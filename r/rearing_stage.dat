40|$|Fishery {{discards}} in the Belgian {{part of the}} North Sea are {{a source}} of food for Herring Gulls Larus argentatus and Lesser Black-backed Gulls L. fuscus. To understand the importance of discards for local L. argentatus and L. fuscus populations, single-item discard experiments were performed at four offshore distances from the gullery of the Port of Zeebrugge, at four different stages of the breeding season (May to August 2011). We compared flock composition during discarding with the distribution of Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls, with respect to offshore distance from the colony as reflected by an 11 -year (2002 – 2013) dataset of standardised ship-based surveys. Consumption of discards depended on the type of fish that was discarded, but prey selectivity by adults was reduced during the chick <b>rearing</b> <b>stage.</b> A generalised linear mixed model identified the number of scavengers following the vessel, the proportion of adults and of Herring Gulls in the flock and the frequency of food robbery events interacting with the stage of the breeding season as affecting the variation in flatfish consumption. Shifts in scavenger flock composition and discard consumption between stages of the breeding season are likely linked to variation in food requirements of the gull population along the season and to dispersal patterns towards the end of summer.

40|$|Trivers’ {{theory of}} sexual {{conflict}} in parental investment has {{laid the groundwork}} for immense quantities of research, especially within the avian taxa. Although male benefits of extra-pair copulation (EPC) are argued to be well-understood, female benefits are harder to explain. Nevertheless, EPC is thought to be female driven and so current research is focusing on possible explanations for female benefits. In 2014, Eliassen & Jørgensen suggested that female-driven EPC is based on the spreading of male interest among neighbouring families. EPC creates incentives for male cooperation in a neighbourhood, contributing to benefits for females and her offspring. We tested this, and more specifically looked at possible sex differences between parents regarding antipredator behaviour and extra-pair paternity (EPP) rates. The study was conducted on a blue tit population in southern France, Montpellier. We exposed parental birds to a taxidermy predator or novel object before egg laying. Antipredator behaviour of exposed nests and naïve neighbours was later observed during the chick <b>rearing</b> <b>stage.</b> DNA samples were collected from parents and offspring to determine EPP rates. We found that both parents reduced their antipredator behaviour in nests that contained extra-pair young, both in the form of alarming less and taking fewer risks by keeping a farther distance. We did not find any significant sex differences between parents. Our results showed no difference in EPP rates between predator-exposed and control nests (object-exposed). We did not find any evidence of a difference in antipredator behaviour during chick <b>rearing</b> <b>stage</b> between the different exposed nests, although due to a modest dataset this experiment should be repeated in consecutive years before making any firm conclusions...|$|E

Sudden mass mortality during the larval <b>rearing</b> <b>stage</b> due to unknown causes is a serious problem.

40|$|Abstract An {{advantage}} of legged locomotion {{is the ability}} to climb over obstacles. We studied deathhead cockroaches as they climbed over plastic blocks in order to characterize the leg movements associated with climbing. Movements were recorded as animals sur-mounted 5. 5 -mm or 11 -mm obstacles. The smaller ob-stacles were scaled with little change in running movements. The higher obstacles required altered gaits, leg positions and body posture. The most frequent se-quence used was to first tilt the front of the body upward in a <b>rearing</b> <b>stage,</b> and then elevate the center of mass {{to the level of the}} top of the block. A horizontal running posture was re-assumed in a leveling-off stage. The ac-tion of the middle legs was redirected by rotations of the leg at the thoracal-coxal and the trochanteral-femoral joints. The subsequent extension movements of the coxal-trochanteral and femoral-tibial joints were within the range seen during horizontal running. The structure of proximal leg joints allows for flexibility in leg use by generating subtle, but effective changes in the direc-tion of leg movement. This architecture, along with the resulting re-direction of movements, provides a range of strategies for both animals and walking machines...|$|E

A total of 260 samples from larvae at different feeding stages were examined, 15 healthy and 50 moribund juvenile dentex were sampled over a 2 -year period. Bacterial isolates (n= 433) from healthy and moribund fish and their environments were identified by biochemical methods; 75 % of them were identified as Gram-negative (mainly Vibrio spp.) and 25 % as Gram-positive. Vibrio scophthalmi and other Vibrio species were recovered from moribund fish samples. Some bacteria were recovered from diseased fish reared in hatcheries, introduced mainly from sea water. Among anaerobic bacteria, Eubacterium tarantellae was recovered from larval gut flora while Clostridium botulinum was recovered from juvenile gut flora. TEM also showed that bacterial endocytosis first occurs when fish are fed granulated dry feeds and becomes more prevalent in the juvenile stages when many bacteria are present in the microvilli.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the environmental burdens associated with an intensive land based rearing system of sea bass (Dicenrrarchus labrax). Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was applied in order to compare two growing facility systems: a traditional raceway (TR) and a cascade raceway (CR). The main goal was to settle reference levels to assess environmental performances and to identify hot spots and possible improvements. The analysis was carried out following the CML 2 (2000) impact method using Simapro 7. 2 software. The contribution analysis showed that the diet process contributed to the majority of the impacts. The sea bass <b>rearing</b> <b>stage</b> was the main contributor of eutrophication (more than 58 % in TR and 52 % in CR). The analysis revealed that the major part of the energy consumption was due to rearing phase through water pumping and oxygen injection and production, with 175, 000 MJ/tonne and 280, 000 MJ/tonne, for TR and CR, respectively. For all the studied impacts, the assessment revealed that CR presented more environmental burden than TR. The major differences between the two farming systems lay in Global Warming Potential GWP and energy use EU. Feed efficiency seems to have a dominant influence on the level of impacts involving diet process. Undoubtedly, the shown difference in the environmental load is the direct result of the relative ability of fish reared in TR to better convert their diet into biomass with a feed conversion ratio of 1. 7, compared to 2. 1 in CR. There are many options for improving the environmental performance of these aquaculture systems. The most important measure is to increase the feed efficiency through improvements in rearing modes, the diet composition and the optimisation of feeding practices.

40|$|The {{spawning}} {{season of the}} most commercially important European abalone {Haliotis tuberculata) was evaluated during the summers of 1996, 1997 and 1999. The {{results of the present}} study show that the best time to start with semi-artificial spawning is from mid July using cultured abalone from the open sea in Guernsey, Channel Isles. Until 1996 Tetraselmis sueccica was the main source of food for juvenile H. tuberculata during their <b>rearing</b> <b>stage</b> (one to twelve weeks old) on glass plates. Nevertheless, this study showed that T. sueccica, as a sole food, is not sufficient for successful development and growth of early juvenile abalone. However, marine diatoms such as Skeletonema costatum, Navicula ramosissima and Cylindrotheca closterium were easily ingested and assimilated depending on the size of the animal and conditions of culture. This thesis studied the effect of different diets (mix of fresh seaweed, fishmeal and an abalone commercial) and temperatures (15, 18 and 22 C) on growth and energy budget of juvenile abalone H. tuberculata over a 210 day period. Energy budget was obtained by Ingestion (I), Egestion (E), Somatic growth (Pg), Reproductive investment (Pr), Excretion (U) and Pedal mucus production (M). All these parameters were assessed for grouped and individual organisms. Animals fed on formulated diets (energetically rich) and cultured at 18 and 22 C were shown to give better growth rates than the natural diet and preferentially allocated energy to gonad development. Thus, the combination of diet and temperature were factors that contributed to enhance growth rates and gonad development. The abalone commercial diet (CO) used in this study produced shell deformation in 89 % of the population after four months of feeding juvenile abalone. The information of these studies have important implications when considering the nutritional requirements of cultured abalone when fed on formulated diets, which need to contain not only the energy, but also the necessary micronutients which are required to produce good growth rates and also healthy animals...|$|E
40|$|One {{component}} of successful parenting {{is related to}} efficiency in foraging behaviour. The relationships among chick feeding, the size and type of food package, and length of parental foraging trips has not been well studied in seabirds. In addition, relatively few data have been collected on the activities of seabirds when foraging away from the nest site. The objectives of this study were: (1) to contrast productivity, feeding rate, and attendance patterns of individuals carrying a novel transmitter with a control group of birds; (2) to use radio-telemetry to assess the variability in foraging locations within and between individual male Common Terns; (3) to determine the seasonal variation in chick diet; (4) to determine for each transmittered bird, the relationships among the foraging patterns, parental behaviour, and seasonal reproductive success. The study took place over two years (1990 - 91) on a concrete breakwater 1 km offshore on Lake Erie near Port Colbome, Ontario. Ten pairs of terns in 1990 and 12 pairs in 1991 were radio-tracked by boat or car during the chick <b>rearing</b> <b>stage.</b> Concurrent behavioural observations documented the time each sex spent foraging or at the nest. The frequency and prey species composition of feeds to chicks were also recorded. The transmitters had negligible effects on the feeding frequency and brood attendance patterns of transmitter carrying birds. Peak nesting transmittered birds in 1990 and 1991 exhibited some inter-individual variability in foraging locations, however intraindividual variability was low. Birds foraged primarily {{to the west and}} northwest of the colony. Late nesters exhibited greater inter-individual variability, however intra-individual variability remained low for most birds. Neither group demonstrated sufficient variability to support the regular use of this colony as an "information centre". Individual transmittered birds had unique and predictable foraging patterns, and corresponding differences in feeding frequencies and brood attendance patterns, yet productivity was essentially equal between nests due to the impact and importance of stochastic events. Individuals that were recaptured in 1991 exhibited very similar foraging patterns to 1990, suggesting littie variability between years. Conservation of foraging patterns between years may have potential implications for mate choice decisions in future breeding seasons. Prey species delivered to chicks differed between morning and evening for peak and late nesters in 1990, but not 1991. Peak nesters in 1990 fed significantiy more Rainbow Smelt fOsmerus mordM) than Emerald Shiner (Notropis atherinoidesV this trend was reversed for late nesters who also fed large numbers of unidentified larval fish. No significant differences were found in 1991. Seasonal changes in prey species delivered to chicks is believed to be attributable to the temperature tolerances of the smelt and shiners, and the presence of large schools of larval fish during the late nesting season...|$|E

40|$|SELFDOTT project 2009 Periodic ReportIn reproduction, {{one of the}} two captive broodstocks [...] {{maintained}} in Spain [...] was successfully induced to mature and spawn using the developed controlled-release delivery systems (implants) loaded with GnRHa. The broodstock began spawning on the 29 th June 2009, three days after hormonal treatment, and spawned daily for a period of 17 days with a total of 140 million eggs. Daily fecundity ranged between 285, 000 eggs to 34, 000, 000. Fertilization success was almost 100 %, as probably only fertilized eggs floated to the surface and were collected. No spawning was observed and no eggs were collected from the other broodstock {{maintained in}} Malta and this was perhaps due to too late hormonal treatment and/or the hydrodynamics of the site. Other major results achieved include the study of the age of puberty in captive reared BFT, the development of an efficient broodstock diet for captive BFT, the successful deployment of a broodstock cage light and temperature remote sensing system to monitor and predict induction opportunities and muscle biopsies obtained from a new broodstock in Malta and from individuals spawning in the Levantine Sea for DNA analysis of the population genetics study. Larval rearing husbandry tasks were satisfactorily supplied with Bonito (Sarda sarda) and viable BFT eggs. Several experiments have been implemented using the 3 targeted larval rearing methods: Mesocosm, pseudo green water and clear water. In the best case bonito rearing attempts have been conducted to 80 dph in mesocosm and a small batch initially produced in pseudo green water is still alive (300 dph). In mesocosm swimbladder inflation rates scored between 60 and 78 % while they reached 60 % in pseudo green water and 85 % in clear water. In BFT, the rearing time lasted 60 dph in mesocosm, 73 dph in pseudo green water and 20 dph in clear water. In mesocosm swimbladder inflation rates was 50 %, scored 58 % in pseudo green water but ranged between 1. 2 and 5 % in clear water. Light intensity, lighting regime, hydrodynamics, surface cleaning, microalgae addition, feed sequence and nutritional quality have been identified as the main factors to be fine tuned mainly during the larval <b>rearing</b> <b>stage.</b> In order to obtain molecular tools for the spatial and temporal localization of the corresponding transcripts, genes of interest were partially cloned. The early development of BFT posterior lateral line has been examined. Ontogeny of digestive tract in Bonito and BFT was rather extensively described. Regarding the immune system ontogeny, a preliminary approach has been conducted. Other studies including the evaluation of the microbiotal diversity of the digestive tract and the bacterial characterization in larvae have been carried out. For Nutrition and feeding studies, Young Bluefin Tuna (YBFT) were used to start the artificial feeding trials. First weaning trials with artificial food was successfully achieved. A trial to compare two diets: raw fish and artificial food has been started. The stomach analyses of captured dead YBFT showed that fish are the main prey (37 % in weight), followed by cephalopods (11 %) and crustaceans (5 %). The main prey species is the round sardinella (Sardinella sp). These results contrast with the ones obtained last year where cephalopods were the main prey, so YBFT can be considered a generalist feeder. From the body composition analyses it seems that YBFTs have different nutritional requirement from most other Mediterranean aquaculture species: high protein and low fat content with significantly higher values of EPA+DHA for YBFTs and higher amino acid concentrations.

40|$|Mycoplasma {{control in}} any poultry company {{requires}} an integrated approach involving diligent biosecurity, animal husbandry and disease surveillance. Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) infection is very costly to the broiler industry as it predisposes birds {{to a variety}} of primary and secondary respiratory diseases thus reducing production efficiency and profitability. Since the primary disease is rather insidious, relatively difficult to confirm (especially in vaccinated flocks), prone to becoming quiescent and vertically transmitted, control measures must begin at the breeder level and involve conscientious flock surveillance. While disease eradication is the best approach to MG control the economic pressures of modern broiler production often preclude such drastic measures. Vaccination programmes are often introduced to reduce the economic impact of the disease in breeder flocks and to minimize, or hopefully prevent vertical transmission. To prevent vertical transmission and lateral spread of field strain MG infection, early diagnosis is critical. Flock testing needs to be done every 2 - 4 weeks (depending on prevailing risk), on 90 birds (for an average flock of 7 000 birds) to satisfy statistical requirements for the detection of a 5 % infection-rate with 99 % confidence. The RSPA test provides an inexpensive, reliable and rapid means of evaluating the serological response to ts- 11 strain vaccination during the rearing phase. A floor pen trial confirmed that, three to ten weeks after ts- 11 vaccination at 10 weeks of age, the RSPA test reactor rate is between 30 % and 60 %. PCR was used to confirm the absence of field challenge. A retrospective analysis of 4 years of RSPA test data from broiler breeder flocks immunized with the live ts- 11 strain MG vaccine indicated that traditional RSPA test monitoring protocols were unreliable as a means of differentiating ts- 11 vaccination from field strain MG infection. Non-infected (PCR negative) vaccinated flocks reached sero-positive agglutination rates of 100 % making the differentiation of vaccine response and field infection impossible during the lay cycle. RSPA monitoring of broiler breeders during the pullet <b>rearing</b> <b>stage</b> (0 - 20 weeks) was in contrast still very effective. While previously reported trials indicated that the introduction and subsequent serological monitoring of in-contact non-vaccinated sentinels may enhance the efficacy of the RSPA monitoring procedure this trial indicated that it does not. The ts- 11 strain MG spread to in-contact sentinels so rapidly under field conditions that the serum agglutination pattern of these birds mimics that of the vaccinated pullets. The potential for ts- 11 strain MG to spread from bird to bird is a reality and even spread from pen to pen (within the same house) may be possible if biosecurity is inadequate. The decision to vaccinate should include consideration as to the consequence of ts- 11 strain MG spread to surrounding susceptible flocks. The use of molecular diagnostic techniques on pooled tracheal swabs taken from representative flock birds is a potentially cost effective and reliable means of differentiating ts- 11 vaccine strain from field strain MG. PCR amplification of DNA from tracheal swab samples and strain identification based on amplicon size was shown to be a reliable and sensitive means of detecting ts- 11 strain following vaccination. The proprietary PCR primer used in this trial was specifically designed to identify the ts- 11 strain by amplifying a 229 bp fragment that is characteristic and distinguishable from all other MG field strain isolates based on amplicon size. This technique provides the opportunity to differentiate field strain infection from vaccine strain MG, provided strain specific PCR primers are available. It is recommended that the RSPA assay is used to differentiate effective vaccination from field exposure during pullet rearing and PCR assay is used to monitor broiler breeder flocks for MG challenge during the laying cycle and confirm that point-of-lay broiler breeder pullets are free of field strain MG infection. Where possible flocks with a confirmed field strain challenge should be eliminated and all hatching eggs removed from the hatchery and destroyed. Dissertation (MMedVet (Altil.))

40|$|The Australasian gannet, Morus serrator, {{a member}} of the Family Sulidae, {{primarily}} inhabits New Zealand and Australian coastal waters. It is considered to be closely related to the Atlantic gannet, Morus bassana, in the North Atlantic, and Cape gannet, Morus capensis, in South African waters, with which it shares similar ecological niches. Although often described as relatively well studied, much of our current knowledge of Australasian gannets has been derived from anecdotal observations, and irregular visits to breeding colonies. Few studies have derived information from continuous observations of known individuals over consecutive breeding seasons. Conversely, studies of Atlantic gannets, in particular, have been conducted on a far more rigorous basis. Thus, parallels drawn between the three species, and particularly Atlantic and Australasian gannets, {{may or may not be}} accurate. This study is the first to document three complete and consecutive breeding seasons (1999 - 00, 2000 - 01, and 2001 - 02), using marked nests at the Plateau colony, Cape Kidnappers, New Zealand. Birds were individually marked and I investigated their breeding ecology, and in particular the annual variability in success and other breeding variables. Contrasting with previous studies, I found that the onset of egg laying differed little between years, and although laying was less synchronous in one season, it was highly synchronous in the other two seasons. This is similar to the Atlantic gannet in which the onset of laying is similar year to year, and laying is also highly synchronised. At least for the Australasian gannet, the timing of egg laying does not appear to be linked to sea surface temperature near the colony. However, both species appear to time egg laying to allow chick rearing to coincide with a predictably timed peak in prey availability. Further in depth study is required to confirm this for the Australasian gannet breeding in New Zealand. The use of back-dating to estimate the onset of egg laying from hatching dates and chick ages was also tested and found to provide a useful estimate. Although previous studies of Australasian gannets have suggested highly variable breeding success, with almost complete breeding failures in some years, this study is the first to document this, and explore possible reasons. Previous studies have suggested human disturbance at breeding colonies as being the cause, with little evidence provided. However, I found in 1999 - 00, there was considerable egg and chick losses as a result of environmental conditions causing adult and chick starvation and desertion of eggs and young chicks, and productivity was only 9 %. A similar pattern, although less severe, occurred in the following season, but conditions improved during the chick <b>rearing</b> <b>stage</b> resulting in 55 % productivity. In 2001 - 02, environmental conditions were stable, resulting in high hatching success, however, an unseasonal storm resulted in considerable chick mortality, and productivity was again low at only 13 %. Thus, productivity during the three seasons studied varied markedly, being very low in two of the three seasons as a consequence of environmental conditions, with no evidence of human disturbance. This is the first study which has linked the environment to variable breeding success in this species, and its findings contrast considerably with the invariably high breeding success of the Atlantic gannet. Retrospective analysis of previous Australasian gannet studies suggests this natural link between the environment and breeding success has been apparent, but not recognised, since the 1940 s. Links between specific environmental factors and breeding failures are yet to be determined. I established that calculated egg volume is a good predictor of fresh egg mass, allowing analysis of eggs through the use of linear measurements, when fresh egg mass is not known. For all seasons combined mean egg volume was 89. 2 mm 3, whilst a mean incubation period of 45 days is similar to other Australasian gannet studies. Changes in specific gravity during egg development did not allow accurate determination of egg laying dates, with 12. 7 % of fresh egg mass being lost during development. Eggs laid both within and between seasons by individual females were highly correlated in all measures (length, width, shape, and volume). These egg measures generally showed a negative correlation with laying date, at least in the last two breeding seasons. Egg volume was positively correlated with chick mass at hatching, although chick growth rates did not seem correlated with egg volume. However, in 2000 - 01, chicks that survived to fledging were significantly heavier on day-one, despite hatching from similar volume eggs. For chicks that fledged successfully, those that hatched later in the season increased in mass more slowly than chicks that hatched early. However, the reverse trend was found for wing length, possibly as a consequence of wing development being more important than mass increase. Linked to the breeding failures in 1999 - 00, were low nest attendance rates by adults and the lowest recorded body mass for adult Australasian gannets in this or previous studies. Similarly, first egg volumes in this first season were significantly lower, and fewer lost eggs were replaced. Chick growth rates also varied between breeding seasons. Early development of chicks (0 - 11 days) was slower in 1999 - 00 than in the other two seasons (slower even than chicks that did not fledge in the other seasons). Growth rates of older chicks (20 + days) that survived to fledge, however, were actually greatest in that season. This suggests that older or more experienced adults, who were better able to provision chicks through poor foraging conditions, were then able to raise faster developing chicks once conditions improved. The evidence presented in this thesis demonstrates that the 1999 - 00 breeding season was a difficult one for breeding Australasian gannets at Cape Kidnappers. Furthermore, information derived from this three season study, along with analysis of historical studies, suggests that the Australasian gannet differs markedly to the Atlantic gannet in many respects. Most notable is the occurrence of pronounced breeding failures in some years, apparently influenced by environmental conditions. This seems to be a consequence of a more variable environment, involving variability in weather, oceanographic conditions, and prey availability and abundance...|$|E

First, an extensive review is presented on the state-of-the-art of measuring compressor degradation and on the impact of roughness on loss and deviation in a compressor cascade. The performance of a baseline, three-stage compressor, which has hydrodynamically smooth blades, is predicted. Using this baseline geometry, the influence of roughness in the front, middle and <b>rear</b> <b>stages</b> is calculated using empirical data for the enhanced losses and increased deviation, with a stage stacking technique. Influence coefficients that relate percentage changes in one parameter to percentage changes in other parameters are calculated. This analysis predicts that the most sensitive parameter for predicting fouling in the front stages is the percentage change in mass flow and the most sensitive parameter for predicting fouling in the <b>rear</b> <b>stages</b> is the efficiency.

In this paper, a circumferentially non-uniform mixing plane method implemented with deterministic stresses is used for the flow prediction inside the <b>rear</b> <b>stage</b> of an axial flow compressor in a multistage environment. The deterministic stress field is calculated with an overlapped solution approach for the same flow passage and implemented with the Navier-Stokes equations in order to provide continuous interfaces. The aerodynamic boundary condition is simplified with the application of a repeating stage model where only the mass flowrate and stage exit average static pressure are required. Two computational cases for the third stage of the Cranfield low-speed research compressor, one with the mixing plane model and the second with the mixing plane model in combination with deterministic stresses, are examined and compared with each other and also with corresponding experimental data. It is shown that the implementation of the deterministic stresses is beneficial for the flow prediction but the improvement in accuracy for low-speed axial flow compressor <b>rear</b> <b>stages</b> is not significant...|$|R

Consequently, these stages are often replaced by a single centrifugal unit. Very small flow compressors often employ two centrifugal compressors, connected in series. Although in isolation centrifugal compressors are capable of running at quite high pressure ratios (e.g. 10:1), impeller stress considerations limit the pressure ratio that can be employed in high overall pressure ratio engine cycles.|$|R
