5000|$|Lamokin (Chester), Pennsylvania - The Lamokin {{plant was}} built in the 1920s and has a net {{capacity}} of 48 MW and consists of three 16 MW motor generators. All three units will be overhauled, including <b>re-winding</b> of rotors and stators, and replacement of slip ring assemblies. Associated breakers and cables are also planned for replacement.|$|E
50|$|Criticisms of the reissue Wide Range Humbucker and the {{escalating}} cost of parted-out original pick-ups {{has led to}} the establishment of a small but thriving aftermarket sector. Suppliers of boutique WRH replacements {{can be found in the}} USA and the UK. Some pick-up specialists also offer a <b>re-winding</b> / rebuilding service designed to return the reissue pickup to the original Seth Lover specifications.|$|E
50|$|The name ‘Parvalux’ {{derives from}} the latin 'parvulus' and 'lux' and means 'young light', {{alluding}} to the hopes that founder Leslie J. Clark had for the Romford-based business where he first began selling motor rewinds in 1947. After relocating to Bournemouth in 1957, the company moved from simply <b>re-winding</b> motors to designing and manufacturing complete gear-motor units for industrial applications.|$|E
5000|$|The weight drive used by Christiaan Huygens in {{his early}} clocks acts as a {{maintaining}} power. In this layout, the weight which drives the clock is carried on a pulley and the cord (or chain) supporting the weight is wrapped around another pulley which has spikes which allow the cord to turn the pulley without slipping. It is this pulley which turns the train of gears in the clock movement. The cord is kept in engagement with this pulley by a small tensioning weight which is also carried on its own pulley. The cord is endless and is looped over a fourth pulley before {{going back to the}} drive weight. The fourth pulley also has spikes to stop the cord slipping and has a ratchet that only allows it to turn in one direction. As the drive weight descends and turns the clock, the tensioning weight rises. When the drive weight needs to be re-wound, either the fourth pulley is turned directly to lift the weight or the cord supporting the tensioning weight is pulled down and draws the fourth pulley round with it. [...] The principle was later applied by the French clockmaker Robert Robin who automated the <b>re-winding</b> in his remontoire. The drive- and tensioning-weights were made much smaller and drove the escape wheel directly. It was re-wound by the main train of the clock which turned the fourth pulley and was controlled by a lever attached to the tensioning weight. When this had risen to its upper limit, it started the <b>re-winding</b> process. As the drive weight rose, the tensioning weight fell and at the bottom of its travel it stopped the <b>re-winding.</b>|$|E

50|$|This {{is a type}} of {{maintaining}} power which needs to be engaged before <b>re-winding</b> is started. It consists of a weighted arm (bolt) with a ratchet pawl on the end of it which engages with the edge of the first wheel to keep it turning while the weight or spring is wound. To make sure that it was always operated, the hole in the dial through which the clock is wound is covered with a shutter which can be moved out of the way by pushing down on a lever {{at the side of the}} dial. This lever also engages the bolt. A similar type of mechanism is sometimes used on turret clocks. Because these take much longer to wind, and are usually wound by trained staff, the bolt carries a segment of a gear wheel rather than a single pawl and is engaged manually.|$|E
5000|$|In 1963, John Cairns {{published}} autoradiographs of the E. coli chromosome, {{showing that}} it was a single circular molecule that is replicated at a moving locus - the [...] "replication fork" [...] - at which both new DNA strands are being synthesized. [...] Cairns, at that time, recognized a topological problem in that the helical twists between the daughter strands would have to be removed if the strands are to separate during cell replication. He proposed that the twists were unwound by means of a hypothetical [...] "swivel" [...] around which the chromosome would be free to rotate as necessary for the un-winding and <b>re-winding</b> operations. [...] However, such a structure would have to have about 400,000 helical twists in the Watson-Crick model, each of which would have to be removed in as little as 20 minutes, if the strands are to separate during cell replication. This leads to the apparent need of the chromosome - or at least some part of it - to be spinning at speeds up to 6900-9000 rpm throughout the life of the bacterial cell.|$|E
5000|$|The {{need for}} a damper {{will depend on the}} age of the engine design, its manufacture, {{strength}} of components, usable powerband, rev range most importantly the quality of the engines tune. The engines tune especially in computer controlled applications can have a dramatic effect on durability, the aggressiveness of the tune puts the engine at risk of detonation which can be catastrophic to all rotating assembly components. Modern (roughly 1988+) DOHC, SOHC flat 4, I4, flat 6, I6, V6, flat 8, and flat-plane V8 have no need for this device. With or without the presence of a damper, a crankshaft will act as a torsional spring to some extent. Impulses applied to the crankshaft by the connecting rods will [...] "wind" [...] this spring, which will respond (as a spring-mass system) by unwinding and <b>re-winding</b> in the opposite direction. This crankshaft winding will usually be damped out naturally. However, at certain crankshaft rotational speeds, such winding can overlap with the crankshaft's natural resonant frequency, thereby increasing the frequency's amplitude and possibly leading to crankshaft damage.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{model for}} the force-dependent {{unwinding}} and rewinding rates of the nucleosome inner turn is constructed and quantitatively compared {{to the results of}} recent measurements [A. H. Mack et al., J. Mol. Biol. 423, 687 (2012) ]. First, a coarse-grained {{model for the}} histone-DNA free energy landscape that incorporates both an elastic free energy barrier and specific histone-DNA bonds is developed. Next, a theoretical expression for the rate of transitions across a piecewise linear free energy landscape with multiple minima and maxima is presented. Then, the model free energy landscape, approximated as a piecewise linear function, and the theoretical expression for the transition rates are combined to construct a model for the force-dependent unwinding and <b>re-winding</b> rates of the nucleosome inner turn. Least-mean-squares fitting of the model rates to the rates observed in recent experiments rates demonstrates that this model is able to well describe the force-dependent unwinding and rewinding rates of the nucleosome inner turn, observed in the recent experiments, except at the highest forces studied, where an additional ad hoc term is required to describe the data, which may be interpreted as an indication of an alternate high-force nucleosome disassembly pathway, that bypasses simple unwinding. The good agreement between the measurements and the model at lower forces demonstrates that both specific histone-DNA contacts and an elastic free energy barrier play essential roles for nucleosome winding and unwinding, and quantifies their relative contributions...|$|E
