5|$|By 1525, <b>Reading</b> <b>was</b> {{the largest}} town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that <b>Reading</b> <b>was</b> the 10th largest town in England when {{measured}} by taxable wealth. By 1611, {{it had a}} population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth. The town was seriously affected by the English Civil War, with a major siege and loss of trade, and {{played a pivotal role}} in the Revolution of 1688, with that revolution's only significant military action fought {{on the streets of the}} town.|$|E

5000|$|In {{language}} learning, extensive <b>reading</b> <b>is</b> {{contrasted with}} intensive <b>reading,</b> which <b>is</b> slow, careful <b>reading</b> {{of a small}} amount of difficult text - it is when one is [...] "focused on the language rather than the text". Extensive and intensive <b>reading</b> <b>are</b> two approaches to language learning and instruction, and may be used concurrently; intensive <b>reading</b> <b>is</b> however the more common approach, and often the only one used.|$|R

5|$|St James's Church {{was built}} on {{a portion of the}} site of the abbey between 1837–40, and marked the return of the Roman Catholic faith to Reading. <b>Reading</b> <b>was</b> also the site of the death of Blessed Dominic Barberi, the Catholic missionary to England in the 19th century who {{received}} John Henry Newman into the Catholic faith. There are now a total of 8 Roman Catholic parish churches in Reading.|$|E
5|$|The 18th century saw the {{beginning}} of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which <b>Reading</b> <b>was</b> to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the Great Western Railway and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{borough of}} <b>Reading</b> <b>was</b> served by three parish churches: Reading Minster, St Giles' Church, and St Laurence's Church. All {{are still in}} use by the Church of England. The Franciscan friars built a friary in the town in 1311. After the friars were {{expelled}} in 1538, the building {{was used as a}} hospital, a poorhouse, and a jail, before being restored as the Church of England parish church of Greyfriars Church in 1863.|$|E

5|$|There is {{presently}} one mosque, the Central Reading Mosque on Waylen Street. The £3–4m Abu Bakr Islamic Centre, on Oxford Road in West <b>Reading,</b> <b>was</b> granted planning permission in 2002. The community-funded project began construction in 2006, but, as of July 2008, had no estimated completion date. A second Islamic centre in eastern Reading {{has also been}} granted planning permission. This £4m project has garnered some controversy.|$|E
5|$|A year later, he starred with Charlie Sheen in the Jim Abrahams comedy Hot Shots!, {{which was}} {{received}} very positively. Cryer is frequently {{linked to the}} Brat Pack. In a March 2009 interview on Anytime with Bob Kushell, Cryer stated that he had auditioned for St. Elmo's Fire but was not cast in a role. In 1993, {{he was asked to}} audition for the role of Chandler Bing on Friends, while doing a play in London. His <b>reading</b> <b>was</b> videotaped by a British casting agent but the tape failed to arrive in the U.S. before the network had made its final decision.|$|E
5|$|Belle's {{strength}} {{and love of}} <b>reading</b> <b>was</b> inspired by American actress Katharine Hepburn's performance as Jo March in the film Little Women (1933), while the writers instilled the adventure-seeking heroine with goals and aspirations beyond romance. However, the story artists and animators often disagreed with Woolverton's liberated vision for the character. Animated by James Baxter and Mark Henn, the former of whom based the character's graceful gait on those of impressionist Edgar Degas' ballerinas, Belle's European facial features were inspired by those of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn. Several additional Hollywood actresses inspired Belle's appearance, including Natalie Wood, Elizabeth Taylor, and Grace Kelly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Read</b> <b>was</b> born in Exeter, {{where his}} father Hedley <b>Read</b> <b>was</b> working on a stage {{production}} of A Streetcar Named Desire. Read struggled at school (he was later diagnosed dyslexic) and following his parents divorce, {{he lived with his}} grandparents. Following his grandmother's death when he was seven years old, <b>Read</b> <b>was</b> sent to Parkside Boarding School, in East Horsley.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} test {{the quality of the}} assembly, the clean <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> mapped to the unigenes and {{transcripts}} dataset. The results are shown in Table  2; more than 93  % of clean <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> mapped. Next, the mapped <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> used to detect the saturation of genes in each library; the saturation curve is shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S 1.|$|R
5|$|Depending on the {{definition}} adopted, neither the town nor the urban area are necessarily coterminous with the borough. Historically, {{the town of}} <b>Reading</b> <b>was</b> smaller than the borough. Definitions include the old ecclesiastical parishes of the churches of St Mary, St Laurence and St Giles, or the even smaller pre-19th century borough. Today, {{as well as the}} town centre Reading comprises a number of suburbs and other districts, both within the borough itself and within the surrounding urban area. The names and location of these suburbs are in general usage but, except where some of the outer suburbs correspond to civil parishes, there are no formally defined boundaries. The Reading town area, sometimes referred to as Greater Reading, incorporates the town's eastern and western suburbs outside the borough, in the civil parishes of Earley, Woodley, Purley and Tilehurst. The Reading urban area (officially Reading/Wokingham) additionally includes Winnersh, Wokingham and Crowthorne with an overall population of around 320,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that <b>reading</b> <b>was</b> basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|Every year Reading {{hosts the}} Reading Festival, {{which has been}} running since 1971. The festival takes place on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the August bank holiday weekend and is the largest {{of its kind in}} the UK aside from the Glastonbury Festival. For some twenty years until 2006, <b>Reading</b> <b>was</b> also known for its WOMAD Festival until it moved to Charlton Park in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. The Reading Beer Festival was first held in 1994 and has now grown to one of the largest beer festivals in the UK. It is held at King's Meadow for the five days {{immediately}} preceding the May Day bank holiday every year. Reading also holds Reading Pride, an annual LGBTA festival in Kings Meadow.|$|E
30|$|As for 77, {{its second}} <b>reading</b> <b>is</b> rightly {{predicted}} by the structure in 79 b. The fact that the first <b>reading</b> <b>is</b> also allowed can {{be accounted for by}} the fact that, even though such a <b>reading</b> <b>is</b> not {{predicted by the}} structure in 79 b, it is allowed due to the working of pragmatics. When Zhangsan hit Lisi with his hand, it is very likely that Zhangsan’s hand became numb as a result. As seen from the ungrammaticality of 78, again such a pragmatically-induced <b>reading</b> <b>is</b> possible only when the de-part is good in both form and meaning.|$|R

5|$|Local {{government}} for the town of Reading is principally provided by Reading Borough Council, a single level unitary authority without civil parishes. However some of the town's outer suburbs are in West Berkshire and Wokingham unitary authorities. These outer suburbs belong to civil parishes, in some cases with their own town status. Reading has elected at least one Member of Parliament to every Parliament since 1295. Historically, <b>Reading</b> <b>was</b> represented by the members for the Parliamentary Borough of Reading, and the parliamentary constituencies of Reading, Reading North, and Reading South. Since the 2010 general election, Reading and its surrounding area has been divided between the parliamentary constituencies of Reading East and Reading West. The whole of the town is within the multi-member South East England European constituency.|$|E
5|$|Mount St. Helens {{remained}} dormant {{from its}} last {{period of activity}} in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. Several small earthquakes, apparently beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano. On March 20, at 3:45p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake (the initial <b>reading</b> <b>was</b> 4.1), centered below the volcano's north flank, signaled the volcano's violent return from 123years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels {{in the next two}} days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale. A total of 174 shocks of magnitude2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the second reading {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second <b>reading</b> <b>was</b> approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced {{the total number of}} seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.|$|E
30|$|Considering {{the genome}} size of several reference-ready insects, a total 49.5 million 101 bp paired-end <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> sequenced and yield 4.95 Gb bases raw data, 48 million clean <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> kept after low quality <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> filtered. After <b>reads</b> {{trimming}} with Trimmomatic, we used Trinity pipeline {{to do the}} de novo transcriptome assembly and obtained 31, 068 transcripts with an N 50 value of 2, 276 bp (Haas et al. 2013; Bolger et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|The raw <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> {{filtered}} {{to generate}} clean reads by removal of adaptors, ambiguous reads with unknown nucleotides larger than 10 %, and low-quality reads {{where more than}} half of the bases’ qualities were less than five (Quality score[*]<[*] 5). The clean <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) Sequence Database with accession number SRR 6147052. Subsequently, the clean <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> de novo assembled by Trinity program (Grabherr et al. 2011) to generate non-redundant unigenes. In brief, all the clean <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> assembled into contigs with different k-mer values to assess optimal assembly range. The assembled transcripts were as reference sequences for transcript annotation and re-validated by aligning clean reads back to transcripts (Miller et al. 2012). Each of clean <b>reads</b> <b>was</b> re-mapped to reference sequences using Bowtie (Langmead 2010) with default parameters. The longest transcripts within each operationally assembled contig were defined as unigenes.|$|R
