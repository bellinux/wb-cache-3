5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently {{be explained by the}} present <b>resonances.</b> The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital <b>resonances</b> moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E
5|$|Models for a {{continuous}} formation throughout {{the age of}} the Solar System illustrate that at weak <b>resonances</b> within the Kuiper belt (such as 5:7 or 8:1), or at the boundaries of stronger <b>resonances,</b> objects can develop weak orbital instabilities over millions of years. The 4:7 resonance in particular has large instability. KBOs can also be shifted into unstable orbits by close passage of massive objects, or through collisions. Over time, the scattered disc would gradually form from these isolated events.|$|E
5|$|Planetesimals {{within the}} region which would become the {{asteroid}} belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding. In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. Orbital <b>resonances</b> occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital <b>resonances.</b> As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these <b>resonances</b> would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.|$|E

5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the {{terrestrial}} region, between 2 and 4AU from the Sun, is called the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt initially contained more than enough matter to form 2–3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of planetesimals formed there. As with the terrestrials, planetesimals in this region later coalesced and formed 20–30 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos; however, the proximity of Jupiter meant that after this planet formed, 3million years after the Sun, the region's history changed dramatically. Orbital <b>resonances</b> with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in the asteroid belt, and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those <b>resonances.</b> Jupiter's gravity increased the velocity of objects within these <b>resonances,</b> causing them to shatter upon collision with other bodies, rather than accrete.|$|E

5|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities among the known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in <b>resonances</b> with Neptune. They find that this pattern would be best explained if the ETNOs were in resonance with an additional planetary-sized object beyond Pluto and note that a number of these objects may be in 5:3 and 3:1 <b>resonances</b> if that object had semi-major axis of ≈700 AU.|$|E

40|$|A {{simplified}} modal {{method to}} explain the <b>resonance</b> phenomenon in guided mode <b>resonance</b> (GMR) gratings with asymmetric coatings is presented.

5|$|Although motions in the {{scattered}} disc are random, they {{do tend to}} follow similar directions, which means that SDOs can become trapped in temporary <b>resonances</b> with Neptune. Examples of resonant orbits within {{the scattered}} disc include 1:3, 2:7, 3:11, 5:22 and 4:79.|$|E
5|$|As Jupiter {{migrated}} inward {{following its}} formation (see Planetary migration below), <b>resonances</b> would have {{swept across the}} asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. The cumulative action of the <b>resonances</b> and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from the asteroid belt or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Some of those massive embryos too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have migrated to the inner Solar System and {{played a role in}} the final accretion of the terrestrial planets. During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets and planetary embryos left the asteroid belt with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{original}} Nice model, objects are captured into <b>resonances</b> with Neptune during its outward migration. Some remain in the <b>resonances,</b> others evolve onto higher-inclination, lower-eccentricity orbits, and are released onto stable orbits forming the dynamically hot classical belt. The hot belt's inclination distribution can be reproduced if Neptune migrated from 24 AU to 30 AU on a 30 Myr timescale. When Neptune migrates to 28 AU, it has a gravitational encounter with the extra ice giant. Objects captured from the cold belt into the 1:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune are left behind as a local concentration at 44 AU when this encounter causes Neptune's semi-major axis to jump outward. The objects deposited in the cold belt include some loosely bound 'blue' binaries originating from closer than the cold belt's current location. If Neptune's eccentricity remains small during this encounter, the chaotic evolution of orbits of {{the original}} Nice model is avoided and a primordial cold belt is preserved. In the later phases of Neptune's migration, a slow sweeping of mean-motion <b>resonances</b> removes the higher-eccentricity objects from the cold belt, truncating its eccentricity distribution.|$|E

50|$|In physics, {{nonlinear}} <b>resonance</b> is {{the occurrence}} of <b>resonance</b> in a nonlinear system.

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital <b>resonances</b> proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such <b>resonances,</b> reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E

5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of <b>resonance</b> to filter signals.

Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic <b>resonance</b> (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical <b>resonance)</b> found its way into filter design ahead of electrical <b>resonance.</b> <b>Resonance</b> can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from <b>resonance.</b> Hence frequencies far from <b>resonance</b> are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|R

5|$|Modern {{computer}} simulations show the Kuiper belt {{to have been}} strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, and also suggest that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in their present positions, because too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are estimated to have formed closer to Jupiter. Scattering of planetesimals early in the Solar System's history would have led to migration of the orbits of the giant planets: Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune drifted outwards, whereas Jupiter drifted inwards. Eventually, the orbits shifted {{to the point where}} Jupiter and Saturn reached an exact 1:2 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational repercussions of such a resonance ultimately destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, causing them to be scattered outward onto high-eccentricity orbits that crossed the primordial planetesimal disc. While Neptune's orbit was highly eccentric, its mean-motion <b>resonances</b> overlapped and the orbits of the planetesimals evolved chaotically, allowing planetesimals to wander outward as far as Neptune's 1:2 resonance to form a dynamically cold belt of low-inclination objects. Later, after its eccentricity decreased, Neptune's orbit expanded outward toward its current position. Many planetesimals were captured into and remain in <b>resonances</b> during this migration, others evolved onto higher-inclination and lower-eccentricity orbits and escaped from the <b>resonances</b> onto stable orbits. Many more planetesimals were scattered inward, with small fractions being captured as Jupiter trojans, as irregular satellites orbiting the giant planets, and as outer belt asteroids. The remainder were scattered outward again by Jupiter and in most cases ejected from the Solar System reducing the primordial Kuiper belt population by 99% or more.|$|E
