25|$|The rufous-tailed scrub robin (Cercotrichas galactotes) is a {{medium-sized}} {{member of the}} family Muscicapidae. Other common names include the rufous scrub robin, rufous bush chat, <b>rufous</b> <b>bush</b> <b>robin</b> and the rufous warbler. It breeds around the Mediterranean and east to Pakistan. It also breeds south of the Sahara from the Sahel region east to Somalia; these African birds are sometimes considered to be a separate species, the African scrub robin (C. minor). It is partially migratory, wintering in Africa (Kenya, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia) and India. This is a very rare visitor to northern Europe.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bush</b> Chat Cercotrichas galactotes is parasitized by the Cuckoo Cuculus canorus. To {{study how}} a Cuckoo elicits {{provisioning}} by this specific host species, {{the response of}} the <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bush</b> Chats to two imitations of the coloration of the gape of Cuckoo nestlings was tested. In pairs of experimental and control own nestlings whose gapes had been artificially coloured, body mass changes were recorded over 2 -hr periods. Body mass increase was used as an indicator of the amount of food provided by the parents. Both in the experimental chicks in 20 nests with gapes artificially coloured plain orange (imitating the coloration of the Cuckoo's gape) and in the experimental chicks in 18 nests with gapes coloured to imitate the design of the Cuckoo's gape, body mass increase was higher than in the controls. Experimental chicks apparently received greater amounts of food than the controls. No significant difference was detected between the effects of both experimental treatments. Therefore, in this particular gens of Cuckoo, parasitizing <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bush</b> Chats in southern Spain, either the gape's intense coloration or its characteristic visual pattern may act as supernormal stimuli. So far in other host species no effect of gape coloration has been found. The conspicuous gape colour and pattern could be playing a more important role stimulating food provisioning in <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bush</b> Chats than in other hosts species whose nestlings produce more begging calls. The specific coloration of the Cuckoo chick may have evolved to exploit the provisioning response of hosts towards their own nestlings. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In {{southern}} Spain {{clutches of}} <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bush</b> Chats Cercotrichas galactotes that were parasitised by Cuckoos Cuculus canorus contained larger eggs than non-parasitised ones. Three alternative hypotheses are given that can explain this result. The first states {{that as a}} result of the larger size difference with the Cuckoo's egg, parasitism in smaller egg clutches is more easily detected by the host, which then ejects the Cuckoo's egg. Such incidence of parasitism would thus go easily unnoticed to the human observer. Yet, this hypothesis was rejected, since it is known that <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bush</b> Chats readily accept Cuckoo egg models larger than their own. The second hypothesis states that the observed higher average size of eggs in parasitised nests could be due to the removal of one of the smaller eggs of the host (it appeared that Cuckoos removed only one egg of the host), resulting in an increase of the average egg size of the remaining clutch. This hypothesis was tested by comparing average egg size of parasitised clutches with that of unparasitised clutches, but excluding the smallest egg in the clutch, and could not be rejected. As smaller eggs hatch earlier, eliminating smaller eggs would perhaps withdraw competition for food of the early-born Cuckoo chick with early born <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bush</b> Chat nestlings. The third hypothesis, which could not be rejected either, is that Cuckoos choose to parasitise host pairs of superior parental quality in the benefit of the Cuckoo chick. Superior quality is then related with large egg size. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Aims: An {{attempt was}} made to {{understand}} the relationship of reproduction with the features of the conspicuous visual pattern in the tail of <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bush</b> Chats Cercotrichas galactotes, especially in relation to its reduction in size during the breeding season. Location: Southwestern Andalusia (southern Spain). Methods: In two breeding seasons the size, fluctuating asymmetry and extent of abrasion of the white terminal and black subterminal markings of male and female <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bush</b> Chats were compared until the end of reproduction. Results: A positive relationship was found in males between the size of their white terminal markings and reproductive success and a negative one between the size of their black subterminal markings and the rate of nest depredation. The size of the white patches was positively related within pairs. Only the size of the white terminal markings is notably reduced over the breeding season. Conclusions: Since most of the abraded white markings are beyond the point of the maximum width of the tail, the hypothesis is offered of an adaptive reduction of its dragging effect during the birds´ trans-Saharan late-summer southward migration. The black subterminal markings, protected by melanin against abrasion, may function fixing a limit to erosion. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

The found positive relationship between weight and elongation of Cuckoo eggs (larger and therefore weaker eggs are more elongated, while small ones are more spherical) is in accord with absence of puncture-egg-ejection by the host and supports the hypothesis of optimization of heat transfer from the female to the egg during incubation.

40|$|<b>Rufous</b> <b>Bush</b> Chats (Cercotrichas galactotes) show a {{conspicuous}} tail color pattern consisting of terminal white and subterminal black patches which {{are shown in}} tail display during nest defense, aggression, and courtship. Multiple linear regression of visual tail features of males showed that {{in the two years}} of study, birds with higher bilateral symmetry in the black patches attained higher seasonal reproductive success, mated earlier in the season, and their nests {{were less likely to be}} depredated. In one year, birds with greater white terminal patches also attained higher reproductive success and their nests were less likely to be depredated, and in the other year birds with longer tails paired earlier. I suggest that these tail features have an effect on reproductive success by facilitating early pairing and/or by diminishing nest predation. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{elucidate}} the functions of song in the <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bush</b> Chat Cerco-trichas galactotes, mainly in relation to the temporal pattern of song production during the stages of the reproductive cycle. Territorial males sing at the highest rate during the period of territory establishment and pair formation, declining to a lower level during the fertile period of the mate and remaining at a low (but partially higher) level afterwards. This result, together with the observation of a constant high rate of song produced by a male which lost his mate, support the mate-acquisition and territory-establishment hypotheses on the functions of song, and suggests that the decrease during the fertile period of the mate may represent an attempt by the males to hide the fertility status of their mates from potential male competitors. The partial increase in song rate during the neighbouring females' fertile periods suggests an EPCs seeking function. Males do not adjust their singing rate to avoid detection of nest during the time of potential brood parasitism by the Cuckoo Cuculus canorus, and they sing much less during the period of nest occupancy, in this way perhaps eluding nest detection by potential predators.
