5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{historian}} R. Shaw-Smith {{points to}} letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> his military merits. Shotter states that Tiberius focused his anger and criticism on Gaius Asinius Gallus (for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her), {{as well as}} toward the two young Caesars, Gaius and Lucius—instead of Augustus, the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.|$|E
5|$|As a {{professor}} of botany at Harvard University for several decades, Gray regularly visited, and corresponded with, many of the leading natural scientists of the era, including Charles Darwin, who held great <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> him. Gray made several trips to Europe to collaborate with leading European scientists of the era, as well as trips to the southern and western United States. He also built an extensive network of specimen collectors.|$|E

5|$|As {{bishop of}} Turin, Claudius {{found that men}} were often {{directed}} to go on pilgrimage to Rome for penance and that worshippers were accustomed to venerate Christ and the saints by bowing before images and relics. Claudius, coming from an educated background, was not greatly exposed to such provincial modes of worship. He made attacks {{on the use of}} images, relics, and crosses, he opposed pilgrimages to obtain absolution, and he had little <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> the authority of the pope due to his belief that all bishops were equal.|$|E
5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
5|$|Deodato said he {{conceived}} {{of the film}} while talking to his son about {{news coverage of the}} terrorism of the Red Brigades. Deodato thought that the media focused on portraying violence with little <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> journalistic integrity and believed that the media staged certain news angles in order to obtain more sensational footage. He reflected this behavior in the film team in Cannibal Holocaust, whom he said symbolized the Italian media.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, city leaders debated the {{responsibility}} and expense {{of creating a}} waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s {{as a sign of}} prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. With little <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> beauty, steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.|$|E
5|$|Gil Grissom has a {{more than}} passing {{similarity}} to Sherlock Holmes. Like Holmes, Grissom is dispassionate with a fierce devotion to logic and little <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> societal norms of behavior; Grissom once smashed mustard jars {{in a grocery store}} to illustrate a theory ("I-15 Murders"), much as Holmes once practiced spearing a pig in a butchers to determine how strong a man would have to be to transfix a man with a harpoon.|$|E
5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century {{two members}} of the clan earned {{considerable}} <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> their Gaelic poetry. James, the poet-chief, (1727–1799) is best remembered for a biting satire he composed in Gaelic in response to Samuel Johnson, the English encyclopedist, who had made derogatory comments about the Scots in his famous trip to the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's high <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> Lancaster that {{he would}} bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism is the {{practice}} of making accusations of subversion or treason without proper <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> evidence. The term refers to U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy and has its origins in the period in the United States known as the Second Red Scare, lasting roughly from 1947 to 1956 and characterized by heightened political repression {{as well as a}} campaign spreading fear of Communist influence on American institutions and of espionage by Soviet agents.|$|E

5|$|Mengele {{received}} doctorates {{in anthropology}} and medicine from Munich University {{and began a}} career as a researcher. He joined the Nazi Party in 1937 and the SS in 1938. Initially assigned as a battalion medical officer at the start of World War II, he was transferred to the concentration camp service in early 1943 and assigned to Auschwitz. There he saw the opportunity to conduct genetic research on human subjects. His subsequent experiments, focusing primarily on twins, had no <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> the health or safety of the victims.|$|E
5|$|Poetic form is more {{flexible}} in modernist and post-modernist poetry, {{and continues to}} be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognisable structures or forms, and write in free verse. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored. Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.|$|E

5|$|The Mildenhall, Kaiseraugst, and Esquiline treasures {{comprise}} large {{items of}} tableware. Other hoards, however, {{such as those}} found at Thetford and Beaurains consist mostly of coins, jewellery, and small tableware items; these two hoards probably are pagan votive offerings. A hoard from Traprain Law in Scotland contains decorated Roman silver pieces cut up and folded, showing <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> {{the value of their}} metal alone, and may represent loot from a raid.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{is still}} {{surrounded}} by the 19th-century Salvation Army farm, and beyond that by Hadleigh Country Park, owned and managed by Essex County Council and a Site of Special Scientific Interest with special <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> invertebrates. In 2008, Hadleigh Farm, close to the castle, was announced as the venue for the mountain biking competition in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting requirements and poor project management by the Navy. The development of an Australian-designed ship customised for Australian conditions caused naval officers to include requirements beyond those which were essential. These changes were made without <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> costs, as the team tasked with developing the specifications was not also responsible for the ships' final price and delivery schedule. The Navy's failure to maintain control of the design requirements and make cost-performance trade-offs {{may have been due}} to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E
