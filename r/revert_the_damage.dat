50|$|Sunburn {{is caused}} by UV radiation, either from the sun or from {{artificial}} sources, such as tanning lamps, welding arcs, or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. It is a reaction {{of the body to}} direct DNA damage from UVB light. This damage is mainly the formation of a thymine dimer. The damage is recognized by the body, which then triggers several defense mechanisms, including DNA repair to <b>revert</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage,</b> apoptosis and peeling to remove irreparably damaged skin cells, and increased melanin production to prevent future damage. Melanin readily absorbs UV wavelength light, acting as a photoprotectant. By preventing UV photons from disrupting chemical bonds, melanin inhibits both the direct alteration of DNA and the generation of free radicals, thus indirect DNA damage.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{statistics}} show that in 2015 more than 140 millions new malware samples have been found. Among these, a large portion is due to ransomware, the class of malware whose specific goal is to render the victim's system unusable, in particular by encrypting important files, and then ask the user to pay a ransom to <b>revert</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage.</b> Several ransomware include sophisticated packing techniques, and are hence difficult to statically analyse. We present EldeRan, a machine learning approach for dynamically analysing and classifying ransomware. EldeRan monitors a set of actions performed by applications in their first phases of installation checking for characteristics signs of ransomware. Our tests over a dataset of 582 ransomware belonging to 11 families, and with 942 goodware applications, show that EldeRan achieves an area under the ROC curve of 0. 995. Furthermore, EldeRan works without requiring that an entire ransomware family is available beforehand. These results suggest that dynamic analysis can support ransomware detection, since ransomware samples exhibit a set of characteristic features at run-time that are common across families, and that helps the early detection of new variants. We also outline some limitations of dynamic analysis for ransomware and propose possible solutions...|$|E
40|$|Most acute tympanic {{membrane}} perforations heal spontaneously without any residual complication, whereas a fraction transforms into a chronic perforation. The current {{treatment of a}} chronic perforation is surgical repair, which is a costly, time consuming and uncomfortable procedure particularly for the pediatric patients. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of the reparative process in acute and chronic perforations. This is done by monitoring the structural and mechanical properties of the {{tympanic membrane}} in various situations during healing. Furthermore, an aim is to test the efficacy of stem cells as a healing adjuvant both in acute and chronic perforations. On otomicroscopic examination {{the reduction of the}} laser perforation size was evident between day four and five after myringotomy. Histological analysis revealed thickening of the tympanic membrane at and around the myringotomy site at two and four weeks post-myringotomy in light microscopic sections. Transmission electron microscopic sections revealed a five-fold thickness increase in the lamina propria. Proliferation of fibroblasts and accumulation of large amounts of extra-cellular substances suggests an attempt of the body s reparative mechanism to <b>revert</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage.</b> The lamina propria is thickened still at six months after myringotomy. The fibers of the lamina propria are loosely packed with seemingly unorganized orientation. These findings suggest that the healing process is not yet finished after half a year. A striking histological feature was the larger thickening increase in the lamina propria of the tympanic membranes that were treated with stem cells, as compared to the untreated. Growth factors or other secreted substances from the stem cells might have influenced the proliferation of fibroblasts and the production of extra-cellular substances to contribute to this accentuated thickness. An in vitro model in the rat was developed and adjusted for moiré interferometry measurements in order to assess the stiffness of normal and healed myringotomized tympanic membranes. Moiré interferometry is an optical, non-contacting technique by which the shape and pressure-produced displacement of an object can be measured. This method provides a full-field, 3 -dimensional, overall stiffness change along with local stiffness variation of different portions of the tympanic membrane. The stiffness of myringotomized and healed tympanic membranes is almost normal already at two weeks after myringotomy. A huge over-production of fibers during the proliferative phase of the healing seem to limit the damage caused by the myringotomy and thus provide extra strength to this area of reorganization. Long-term measurement of the myringotomized and healed tympanic membranes showed slightly reduced strength as compared to normal. Acute perforations treated with mouse embryonic stem cells did not show any enhanced healing as compared to untreated. Teratoma, which is a known complication to embryonic stem cell treatment, was not detected in any of the ears after a follow-up time of six months. The use of human mesenchymal stem cell treatment on chronic perforations showed better healing as compared to the untreated. Thus, it appears to be of great importance to continue to study this type of stem cells in the treatment of chronic tympanic membrane perforations...|$|E
25|$|India had a horrid {{beginning}} to the tournament. Their first match was against minnows Holland at Paarl, who tumbled the Indian batsmen out for just 204 (all out, 48.5 overs, 206 minutes), with only Tendulkar (52 from 72 balls, 7 fours) putting up resistance, although veterans Srinath and Kumble <b>reverted</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> with 4 wickets each and India ended up winning by 68 runs, the unconvincing victory {{setting the stage}} for immense criticism. India's next match was against Australia at Centurion. The Indian team, batting first, was steadily making progress at 41/1 when disaster struck. Sehwag's wicket triggered a middle order collapse that left India struggling at 50/5 having lost 4 wickets for 9 runs. Tendulkar and Harbhajan offered some resistance but <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> was done as India were out for 125 (all out, 41.4 overs, 176 minutes). Australia scored the target in 22.2 overs, only losing one wicket. The Indian team's mediocre performance in the first two matches triggered uproar in India. Player effigies were said to be burnt on streets and the Board of Control for Cricket in India was under immense pressure to reshuffle the team {{at the end of the}} World Cup. This reaction at home may have triggered the Indian team's performance for the remainder of the World Cup.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{limitations}} {{in the use of}} triazene compounds for inducing increased immunogenicity of tumor cells in vivo (i. e. chemical xenogenization) is the profound immunodepressive activity of these drugs. The present study analysed the inhibitory effects of DTIC on various T-dependent immune responses in mice in an attempt to determine the mechanism of action and appropriate treatments for <b>reverting</b> <b>the</b> immune <b>damage</b> produced by <b>the</b> agent. Results obtained show that treatment with DTIC in vivo produced: (a) inhibition of spleen cell proliferation; (b) reduced IL- 2 production in response to allogeneic stimuli; (c) reduction of the generation of IL- 2 R + CD 8 + cells in allogeneic MLC; (d) inhibition of allo-CTL generation. The addition of IL- 2 to MLC on day 2 of the co-culture restored full allogeneic CTL responses. These data suggest that exogenous IL- 2 could be used to counteract DTIC-induced depression of T-cell reactivity, which is presumably involved in hosts' responses against autochthonous xenogenized tumor cells...|$|R
40|$|Elephantopus scaber {{has been}} {{traditionally}} used as liver tonic. However, the protective effect of E. scaber on ethanol-induced liver damage is still unclear. In this study, we have compared the in vivo hepatoprotective effect of E. scaber with Phyllanthus niruri on <b>the</b> ethanol-induced liver <b>damage</b> in mice. <b>The</b> total phenolic and total flavanoid content of E. scaber ethanol extract were determined in this study. Accelerating serum biochemical profiles (including AST, ALT, ALP, triglyceride, and total bilirubin) associated with fat drop and necrotic {{body in the}} liver section were observed in the mice treated with ethanol. Low concentration of E. scaber was able to reduce serum biochemical profiles and the fat accumulation in the liver. Furthermore, high concentration of E. scaber and positive control P. niruri were able to <b>revert</b> <b>the</b> liver <b>damage,</b> which {{is comparable to the}} normal control. Added to this, E. scaber did not possess any oral acute toxicity on mice. These results suggest the potential effect of this extract as a hepatoprotective agent towards-ethanol induced liver damage without any oral acute toxicity effect. These activities might be contributed, or at least in part, by its high total phenolic and flavonoid contents...|$|R
40|$|O estudo mostrou os efeitos do extrato padronizado de Erythrina velutina (EPEV), na atividade motora, na memÃria e nas concentraÃÃes de aminoÃcidos cerebrais de camundongos submetidos Ã isquemia {{cerebral}} global (ISQ). Os animais (camundongos swiss, machos, 30 - 35 g) foram submetidos Ã isquemia cerebral transitÃria pela oclusÃo de ambas as artÃrias carÃtidas durante 30 minutos e tratados durante 5 dias com EPEV 200 ou 400 mg/kg e Memantina (MEM), controle positivo, 10 mg/kg, 2 ou 24 h apÃs a isquemia. O mesmo procedimento foi feito no grupo Falso-operado + DMSO (FO) com exceÃÃo do clampeamento das artÃrias carÃtidas. No 6 Âdia apÃs a induÃÃo da isquemia, os animais foram submetidos aos testes de atividade locomotora, rota rod e memÃria ({{step down}}, Y-maze e reconhecimento de objetos), a seguir foram sacrificados e as Ãreas cerebrais dissecadas como (cÃrtex prÃ-frontal âCPF; hipocampo- HC e corpo estriado- CE) para determinaÃÃo das concentraÃÃes de aspartato (ASP), glutamato (GLU), glicina (GLI), taurina (TAU) e Ãcido gama-amino-butirico (GABA). Nenhuma alteraÃÃo na atividade exploratÃria vertical foi detectada entre os grupos FO e ISQ tratados com os diluentes, bem como entre os grupos tratados com EPEV ou MEM. PorÃm, um aumento na atividade exploratÃria horizontal (rearing) foi observado no grupo EPEV 200 mg 2 H quando comparado com o grupo ISQ. No teste de rota rod nenhuma alteraÃÃo significativa foi detectada entre os grupos. No teste de memÃria step down a ISQ afetou os processos de aquisiÃÃo e retenÃÃo de memÃria tanto na fase imediata (memÃria recente - MR), quanto na fase de consolidaÃÃo (memÃria tardia - MT) quando comparado ao grupo FO. Comparando os tratamentos de EPEV 200 ou 400 mg/kg observamos um aumento significativo, no tempo de permanÃncia na plataforma, nos animais tratados apÃs a isquemia quando avaliados na MR e na MT. No teste Y-maze a ISQ promoveu um dano na retenÃÃo da memÃria dos animais em relaÃÃo ao grupo controle (FO), porÃm o EPEV e a MEM conseguiram reverter esse dano em ambas as doses. Os animais submetidos a ISQ mostraram dÃficit na memÃria tambÃm no teste de reconhecimento de objetos. Esse dÃficit foi revertido pelo grupo EPEV 400 mg (2 ou 24 H) e por MEM. A dosagem de aminoÃcidos apÃs o teste de comportamento no CPF, HC e CE apresentou aumento nas concentraÃÃes dos aminoÃcidos excitatÃrios (ASP, GLU) nos animais ISQ +DMSO quando comparados ao FO. No CPF esse aumento pode ser revertido pelos animais tratados com EPEV 24 H em ambas as doses e MEM 24 H. JÃ no HC esse aumento foi revertido por todos os grupos tratados. No CE houve reduÃÃo das concentraÃÃes de GLU nos grupos EPEV 200 mg (2 ou 24 H) e MEM 2 H. A respeito das concentraÃÃes de GABA, GLI e TAU, no CPF, houve reversÃo dos valores nos grupos EPEV 200 mg 2 H e no grupo 400 mg em ambos os horÃrios de tratamento como tambÃm no grupo MEM 24 H quando comparados ao controle isquemiado. No HC um aumento nas concentraÃÃes de GLI e TAU pode ser visto nos grupos EPEV 200 mg 24 H, EPEV 400 mg 2 H e MEM 24 H. JÃ as concentraÃÃes de GABA foram revertidas nos grupos EPEV 400 mg e MEM no tempo de 24 H. O CE apresentou concentraÃÃes elevadas de TAU e GABA nos animais ISQ quando comparados com o controle. O valor de GABA sÃ foi revertido pelo grupo EPEV 200 mg 2 H. Diante do exposto, concluÃmos que o EPEV em ambas as doses desenvolveu uma aÃÃo neuroprotetora, possivelmente pela reduÃÃo das concentraÃÃes de aminoÃcidos excitatÃrios e aumento dos inibitÃrios apÃs a isquemia. Possibilitando, assim, a perspectiva de um uso futuro do EPEV em doenÃas isquÃmicas no Sistema Nervoso Central. The study shows {{the effects of}} standardized extract of Erythrina velutina (EPEV) in motor activity, in memory and in the determination of amino acids in mice brain undergoing global cerebral ischemia (ISQ). Animals (swiss mice, males, 30 - 35 g) were subjected to transient cerebral ischemia by occlusion of both carotid arteries during 30 minutes and treated for 5 days with EPEV 200 or 400 mg/kg and Memantine (MEM) 10 mg/kg, 2 or 24 hours after ischemia. The same procedure was done in false-operated group + DMSO (FO) {{with the exception of}} clamping the carotid arteries. On day 6 after induction of ischemia, the animals were subjected to tests of locomotor activity, rota rod and memory (step down, Y-maze and object recognition), then were sacrificed and dissected brains on ice the prefrontal cortex (PFC), Hippocampus (HC) and striatum (ST) determination of aspartic acid (ASP), glutamate (GLU), glycine (GLY), taurine (TAU) and gamma-amino-butirico acid (GABA). No change in exploratory activity was detected between the groups vertical FO and ISQ treated with solvents, as well as between the groups treated with EPEV or MEM, however, an increase in exploration activity across (rearing) was observed on EPEV 200 mg 2 H group when compared to the ISQ. In rota rod test no substantial modification has been detected between the groups FO and ISQ treated with DMSO and in the groups treated with EPEV and MEM. Memory test step down the ISQ has affected the processes of acquisition and retention of memory both in the immediate phase (recent memory-RM), and the consolidation phase (late memory-LM) when compared with the group FO. Comparing the treatments we observed {{a significant increase in the}} length of stay in the non-electrified platform, in the animals treated after ischemia when evaluated in RM, and in LM. Y-maze test the ISQ promoted a retention damage in memory of animals compared to the control group (FO), however the EPEV and MEM managed to <b>revert</b> <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> on the acquisition of memory induced by ISQ at both doses. Animals subjected to ISQ showed deficit in memory also in object recognition test, this deficit was reversed by EPEV 400 mg 2 or 24 H group and by MEM 10 mg. The dosage of amino acids after testing behavior on PFC, HC and ST presented an increase in concentration of excitatory amino acids (ASP, GLU) in animals ISQ + DMSO when compared to FO. In the CPF that increase can be reversed by the animals treated with EPEV 24 H at both doses and MEM 10 mg 24 H in HC this increase was reversed by all treated groups. In CE there was a reduction in levels of GLU on EPEV 200 mg 2 or 24 H and MEM 10 mg 2 H. Regarding the levels of GABA, GLY and TAU in the CPF, there was reversal of values in the Group EPEV 200 mg 2 H and 400 mg in both treatment schedules as well as group MEM 10 mg 24 H when compared to the control that suffered ischemia. In the HC an increase in levels of GLY and TAU can be seen in EPEV 200 mg 24 H, EPEV 400 mg 2 H and MEM 10 mg 24 H groups. GABA levels were already reverted on EPEV 400 mg and MEM 10 mg groups at the time of 24 H. The ST presented high levels of TAU and GABA in the ISQ animals when compared with the control. The value of GABA was only reversed by EPEV 200 mg 2 H group. With this, we concluded that the EPEV at both doses developed a neuroprotective action, possibly by reducing the levels of excitatory amino acids and inhibitory increase after ischemia...|$|E
40|$|Cigarette {{smoke is}} the major risk factor for lung cancer {{and a variety of}} chronic {{degenerative}} diseases. We tested the ability of the glucocorticoid budesonide and of the natural agent phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) to inhibit DNA damage in bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BAL) of CD– 1 mice exposed to environmental cigarette smoke (ECS). A total of 197 mice were divided into following experimental groups: (A) untreated (sham); (B) ECS; (C) ECS þPEITC; (D) ECS þ budesonide. Exposure to ECS started within 12 h after birth and continued throughout the weaning period and for 2 additional weeks after weaning, for a total of 7 weeks. After treatment, the mice were sacrificed and subjected to BAL in order to evaluate DNA damage in BAL cells by using the alkaline–halo test. DNA damage was significantly increased in ECS exposed mice vs. Sham (3. 3 -fold). Both PEITC (2. 4 -fold) and budesonide (2. 0 - fold) significantly attenuated ECS-induced DNA <b>damage.</b> In conclusion, <b>the</b> analysis of sentinel cells collected by BAL showed that the investigated agents, which are among the most promising chemopreventive agents, are able to <b>revert</b> <b>the</b> DNA <b>damage</b> produced by passive exposure to cigarette smoke...|$|R

40|$|Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) is a {{naturally}} occurring hormone that exerts neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties {{in a wide}} range of neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. Accumulating evidence suggests that the effects of IGF-II in the brain may be explained by its binding to the specific transmembrane receptor, IGFII/M 6 P receptor (IGF-IIR). However, relatively little is known regarding the role of IGF-II through IGF-IIR in neuroprotection. Here, using adult cortical neuronal cultures, we investigated whether IGF-II exhibits long-term antioxidant effects and neuroprotection at the synaptic level after oxidative damage induced by high and transient levels of corticosterone (CORT). Furthermore, the involvement of the IGF-IIR was also studied to elucidate its role in the neuroprotective actions of IGF-II. We found that neurons treated with IGF-II after CORT incubation showed reduced oxidative stress damage and recovered antioxidant status (normalized total antioxidant status, lipid hydroperoxides and NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase activity). Similar results were obtained when mitochondria function was analysed (cytochrome c oxidase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential and subcellular mitochondrial distribution). Furthermore, neuronal impairment and degeneration were also assessed (synaptophysin and PSD- 95 expression, presynaptic function and FluoroJade B® stain). IGF-II was also able to recover the long-lasting neuronal cell <b>damage.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> effects of IGF-II were not blocked by an IGF-IR antagonist, suggesting the involvement of IGF-IIR. Altogether these results suggest that, in or model, IGF-II through IGF-IIR is able to <b>revert</b> <b>the</b> oxidative <b>damage</b> induced by CORT. In accordance with the neuroprotective role of the IGF-II/IGF-IIR reported in our study, pharmacotherapy approaches targeting this pathway may be useful for the treatment of diseases associated with cognitive deficits (i. e., neurodegenerative disorders, depression, etc.) ...|$|R
