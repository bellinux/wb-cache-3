5000|$|Police {{stations}} in India maintain history sheets (similar to US <b>rap</b> <b>sheets)</b> in three categories. A repeat offender progresses from category C to B to A; a [...] "category A" [...] history-sheeter {{is considered to}} be a hardened criminal, whose criminal inclination is close to incurable.|$|R

50|$|On rehearing, the Court of Appeals, modifying its holding, {{said that}} most state {{policies}} in fact did not favor disclosure of <b>rap</b> <b>sheets,</b> {{but that the}} District Court should nonetheless make a factual determination whether the remaining brother's privacy interest in his rap-sheet information had faded because such information appeared on the public record (265 App DC 365, 831 F2d 1124). The Court of Appeals subsequently denied rehearing en banc.|$|R

50|$|In Career mode, pursuits are {{integrated}} into the game {{in such a way}} that it is necessary to participate in pursuit in order to be able to challenge Blacklist racers. The player must complete Milestones which involve committing at least a specified amount of traffic offenses or pursuit lengths during a pursuit, and collecting an amount of Bounty, a form of credit accumulated as players continue to evade the police or damage police units. A car's heat level may be reduced by changing the physical appearance of a car by changing body parts or paint color, or by using another purchased car with a lower heat level to race in the streets. If a car is not being used by the player its heat level will slowly lower over time. <b>Rap</b> <b>sheets,</b> with records such as the player's infractions, cost to state, deployed tactics and pursuit lengths, are also available for viewing by hacking into police records.|$|R
50|$|Following the ComStat meeting, Colvin {{comes up}} with a new plan - instead of {{contacting}} the low level hoppers, he needs to coerce the dealers and crew chiefs into following his new rules. He asks Carver for a list of names of all the mid-level dealers on his corners. Carver is unable to offer anything and Colvin is once more disappointed in him. Colvin is forced to go to Major George Smith - the CID Narcotics Unit commander who has replaced Foerster. He finds Smith's records a disappointingly slim collection of <b>rap</b> <b>sheets.</b> Smith tells him there is no one looking at high end drug cases because Rawls is directing their efforts to street work. Colvin is also unable to obtain anything from the Intelligence Division, adding more to his disappointment. Eventually Colvin is referred to the Major Case Unit where Lieutenant Daniels and Detectives Kima Greggs and Lester Freamon are able to give him a wealth of information. Colvin is glad and surprised that a unit as small as theirs is the only group of police in the department who have every file that he is looking for. McNulty arrives and receives a warm greeting from Colvin, his old commander, who still calls him Bushy Top.|$|R

50|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} list was the trading of full forward Brendan Fevola to the Brisbane Lions.

5000|$|Henry Barnes of The Guardian {{has written}} that the claims for the project made by Galloway, [...] "a good friend of hyperbole", do not match {{the content of the}} final film.

5000|$|Fredericksburg has {{a safety}} <b>rap</b> <b>sheet</b> a mile long. The Coast Guard cited {{it for two}} deficiencies—improper boiler {{maintenance}} and damaged hull plates from an encounter with a Houston dock—in 2002 and investigated 26 minor accidents and oil discharges in the preceding nine years. That tally is much longer than the Coast Guard sheet on every younger tanker I examined.|$|E
5000|$|Cindy {{told reporters}} that her two sons are [...] "thieves and drug addicts" [...] whose lives revolve around their addictions, but insists that pulling off a murder plot and {{covering}} it up is above their abilities.

5000|$|The Court {{held that}} the fact that an event was not wholly [...] "private" [...] did not mean that an {{individual}} had no interest in limiting its disclosure. The privacy interest in a <b>rap</b> <b>sheet</b> was substantial. Whether an invasion of privacy was warranted had to turn {{on the nature of the}} requested document and its relationship to the basic purpose of the FOIA, which focused on the citizen's right to be informed about the government's actions. The news groups in this case did not intend to discover anything about the conduct of the agency, and response to the request would not shed any light on the agency's conduct. Thus, the public interest in release of a <b>rap</b> <b>sheet</b> was not the type of interest protected by the FOIA. The Court held, as a categorical matter under § 552(b)(7)(C), that a third party's request for law enforcement records about a private citizen could reasonably be expected to invade that citizen's privacy, and that when the request sought no official information about the government, the privacy invasion was unwarranted.|$|E
5000|$|One reviewer, Barry Garron, {{wrote that}} [...] "'Being Bobby Brown,' the reality show {{spotlighting}} the R&B singer whose <b>rap</b> <b>sheet</b> might be longer than his catalog, is undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television". Garron and other reviewers {{noted that the}} show contained remarks regarding sexuality and excretory functions, and Garron opined that the show robbed Whitney Houston [...] "of any last shreds of dignity." ...|$|E

50|$|The journalists sued in District Court, {{limiting}} their request to documents containing {{information that was}} a matter of public record.

5000|$|The FBI's {{compilation}} of an individual's criminal identification, arrest, conviction, and incarceration information {{is known as}} the Interstate Identification Index, or [...] "Triple-I" [...] for short.

It contains information voluntarily reported by law enforcement agencies across the country, as well as information provided by other federal agencies. It contains information on felonies and misdemeanors, and may also contain municipal and traffic offenses if reported by the individual agencies.|$|E

In the interview Davison admits to a felony conviction for a gun related crime in 1996. and Department of Justice records indicate {{an extensive}} criminal arrest record including probation violations, DUI, drug and weapons charges, and even an arrest for first degree murder in Kansas City, Missouri in 2004.|$|E

Curtis explains that [...] "it's really my favorite record store in disguise" [...] and that [...] "the locals torch the place once they find out its real identity", apparently due to the type of music it sells (usually rap music featuring an artist with a <b>rap</b> <b>sheet).</b>|$|E
