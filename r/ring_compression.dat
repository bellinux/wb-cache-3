40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>compression</b> test using physical modelling experiments and finite element (FE) simulation. Using commercially available modelling clay, material stress–strain relationships were obtained from compression tests of solid cylindrical specimens. A series of <b>ring</b> <b>compression</b> tests were carried out to obtain friction coefficients for a number of lubricants including vaseline, zinc stearate and talcum powder. FE simulations were used to derive the friction calibration curves and to evaluate material deformation, geometric changes and load–displacement results. Friction coefficient values of the tested lubricants are in agreement with the results obtained by other researchers. Further investigation is necessary {{to determine the effects of}} material properties, test conditions and use of calibration curves on the <b>ring</b> <b>compression</b> test. It is suggested that the combined use of physical modelling experiment and FE simulation provides a simple and effective means in the study of frictional mechanisms for bulk material deformation. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, <b>ring</b> <b>compression</b> {{test was}} {{conducted}} to investigate i) effects of surface topography on friction and lubrication at room temperature with both dry and lubricated conditions, and ii) the effect of die temperature on friction and lubrication by differentiating temperatures of die and ring samples. Findings from experiments and FE results lead to develop a pressure-dependent variable friction model that concurrently changes friction factor during the forming stroke and different contact surface areas. The constant frictional model and this variable friction model were used in FE simulations of <b>ring</b> <b>compression.</b> The prediction results were compared with experimental results in details. The use of variable friction model gave very good correlations of the final ring geometry than other constant friction models in comparison to experiments. This implies that the pressure-dependent variable friction model can better characterize the interfacial friction condition in cold forging applications. In the <b>ring</b> <b>compression</b> with heated dies, the temperature rise was found to degrade the performance of lubricant, {{which resulted in the}} tapered shape ring. Therefore, the effect of surface topography and die temperature on interfacial friction condition with lubricant viscosity should be considered for the improved friction model for FE simulations of forging processes with high stroking rates...|$|E

40|$|Tribological {{conditions}} can change drastically during heavy loaded regimes as experienced in metal forming; {{this is especially}} critical when lubrication can only be applied at the early stage of the process because the homogeneous lubricant layer can break along the die-workpiece interface. In these cases, adopting a constant friction factor for the lubricant-surface pair {{may not be a}} valid assumption. This paper presents a procedure based on the use of dual friction factor maps to determine friction factors employed in heavy loaded regimes. A finite element (FE) simulation is used to obtain the friction factor map for the alloy UNS A 96082. Experiments were conducted using four lubricants (aluminum anti-size, MoS 2 grease, silicone oil, and copper paste) to determine the actual friction curves.
