5|$|Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, died on 4February 211 at Eboracum (now York) {{while on}} {{campaign}} in Caledonia, {{north of the}} Roman Britannia. Caracalla and his brother, Publius Septimius Antoninus Geta, jointly inherited the throne upon their father's death. Caracalla and Geta ended the campaign in Caledonia after concluding a peace with the Caledonians that returned the border of Roman Britain to the line demarcated by Hadrian's Wall. During the journey back to Rome with their father's ashes, Caracalla and his brother continuously argued with one another, making relations between them increasingly hostile. Caracalla and Geta considered dividing the empire in half along the Bosphorus to make their co-rule less hostile. Caracalla was to <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west and Geta was to <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east. They were persuaded not to do this by their mother.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} many {{different}} proposals involving {{the removal of}} Cisneros. Many of them required the new authorities to be elected by the Cabildo. Pascual Ruiz Huidobro proposed that the Cabildo should <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interim and appoint a new government, but this proposal made no reference to popular sovereignty or {{the creation of a}} junta. This proposal received 35votes, and sought simply to replace Cisneros with Huidobro: Huidobro was the most senior military officer, and thus the natural candidate under current laws to replace the viceroy in the lack of a new appointment from Spain. Juan Nepomuceno Solá proposed a junta composed of delegates from all the provinces of the viceroyalty, while the Cabildo should govern in the interim; this proposal received nearly 20votes. Cornelio Saavedra, whose aforementioned proposal was that the Cabildo should appoint a Junta and <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interim, got the largest number of votes. A number of other proposals received only a few votes each.|$|E

5|$|Aberdeen's {{first and}} only foreign manager, Ebbe Skovdahl, was {{appointed}} in 1999 and his time in charge coincided {{with some of the}} heaviest defeats in the club's history. The low point of the club's history came in the 1999–2000 season, where they finished bottom of the table. As the Scottish Premier League was being expanded to twelve teams, there was then a three team play-off. However, as Falkirk's stadium did not meet SPL requirements, Aberdeen retained their status in the top flight.

5|$|After Saladin conquered {{almost the}} whole Kingdom of Jerusalem {{in the second}} half of 1187, Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem, sought shelter in Tripoli, which became a center of her supporters. The noblemen who {{condemned}} her husband, Guy of Lusignan, for the fall of the kingdom, joined Conrad of Montferrat at Tyros. Saladin decided to invade the crusader states in Syria. He started his military campaign against Tripoli in May 1188, but the arrival of the fleet of William II of Sicily saved the town. After Saladin captured Tortosa and Jabala (present-day Tartus and Jableh in Syria) in July, only Tripoli, Krak des Chevaliers, and the citadel at Tortosa remained under Christian <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county.|$|E
5|$|After William the Conqueror {{defeated}} Harold Godwinson and the English at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, {{he continued}} to face resistance to his <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north of England. For a number of years, William's position was very insecure. In order to project his influence northwards to control {{the people of the}} Danelaw (an area that had for a time been under the control of Scandinavian settlers), he constructed a number of major castles in the North and Midlands of England: including those at Warwick, Nottingham and York. After gaining control of York, the Conqueror turned southwards and arrived at the Roman and Viking city of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|After {{the revolt}} had largely been suppressed, those who {{accepted}} Ottoman suzerainty were initially allowed {{to retain their}} holdings and partial autonomy. Many timars were also granted to local Albanians holding high posts of the administration, especially during the rule of Jakub Muzaka and Skanderbeg. Throughout the pacification process, various primarily rural areas were still in revolt and new rebellions erupted, like that of Teodor Korona Muzaka in 1437. As the empire further extended its area of <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, centralization attempts and the replacement of local timar holders with Ottoman landowners resumed. These policies would lead {{in part to the}} formation of the League of Lezhë under Skanderbeg in 1444, and a new era in the Ottoman–Albanian wars.|$|E
