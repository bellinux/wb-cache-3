40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>radiation</b> <b>losses</b> from high {{frequency}} parallel-wire transmission lines was first realized {{as early as}} 1900, {{and has become a}} matter of controversy ever since. Many writers have investigated the problem from a theoretical standpoint, but very little has been done in the way of measuring these losses experimentally. At low frequencies <b>radiation</b> <b>losses</b> are negligible, but they become appreciable at high frequencies thus affecting the design of parallel-wire lines for use in the higher portion of the frequency spectrum. In order that the controversy may be wholly or at least partially settled, and to correct existing data, this treatise has therefore been prepared. This paper describes the measurement of radiation resistance from resonant parallel-wire lines in the frequency range 300 Mc/sec. to 1200 Mc/sec. To determine the dependence of <b>radiation</b> <b>losses</b> on line length, lines varying in length from one-quarter wavelength to four wavelengths, with open and short-circuited terminations have been investigated. The results obtained agree with theory in some ways whereas they disagree in others. <b>Radiation</b> <b>losses</b> are similar in some respects to ohmic losses and as such are undesirable in many engineering applications.
