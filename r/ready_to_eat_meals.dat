In 1983, field trials began to test {{the adequacy of the}} MRE ration for long-term subsistence, leading to concerns about weight loss. Following these trials, a new military nutrition research division known as the Nutrition Task Force was established at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine. One of the Nutrition Task Force’s first objectives was to complete an intensive field trial of rations to test ration acceptance and intake over extended periods of time. The second half of the 1980s saw continued investment in military nutrition research and in 1986, the Nutrition Task force became the Military Nutrition Division.|$|R

40|$|<b>Ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> pasta <b>meals</b> are an {{important}} segment of convenience food, but these products are subjected to significant changes in physico-chemical properties during storage, which reduce their acceptability {{at the time of}} consumption. A deep understanding of the properties of the single phases, their dependence upon formulation, and the changes they undergo during storage is very important to intelligently intervene on products properties to improve their quality at the time of consumer’s consumption. This work has focused on the effect of formulation on physico-chemical properties of pasta and tomato sauce with a special focus on mechanical/rheological attributes and water status. Variable considered in pasta formulation were gluten, glycerol and moisture content and their effect was studied in both freshly cooked or shelf-stable cooked pasta. The effect of multiple hydrocolloids (at different levels) was considered in the case of tomato sauce. In the case of pasta, it was found that water content was indeed a very important variable in defying pasta mechanical properties and water status. Higher moisture contents in pasta resulted in softer samples and reduced the changes in physico-chemical parameters during storage. Glycerol was found to favor water uptake and to soften the pasta matrix, acting as plasticizer and increasing molecular mobility. The addition of gluten hardened pasta but did not affect the water status. The combination of higher amount of gluten (15 %, g gluten / 100 g product) with higher moisture content (59 - 65 %, g water / 100 g product) were found to minimize the physico-chemical changes occurring in RTE pasta meals during storage, improving quality at longer storage times. Hydrocolloids added into tomato sauce modulated its mechanical attributes and water status in very different manner, depending on hydrocolloid type and concentration. This may allow to produce tomato sauce for different applications and that are expected to have different performance if placed in contact with pasta in a RTE meal. Future work should include an investigation of how the interaction between the two phases (pasta and sauce) can be modulated and controlled by controlling the properties of the single phases with the goal of obtaining highly acceptable products also at longer storage times...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the home meal {{replacements}} (HMR) consumer and investigates three HMR categories: <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>meals,</b> ready to heat meals, and ready to cook meals. A nationally representative (n= 359) survey was undertaken in Taiwan amongst primary food purchasers in the households. Within each HMR category, consumers were segmented into frequency based on their level of purchase behavior. The frequency with the highest purchase level of HMR was compared with the frequency with the lowest purchase level on their food-related lifestyles about HMR. Analysis of data found {{that the importance of}} product information were found to be positively contributing to the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>meals.</b> The demands of freshness were found to be negatively contributing to the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>meals.</b> The health and quality dimensions were found to be negatively contributing to the reported purchase behavior of ready to heat meals and ready to cook meals. The whole family dimensions were found to be positively contributing to the reported purchase behavior of ready to heat meals and ready to cook meals. The price criteria were found to be positively contributing to the reported purchase behavior of ready to cook meals. 隨著時間壓力的增加、烹調設備的進步與缺乏烹調餐食慾望等生活型態轉變，影響到用餐型態的選擇，對於方便性飲食需求將持續增加；在此背景下，提供取代部分或全部的家庭餐食，減少消費者食用前的處理步驟，增加料理的簡便力和省力化，讓家庭可更方便食用的家庭取代餐(Home meal replacement) 概念之產品，在未來的國內食品市場將愈趨重要。因此，本研究目的希望鎖定在家庭食品消費中居於主導地位的家庭主婦為研究對象，藉由目的為收集消費者在購買、準備和消費食品產品時的態度和行為等資訊之食品生活型態(food-related lifestyle) ，找出影響家庭取代餐購買行為之因素，並探討食品生活型態因素對家庭主婦在不同類型之HMR產品購買行為之影響關係，提供相關食品產業在制定決策時的參考。研究結果發現，在顯著影響因素方面，產品資訊的重要性對即食餐購買頻率有顯著正面影響，新鮮需求則有負面的顯著影響關係；在健康與品質導向因素中，對即熱餐和即煮餐之購買頻率皆為負向顯著影響，相反的，家人的協助因素則有正向的顯著影響關係；此外，當家庭主婦對價格的敏感度愈高時，則會提高即煮餐之購買頻率。第一章 緒論 [...] . 1 第一節 研究背景與動機 [...] . 1 第二節 研究目的 [...] . 5 第二章 文獻探討 [...] . 6 第一節 用餐型態的轉變與家庭取代餐的崛起 [...] . 6 第二節 食品生活型態 [...] 17 第三節 食品生活型態與家庭取代餐購買行為相關研究 [...] 23 第三章 研究方法 [...] 25 第一節 研究架構與假說 [...] 25 第二節 變項操作性定義 [...] 27 第三節 研究對象、範圍與取樣方法 [...] 31 第四節 問卷設計與分析方法 [...] 32 第四章 分析與結果 [...] 38 第一節 問卷回收 [...] 38 第二節 樣本敘述性統計分析 [...] 39 第三節 食品生活型態之分析 [...] 42 第四節 家庭取代餐購買行為之分析 [...] 60 第五章 結論與建議 [...] 83 第一節 研究發現與結論 [...] 83 第二節 研究建議 [...] 87 參考文獻 [...] . 90 附錄...|$|E

40|$|Several {{factors such}} as {{insufficient}} harvesting and handling methods as well as inadequate methods of storage and distribution, poor processing techniques and poor quality of raw materials used in making ready to eat foods {{may lead to the}} cumulative causes of food borne illness particularly in developing countries. Public trend in the world nowadays are demanding access to more and more fresh eating products practical but nutritious, safe and preferably processed under non thermal treatments. The new and emerging post harvest technologies in controlling pathogen and maintaining quality of food products is ionizing radiation, because it is applicable for almost all type of foods without impairing the overall quality as well as sensory attributes. The foods either fresh, dried, or <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>meals</b> in the packages can be exposed to ionizing radiation for different purposes such as quarantine measures, control of sprouting and germination, shelf-life extension of perishable foods, delaying ripening and aging of fruits and vegetables, destruction of parasites and harmful pathogenic microorganisms. International trade of agricultural commodities opens the possibility of the movement of pests such as insects from country to country. The countries involve in this business have established laws and regulations, including international trade regulation of irradiated foods, in order to minimize the risk and trade barrier. The future of food irradiation is filled with promise although the needs for this technique relates to consumer acceptance. Consumers will grow to appreciate the technology for the lifesaving and good food availability. It should be kept in mind that irradiation is controlling contamination and it does not prevent it...|$|E
40|$|Colilert® (IDEXX) was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} simultaneous enumeration of coliforms and E. coli in water samples and {{has been used for}} the quality control routine of drinking, swimming pools, fresh, coastal and waste waters (Grossi et al., 2013). The Colilert® culture medium contains the indicator nutrient 4 -Methylumbelliferyl-β-D-Glucuronide (MUG). MUG acts as a substrate for the E. coli enzyme β-glucuronidase, from which a fluorescent compound is produced. A positive MUG result produces fluorescence when viewed under an ultraviolet lamp. If the test fluorescence is equal to or greater than that of the control, the presence of E. coli has been confirmed (Lopez-Roldan et al., 2013). The present work aimed to apply Colilert® to the enumeration of E. coli in different foods, through the comparison of results against the reference method (ISO 16649 - 2, 2001) for E. coli food analysis. The study was divided in two stages. During the first stage ten different types of foods were analyzed with Colilert®, these included pastry, raw meat, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>meals,</b> yogurt, raw seabream and salmon, and cooked shrimp. From these it were approved the following: pastry with custard; raw minced pork; soup "caldo-verde"; raw vegetable salad (lettuce and carrots) and solid yogurt. The approved foods presented a better insertion in the tray, the colour of the wells was lighter and the UV reading was easier. In the second stage the foods were artificially contaminated with 2 log/g of E. coli (ATCC 25922) and analyzed. Colilert® proved to be an accurate method and the counts were similar to the ones obtained with the reference method. In the present study, the Colilert® method did not reveal neither false-positive or false-negative results, however sometimes the results were difficult to read due to the presence of green fluorescence in some wells. Generally Colilert® was an easy and rapid method, but less objective and more expensive than the reference method...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{consumption}} of processed foods has increased, mainly due to changes in consumers’ lifestyle. Therefore, dietary habits of people are changing and it is of utmost importance to evaluate the nutritional quality of processed foods. Processed foods are recognized as sources of sugar, salt and fat. With respect to fat, according to the literature, these foods are mainly rich in saturated fatty acids. Moreover, since some of these foods have partially hydrogenated edible oils as ingredients, it is also very important to evaluate trans fatty acids (TFA) content of processed foods. Gas chromatography is the most used analytical method to determine the fatty acids profile of foodstuffs, since this technique presents better sensitivity and it allows separation of the different fatty acids isomers. In the present study, gas chromatography {{has been used to}} evaluate the nutritional quality of 236 processed foods (bakery products, soups, burgers, patties, seeds, nuts, French-fries, potato crisps, pizzas, sauces, cereals, biscuits, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>meals,</b> among others). Samples to be analysed were selected by reviewing existing data on the contribution of processed foods to the intakes of saturated fat, TFA and salt. Samples were purchased from supermarkets and fast-food restaurants. The selected processed foods were analysed regarding their fatty acids profile. The methylation of fatty acids was performed using 0. 25 mL of methanolic potassium hydroxide (2 M) and 2 mL of n-heptane. Then, a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector was used. Fatty acids methyl esters were separated in a Supelco®- 2560 column (100 m x 0. 25 mm i. d., 0. 25 µm film thickness). According to the obtained results, for the bakery products, it was possible to confirm that fatty acids profile can be used to discriminate the different types. For example, it was possible to identify the healthier processed food, between similar foods, using the fatty acids analysis. Moreover, for potato crisps group the determination of fatty acids profile was also very useful to identify the oil/fat that was used as the frying medium. For other groups of processed foods this type of analysis was not sufficient, and a deeper analysis using other parameters, such as salt, was used to evaluate its nutritional quality. Regarding TFA, in general the analysed processed foods have low contents. Authors consider that the content of TFA has significantly been reduced during the last years, possibly due to industry reformulations. In conclusion, the obtained results will be essential to perform an update regarding the fatty acids profile of processed foods consumed by the Portuguese people. Also, these results will be included in the Portuguese Food Composition Database, which from a nutritional point of view, will make possible to perform associations between the intake of these foods and the impact that they can have in the health status of consumers. In the near future, we intend to include more types of processed foods in order to take a broader view of the current situation in Portugal.
