5000|$|As {{early as}} 1979, {{the idea of}} a {{defensive}} wall has been an obvious one for the Moroccan authorities.

50|$|In addition, {{some have}} {{proposed}} translating the maritime <b>right</b> <b>of</b> hot <b>pursuit</b> into a comparable right to pursue criminals over land borders. Although {{it does not}} form a settled tenet of international law, the principle has been invoked by the United States regarding Taliban militants crossing into Pakistan, by Turkey regarding its attacks on Kurdistan Workers Party bases in northern Iraq, and by Colombia regarding its raid on a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia camp in Ecuador, {{which led to the}} 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis.|$|R

Their stated agenda includes a campaign against homophobia and discrimination based on sexual orientation, equal rights for sexual minorities (in their own words, [...] "complete freedom, equality, and <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>pursuit</b> of happiness for homosexuals") {{as well as the}} legalization of same-sex marriages. On its campaign bid for the 2004 parliamentary elections, the Democratic Labour Party promised the abolition of all inequalities against sexual minorities and won a record 10 seats in the Kukhoe National Assembly.|$|E
50|$|Every day, the GEA has to {{face the}} endless {{evolution}} of the criminal organisations. In international waters, huge foreign “mother - ships” operate as fixed and untouchable warehouses, transhipping drugs and smuggled tobaccos on fast motorboats, {{so that they can}} “deliver” these illegal goods on Italian coasts, with minimal probability of being caught. The GEA fights against this criminal trick using the <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pursuit</b> stated by the Montego Bay Convention (art. 111), this way it scored top results in this field, including:o seizure of a motor ship and 2.935 kg of smuggled tobaccos (operation “JANET” - 1999);o seizure of a fishing ship and 5.036 kg of drug (operation “TESTA ROSSA” - 2007);o seizure of a yacht and 11.060 kg of drug, in cooperation with Spanish Police Forces (operation “VALIANT” - 2003);o seizure of 4.166 kg of drug and 10 people arrested (operation “OMBRA”, entirely accomplished by GEA personnel).|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} law principle <b>of</b> hot <b>pursuit</b> {{is analogous to}} the common law principle, but was probably conceived independently. It began to coalesce into a general custom of international relations {{during the early years of}} the 20th century, although the general principle had been advanced before in national legislation such as the British Hovering Acts. The participating states at the League of Nations Codification Conference of 1930 broadly agreed on the validity <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> hot <b>pursuit,</b> but the proposed convention on territorial waters in which it was included was never ratified. It was finally codified as Article 23 of the Geneva Convention on the High Seas in 1958.|$|R

30|$|The {{state has}} adopted very {{different}} approaches {{in response to}} different types of labor disputes. Chen and Tang (2013, 566) believe that there were three types of labor conflicts emerged during China’s transformation: in the early stage, the protests of workers from state-owned enterprises {{were based on a}} moral economy, mainly in <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> wage and social security that would maintain their living standard. These protests were in accordance with the socialist discourse and survival ethics before the reform, and mainly took the form of leapfrog petitions and sit-down protests. The authorities responded mainly by introducing special relief programs and discouraging protests. Later, more rights protection action in the non-state-owned sector was carried out in light of the concept <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> in <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> legally secured wages (and wages for overtime work) and compensation for work-related injuries. Such action relied on specific laws and policies, and usually took the form of arbitration and litigation. The authorities responded mainly through (quasi-)judicial disposition and providing legal services. However, in recent years, more and more protests concerned conflicts of interests. They aimed at increasing wages and improving working conditions, were based on a sense of economic fairness, and mainly took the form of strikes. The responsive strategies of authorities changed to communicating and negotiating with protesters and employing force to break up the protesters (Chen and Tang 2013, 566).|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe asked {{subjects}} to align a target that flashed as their eyes rotated to the <b>right</b> in <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> a moving ring, with a target that flashed as their eyes rotated {{to the left}} in <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> the ring. Subjects systematically mislocalised the targets in the direction <b>of</b> <b>pursuit.</b> When the ring and flashes were the only structures that were visible, the alignment error was about 4 cm, corresponding to a timing error of about 100 ms. The timing error was independent of the position along the ring's path, but did depend to some extent on pursuit velocity. Adding a textured background reduced the mislocalisation considerably, presumably because it enabled {{subjects to}} localise the targets relative to the surrounding. There was almost no mislocalisation if the subject was not pursuing the ring. It is suggested that the mislocalisation arises because incoming retinal signals are combined directly with outgoing oculo-motor commands, with no attempt to account {{for any of the}} involved neuronal and muscular delays...|$|R

60|$|In this {{formation}} we advanced a {{few hundred}} yards to our left, evidently with the object of interposing ourselves between the routed impi and the pursuing Usutu, or, if the latter should elect to go round us, with that of threatening their flank.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to destroy ISIS, {{beginning}} in August 2014, the United States, assisted {{by a handful of}} other Western and Arab countries, carried out thousands of bombing sorties and cruise missile attacks against ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. Iraq had consented to the airstrikes in its territory, but Syria had not, and Russia blocked the UN Security Council from authorizing force against ISIS in Syria. The United States invoked several different legal arguments to justify its airstrikes, including the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> humanitarian intervention, the right to use force in a failed state, and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> hot <b>pursuit,</b> before finally settling on self-defense. Use of force in self-defense has traditionally not been viewed as lawful against non-state actors in a third state unless they are under the effective control of that state but the United States argued that {{in the aftermath of the}} 9 / 11 attacks by al Qaeda, such force can be justified where a government is unable or unwilling to suppress the threat posed by non-state actors operating within its borders. This view was not, however, initially accepted by Russia, China, or even the United Kingdom. But that changed in the aftermath of ISIS attacks against a Russian jetliner and a Paris stadium and concert hall in 2015, leading to the unanimous adoption of a UN Security Council resolution calling on States to use all necessary measures to fight ISIS in Syria without offering a legal basis for military action. This article examines the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> to use force in self-defense against non-state actors and makes the case that events in 2015 triggered a “Grotian Moment”: a fundamental paradigm shift that will have broad implications for international law...|$|R
