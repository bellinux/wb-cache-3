There is the story of the singer Harun al-Rashid asks to keep singing until the caliph falls asleep. Then a handsome young man arrives, snatches the lute from the singer's hand and shows him how it <b>really</b> <b>should</b> be done. On awakening Harun is told of this and suggests his singer had a supernatural visitation. Al-Mas‘udi quotes the lines (five in English) of this remarkable song.|$|E

Writing in Science & Society, Harvey O'Connor also gave the book a mixed appraisal, observing that while the book constituted a [...] "comprehensive indictment ... of the power of great fortunes" [...] based on [...] "encyclopedic research", Lundberg suffered from [...] "the New York myopia" [...] in describing the situation he presents as essentially beyond correction.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, when Taylor became {{eligible}} for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, there were some concerns that his hard-partying lifestyle and drug abuse would hurt his candidacy. These concerns proved to be ill-founded, however, as he was voted in on the first ballot. His son Lawrence Taylor Jr. gave his introduction speech at the induction ceremony. Taylor's ex-wife, his three children, and his parents were in attendance and during his induction speech Taylor acknowledged them saying, [...] "hank you for putting up with me for all those years." [...] He also credited former Giants owner Wellington Mara for being supportive of him saying, [...] "e probably cared more about me as a person than he <b>really</b> <b>should</b> have." ...|$|E

It seriously, seriously sucks," [...] adding [...] "the single nice thing we can find to say is that the concept had potential." [...] Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal thought, [...] "despite a strong - and {{somewhat}} morally ambiguous - ending [...] <b>really</b> <b>should</b> have delivered in more spectacular fashion than this." [...] Patrick also criticised Jack's personality throughout the episode, stating [...] "we wanted a spinoff series about him because he was cocky, cool and downright entertaining - Buzz Lightyear meets Ace Rimmer meets James Bond. We didn't want some grumpy immortal bastard with a chip on his shoulder." [...] Despite the mixed reviews however, the series producers and BBC controller of fiction Jane Tranter regard the episode as one of their favourites from the first series.|$|E
500|$|Amidst these drastic changes, large {{proportions}} of the freshmen classes (some as high as 30%) contained all-state high school band members. As the band's experience and musical talents grew, {{the quality of the}} music improved dramatically. Haney even rewrote the drills to include a portion where the band stopped moving and played to the audience. This innovation was well received and became a staple of the band's repertoire. In 1975, at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas, the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game. By the fourth quarter, the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney, trying his best to be fair, told the cameraman that they <b>really</b> <b>should</b> let the Razorback Band play a little too. The cameraman called up to the broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied, [...] "The director doesn't want to hear the Arkansas band, he wants to hear the Aggie Band." ...|$|E

Cole, but hey, anyone can sound good over this beat. And not only that, but Cole's vocals, however brief, are a welcome complement." [...] Making reference to its music video, Entertainment Weeklys Erin Strecker commented: [...] "I'm assuming it was shot mid-summer, {{which is when}} this <b>really</b> <b>should</b> have been put out. Releasing this track {{at the end of}} October seems like an odd choice, as the video involves a grillout and trailer-park pool party that would have sparkled mid-July."

Morrison, as usual, declined {{to take part}} but the author's scholarly methods lend this weighty volume a real authority." [...] The Journal Gazette called the book: [...] "A definitive, provocative and revelatory portrait of an endlessly complicated man and his music." [...] A review in The Irish Times characterised the book as a [...] "magical" [...] journey into Van Morrison's life, noting: [...] "Johnny Rogan spent 23 years researching his biography of Van Morrison. It shows. In a book that <b>really</b> <b>should</b> have been titled Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Van Morrison But Were Too Petrified To Ask, this is a magical 'into the mystic' journey which vertiginously takes you from Edward Carson to Leadbelly, from the Mafia to the Rosacrucians, from drinking stories to Gestalt therapy, and from Bernadette Devlin to Terry Keane." [...] Brian Boyd of The Irish Times described Rogan's work as a [...] "superb book".|$|E
500|$|Playwright Horton Foote {{reportedly}} considered {{giving up}} on film writing, due to what he regarded as a poor adaption of his 1952 play The Chase into a 1966 film of the same name. Following what Foote saw as a far more successful adaption of his 1968 play Tomorrow in 1972, his interest in filmmaking was rekindled, {{under the condition that}} he maintain some degree of control over the final product. Foote said of this stage in his career, [...] "I learned that film <b>really</b> <b>should</b> be like theatre in the sense that in theatre, the writer is, of course, very dominant... If we don't like something, we can speak our minds.... It is always a collaborative effort.... But in Hollywood it wasn't so. A writer there has in his contract that you are a writer for hire, which means that you write a script, then it belongs to them." [...] This renewed interest in cinema prompted Foote to write Tender Mercies, his first work written specifically for the screen. In the view of biographer George Terry Barr, the script reflected [...] "Foote's determination to battle a Hollywood system that generally refuses to make such personal films." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad that {{features}} elements of pop and soul music. Instrumentation {{is provided by}} a guitar, kick drums, an organ, percussion and a piano. It is also backed by doo-wop beats, finger snaps and cooing backup vocals. Lyrically, the song speaks of a woman's breaking point and Hilson [...] "voices the frustration" [...] {{of women who are}} being neglected and exploited by men. In the chorus, she sings: [...] "Every woman has a breaking point, y'all/ Hey, I know you know, some women can be lied to, cheated on and beat on/ Somebody know, hey, every woman has a breaking point, y'all." [...] According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, Hilson vocally incorporates an [...] "improvisational gospel style. MTV Buzzworthy writer Chris Ryan compared Hilson's vocals with Mary J. Blige's, particularly in Blige's cover of [...] "I'm Going Down" [...] (1995). Halfway through [...] "Breaking Point", Hilson talks about [...] "the need for each woman to reclaim her life" [...] in a spoken-word interlude, during which she mimics Blige, according to Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe.

[...] In 1999, she played Alice in the romantic comedy Strange Planet and the Texan student Holly Maddux in The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer, which was based on the real life effort to capture Ira Einhorn, who was charged with Maddux's murder. In 2000, while David Lynch was expanding the rejected pilot of Mulholland Drive into a feature film, Watts starred alongside Derek Jacobi, Jack Davenport and Iain Glen in the BBC TV film The Wyvern Mystery, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Sheridan Le Fanu that was broadcast in March of that year.|$|E

The Bacon Cookbook is his 15th book on food. In the lead-up to the 2009 International Bacon Day, Villas commented to Pork Magazine, [...] "People are starting to realize that bacon is no longer just a breakfast staple. Bacon is, without a doubt, one of the most versatile and flavorful options in the grocery aisle. Most importantly, a little bacon goes a long way. A sprinkle can enhance not only the flavor, but also the aroma and appeal of nearly any dish. We’re seeing chefs and home cooks add bacon to dishes you wouldn’t expect, like popcorn or cookies, and take traditional tastes to another dimension." [...] Villas explained to Salon, [...] "Bacon has the perfect balance of sweet, salty, smoky flavor, and the perfect balance of meaty and crispy texture." [...] Villas commented to CBS News that his book was part of a growing interest in bacon products, [...] "We have a lot more conscientious producers today, you know, really turning out fresh great product like we've got here in this store.
