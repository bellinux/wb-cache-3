5|$|As {{automobile}} use {{in southern}} Ontario {{grew in the}} early 20th century, <b>road</b> <b>design</b> and construction advanced significantly.

5|$|The {{proposed}} Perth Bunbury Highway Peel deviation, part {{of which}} later became an extension to Kwinana Freeway, underwent a public environmental review in 1997, and an environmental assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in 2000. The relevant environment factors considered by the EPA were vegetation communities, declared rare and priority flora, wetlands, and traffic noise. Main Roads proposed management plans for each factor. Only clearing of vegetation critical for road construction would be undertaken, and more vegetation would be replaced than the amount impacted, using local native species. A survey for declared rare and priority flora found no rare species, and only one priority species, Lasiopetalum membranaceum, near {{the southern end of}} the project. Road construction would impact one conservation class wetland, but no protected wetlands. To minimise impact, road drainage would be designed to contain spills and prevent direct discharges into the surrounding environment. Noise levels would be contained to an acceptable limit in the <b>road</b> <b>design,</b> in accordance with the Main Roads traffic noise policy. The EPA concluded that the road could be designed and managed to an acceptable standard. Main Roads' 2006 plan for environmental management of the project included numerous aspects, which for the northern segment of the project exceeded the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, topsoil management, construction, foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E
25|$|The {{subject of}} <b>road</b> <b>design</b> is {{considered}} part of highway engineering. Structural <b>road</b> <b>design</b> is the science of designing a road for its environment in order to extend its longevity and reduce maintenance.

25|$|Speed bumps vary in length, but it {{is typical}} to leave space between the bump and either edge of an {{enclosed}} road (i.e. with curbs and gutters) to allow for drainage. Spaces on either side may also allow more expedient passage for emergency vehicles, though effectiveness {{will depend on the}} type of vehicle and specific <b>road</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
25|$|Horizontal {{alignment}} in <b>road</b> <b>design</b> {{consists of}} straight sections of road, known as tangents, connected by circular horizontal curves. Circular curves {{are defined by}} radius (tightness) and deflection angle (extent). The design of a horizontal curve entails the determination of a minimum radius (based on speed limit), curve length, and objects obstructing {{the view of the}} driver.|$|E

25|$|Worldwide, {{road traffic}} is {{becoming}} ever safer, {{in part due}} to efforts by the government to implement safety features in cars (e.g., seat belts, air bags, etc.), reduce unsafe driving practices (e.g., speeding, drinking and driving and texting and driving) and make <b>road</b> <b>design</b> more safe by adding features such as speed bumps, which reduce vehicle speed, and roundabouts, which reduce the likelihood of a head-on-collision (as compared with an intersection).|$|E
25|$|Sir Charles Herbert Bressey, CB, CBE (3 January 1874 – 14 April 1951) was a civil {{engineer}} and surveyor who specialised in <b>road</b> <b>design.</b> Bressey was Chief Engineer for Roads at the Ministry of Transport from 1921 to 1938. Between 1935 and 1938 he carried out research on road planning and motorway design in preparation for his Highway Development Survey, 1937 for Greater London published in 1938. He served as President of the Institution of Chartered Surveyors in 1938-9.|$|E

This uniform is nearly identical to the road uniform that the Blackhawks currently wear. The main differences between this design and the current <b>road</b> <b>design</b> {{comes in the form}} of the lace up collar, the name/number block font (which is serifed), and the C-Tomahawk logo, which is mostly red, black, and white (with a tad bit of yellow) instead of being mostly red, yellow, green black and white.|$|E

As a result, on January 1, 1924, the Texas Highway Department took full control of maintaining the state highways from the counties within which they resided. In 1925, the state legislature granted the highway department the responsibility of surveying, planning, and building highways, and the authorization to acquire new highway rights-of-way by purchasing, or condemning through eminent domain, land required for highway construction.|$|E
25|$|Total road {{deaths in}} New Zealand are high by {{developed}} country standards. 2010 {{figures from the}} International Transport Forum placed New Zealand 25th out of 33 surveyed countries in terms of road deaths per capita, a rank that has changed little in 30 years. The fatality rate per capita is twice the level of Germany's, or that of the United Kingdom, Sweden or the Netherlands (2010 comparison). This is variously blamed on aggressive driving, insufficient driver training, old and unsafe cars, inferior <b>road</b> <b>design</b> and construction, {{and a lack of}} appreciation of the skill and responsibility required to safely operate a motor vehicle.|$|E

He later apologized, though people had been complaining about the fractured grid system {{for more than a}} century by that point. Some of the city's <b>road</b> <b>design</b> is the result of the curve of the Mississippi River, hilly topography, conflicts between developers of different neighborhoods in the early city, and grand plans only half-realized. Outside of downtown, the roads are less confusing, but most roads are named, rather than numbered, increasing the difficulty for non-natives to navigate.|$|E
500|$|Construction of an {{extension}} to the freeway, initially {{known as the}} [...] "New Perth Bunbury Highway", began in December 2006.

Insufficient sight distance can adversely affect the safety or operations of a roadway or intersection.|$|E
