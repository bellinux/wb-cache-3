40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{important}} activity in airport operations is the gate scheduling. It is concerned with finding an assignment of flights to terminal and <b>ramp</b> <b>positions</b> (gates), and an assignment of the start and completion times of the processing of a flight at its position. The objectives related to the flight gate assignment problem (FGAP) include the minimization of the number of flights assigned to remote terminals and the minimization of the total walking distance. The main aim of this research is to find a methodology to solve the FGAP. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach called Biogeography-based Bee Colony Optimization (B-BCO). This approach is obtained fusing two metaheuristics: biogeography-based (BBO) and bee colony optimization (BCO) algorithms.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of thrust-sense tectonometamorphic discontinuities within the exhumed Himalayan metamorphic core {{can be explained}} {{as part of the}} Main Central thrust system. This imbricate thrust structure, which significantly thickened the orogenic midcrustal core, comprises a series of thrust-sense faults that all merge into a single detachment. The existence of these various structures, and their potential for complex overprinting along the main detachment, may help explain the contention surrounding the definition, mapping, and interpretation of the Main Central thrust. The unique evolution of specific segments of the Main Central thrust system along the orogen is interpreted to be a reflection of the inherent basement structure and <b>ramp</b> <b>position,</b> and structural level of exposure of the mid-crust.

40|$|Given {{that the}} lower third of a pyramid {{contains}} about 70 % of the stone blocks, the only efficient way of reducing building time at the minimum is a method which allows for upward transport of material from all four sides simultaneously. <b>Ramps</b> <b>positioned</b> tangentially with a slope of 26 ° come to mind. The time required for upward transport of blocks significantly influences the total building time. By comparison, the production of blocks in the quarry {{as well as their}} transport to the building site and horizontal transfer on the respective level would have been far less challenging as more workforce would have been available. In the model presented here, upward pulling of blocks on horizontal rollers is accom- plished by letting workers move downwards {{on the other side of}} the ramp. After completion of the stepped core, the ramps are removed, and the casing, which consists of horizontal courses, is laid. For this, a stepped auxiliary platform and tangential ramps are used.

The aim {{of this study is to}} report the perioperative management of a morbidly obese pregnant woman, body mass index > 50 kg/m 2, who underwent cesarean section under general anesthesia. Case reportPregnant woman in labor, 35 years of age, body mass index 59. 8 kg/m 2. Cesarean section was indicated due to the presumed fetal macrosomia. The patient refused spinal anesthesia. She was placed in the <b>ramp</b> <b>position</b> with cushions from back to head to facilitate tracheal intubation. Another cushion was placed on top of the right gluteus to create an angle of approximately 15 ° to the operating table. Immediately before induction of anesthesia, asepsis was carried out and sterile surgical fields were placed. Anesthesia was induced in rapid sequence, with Sellick maneuver and administration of remifentanil, propofol, and succinilcolina. Intubation was performed using a gum elastic bougie, and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The interval between skin incision and fetal extraction was 21 min, with the use of a Simpson's forceps scoop to assist in the extraction. The patient gave birth to a newborn weighing 4850 g, with Apgar scores of 2 in the 1 st minute (received positive pressure ventilation by mask for about 2 min) and 8 in the 5 th minute.

40|$|International audienceMolinges {{was located}} on an Upper Jurassic ramp system of {{low-energy}} regime that {{developed at the}} southern margin of the French Jura platform. The sedimentary succession {{is characterized by the}} transition from a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate to a carbonate depositional setting that occurred during a long-term shallowing-upward trend. The disappearance of siliciclastics is explained by a climatic change, from humid and cold to drier and warmer conditions, previously identified in Late Oxfordian adjacent basins. The base of the section shows marl-limestone alternations of outer ramp. In its middle part, the section displays oncolitic marls, coral-microbialite beds and oncolitic limestones that deposited in a mid <b>ramp</b> <b>position.</b> Finally, the upper section part is made of oolitic limestones of inner ramp. In outer- to mid-ramp settings submitted to terrigenous inputs, the stacking pattern of deposits and facies evolution allow the identification of elementary, small-, medium-, and large-scale sequences. Small amplitudes of sea-level variations probably controlled rapid shifts of facies belts and reef window occurrences. In small-scale sequences, the coral beds developed during periods of sea-level rise. The decreasing rate of sea-level rise is marked by the downramp shift of the oncolitic limestone belt that led to the demise of coral-microbialite beds. These bioconstructions are mainly represented by thin biostromes in which corals never reach great sizes. The coral assemblages mainly include the genera Enallhelia, Dimorpharaea, Thamnasteria, and some solitary forms (Montlivaltia and Epistreptophyllum). They suggest relatively low-mesotrophic conditions in marine waters during the edification of the primary framework. Relatively cold water temperatures and periods of more elevated nutrient contents are probably responsible of the reduced coral development and the formation of a large amount of microbialites...|$|E
40|$|Background: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the effect of ventilation using the ProSeal TM laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) with facemask and oropharyngeal airway (FM), prior to laryngoscopy, on arterial oxygenation in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Methods: Forty morbidly obese patients were randomly recruited to either PLMA or FM. After pre-oxygenation (FiO 2 1. 0) in the <b>ramp</b> <b>position</b> with continuous positive airway pressure of 10 cm H 2 O for 5 min, anaesthesia was induced. Following loss of jaw thrust oropharyngeal airway, the FM and PLMA were inserted. On achieving paralysis, volume control ventilation with PEEP (5 cm H 2 O) was initiated. The difficulty in mask ventilation (DMV) in FM, number of attempts at PLMA and laryngoscopy were graded (Cormack and Lehane) in all patients. Time from onset of laryngoscopy to endotracheal tube confirmation was recorded. Hypoxia was defined as mild (SpO 2 ≤ 95 %), moderate (SpO 2 ≤ 90 %) and severe (SpO 2 ≤ 85 %). Results: Significant rise in pO 2 was observed within both groups (P= 0. 001), and this was significantly higher in the PLMA (P= 0. 0001) when compared between the groups. SpO 2 ≥ 90 % (P= 0. 018) was seen in 19 / 20 (95 %) patients in PLMA and 13 / 20 (65 %) in FM at confirmation of tracheal tube. A strong association was found between DMV and Cormack Lehane in the FM group and with number of attempts in the PLMA group. No adverse events were observed. Conclusion: ProSeal TM laryngeal mask airway as conduit prior to laryngoscopy in morbidly obese patients seems effective in increasing oxygen reserves, and can be suggested as a routine airway management technique when managing the airway in the morbidly obese...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the performance of a two-dimensional, mixed-compression bifurcated duct inlet system designed for a free-stream Mach number of 2. 7. Thirty percent of the supersonic area contraction occurred internally. A movable ramp was used to vary the contraction ratio for off-design operation. Boundary layer bleed regions were located on the cowl, centerbody, and sidewall surfaces. There were also provisions for vortex generators on the cowl and centerbody of the subsonic diffuser. Data were obtained over the Mach number range of 2. 0 to 2. 8 and at angles of yaw from 0 deg. to the maximum value prior to inlet un-start. The test at Mach 2. 8 was to obtain data for an over- speed condition. The Reynolds number varied from 2. 5 to 2. 3 million/ft for Mach numbers above 2. 5. At Mach numbers of 2. 5 and lower, the Reynolds number was set at 2. 5 million/ft. Bleed patterns, vortex generator patterns, and <b>ramp</b> <b>position</b> were varied, and three inlet configurations were selected for more extensive study. Two of these configurations had self-starting capability. The self-starting configuration that was developed produced 89 percent total pressure recovery at the compressor face station with 6. 8 percent total bleed. The compressor face distortion was about 16 percent. Vortex generators were extremely effective in re-distributing flow but were not as effective in reducing distortion. Excellent flow symmetry was achieved between the separated halves of the inlet, and twin-duct instability was not observed. The ramp tip shock was steeper than expected. This caused the cowl lip shock to be reflected from the ramp instead of being cancelled at the shoulder. However, peak recovery at the throat was still obtained with the ramp near the design position...|$|E
40|$|The Middle Cambrian Spence Shale Member of the Langston Formation of {{northern}} Utah and southern Idaho is a fossil-rich unit that exhibits distinct cyclicity at the parasequence (meter) scale. At least seven discrete, shallowing-upwards parasequences, or cycles, {{can be found}} at the Miners Hollow and Antimony Canyon localities, each composed of calcareous shale capped by limestone. Within each cycle and within the member as a whole, predictable patterns of faunal distribution are evident. Sampling and identification of fossils from two localities have revealed that observed changes in fauna track changes in sea level throughout the section. Through cluster and principal components analyses it has been determined that those rocks of the Spence Shale representing a transgressive systems tract are home to a particular community of organisms, while those rocks of the highstand systems tract are home to another. It logically follows that the rocks of the transgressive tract represent a distinct biofacies, while those of the highstand tract represent another. The transgressive biofacies is composed of species such as agnostid and oryctocephalid trilobites and inarticulate brachiopods that are commonly found in deeper ramp settings. The highstand biofacies is distinguished by such taxa as Zacanthoides and other larger trilobite genera such as Glossopleura and Kootenia, and the eocrinoid Gogia, among others. The difference in <b>ramp</b> <b>position</b> between the Miners Hollow and Antimony Canyon localities implies a water depth gradient, with Antimony Canyon representing shallower water and Miners Hollow representing deeper water. This relationship is also reflected in the biofacies and community assignments. The stratigraphic trends explored in this study may be applied to other Spence Shale localities and possibly other Cambrian fossil deposits, such as the Burgess Shale of British Columbia.

40|$|Chattian mixed carbonate-siliciclastic {{deposits}} {{from two}} palaeogeographic units of Southern Alps, the Lessini Shelf and Venetian foreland basin of northeast Italy, are studied {{with respect to}} facies distributions and controlling ecological factors on dominant biogenic components. These ramp depositional systems {{are located in the}} western Southern Alps on the Lessini Shelf, and in the eastern Southern Alps in the Venetian foreland basin. The successions show an extensive geographic distribution of at least 150 km× 40 km at the southern margin of the Southern Alps. Palaeoenvironments are inferred following microfacies characteristics and floral and faunal indicators, especially those of coralline red algae and larger foraminifera. An inner- to middle homoclinal ramp morphology is reconstructed based on facies distributions and taxonomic and coralline algal growth-form proxy data. The distribution along depositional strike shows variation from thinner, carbonate dominated sequence in the west (Monti Berici and Monti Lessini) to a more variable, mixed carbonate-siliciclastic dominated environment to the east (Vittorio Veneto, Alpago). Facies character and occurrence are controlled by local hydrodynamic conditions and varying water turbidity of the studied ramp depositional system. The general facies succession shows a transgressive sequence from the proximal inner- to proximal middle ramp. A shoal belt of trough cross-bedded sandstones occurs in a proximal inner <b>ramp</b> <b>position</b> in all of the studied areas. In a gentle-dipping homoclinal ramp, most benthic organisms inhabited the relatively quite environments off these shoals in a distal inner ramp setting. Basinward environments (proximal middle ramp) constitute areas of maximal carbonate production and consist primarily of larger foraminiferal facies and rhodolith pavements. Larger foraminifera, represented by two larger foraminiferal assemblages, are most diversified in the shallower settings (near the fair-weather wave base, distal inner/proximal middle ramp), whereas coralline algae predominate in deeper areas (proximal middle ramp) constructing extensive rhodolith pavements. Rhodolith pavements are distinguished with respect to rhodolith shape, size, growth-forms and coralline algal taxonomic composition. Larger foraminifera are interpreted with respect to shell structures, shell architectures and comparable Recent counterparts. The analysed benthic communities thrived in a mesotrophic regime within trophic gradients constrained by fluvial influence. Coralline algal dominance and a moderately diverse larger foraminiferal assemblage suggest a tropical/warm temperate transition. The considerable stability imposed on sediments by the rhodolith pavement must also have significantly contributed to the maintenance of a middle ramp profile bulge.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} what factors influence successful endotracheal intubation in the critically ill morbidly obese {{patient in the}} intensive care unit? Method: An English language literature search was undertaken using Google scholar, Medline, MD Consult, Cochrane and Cinahl (1975 - 2009) with the key words ‘obesity’, ‘morbid obesity’, ‘ICU’, ‘intensive care’, ‘airway management’, ‘difficult intubation’, ‘positioning’, ‘critical care’, ‘bag mask ventilation’. Reference lists were examined manually to find further articles. Results: Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic and morbidly obese patients are accessing intensive care services. Thirteen articles were found for analysis. The incidence of difficult intubation was greater in obese patients rather than lean patients; 15. 5 % and 2. 2 % respectively (p 26 kg/m². Difficult intubation and high Cormack-Lehane grades were significantly greater in the DMV group. The intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) was inserted with similar ease regardless of Cormack-Lehane grade. Mean arterial oxygen saturations were similar during ILMA insertion for obese and lean, 96 % and 98 %, respectively. In the reverse Trendelenburg position it took longer for oxygen saturations to fall to 92 % during apnoea when compared with the supine position. It took twice as long for patients in the supine position to reach oxygen saturations of 97 % when ventilation was re-instituted than those in the reverse trendelenburg position. In the 25 degrees head up position gives 23 % higher mean oxygen tension after three minutes of pre-oxygenation. Conclusion: Predictors of difficult intubation are Mallampati class and a large neck circumference for the morbidly obese. <b>Ramped</b> <b>positioning</b> provides a better laryngeal exposure for ease of intubation. With head up positioning oxygenation can be optimised reducing periods when oxygen saturation values fall. The ILMA is a safe and effective rescue device for a failed intubation...|$|R
40|$|Agnes M Lamon, Ashraf S Habib Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA Abstract: Obesity is a {{worldwide}} epidemic. It {{is associated with}} increased comorbidities and increased maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. The risk of cesarean delivery is also increased in obese parturients. Anesthetic management of the obese parturient is challenging and requires adequate planning. Therefore, those patients should be referred to antenatal anesthetic consultation. Anesthesia-related complications and maternal mortality are increased in this patient population. The risk of difficult intubation is increased in obese patients. Neuraxial techniques are the preferred anesthetic techniques for cesarean delivery in obese parturients but can be technically challenging. An existing labor epidural catheter can be topped up for cesarean delivery. In patients {{who do not have}} a well-functioning labor epidural, a combined spinal epidural technique might be preferred over a single-shot spinal technique since it is technically easier in obese parturients and allows for extending the duration of the block as required. A continuous spinal technique can also be considered. Studies suggest that {{there is no need to}} reduce the dose of spinal bupivacaine in the obese parturient, but there is little data about spinal dosing in super obese parturients. Intraoperatively, patients should be placed in a <b>ramped</b> <b>position,</b> with close monitoring of ventilation and hemodynamic status. Adequate postoperative analgesia is crucial to allow for early mobilization. This can be achieved using a multimodal regimen incorporating neuraxial morphine (with appropriate observations) with scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. Thromboprophylaxis is also important in this patient population due to the increased risk of thromboembolic complications. These patients should be monitored carefully in the postoperative period, since there is increased risk of postoperative complications in the morbidly obese parturients.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{have been designed}} to test whether the saccadic system takes target motion into consideration in computing saccade amplitude. In one experiment, while the subject fixated straight ahead, either a horizontal ramp-step-ramp or a horizontal step-ramp target moved from left to right. After the step, the subject had to make a saccade and follow the target. In the second set of experiments, the target, after an initial step, moved extrafoveally from up to down at fixed velocity; a tone, signaling the subject to make a saccade to the target and follow it, was delivered either after a variable delay (previewed condition) or simultaneously with the intial target step (non-previewed condition). In both experiments, eye position at saccade end was statistically different from target position 100 msec before saccade onset only when the target slow motion was presented before the step (i. e. in horizontal ramp-step-ramp and in previewed H-step V-ramp paradigms), suggesting that target motion could be used by the saccadic system to extrapolate the future target position, only if the subject is given enough time to observe the target ramp motion before the step.

Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) activation <b>ramped</b> over sequence <b>position</b> and reset at the initiation of each new sequence. To establish the necessity and function of RLPFC in this task, participants performed the sequential task while undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the RLPFC versus two prefrontal control regions. Across two independent experiments, only RLPFC stimulation increasingly disrupted task performance as each sequence progressed. These data establish RLPFC as necessary for uncertainty resolution during sequence-level control...|$|R

There are partial solutions {{based on the}} deployment {{of a network of}} sensors (Local Positioning Systems or LPS). Other solutions only require the installation of an inertial sensor on the person’s body (Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning or PDR). PDR solutions integrate the signals coming from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which usually contains 3 accelerometers and 3 gyroscopes. The main problem of PDR is the accumulation of positioning errors due to the drift caused by the noise in the sensors. This paper presents a PDR solution that incorporates a drift correction method based on detecting the access ramps usually found in buildings. The ramp correction method is implemented over a PDR framework that uses an Inertial Navigation algorithm (INS) and an IMU attached to the person’s foot. Unlike other approaches that use external sensors to correct the drift error, we only use one IMU on the foot. To detect a ramp, the slope of the terrain on which the user is walking, and the change in height sensed when moving forward, are estimated from the IMU. After detection, the ramp is checked for association with one of the existing in a database. For each associated <b>ramp,</b> a <b>position</b> correction is fed into the Kalman Filter in order to refine the INS-PDR solution. Drift-free localization is achieved with positioning errors below 2 meters for 1, 000 -meter-long routes in a building with a few ramps...|$|R
40|$|Is the {{presence}} of foveal stimulation a necessary prerequisite for rhesus monkeys to perform visually guided eye movements? To answer this question, we trained two rhesus monkeys to direct their eyes towards imaginary targets defined by extrafoveal cues. Independent {{of the type of}} target, real or imaginary, the trajectory of target movement determined the type of eye movement produced: steps in target position resulted in saccades and <b>ramps</b> in target <b>position</b> resulted in smooth pursuit eye movements. There was a tendency for the latency of saccades as well as pursuit onset latency to be delayed {{in the case of an}} imaginary target in comparison to the real target. The initial eye acceleration during smooth pursuit initiation elicited by an imaginary target decreased in comparison to the acceleration elicited by a real target. The steady-state pursuit gain was quite similar during pursuit of an imaginary or a real target. Our results strengthen the notion that pursuit is not exclusively a foveal function. © 1999 Elsevie...|$|R
