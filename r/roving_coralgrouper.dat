2500|$|In {{the coral}} reefs of the Red Sea, <b>roving</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> that have spotted a small prey fish {{hiding in a}} crevice {{sometimes}} visit the sleeping hole of a giant moray and shake their head at the moray, and {{this seems to be}} an invitation to group hunting as the moray often swims away with the grouper, is led to the crevice where the prey hides, and proceeds to probe that crevice (which is too small to let the grouper in), either catching the prey by itself or flushing it into the open where the grouper grabs it. [...] The closely related coral trout also enrolls the help of moray eels in this way, and they only do so when the prey they seek is hidden in crevices, where only the eel can flush them. They also quickly learn to invite preferentially those individual eels that collaborate most often.|$|E

50|$|The <b>roving</b> <b>coralgrouper</b> (Plectropomus pessuliferus) is {{a species}} of fish in the family Serranidae. Other commom names are violet coral trout and leopard grouper.|$|E

50|$|Reef-associated <b>roving</b> <b>coralgroupers</b> (Plectropomus pessuliferus) {{have been}} {{observed}} to recruit giant morays to join them in hunting for food. The invitation to hunt is initiated by head-shaking. The rationale for this joining of forces {{is the ability of}} the morays to enter narrow crevices and flush prey from niches not accessible to groupers. This is the only known instance of interspecies cooperative hunting among fish. Cooperation on other levels, such as at cleaning stations, is well known.|$|R
