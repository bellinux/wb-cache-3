50|$|A {{torsion spring}} {{counterbalance}} system consists {{of one or}} two tightly wound up springs on a steel shaft with <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> at both ends. The entire apparatus mounts on the header wall above the garage door and has three supports: a center bearing plate with a steel or nylon bearing and two end bearing plates at both ends. The springs themselves consist of the steel wire with a stationary cone at one end and a winding cone at the other end. The stationary cone is attached to the center bearing plate. The winding cone consists of holes every 90 degrees for winding the springs and two set screws to secure the springs to the shaft. Steel counterbalance cables run from the roller brackets at the bottom corners of the door to a notch in the <b>cable</b> <b>drums.</b> When the door is raised, the springs unwind and the stored tension lifts the door by turning the shaft, thus turning the <b>cable</b> <b>drums,</b> wrapping the <b>cables</b> around the grooves on the <b>cable</b> <b>drums.</b> When the door is lowered, the cables unwrap from the drums and the springs are rewound to full tension.|$|R

The web site provides a simple user interface, and creates simple methods for a user to update the backend with correct information. The system have been designed and implemented from requirements set by Nexans Rognan. Multiple smaller, fault prone and time-consuming tasks have been adopted into the system.

40|$|This project {{concerns}} large <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> made of steel. <b>Cable</b> <b>drums</b> are cylindrical structures used {{to transport}} {{different kinds of}} cables or wires. The ones in focus in this work are used to transport very stiff and heavy cables to offshore sites in the oil industry. To reduce weight in structures is always of great interest, and for <b>cable</b> <b>drums,</b> that are designed according to standards, {{there is much that}} can be improved. The aim of this project is to predict the loads acting on a drum during the winding of cables. This was accomplished by performing explicit finite element simulations of the winding sequence. Modeling and meshing were done using LS-PrePost and ANSA, and the winding was simulated using LS-DYNA. LS-PrePost was also used to analyze the results, together with mETApost. A number of simplifications and delimitations have been made {{in order to make the}} simulation possible within the time frame of the project. Simplified models of both the <b>cable</b> and the <b>drum</b> have been used. Winding velocities in real life are really slow, so in order to reduce simulation times, the winding velocity had to be increased while still avoiding dynamic effects. From this, contact forces between the <b>drum</b> and the <b>cable</b> could be obtained. The contact forces were investigated with respect to different friction values between the <b>cable</b> and the <b>drum,</b> for the <b>cable</b> itself and also for different cable stiffnesses. The results obtained from the simulations provide contact force distributions for different parts of the drum. Much fewer rows and layers of cable were winched than in real life, and it is therefore hard to see any clear trends in the obtained forces. However, one important result of the contact forces, is that a previously used assumption, namely that the pretension of the cable only applies loads to a small fraction of the drum, was a bit too conservative. According to the simulations it actually gets distributed over the whole drum. It is hard to draw any conclusions from the obtained contact forces, due to the small size of the simulations. The conclusion one can draw from this report, is that it is fully possible to use finite element tools to simulate the winding sequence of <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> and this report presents a methodology on how to achieve this. LS-DYNA handles the contact definitions in an adequate way and is, according to the authors, a strong candidate for future work in this area. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{net sounder}} is an echo sounder with a {{transducer}} {{mounted on the}} headline of the net {{rather than on the}} bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit, which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case there has to be the provision of a <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable less net-sounder â€“ such as Marportâ€™s Trawl Explorer - in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver/hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver.|$|R

About 25 minutes into the flight, a German flak battery fires on the Liberator, damaging the fuselage, wings and number 4 (starboard outer) engine and cutting the <b>rudder</b> <b>cables.</b> Pilot Oberfeldwebel Rauchfuss manages to maintain control, however. Two passengers, injured by the gunfire, require immediate medical attention (one later dies), and the pilot lands in a meadow near Quedlinburg, but a powerline forces him to apply power to clear it and the bomber breaks its nosewheel strut when it overruns into a freshly ploughed field. The strut is removed {{and sent to the}} Junkers Component Factory at Eilsleben for repair. The oil leak on the engine and the <b>rudder</b> <b>cables</b> are also repaired. Returned on 12 April, the strut is reinstalled and an attempt is made to take off on 13 April, after all excess equipment is removed to lighten the plane, but the clearing proves too short, the B-24 bogs down in sodden soil, and the nose strut again breaks. Reluctantly, the crew destroys the airframe by punching holes in the fuel tanks and setting it alight with a flare pistol.|$|R

50|$|Examination of the {{aircraft}} and the cargo door, which was recovered largely intact in Windsor, demonstrated that the latches had never rotated to their locked position. In their locked position, pressure on the door presses the latches further shut, and no force is transmitted into the actuator system that closes and opens them. With the latches only partially closed, forces on the door were transmitted back into the actuator, eventually overwhelming it at about 6,600 lbf. The rapid depressurization when the door broke off caused the floor above it to partially cave in, which pulled the <b>rudder</b> <b>cable</b> to its extension limit and severed several other operating cables.|$|R
