50|$|The tournament was {{considered}} a failure. One of the reasons was that Centertur used a <b>rubber</b> <b>check</b> to pay the accommodations of Olimpia at Hotel Mariner Plaza in Itajaí. Also, many traditional teams declined to play the tournament, exhausting the competition before it started. The tournament was discontinued and three years later, the Copa Mercosur's first edition was played.|$|E

Just after Sach receives the horse's name, [...] "Rubber Check," [...] from the devil, disguised as a soft drinks salesman, Chuck arrives {{with the news that}} the Polio Fund has agreed to pay for the boy's treatment. Sach then realizes that they now do not need the money and he can cancel the devil's contract. Duke, however, insists on betting on <b>Rubber</b> <b>Check</b> and Mabel tips off Tony and the others. Sach talks with the devil and attempts to break the contract, but the devil refuses and points out that if the horse wins, Sach's soul is his. Sach then convinces Duke to help him to disable Rubber Check's jockey after which Sach takes his place in the race, but is unable to stop the horse from winning. Just after Sach explains the full dimensions of his problem to Duke, the devil reappears to claim him, but is thwarted by an official track announcement that <b>Rubber</b> <b>Check</b> is disqualified as he had an unauthorized jockey, thereby nullifying the devil's contract with Sach and causing Tony and his gang to lose all their money.|$|E

50|$|Jean LaBanta (born c. 1879) was an American criminal, forger {{and train}} robber. He was a notorious conman and check forger in California {{during the early}} 20th century. Between 1913 and 1914, he passed out an {{estimated}} $40,000 in <b>rubber</b> <b>checks</b> and was also responsible {{for a series of}} train robberies against the Southern Pacific Railroad. It was partly due to his robberies that the railroad company first began arming its guards.|$|R
50|$|Born around 1879, {{little is}} known about Jean LaBanta's early life. In April 1911, he was convicted of grand larceny in San Benito County, California, and sentenced to 2 years {{imprisonment}} at San Quentin. He received an early parole in 1913 and was soon being investigated by authorities in several California counties for writing <b>rubber</b> <b>checks.</b> Placer County was the first to issue a warrant on LaBanta, then under his alias Clyde Kaufman, for forging $65 checks. Investigators would discover that LaBanta had passed out an estimated $40,000 in fraudulent checks.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some results}} achieved {{in a wide}} research {{carried out in the}} road material laboratory of the Rome University “La Sapienza” to assess the suitability of a new hot mix asphalt (HMA), containing crumb rubber (particle size 2 - 5 mm), as sub-ballast in railways or base layer in road pavements. This material could be effective in the reduction of vehicular traffic vibrations; however, crumb rubber is responsible for reducing mechanical characteristics of the asphalt concrete. The aim of this step of the program here discussed is to evaluate the influence of kind and content of crumb rubber on bituminous mixes, regarding fatigue life. The experimental analysis was directed to detect the initial modulus value, above which this bituminous material will remain structurally serviceable for a considerable period. The tests were conducted on cylindrical specimens, using a servo-hydraulic loading system and operating in a loaded-controlled fashion (tension-compression), at a frequency of 10 Hz and a temperature of 20 ° C. The adopted failure criterion, considering an assigned constant stress amplitude, was the number of load repetition that causes a decrease in modulus to half the initial value or, depending on the progress of the test, the fracture of the specimen due to macro-cracking. The tests were performed with various stress levels, related to the stiffness of the mix. This study documents the relationship between stiffness, as characterized by dynamic (complex) modulus, and fatigue life. Four mixes, different in kind and content of <b>rubber,</b> were <b>checked</b> and compared with a traditional HMA. The interpretation of experimental results demonstrates that mixes, containing a certain kind and a weight content up to 3 % of crumb rubber, show a fatigue life comparable with traditional HMA...|$|R

40|$|Alameda Creek {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} streams in the San Francisco Bay Estuary that has the potential to regain a viable steelhead trout population (Oncorhynchus mykiss). While great effort is underway to remove large barriers throughout the watershed, lesser known are the impacts of smaller structures in the lower reaches. The objective of my study was to determine if a decommissioned <b>rubber</b> dam, a <b>check</b> dam, and a temporary sewage pipe crossing impeded movement and/or created conditions that were unfavorable for outmigrating steelhead smolt during low flow periods. For the study I gathered data on temperature, depth, and channel form. The results showed that the rubber dam created inhospitable conditions of < 0. 1 ft depth and water temperature of 20 C in April across a 54 ft flat cement surface. Although the check dam and the sewage pipe crossing were less restrictive for smolt passage, all of the structures created environments that increased the risk of smolt predation. These inhospitable conditions were likely exacerbated by low flows. Gauge data from the past 33 years showed that low flows are common throughout the smolt migration period of April in the lower reach of Alameda Creek; therefore indicating the conditions observed in this study were not uncommon. Overall, the results suggest that modification or complete removal of these structures is the most viable solution to improve smolt migration success during low flow periods...|$|R
