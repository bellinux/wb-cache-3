40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{a series of}} patients with lower eyelid epiblepharon associated with lower eyelid <b>retraction.</b> Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent surgery for lower eyelid <b>retraction,</b> epiblepharon, or thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) between October 1999 and March 2007. Patients with both lower eyelid <b>retraction</b> and epiblepharon on preoperative examination were included in this study. Results: Twenty-seven eyelids of 20 patients with both lower eyelid <b>retraction</b> and epiblepharon were enrolled. The underlying causes of lower eyelid <b>retraction</b> included congenital <b>retraction</b> (seven eyelids), congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM; seven eyelids), TAO (seven eyelids), post-operative cicatricial <b>retraction</b> (five eyelids), and facial nerve palsy (one eyelid). Eight of 27 eyelids were successfully corrected after the repair of <b>retraction</b> without the repair of epiblepharon, regardless of the cause of lower eyelid <b>retraction.</b> Another four eyelids with epiblepharon associated with TAO resolved after only orbital decompression. Cilia-everting sutures were additionally applied for epiblepharon in another 14 eyelids, 12 of which did not require the excision of a skin fold or the orbicularis muscles. Only one eyelid with mild <b>retraction</b> and epiblepharon underwent simple epiblepharon repair. Recurrence of <b>retraction</b> or epiblepharon developed in three eyelids during follow-up. Conclusions: In cases with both lower eyelid <b>retraction</b> and epiblepharon, the <b>retraction</b> should be repaired first, an...|$|R
