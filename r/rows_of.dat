In order to evaluation of integrated application of bio-fertilizers and chemical fertilizers on on {{quantitative and qualitative}} yield of Ajowan in strip intercropping, a field experiment was conducted in a factorial design based on randomized complete blocks with three replications at research farm of Payamenoor University of Nagadeh, Iran during growing reason of 2011 - 2012.

The maximum grain yield and essential oil yield of Ajowan were obtained of treatment of bio-fertilizers + 50 % chemical fertilizers and control, respectively. Calculation of LER revealed that the maximum LER values (1. 97) were obtained of strip intercropping (4 <b>row</b> <b>of</b> ajowan+ 2 <b>row</b> <b>of</b> fenugreek) with chemical fertilizers.

5|$|The {{most obvious}} feature of Scelidosaurus is its armour, {{consisting}} of bony scutes {{embedded in the}} skin. These osteoderms were arranged in horizontal parallel rows down the animal's body. Osteoderms are today found in the skin of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The osteoderms of Scelidosaurus ranged in both size and shape. Most were smaller or larger oval plates with a high keel on the outside, the highest point of the keel positioned more to the rear. Some scutes were small, flat and hollowed-out at the inside. The larger keeled scutes were aligned in regular horizontal rows. There were three <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> these along {{each side of the}} torso. The scutes of the lowest, lateral, row were more conical, rather than the blade-like osteoderms of Scutellosaurus. Between these main series, one or two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> smaller oval keeled scutes were present. There were in total four <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> large scutes on the tail: one at the top midline, one at the midline of the underside, and one at each tail side. Whether the midline tail scutes continued over the torso and neck to the front is unknown and unlikely for the neck, though Scelidosaurus is often pictured this way.|$|E
