40|$|A {{heavy gauge}} square steel pipe is {{manufactured}} by a hot roll sizing process, {{in view of}} difficulty in manufacturing such a pipe with sharp corners by cold roll forming. In this paper, the effect of pass schedule on a cross-sectional shape is discussed by referring to experimental measurements, and results calculated by the rigid-plastic finite element method. The experiment was carried out at the last step of the sizing process for seamless pipes. The corners of a product become sharper as the magnitude of total reduction increases. In {{the case of a}} two-roll type roller, the corner near the <b>roll</b> <b>flange</b> becomes sharper than the corner near the groove bottom. The hollow depth at the sides is small when the incremental reduction at each sizing stand is high at the early reshaping stage with a large bending curvature (ðD 0 = 2 Þ=Ri, Ri: bending radius, D 0 : initial external diameter of a circular seamless pipe) and low at the late reshaping stage with a small bending curvature...|$|R

50|$|Lover's Lane {{is a short}} east-west road {{located in}} {{southern}} Berlin, joining Chandler Road {{to the west and}} Vermont Route 12 to the east, each of which run roughly parallel to the north-flowing Dog River. The bridge across the river is oriented roughly northeast-southwest, at a point where the river briefly bends to the west. It is a single-span Warren pony truss structure, 85 ft in length, resting on modern concrete abutments. The truss elements are made of rolled steel joined by bolts, a replacement for original rivets. The bridge floor is also a modern replacement, consisting of <b>rolled</b> steel <b>flange</b> beams supporting a wooden deck.|$|R
5000|$|Materials for flanges {{are usually}} under ASME designation: SA-105 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Piping Applications), SA-266 (Specification for Carbon Steel Forgings for Pressure Vessel Components), or SA-182 (Specification for Forged or <b>Rolled</b> Alloy-Steel Pipe <b>Flanges,</b> Forged Fittings, and Valves and Parts for High-Temperature Service). In addition, {{there are many}} [...] "industry standard" [...] flanges that in some {{circumstance}} may be used on ASME work.|$|R
40|$|Use of {{parallel}} flange I beam sections is advantageous than tapered flange I beam sections  due to, increased lateral stiffness, sections {{do not have}} sloping flanges and excessive material  in web and easy to weld and bolt. Nowadays the hot <b>rolled</b> parallel <b>flange,</b> narrow parallel  flange beams (NPB) and wide parallel flange beams (WPB) sections as per Indian standards,  having yield stress, 300 MPa, 350 MPa and 410 MPa are being manufactured. Available  range of these sections {{can be used for}} steel moment resisting frames (SMRF’s) and  prequalified connections as per AISC codes. When the cross section of a steel shape is  subjected to large compressive stresses, the thin plates that make up the cross section may  buckle before the full strength of the member is attained if the thin plates are too  slender. This failure mode may be prevented by selecting suitable width-to-thickness ratios  of component plates. In the present exercise, a suitability of NPB and WPB section for use in  SMRF’s as per width-to-thickness limitations of AISC 341 - 2010 and AISC 341 - 2005 codal  provisions is studied. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The {{housing is}} the {{component}} that holds {{all of the}} other elements of the rotary union together. The housing has an inlet port, which is a threaded port to which the hose supplying the medium will be attached. The rotary union may also have an outlet port, if the same joint is being used both to supply fluid to a roll and to remove fluid from the roll. In smaller rotary unions the housing is stationary. In larger rotary unions the housing is usually bolted to the drum or <b>roll</b> using a <b>flange.</b> In these cases the housing rotates at the same speed as the drum ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{eco-friendly}} stud {{obtained by}} expanding the sheared {{pattern of the}} web and by roll-forming the flange is going to prevail because of the scrapless manufacturing process. In order to design the shearing pattern for the eco-friendly stud, the finite element analysis and Taguchi method are employed. For the design of expanding process of sheared patterns, the whole roll-forming processes are simulated by finite element method. Six geometries are considered to see the durability and fire resistance of the dry wall, for which structural and thermal analyses are performed. For determining the best, the orthogonal array and smaller-the-better characteristics of the Taguchi method are utilized. As the roll gap of the upper-and-lower <b>roll</b> type causes <b>flange</b> buckling, the side roll type is adopted. The stress and strain distributions {{as well as the}} formed shape obtained from the finite element simulation are used for the successful design of the roll-forming processes. The material cost of the eco-friendly stud can be reduced, compared to the conventional stud. Moreover, the expanding process by side rolls shortens the length of the roll-forming process and minimizes the die cost. This research was supported by Seoul R&BD Program (JP 100037), for which authors show their appreciation...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{transport}} studies incorporating {{radio frequency}} identification (RFID) tracers are becoming a key component in understanding sediment transport dynamics due to the data they provide on spatial and temporal variability. This technique involves inserting small glass cylindrical transponders into stones then seeding those stones in the river bed. Existing methods of using RFID tracers involve either manually sweeping the channel bed after a hydrologic event or placing a series of fixed antennas along the channel to detect when sediment containing a RFID tracer passes that point. The first method is limited {{because it does not}} correlate the hydrodynamic conditions with the movement of the sediment, while the second method is limited by spatial resolution afforded by the fixed antennas. The goal of this research is to develop a flume with the capacity to accurately measure sediment inputs, transport, and export in real time. This is accomplished by automating the sediment supply, using a sediment trap with a light table to monitor sediment leaving the flume, and implementing an RFID sediment tracking system to provide real time tracking of the movement of individual clasts over the course of an experiment. A tilting flume with sediment supply and capture systems was designed and built with an integrated RFID tracking system to enable sediment transport experiments to be conducted in the flume while continuously tracking the position of RFID tagged sediment. The RFID tracking system, located under the floor of the flume, consists of a carriage containing the antennas, tuners, multiplexing RFID readers, batteries, and rollers to enable the carriage to <b>roll</b> along the <b>flanges</b> of the beam supporting the flume. The carriage is transported back and forth the length of the flume using cogged belts and pulleys powered by a DC motor and controlled by a PLC with limit switches. The identification of RFID tags detected by the carriage is transmitted Bluetooth to a stationary computer that also receives carriage position information from a laser range finder. Validation tests were conducted with vertically oriented RFID tags to establish the detection range and accuracy of estimating RFID tag positions. When no steel cross members were present, an RFID tag could be detected up to 21 cm above the flume floor with streamwise position estimation accurate within 1 cm. When steel cross members or multiple RFID tags were present, the detection range and position estimation accuracy decreased. Further refinement to this technique could be achieve by experimenting with different antenna designs which may provide a larger detection range and by using different type of PIT tags to enable tracking of smaller sized sediment. The developed flume and tracking system will allow us to obtain new and better information about sediment transport which should improve fundamental understanding and aid in the design of channel restoration projects...|$|R
