Unlike the pre-1971 non-SI roentgen unit of radiation exposure, the gray when used for absorbed dose is defined independently of any target material. However, when measuring kerma the <b>reference</b> <b>target</b> material must be defined explicitly, usually as dry air at standard temperature and pressure.|$|E
50|$|Without {{structural}} {{information about}} a protein, sequence analysis is often useful in elucidating information about the protein. These techniques involve alignment of target protein sequences with other related protein sequences. This alignment can show which amino acids are conserved between species and are important for {{the function of the}} protein. These analyses can help to identify hot spot amino acids that can serve as the target sites for mutations. Multiple sequence alignment utilizes data bases such as PREFAB, SABMARK, OXBENCH, IRMBASE, and BALIBASE in order to cross <b>reference</b> <b>target</b> protein sequences with known sequences. Multiple sequence alignment techniques are listed below.|$|E

This time it really seemed like XaAES had hit the end of the road, with no one interested in taking up the project again. After a period of complete standstill Dutch coder Henk Robbers took over the project in November 1999. During Henk's maintainership loads of progress was made, and XaAES went from interesting to becoming rather usable and showing great potential. The visual appearance was made to look closer to that of N.AES, as this was the obvious <b>reference</b> <b>target</b> - the AES that at the time was the GUI for FreeMiNT. XaAES also become a lot more robust although the response for key and mouse input was still somewhat of a problem.|$|E
5000|$|Following orbital {{injection}} {{and separation}} from the S-IVB, the crew turned the CSM around using its Reaction Control System thrusters, and Eisele practiced a simulated Lunar Module rendezvous and docking, using a visual <b>reference</b> <b>target</b> mounted inside the spacecraft adapter in the same radial position it occupied on the LM. One of the adapter panels on the S-IVB failed to completely deploy to its 45 degree open position, reminding CAPCOM Tom Stafford of his [...] "angry alligator" [...] experience on Gemini 9A, when docking was prevented by mis-deployed adapter panels. Had this been an actual lunar mission, the astronauts might have found the process of LM extraction from the adapter more difficult, risking possible damage. This reinforced the decision to add a system to completely separate and jettison the panels on all subsequent Apollo-Saturn V flights.|$|E

30|$|The {{employment}} of <b>reference</b> <b>targets</b> {{in the process}} of professional digitization or photography is ubiquitous today. Practically all current digitization guidelines aimed at the preservation of cultural heritage material highly recommend the inclusion of <b>reference</b> <b>targets</b> in each of the originals being scanned. Many agencies go even further, advocating the use of several targets in order to allow for a more accurate quantization of the variables involved in the digitization process. A prominent example are the numerous federal agencies from the US adhering to the Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative (FADGI) [11]. The FADGI suggests as a minimal requirement the use of photographic gray scale as a tone and color reference, as well as the utilization of an accurate dimensional scale. Color <b>reference</b> <b>targets,</b> also known as color checkers are therefore of central importance in any mass digitization process.|$|R

40|$|The {{requirements}} on new spaceborne {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) missions are always pushed towards better image quality with respect to signal-to-noise ratio, radiometric accuracy, and spatial resolution. An accurate radiometric calibration of the whole SAR system is crucial {{to cope with the}} demand on high image quality. Among other factors, the quality of the calibration depends on the utilized <b>reference</b> <b>targets.</b> Also permanent system monitoring, onboard and by <b>reference</b> <b>targets,</b> is required to guaranty the image quality over the whole mission time.

We first study the reconstruction problem given dense correspondences between 3 D points on the <b>reference</b> <b>target</b> and image locations. In such conditions, our differential geometry analysis provides a theoretical proof that the shape of the mirror surface can be uniquely recovered if the pose of the <b>reference</b> <b>target</b> is known. We then relax our assumptions by considering the case where only sparse correspondences are available. In this scenario, we formulate reconstruction as an optimization problem, which can be solved using a nonlinear least-squares method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real images. 1...|$|E
30|$|However, it is {{important}} to separate the detection from the multi-target identification, which will be discussed in Section 5.2. A target identification system has to distinguish sidelobes from targets, handle the case where targets are very close and have overlapping main lobes, etc., and therefore is an additional source of errors. To simulate an OFDM radar system without introducing multi-target-related errors, we create a scenario where everything except the <b>reference</b> <b>target</b> has zero RCS, and the <b>reference</b> <b>target</b> is therefore the only scatterer. The interferers only produce interference noise.|$|E

In this study, the FEKO electromagnetic simulation software is used to obtain the change curve of the target RCS as a function of frequency and aspect angle while incorporating high-resolution point-target SAR simulation, and quantitatively analyzing the effect of the modulation effect on SAR images.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for radiometric calibra-tion of {{light detection and ranging}} (LIDAR) intensity data and demonstrate an application of this method to natural targets. The method is based on 1) using commercially available sand and gravel as <b>reference</b> <b>targets</b> and 2) the calibration of these <b>reference</b> <b>targets</b> in the laboratory conditions to know their backscatter properties. We have investigated the target properties crucial for accurate and consistent reflectance calibration and present a set of ideal targets easily available for calibration purposes. The first results from LIDAR-based brightness measurement of grass and sand show that the gravel-based calibration approach works in practice, is cost effective, and produces statistically meaningful results: Comparison of results from two separate airborne laser scanning campaigns shows that the relative calibration produces repeatable reflectance values.

40|$|In {{traditional}} localization {{methods for}} {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR), the range sum estimation and Doppler centroid estimation (DCE) are required. The DCE error can influence the localization accuracy greatly. In addition, the target height information cannot be obtained by these methods. In this paper, a three-dimensional localization method for multistatic SAR based on the numerical range-Doppler (RD) algorithm and entropy minimization principle is proposed. In this method, the raw data from each transmitter and receiver (T/R) pair are focused by the numerical RD algorithm with the initial location value of the <b>reference</b> <b>target.</b> Then, Newton iteration is used to solve the target location value with the information of the bistatic range sum (BRS) in different SAR images with respect to different T/R pairs. Generally, the initial location value of the <b>reference</b> <b>target</b> is not accurate, and it can influence the imaging quality and accuracy of other target locations. We use entropy to measure image quality and iterate imaging with the new location value of the <b>reference</b> <b>target,</b> until the entropy gets the minimum value. Therefore, {{we can get the}} optimal location value of the <b>reference</b> <b>target,</b> which can make image entropy reach the minimum. Finally, all targets can be located by the Newton iteration method with their BRS in each T/R pair that are obtained from the images with minimum entropy. Compared with traditional localization methods for monostatic SAR, the proposed method not only effectively eliminates the influences of DCE errors, but also can get the target height information. Therefore, it improves the localization accuracy and can achieve three-dimensional localization. The effectiveness of the localization approach is validated by a numerical simulation experiment...|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} approach {{concerns a}} method for the accurate calibration of multi-channel SAR instruments, such as those required to support SAR polarimetry, single-pass interferometry and digital beam-forming, {{on the basis of}} dedicated SAR acquisitions containing <b>reference</b> <b>targets</b> with known properties. Unlike conventional approaches, the method is based entirely on the analysis of range-compressed raw data. It leverages the pulse-by-pulse analysis of amplitude, phase and delay variations observed within the range histories of <b>reference</b> <b>targets</b> to fully characterise and correct propagation direction dependent calibration issues. In addition, the approach does not require SAR image focussing in azimuth, which is essential in cases where azimuth focussing requires beam-forming techniques and thus presupposes an accurate calibration of the sensors' antenna array.

40|$|Background. Reference {{databases}} are {{mandatory in}} orthopaedics because they enable {{the detection of}} gait abnormalities in patients. Such databases rarely include data on children under seven years of age. In young children, gait is principally influenced by age and walking speed. The influence of the age-speed interaction has not been well established. Therefore, {{the objective of the}} present study is to propose normative values for biomechanical gait parameters in children taking into account age, walking speed, and the age-speed interaction. Methods. Gait analyses were performed on 106 healthy children over a large age range (between one and seven years of age) during gait trials at a self-selected speed. From these gait cycles, biomechanical parameters, such as the joint angles and joint power of the lower limbs, were computed. Specific peak values and the times of occurrence of each biomechanical gait parameter were identified. Linear regressions are proposed for studying the influence of age, walking speed and the age-speed interaction. Findings. Most of the regressions achieved good accuracy in fitting the curve peaks and times of occurrence, and the normal <b>reference</b> <b>targets</b> of biomechanical parameters could be deduced from these regressions. The biomechanical gait parameters of a pathological case were plotted against the normal <b>reference</b> <b>targets</b> to illustrate the relevance of the proposed targeting method. Interpretation. The normal <b>reference</b> <b>targets</b> for biomechanical gait parameters based on agespeed regressions in a large database might help clinicians detect gait abnormalities in children from one to seven years of age...|$|R

40|$|The {{selection}} and validation of stably expressed reference genes {{is a critical}} issue for proper RT-qPCR data normalization. In zebrafish expression studies, many commonly used reference genes are not generally applicable given their variability in expression levels {{under a variety of}} experimental conditions. Inappropriate use of these reference genes may lead to false interpretation of expression data and unreliable conclusions. In this study, we evaluated a novel normalization method in zebrafish using expressed repetitive elements (ERE) as <b>reference</b> <b>targets,</b> instead of specific protein coding mRNA targets. We assessed and compared the expression stability of a number of EREs to that of commonly used zebrafish reference genes in a diverse set of experimental conditions including a developmental time series, a set of different organs from adult fish and different treatments of zebrafish embryos including morpholino injections and administration of chemicals. Using geNorm and rank aggregation analysis we demonstrated that EREs have a higher overall expression stability compared to the commonly used reference genes. Moreover, we propose a limited set of ERE <b>reference</b> <b>targets</b> (hatn 10, dna 15 ta 1 and loopern 4), that show stable expression throughout the wide range of experiments in this study, as strong candidates for inclusion as <b>reference</b> <b>targets</b> for qPCR normalization in future zebrafish expression studies.
