50|$|In pure central {{sleep apnea}} or Cheyne-Stokes respiration, the brain's {{respiratory}} control centers are imbalanced during sleep. Blood levels of carbon dioxide, and the neurological feedback mechanism that monitors them, do not react {{quickly enough to}} maintain an even respiratory rate, with the entire system cycling between apnea and hyperpnea, even during wakefulness. The sleeper stops breathing and then starts again. There is no effort made to breathe during the pause in breathing: there are no chest movements and no struggling.

5000|$|In pure central sleep apnea, the brain's {{respiratory}} control centers, {{located in}} the region of the human brain known as the pre-Botzinger complex, are imbalanced during sleep and fail to give the signal to inhale, causing the individual to miss one or more cycles of breathing. The neurological feedback mechanism that monitors blood levels of carbon dioxide and in turn stimulates respiration fails to react quickly enough to maintain an even respiratory rate, allowing the entire respiratory system to cycle between apnea and hyperpnea, even for a brief time following an awakening during a breathing pause. The sleeper stops breathing for up to two minutes and then starts again. [...] There is no effort made to breathe during the pause in breathing: there are no chest movements and no muscular struggling, although when awakening occurs {{in the middle of a}} pause, the inability to immediately operate the breathing muscles often results in cognitive struggle accompanied by a feeling of panic exacerbated by the feeling associated with excessive blood CO2 levels. Even in severe cases of central sleep apnea, however, the effects almost always result in pauses that make breathing irregular rather than cause the total cessation of breathing over the medium term. After the episode of apnea, breathing may be faster and/or more intense (hyperpnea) for a period of time, a compensatory mechanism to blow off <b>retained</b> <b>waste</b> gases, absorb more oxygen, and, when voluntary, enable a return to normal instinctive breathing patterns by restoring oxygen to the breathing muscles themselves.|$|E

Two basic waste categories are those for which shallow disposal is accepted and those for which more extreme isolation is desired. The latter includes "high level" wastes and others contaminated with radionuclides with the unusual combined properties of long radioactive half-life and high specific radiotoxicity. The favored method for extreme isolation is emplacement in a deep stable geologic formation. Necessary technologies for waste treatment and disposal are considered available. The present program to implement these technologies is discussed, including the waste management significance of current policy on spent nuclear fuel reprocessing.

40|$|The {{freezing}} {{of ground}} for the containment of subsurface hazardous waste is a promising method that is environmentally friendly and offers a safe alternative to other methods of waste retention in many cases. The frozen soil method offers two concepts for <b>retaining</b> <b>waste.</b> One concept is to freeze the entire waste area into a solid block of frozen soil thus locking the waste in situ. For small areas where the contaminated soil does not include vessels that would rupture from frost action, this concept may be simpler to install.

40|$|Nuclear {{technology}} {{originally developed}} {{in only a}} few countries – arising out of weapons programmes. In the early years, the concept of nuclear fuel cycle centres was topical. In the 1950 s, the IAEA charter itself allowed centralized plutonium storage and management. Studies were performed (e. g. by INFCE) on regional nuclear fuel cycle centres and on international spent fuel management but did not come to fruition. Nevertheless, the fuel cycle was truly international during the 1960 s and 1970 s, with services such as uranium production and enrichment, fuel fabrication, reprocessing and reactor supply being carried out in a limited number of countries and sold to others. Even the back end of the cycle was to some extent internationalised, with the UK, France and Russia all <b>retaining</b> <b>wastes</b> produced by the reprocessing of foreign fuels. However, with time, further national nuclear capabilities were developed by countries looking for increased independence from the big suppliers, seeking commercial opportunities or seeking an independent nuclear weapons capability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{ability of}} hydrotalcites to <b>retain</b> anionic <b>wastes</b> was studied. In particular, Cr(VI) -adsorbed hydrotalcites were heated to {{immobilize}} Cr(VI) in the solid sample. When the heating temperature increased up to 500 ºC, the lamellar structure of hydrotalcite was lost. At high temperatures (1200 ºC), the solids were recrystallized {{in the form}} of a spinel. Lixiviation with 1 N and 5 N NaCl solutions were utilized to simulate the effect of sea water and of concentrated NaCl solutions in salt mines on the immobilization of Cr. Radiation damage on the solid containing the immobilized Cr was studied by g-irradiating with a 60 Co source at 1000 and 6000 kGy. The Cr-containing samples heated at 1200 ºC, whether irradiated or not, safely immobilized Cr in the hydrotalcite mainly {{in the form of}} MgCr 2 O 4 spinel. Irradiation of hydrotalcites revealed two different effects: (1) samples heated up to 1200 ºC evolved as a solid in which chromium was retained more firmly than in the non-irradiated material, irradiation enhancing the spinel formation; (2) the structure of samples heated at 1200 ºC developed a preferential crystallite orientation rather than a purely random one or new location of chromium ions, this effect did not affect Cr immobilization in the solid. Chromium lixiviation with 5 N NaCl solution was always less than the corresponding value with 1 N NaCl solution, probably due to the poor mobility of Cl ions in the highly concentrated NaCl solution...|$|R

Because moisture content is a key critical factor determining the safety of ferrocyanide-containing tank wastes, physical modeling was performed by Pacific Northwest National laboratory to evaluate the moisture-retaining behavior of typical tank wastes. The physical modeling reported here has quantified the mechanisms by which two main types of tank waste, sludge and saltcake, retain moisture in a tank profile under static conditions.

40|$|Wetlands {{are known}} to filter water from {{catchments}} by <b>retaining</b> solid <b>waste</b> and eroded sediments from catchment areas. They reduce the impact of flooding, speed of flow, and hence store water while releasing it slowly. The {{extent to which the}} wetlands perform this role has been investigated in two wetlands, Kinawataka with an industrial and heavily populated catchment, and Kisoma with subsistence agricultural catchment. Water samples were collected once a month from measurable streams entering the wetlands, along transects within the wetland and at the out flow. Parameters investigated included pH, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity, orthophosphates, total phosphorus, nitrates, total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand. Results showed that the urban Kinawataka wetland received a lot of pollution from its catchment and this was considerably reduced as the water moves through it to the out flow. Reductions of Total Nitrogen(TN) to about 50 % and Total Phosphorus (TP) to about 10 % were noted. The rural Kisoma wetland, however, received fewer nutrients from its catchment but releases more in its out flow. There were increases in orthophosphates to about 50 %, TP to 40 % and TN to 22 %. In situations where wetlands received large volumes of water especially after a heavy storm or during floods, their capacity to buffer becomes impaired; hence materials from the catchment would pass through them un-buffered. This paper discusses the performance of wetlands as buffering units for the reservoirs where the water is proceeding. It is suggested that wetland buffering depends on the amount of nutrients and water inflow from the catchment, the wetland-slope, nature of the vegetation, size of the wetland, catchment rainfall and anthropogenic characteristics. The conditions within the wetlands modify the nature of the nutrients as the water flows through them...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy must {{demonstrate}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) as a permanent repository for the disposal of transuranic (TRU) waste. Performance assessments of the WIPP require that estimates of the transportability and outcome of the radionuclides (actinides) be determined from disposal rooms that may become either partially or completely filled with brine. Federal regulations limit the amount of radioactivity that may be unintentionally released to the accessible environment by any mechanism during the post closure phase up to 10, 000 years. Thermodynamic models have been developed to predict the concentrations of actinides in the WIPP disposal rooms under various situations and chemical conditions. These models are based on empirical and theoretical projections of the chemistry that might be present in and around the disposal room zone for both near and long-term periods. The actinides that are known to be present in the TRU wastes (and are included in the model) are Th, U, Np, Pu, and Am. Knowledge of the chemistry that might occur in the disposal rooms when the waste comes in contact with brine is important in understanding the range of oxidation states that might be present under different conditions. There is a need to establish the mechanisms and resultant rate of transport, migration, or effective retardation of actinides beyond the disposal rooms to the boundary of the accessible environment. The influence of the bulk salt rock, clay sediments and other geologic matrices on the transport behavior of actinides must be determined to establish the overall performance and capability of the WIPP in isolating waste from the environment. Tests to determine the capabilities of the WIPP geologic formations in retarding actinide species in several projected oxidation states would provide a means to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} WIPP in <b>retaining</b> TRU <b>wastes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Role {{of sodium}} in hemodialysis. Sodium {{chloride}} {{is the most}} abundant salt in extracellular fluid. In normal individuals, the tonicity exerted by dissolved sodium chloride determines plasma osmolality and indirectly determines intracellular tonicity and cell volume. Uremic patients <b>retain</b> nitrogenous <b>wastes</b> and have an elevated plasma osmolality. While urea exhibits osmotic activity in serum, no sustained gradient can be established across cell boundaries because it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Thus, sodium remains the major indicator of body tonicity and determines the distribution of water across the intracellular–extracellular boundary, subsequent cell volume, thirst, and, among patients with renal insufficiency, systemic blood pressure. As a result of highly conserved plasma tonicity control systems, uremic subjects demonstrate remarkable stability of their serum sodium. Dialysate is a synthetic interstitial fluid capable of reconstituting extracellular fluid composition through urea extraction and extremely efficient solute and solvent (salt and water) transfer to the patient. Subtle transdialyzer gradients deliver and remove large quantities of trace elements, solvent, and solute to patients, creating a variety of dialysis “disequilibrium” syndromes manifest as cellular and systemic distress. Every dialysis patient uses dialysate, and the most abundant chemicals in dialysate are salt and water. Despite its universal use, no consensus on dialysate composition or tonicity exists. This can only be explained if we believe that dialysate composition is best determined by matching unique dialysis delivery system characteristics to specific patient requirements. Such a paradigm treats dialysate as a drug and the dialysis system as a delivery device. Understanding the therapeutic and toxic profiles of this drug (dialysate) and its delivery device (the dialyzer) is important to safe, effective, goal-directed modifications of therapy. This article explores some of the historical rationale behind choosing specific dialysate tonicities...|$|R

The AnOMBR utilizes a forward osmosis (FO) membrane to <b>retain</b> influent organic <b>waste,</b> which facilitates anaerobic wastewater treatment and energy recovery {{in the form of}} methane gas. The feasibility of AnOMBR for treating low-strength wastewater at mesophilic temperature was evaluated and membrane fouling was investigated. Permeate flux declined under the combined effects of both salt accumulation and membrane fouling. Although flux reduction was dominated by the effect of salt accumulation in the reactor, the presence of organic fouling and inorganic scaling could be clearly identified. Bulk pH could be maintained within neutral to slightly alkaline due to the retention of alkalinity by the FO membrane. The AnOMBR shows good and stable removal of soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) and nearly complete removal of total phosphorous. However, only partial removal of total nitrogen and ammonia was observed. The elevated salt environment appeared to have little effect on bioactivity of methanogens, and stable methane production of 0. 3 L/g sCOD digested was obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

Using data published in Biomedical Results from Skylab, researchers performed new calculations that reflect more directly the operations of the kidney in the handling of calcium, sodium, chloride, potassium and phosphate during space flight.

This represents a large absolute increase because the total filtered amount is huge. Because the tubular rejection fraction of other ions increased relatively less than that of calcium, researchers postulate the inflight development of a specific renal defect that causes an excessive loss of calcium in urine and thereby contributes to the weakening of bones...|$|R
