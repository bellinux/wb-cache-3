He told {{investigators}} he and Maura went car-shopping that afternoon and later went {{to dinner with}} a friend of Murray's. Murray dropped her father off at his motel room and, borrowing his Toyota Corolla, she returned to campus to attend a dorm party. She arrived at 10:30 pm. At 2:30 am on Sunday, February 8, she left the party. At 3:30 am, en route to her father's motel, she struck a guardrail on Route 9 in Hadley causing nearly $10,000 worth of damage to her father's car. The responding officer wrote an accident report but there is no documentation of sobriety field tests being conducted.

500|$|H-Hour for {{the landing}} at Gold {{was set at}} 07:25 on King sector (50 minutes later than in the American landings, because of {{differences}} in the tide). The first wave on King was the 5th East Yorkshires and 6th Green Howards of 69th Brigade, assisted by amphibious DD tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards. The 7th Green Howards landed at 08:20. The original plan called for the 38 DD tanks to be launched from their landing craft tank (LCTs) about [...] out. Due to extremely choppy seas, they decided to run the tanks directly onto the beach. Infantry, engineers, and DD tanks arrived almost simultaneously. Units disembarking onto the beach immediately came under fire from the casemated 88mm gun at La Rivière, and the infantry were forced to take cover behind the sea wall. The gun was taken out when a flail tank of the Westminster Dragoons fired a charge directly into its aperture. The 5th East Yorkshires, supported by several tanks, spent the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> clearing out the heavily fortified houses of La Rivière, {{at the loss of}} 90 men, including six officers.|$|E

[...] Lewis went on: [...] "The one aim Giono seems to have in mind, apart from <b>the</b> contriving <b>of</b> swift and lively episodes and <b>the</b> exact rendering <b>of</b> physical sensations, is to recapture something <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> Stendhal, especially <b>The</b> Charterhouse <b>of</b> Parma. ... <b>The</b> prose <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Straw Man likewise attempts <b>the</b> Stendhalian eruptions <b>of</b> ironic juxtaposition, and it indulges in the same nervous, playful italicizing.

500|$|<b>The</b> next <b>morning,</b> September 11, <b>the</b> 19th Infantry {{passed through}} the {{left-hand}} ROK regiment just south of Hill 131 and, with the 1st Battalion leading, attacked west. At 09:30 it captured without opposition the first hill mass [...] west of its starting point. The 2nd Battalion then {{passed through the}} 1st Battalion and continued the attack toward Hill 482 (Unje-san), [...] westward across a steep-sided gorge. There, North Koreans held entrenched positions, and their machine gun fire checked the 2nd Battalion for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. <b>The</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> September 12 four Australian pilots from No. 77 Squadron RAAF struck the North Korean positions with napalm, and an artillery preparation followed the strike. The 2nd Battalion then launched its attack and secured Hill 482 about 12:00. That afternoon, ROK forces relieved Task Force Davidson on the hill mass, and the task force descended to <b>the</b> valley southwest <b>of</b> Yongdok-tong for <b>the</b> night. On September 13, Task Force Davidson returned to Kyongju.|$|R
500|$|The {{remainder}} of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division around Cheux and Sainte Manvieu, was being relieved by the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. When the 5th Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, of the 214th Infantry Brigade, moved into the outskirts of Cheux, {{they found that the}} Scottish infantry had moved on and the vacant position had been reoccupied by grenadiers of 12th SS Panzer Division. After battling to recapture the position, at 0930 the battalion was counter-attacked by six Panthers of the 2nd Panzer Division. The attack penetrated Cheux and several British anti-tank guns were destroyed before it was beaten off. Further attacks by the 2nd Panzer Division were halted but the entire front was [...] "a mass of small engagements". For the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and afternoon, the Scottish infantry and the 4th and 29th Armoured brigades expanded the salient north of the Odon and secured the rear of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. During late evening the men of the 159th Infantry Brigade (11th Armoured Division) were transported in trucks through the narrow [...] "Scottish Corridor" [...] to Tourville, where they dismounted and crossed the Odon on foot to reinforce the bridgehead. During the night Kampfgruppe Weidinger, a 2,500-strong battle group from the 2nd SS Panzer Division arrived at the front and was placed under the command of the Panzer Lehr Division.|$|E
2500|$|Pancho Villa {{arrived at}} Ciudad Juarez {{on the night}} of June 14, 1919. He first {{concentrated}} his forces in an attack on Fort Hidalgo at 12:10 am on June 15, but was repulsed after a 50-minute battle. Gen. Martin Lopez, Villa's godson, led the attack because Villa was sick at the time. At about 1:10 am Lopez attacked the city itself. The cavalry charged ahead of the infantry and advanced in a way so that no bullets were crossing the border into El Paso. At first the Villistas seemed to be making progress—they cut through barbed wire entanglements with wire cutters smuggled in from the US and routed a line of Carrancista infantry. Then, as Lopez proceeded into the city streets, the advance began to slow. For the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and throughout day the two sides fought a bloody close-quarters engagement. Gen. Gonzalez was held up in the Municipal Palace and observing the battle from the rooftop. As his lines crumbled he asked his assistant, Col. Escobar, why his forces were not holding. Escobar told him it was because the [...] "Villistas were attacking like rabid dogs." [...] Escobar also advised that Gonzales withdraw his forces into the nearby fortress, or else be overrun. Gonzalez agreed with Escobar so the order was given to retreat and the Villistas took complete control of the city. When he got to the fort, Gonzalez used the telephone to contact the American garrison across the river and request aid. Though the Americans had already begun assembling infantry, cavalry and artillery from Fort Bliss, they had not yet received orders.|$|E

60|$|What a {{different}} Sunday <b>morning</b> from <b>the</b> old Sunday <b>morning</b> at Yarmouth! In due time I heard the church-bells ringing, as I plodded on; and I met {{people who were}} going to church; and I passed a church or two where the congregation were inside, and <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> singing came out into the sunshine, while the beadle sat and cooled himself in <b>the</b> shade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porch, or stood beneath the yew-tree, with his hand to his forehead, glowering at me going by. But <b>the</b> peace and <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Sunday <b>morning</b> were on everything, except me. That was the difference. I felt quite wicked in my dirt and dust, with my tangled hair. But for the quiet picture I had conjured up, of my mother in her youth and beauty, weeping by the fire, and my aunt relenting to her, I hardly think I should have had the courage to go on until next day.

2500|$|German {{preparations}} {{to resume}} the attack on 24 August were complete by [...] and the super-heavy artillery resumed <b>the</b> bombardment <b>of</b> forts Emine and Suarlée. Troops in the town repaired the bridges over the Meuse and Sambre. Fort Maizeret had fallen the day before to the 22nd Division and Gallwitz ordered the 38th Division to advance into the broken country to <b>the</b> south-west <b>of</b> Namur, to attack forts Malonne and St. Héribert. The 3rd Guard Division was to take <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town and the 1st Guard Reserve Division was to guard the artillery positions north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Meuse, as forts Emines and Suarlée were bombarded. The 14th Reserve Division was to prevent a breakout to the west or south-west and the 22nd Division was to take forts Andoy and Dave, then advance to the Meuse. The 3rd Guard Division took <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Namur during <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> fort Andoy.

Her solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy's books lay scattered about. Nothing was neat and pleasant but 'Marmee's corner', which looked as usual. And there Meg sat, to 'rest and read', which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary. Jo spent <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> on <b>the</b> river with Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The Wide, Wide World, up in the apple tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her music, rejoicing {{that she had no}} dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was. As no one appeared but an inquisitive daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{incidence}} <b>of</b> cardiovascular {{events is}} {{significantly higher in}} <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> than other times of day. This has previously been associated with poor blood pressure control via the cardiac baroreflex. However, {{it is not known}} whether diurnal variation exists in vascular sympathetic baroreflex function, in which blood pressure is regulated via muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was to compare vascular sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in the same participants between <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and afternoon. In 10 participants (mean age 22 ± 2. 9 yrs), continuous measurements of blood pressure, heart rate and MSNA were made during 10 minutes <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> (between 9 : 00 and 10 : 00 am) and afternoon (between 2 : 00 and 3 : 00 pm). Spontaneous vascular sympathetic BRS was quantified by plotting MSNA burst incidence against diastolic pressure (vascular sympathetic BRSinc), and by plotting total MSNA against diastolic pressure (vascular sympathetic BRStotal). Significant vascular sympathetic BRSinc and vascular sympathetic BRStotal slopes were obtained for 10 participants at both times of day. There {{was no significant difference in}} vascular sympathetic BRSinc between morning (- 2. 2 ± 0. 6 %bursts/mmHg) and afternoon (- 2. 5 ± 0. 2 %bursts/mmHg; P= 0. 68) sessions. Similarly, vascular sympathetic BRStotal did not differ significantly between <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> (- 3. 0 ± 0. 5 AU/beat/mmHg) and afternoon (- 2. 9 ± 0. 4 AU/beat/mmHg; P= 0. 89). It is concluded that in healthy, young individuals baroreflex modulation <b>of</b> MSNA at <b>rest</b> does not differ between <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and afternoon. <b>The</b> results indicate that recording MSNA at different times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day is a valid means of assessing sympathetic function...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{pre-production}} began, Don Dokken {{proposed as}} producer his German friend Michael Wagener, whose curriculum included works with Accept, Raven, Great White {{and the production}} and engineering <b>of</b> Breaking <b>the</b> Chains. [...] Predictably, Wagener's friendship with Dokken and Lynch's dissatisfaction for <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> their debut album brought to <b>the</b> rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singer's proposal by <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band. Elektra Records selected instead the expert Tom Werman to produce the album; his accomplishments {{in the music business}} included multi-platinum albums with Cheap Trick, Molly Hatchet, Ted Nugent and <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> rising stars Mötley Crüe's second album Shout at the Devil. Werman was present at rehearsals and helped to select and arrange the songs before production began. <b>The</b> recording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album started in Spring 1984 at Cherokee Studios in Hollywood, California with veteran sound engineer Geoff Workman, whose personality and erratic behaviour did not mesh easily with Werman's direction. This troubled relationship only added up to <b>the</b> escalating clash <b>of</b> egos between Lynch and Dokken, which was furtherly exacerbated by <b>the</b> abuse <b>of</b> cocaine and alcohol by musicians and technicians. Werman set the working schedule to avoid <b>the</b> contemporary presence <b>of</b> guitarist and vocalist in the studio, with the former recording with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band late <b>morning</b> and in <b>the</b> afternoon and the latter at night. [...] This arrangement was maintained for all <b>the</b> permanence <b>of</b> George Lynch in the band, as he and Dokken never worked together in a recording studio. After a few weeks <b>of</b> work, <b>the</b> situation exploded when Lynch violently rejected Werman's advice for some of his guitar solos and refused to work again with the producer. Werman quit and left for a summer vacation with his family, bringing Don Dokken to request again <b>the</b> hiring <b>of</b> Michael Wagener to complete the recordings and mixing the tracks. Despite Werman and Burnstein's agreement on Wagener's involvement, [...] <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band continued to refuse him, jeopardizing <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album.|$|R
