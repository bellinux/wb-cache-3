40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{techniques}} for estimating the amount of weathering a clast has undergone. These usually have the objective of establishing an ordinal chronology of geomorphological surfaces, or investigation of site-specific conditions affecting weathering rates. Three such techniques are applied to a dated sequence of alluvial fan segments in southern Tunisia. Two of these techniques depend on measuring surface <b>roughness</b> (the micro-roughness <b>meter</b> and a displacement approach) and one uses the structural weakening of the rock fabric (Schmidt hammer). The micro-roughness meter enables calculation of standard deviation of surface height variation, root mean square roughness and surface autocorrelation function. Of these techniques, Schmidt hammer rebound values, standard deviation, root mean square roughness and the displacement technique show systematic changes on the three fan segments which are statistically significant at the 0. 05 level. However, the amount of variance in all datasets is very large, indicating the need for caution in application of these techniques for relative dating. 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Surface {{roughness}} at the centimetre and millimetre {{scale is}} an important factor governing radar backscatter, {{especially in the case of}} warm (>- 5 T) o r highly saline sea ice types. Quantitative measurements of surface roughness are required as input to backscatter models. Several field techniques have been used to quantitatively measure the surface roughness of sea ice. These techniques usually possess at least one of the following obstacles: difficult field operation, expense, poor accuracies or arduous data processing. A prototype portable field instrument called the Surface <b>Roughness</b> <b>Meter</b> has been designed to measure micro-scale surface roughness. The instrument provides measurements of two surface roughness parameters, root mean square height and correlation length. The instrument consists of a 35 mm camera and a flash mounted on a platform. The system illuminates and photographs a rectangle of known size on the surface from a fixed height. The negatives are digitized and the root mean square height and correlation length are calculated and recorded using a PC-based image analysis system in the laboratory. The first sea ice application for the instrument was the Labrador Ice Margin Experiment (LIMEX) 1989. The instrument was used to measure surface roughness of first-year deformed pack ice. The resulting data from LIMEX ’ 89 were digitized and surface roughness statistics were computed using a PC image analysis system. LIMEX ’ 89 Surface <b>Roughness</b> <b>Meter</b> data compared favourably to roughness statistics obtained from LIMEX ’ 87.

40|$|Polymers and ceramic {{materials}} {{are used as}} substrates in the fabrication of electroless copper plated components for electronic devices. These substrates must be pretreated prior to electroplating to facilitate good adhesion between the substrate and the metal coating. There {{are a variety of}} established pre-treatment methods. Most of the industrial methods utilize hazardous chemistry (toxic acids), require long process times, use large amounts of waste water to remove chemicals, and require high temperatures. The aim of this project was to investigate the ability of power ultrasound to pre-treat these materials by utilizing non-hazardous chemistry, lower temperatures and short process times. In this project four different substrates were investigated; Epoxy resin, ABS, Noryl and Ceramic. The materials were treated with ultrasound under four different conditions (40 °C, 0 °C, freezing before pre-treatment, and the addition of solvent to the bath). The changes on the surfaces were monitored with several analysis techniques including: Weight loss, Contact angle measurement, <b>Roughness</b> measurement, Gloss <b>meter</b> determination, SEM surface analysis and adhesion testing. The optimum power setting for the epoxy material was found to be between 50 W and 80 W. In addition the most effective surface modification conditions for the Epoxy material was found to be achieved by lowering the temperature to 0 °C during the sonication processes and utilizing a power setting of 50 W. The most effective parameter to employ to surface-modify ABS material was found to be utilizing 5 % gamma-caprolactone solution with a power setting of 50 W at 0 °C. The most effective parameters to employ to surface modify Noryl material was found to be by utilizing 5 % ethylene glycol solution with a power setting of 50 W at 0 °C. Of the four tested materials, the ceramic material was least effected by sonication. The best results for this material were obtained with the frozen samples which were then treated with 50 W power at 0 °C. Solvents results did not shown significant results as those obtained with frozen samples. The project determined that each material required very specific pre-treatment parameters and demonstrated that surface modification could be achieved at lower temperatures, with far fewer chemicals, and a possibly safer, more economical process than the conventional industrial techniques...|$|R
40|$|Engineering design {{considerations}} of artificial coastal structures were tested to resemble {{as far as}} possible the nearest natural equivalent habitat, ecologically valuable rocky shores, as a potential management option. Coastal areas around the world attract urbanisation but these transitional areas between sea and land are inherently vulnerable to risk of flooding and erosion. Thus hard structures are often built in sensitive coastal environments to defend assets such as property and infrastructure (roads, railways, ports) against rising and stormy seas. The design, construction and maintenance of hard defences should wherever possible incorporate ecological considerations to enhance biodiversity, including maintaining or restoring natural habitats and wild species to ensure favourable conservation status. Artificial habitats are less topographically complex than natural rocky shores, at millimetre scales in terms of surface <b>roughness,</b> centimetre to <b>meter</b> scales for crevices and pools to tens, hundreds and occasionally thousands of meters for variation in tidal height and wave action gradients. The habitat value of design features of an existing seawall and breakwater, such as areas of different slope and orientation, and the presence of crevices and pools, that are analogous to habitat created by topographical features on a natural shore, were demonstrated by their ability to support distinct assemblages of species. X Furthermore, evidence is provided that a greater variation in the type of design features led to a higher species diversity occupying the structure, and included species that would otherwise not be present on the structure. The long term succession on artificial structures and the biodiversity reached on intertidal coastal defence structures is described to inform understanding of timescales over which successional processes operate. As a consequence of succession, artificial structures of large extent eventually resemble natural rocky shores of the same exposure. Increased surface heterogeneity of concrete armour units on Plymouth Breakwater by drilling holes was effective in adding habitat and increasing local species diversity. These can be added at the construction stage or post construction. In a real case study, added recessed pools, holes and surface texture during the construction of a tidal defence sea wall at Shaldon made heterogeneous surfaces to add habitat and influence species diversity, without compromising the engineering function or aesthetics of the structure. This study provides coastal engineers and decision makers with well researched practical design options to inform future construction and maintenance of coastal defence structures that will encourage specific outcomes to mitigate the negative environmental impact of artificial structures and contribute to conservation priorities...|$|R

All specimens were subjected to bleaching procedure with 35 % hydrogen peroxide (two 45 -min applications, with a 5 -day interval). The surface roughness of all specimens was evaluated {{before and after the}} bleaching and/or finishing/polishing (Ra parameter) by a <b>roughness</b> <b>meter.</b> After bleaching, the groups were subjected to finishing and polishing procedures: G 2 and G 5 - felt discs + diamond pastes; and G 3 and G 6 - silicon rubber tips.

A glazed group (GLGR) of each ceramic material served as reference. One-hundred and twenty specimens of VITABLOCS Mark II (VITA) and 120 specimens of IPS Empress CAD (IPS) were roughened in a standardized manner. Twenty VITA and 20 IPS specimens were glazed (VITA Akzent Glaze/Empress Universal Glaze). Five polishing methods were investigated (n= 20 /group) : 1) EVE Diacera W 11 DC-Set (EVE), 2) JOTA 9812 -Set (JOTA), 3) OptraFine-System (OFI), 4) Sof-Lex 2382 discs (SOF) and 5) Brownie/Greenie/Occlubrush (BGO). Polishing quality was measured with a surface <b>roughness</b> <b>meter</b> (Ra and Rz values). The significance level was set at alpha= 0. 05. Kruskal Wallis tests and pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum tests with Bonferroni-Holm adjustment were used. Qualitative surface evaluation of representative specimens was done with SEM. On VITA ceramics, SOF produced lower Ra (p< 0. 00001) but higher Rz values than GLGR (p= 0. 003); EVE, JOTA, OFI and BGO yielded significantly higher Ra and Rz values than GLGR. On IPS ceramics, SOF and JOTA exhibited lower Ra values than GLGR (p< 0. 0001). Equivalent Ra but significantly higher Rz values occurred between GLGR and EVE, OFI or BGO. VITA and IPS exhibited the smoothest surfaces when polished with SOF. Nevertheless, ceramic polishing systems are still of interest to clinicians using CAD/CAM, as these methods are universally applicable and showed an increased durability compared to the investigated silicon polishers...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of the position of the mold during the setting stage of type IV stone plaster Durone (Dentsply Ind. Com., Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), on the following properties: surface hardness and roughness. Methods: For the roughness test, two groups (n= 6) in the form of pellets were prepared. In the first group, the surface of the base of the device was turned down during the plaster setting stage (N), in the second group this position was inverted, which has been described as an act of capsize it (E). For analysis, a <b>roughness</b> <b>meter</b> with reading precision of 0. 01 μm was used. With regard to the hardness analysis, two groups with conical-shaped samples were obtained. The plasters were left to set under the same conditions of the mold/model position described for the previous experiment. Hardness measurement was performed in a durometer with a spherical penetrating tip for Rockwell readout. Three measurements were performed for each test specimen in both tests. Results: The hardness (N - 39. 8, standard deviation = 3. 3, E - 30. 8, standard deviation = 5. 6) and roughness data (N - 0. 67, standard deviation = 0. 17, E - 0. 74, standard deviation = 0. 13) submitted to the Student’s-t test (5 %) showed no statistically significant differences for the roughness test (0. 489), but showed statistically significant differences for the hardness test (0. 014). Conclusion: The variation in the mold/model position influenced the final characteristics of the specimens in terms of hardness, since those obtained with the capsize technique showed lower surface hardness, whereas for roughness these differences were not statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of {{bleaching}} agents (10 % and 16 % carbamide peroxide) on the roughness of two dental ceramics in vitro, and to analyze the surface by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Two bleaching agents (10 % and 16 %/Whiteness, FGM Gel) and two microparticle feldspathic ceramics (Vita VM 7 and Vita VM 13) were used. Forty disks of Vita VM 7 and Vita VM 13 ceramic were manufactured, measuring 4 mm in diameter and 4 mm high, in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations, and were divided into 4 groups (n = 10) : (1) VM 7 + Whiteness 10 %; (2) VM 7 + Whiteness 16 %; (3) VM 13 + Whiteness 10 %; (4) VM 13 + Whiteness 16 %. The bleaching agent was applied for 8 hours a day for 15 days and during the intervals the test specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C. The roughness (Ra) of the test specimens was evaluated before and after exposure to the bleaching agents using a laser <b>roughness</b> <b>meter</b> and the topographic description was analyzed by SEM. The statistical analysis of roughness data showed significant differences in the VM 7 groups, using paired t-test, p = 0. 05 (VM 7 + Whiteness 10 %: p = 0. 002; VM 7 + Whiteness 16 %: p = 0. 001) and two-sample t-test (VM 7 p = 0. 047), and no significant difference was found among VM 13 groups. The qualitative SEM analysis showed different degrees of surface changes. The results suggest that the roughness of the tested ceramic surfaces increased after exposure to the bleaching agents...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of surface roughness on surface hardness (Vickers; VHN), elastic modulus (EM), and flexural strength (FLS) of two computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) ceramic materials. One hundred sixty-two samples of VITABLOCS Mark II (VMII) and 162 samples of IPS Empress CAD (IPS) were ground according to six standardized protocols producing decreasing surface roughnesses (n= 27 /group) : grinding with 1) silicon carbide (SiC) paper # 80, 2) SiC paper # 120, 3) SiC paper # 220, 4) SiC paper # 320, 5) SiC paper # 500, and 6) SiC paper # 1000. Surface roughness (Ra/Rz) was measured with a surface <b>roughness</b> <b>meter,</b> VHN and EM with a hardness indentation device, and FLS with a three-point bending test. To test for a correlation between surface roughness (Ra/Rz) and VHN, EM, or FLS, Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated. The decrease in surface roughness led to an increase in VHN from (VMII/IPS; medians) 263. 7 / 256. 5 VHN to 646. 8 / 601. 5 VHN, an increase in EM from 45. 4 / 41. 0 GPa to 66. 8 / 58. 4 GPa, and an increase in FLS from 49. 5 / 44. 3 MPa to 73. 0 / 97. 2 MPa. For both ceramic materials, Spearman rank correlation coefficients showed a strong negative correlation between surface roughness (Ra/Rz) and VHN or EM and a moderate negative correlation between Ra/Rz and FLS. In conclusion, a decrease in surface roughness generally improved the mechanical properties of the CAD/CAM ceramic materials tested. However, FLS was less influenced by surface roughness than expected...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{analyzing}} the compomers wear by an "in vitro" toothbrushing abrasion test. The null hypotheses tested were {{that there would}} be no differences in weight loss and no significant changes in surface roughness of the compomers after this test. The utilized commercial brands were Dyract (Dentsply), Dyract AP (Dentsply), Compoglass F (Vivadent), Freedom (SDI), F 2000 (3 M ESPE), which were compared to the two resin composites Z 100 (3 M ESPE) and Silux Plus (3 M ESPE). Ten cylindrical specimens for each commercial brand were prepared with 5 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness. An appropriate machine with soft bristle tips containing dentifrice solution and deionized water was used. A total of 100, 000 brushing cycles were performed. The amount of weight loss was measured by the percentage alteration between the initial (before toothbrushing) and final weight (after toothbrushing), measured by a Sartorius analytical balance. The surface roughness change was determined by the percentage difference between initial and final means after 5 tracings by a T 1000 Hommel Tester <b>roughness</b> <b>meter</b> on the specimen's surfaces before and after toothbrushing abrasion test. The statistical analysis (Students paired t-test, ANOVA and Tukey, á= 0. 05) showed that all materials presented statistically significant weight loss and roughness increase after abrasion test. All compomers presented higher weight loss than resin composites. Freedom and Dyract AP presented the lowest weight loss among compomers. F 2000 presented the worst abrasion resistance, without statistical differences with Dyract. For roughness changes, Dyract, Dyract AP, Z 100, Compoglass F and Silux Plus showed the lowest surface roughness alteration, in increasing order, without statistical differences between them. Freedom was the statistically roughest material of the study...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{the quality}} of the Indonesian {{national}} road network is inadequate due to several constraints, including overcapacity and overloaded trucks. The high deterioration rate of the road infrastructure in developing countries along with major budgetary restrictions and high growth in traffic have led to an emerging need for improving the performance of the highway maintenance system. However, the high number of intervening factors and their complex effects require advanced tools to successfully solve this problem. The high learning capabilities of Data Mining (DM) are a powerful solution to this problem. In the past, these tools have been successfully applied to solve complex and multi-dimensional problems in various scientific fields. Therefore, it is expected that DM can be used to analyze the large amount of data regarding the pavement and traffic, identify the relationship between variables, and provide information regarding the prediction of the data. In this paper, we present a new approach to predict the International Roughness Index (IRI) of pavement based on DM techniques. DM was used to analyze the initial IRI data, including age, Equivalent Single Axle Load (ESAL), crack, potholes, rutting, and long cracks. This model was developed and verified using data from an Integrated Indonesia Road Management System (IIRMS) that was measured with the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities (NAASRA) <b>roughness</b> <b>meter.</b> The results of the proposed approach are compared with the IIRMS analytical model adapted to the IRI, and the advantages of the new approach are highlighted. We show that the novel data-driven model is able to learn (with high accuracy) the complex relationships between the IRI and the contributing factors of overloaded trucksFundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT) We acknowledge the Directorate of Planning, DGH-Indonesia for providing the data for this research, and the Centre for Territory, Environment, and Construction and the Centre Algorithmic, University of Minho, Guimarães, Portugal for assistance in the research study...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{evaluated}} the surface {{quality of a}} new low-shrinking experimental resin restorative material after polishing with seven different techniques. METHODS: The composite resin {{used in this study}} was the experimental material, Hermes (3 M/ESPE). Seventy standardised specimens were prepared using a perspex mould. All samples were stored in distilled water for 10 days. Samples were randomly divided into 7 groups (n= 10). Thereafter, the average roughness of one side of each specimen (formed against the matrix) was recorded using a surface <b>roughness</b> <b>meter</b> (Surftest SJ 301) (control). The other side of each specimen was roughened with 320 grit silicone-carbide paper in a polishing machine for 45 seconds. The finishing/polishing of specimens was performed following the five different protocols according to the manufacturer’s instructions: (1) Enhance polishing cones (E), (2) Enhance followed by POGO (EPG), (3) Jiffy Polishing Cups (J), (4) consecutive use of four flexible Sof-Lex discs (S), (5) consecutive use of four flexible Sof-Lex discs followed by Sof-Lex brush(SB), (6) consecutive use of three flexible OpenDiscs (O), and (7) consecutive use of three flexible OpenDiscs followed by Openshine brushes (OB). The mean roughness of each polished surfaces was determined using the surface profilometer, collecting 5 measurements from each specimen. Data was analyzed statistically (ANOVA). Results: The mean average roughness (Ra) values obtained for specimens in Groups 2 - 8 that were treated with one of the polishing systems ranged from 0. 63 – 1. 21 μm. ANOVA analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference between Enhance (roughest) compared to all the other groups (P < 0. 001). There were no statistical significant differences (p< 0. 001) between Groups 3 (Enhance and POGO 2), 4 (Jiffy Polishing Cups), 5 (Sof-Lex), 6 (Sof-Lex and Sof-Lex Brushes), 7 (OpenDiscs) and 8 (OpenDiscs and OpenShine Brushes). Clinical Significance: All the polishing techniques evaluated in this study, {{with the possible exception of}} Enhance Points, can be utilised to produce a smooth surface on Hermes composite resin material. The material Hermes can be polished to a high gloss and excellent smoothness, and will be acceptable for usage in the mouth...|$|E
40|$|It was {{recently}} demonstrated that, infiltration into mountain-tilled soils with highly stable microaggregates, increases with increasing slope gradient. In this work we investigate {{the processes that}} underpin this phenomenon by means of field experiments and modelling. The study area is located in northern Laos. Rainfall simulations were conducted in two 1 -m 2 plots using a portable field simulator. The drop size distribution and kinetic energy were similar to that occurring {{on the occasion of}} tropical downpours. Soils exhibited a clay loam texture and very similar organic matter contents across experimental plots, but differed greatly in slope gradient (30 % and 75 %). Runoff water samples were collected at intervals ranging from 1 to 3 min, depending on the runoff intensity. Plots microtopography was measured before and after rainfall simulations using an automatic surface <b>roughness</b> <b>meter</b> on a 1 -cm grid. High-resolution bulk density images were obtained from soil slices using a standard X-ray generator. Final infiltration rates of 6 and 21 mm h− 1; soil detachment of 667 and 310 g m− 2; surface lowering due to soil loss of 0. 82 and 0. 38 mm; surface lowering due to compaction of 1. 21 and 0. 90 mm; percentage area with sieving crust of 36 % and 90 %; percentage area with erosion crust of 63 % and 0 %; were obtained for the 30 % and 75 % slopes, respectively. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this work: (1) high intensity rainfall can rapidly transform soil surface features of steep bare soil; (2) on steeper slopes, the micro-relief tends to form micro-terraces much more pervious and less erodible than the ripple-like roughness that formed on gentler slopes; and (3) there was a more pronounced lowering of the soil surface due to compaction and denser microlayers on gentler slopes. The latter conclusion confirms the hypothesis that higher effective rainfall intensity is responsible for the formation of less permeable erosion crusts under 30 % slope gradients while more permeable structural crusts develop under 75 % slope gradients. The runoff results were modelled with the Green and Ampt model which accounts for time evolution of soil hydraulic conductivity. This modelling shows that soil is undoubtedly non homogeneous, evolves with time and that infiltration kinetics is slower and soil permeability greater for the 75 % slope...|$|E
