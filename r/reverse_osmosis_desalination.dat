25|$|Drinking {{water is}} often {{collected}} at springs, extracted from artificial borings (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places {{is thus a}} possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful microbes. Popular methods are filtering with sand which only removes undissolved material, while chlorination and boiling kill harmful microbes. Distillation does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis.</b> <b>Desalination</b> of abundant seawater is a more expensive solution used in coastal arid climates.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{the first}} <b>reverse</b> <b>osmosis</b> <b>desalination</b> plant in Israel opened in Eilat. In 2002, under {{the impact of}} drought, the Government {{approved}} the construction of large seawater desalination plants along the Mediterranean coast. These installations would supply 305 million m3/yr of desalinated water by the year 2010 and 500 million m³/yr by 2015. By mid-2008 two of the new plants with a capacity of 130 million m3/yr were in operation. In parallel to the desalination program the cabinet also decided to promote water savings activities that could reduce household water use by at least 10 percent. In 2012, the Ashkelon Desalination Plant was converting 15,000 to 16,000 cubic meters of seawater to fresh water every hour, supplying 15 percent of Israel's annual water supply.|$|E
