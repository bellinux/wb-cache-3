40|$|Traditionally, {{the design}} {{coordination}} process {{is carried out}} by overlaying and comparing 2 D drawings made by different project participants. Detecting information errors from a composite drawing is especially challenging and error prone. This procedure usually leaves many design errors undetected until construction begins, and typically lead to rework. Correcting conflict issues, which were not identified during design and coordination phase, reduces the overall productivity for everyone involved in the construction process. The identification of construction issues in the field generate <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Information</b> (<b>RFIs)</b> {{that is one of}} delays causes. The application of Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) tools to the coordination processes can bring significant value to architecture, structure, and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) designs in terms of a reduced number of errors undetected and <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>information.</b> This paper is focused on evaluating <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> (<b>RFI)</b> associated with water/sanitary facilities of a BIM model.

This study adopts RFI’s classification in six analyzed categories: correction, omission, validation of information, modification, divergence of information and verification. The results demonstrate VDC’s contribution improving the plumbing system designs.

25|$|One of {{the driving}} {{requirements}} for the new trainer will be to help prepare pilots for the increased complexity in some areas, particularly information management, that {{are a part of}} fifth generation jet fighters like the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II. The Air Force first viewed this as unnecessary and costly, but industry analysis showed it to be cheaper in the long run. The aircraft and simulation system will have to fulfill several basic training roles; basic aircraft control, airmanship, formation, instrument and navigation, advanced air-to-air, advanced air-to-ground, and advanced crew/cockpit resource management. Furthermore, there are five advanced training roles that the system is expected to fulfill; sustained high-G operations at 6.5–7.5g, aerial refueling, night vision imaging systems operations, air-to-air intercepts, and data-link operations. The 2009 <b>Request</b> <b>For</b> <b>Information</b> (<b>RFI)</b> mentions that some tasks, such as aerial refueling, may be performed in the simulator and not on the aircraft itself. Aircraft availability is to be 80%, but not higher, as that would drive cost too high. Program requirements focus on life-cycle costs rather than just purchase price.|$|E

On 12 May 1994, the US Government authorized the purchase of up to 25 F-15Is by Israel. In November 1995, Israel ordered four extra F-15Is, thus 25 were built from 1996 to 1998. The aircraft can carry: the AIM-9L, Rafael Python 4 and the Rafael Python 5 infrared-homing missiles; and the AIM-7 Sparrow and the AIM-120 AMRAAM radar-guided missiles.

In addition, the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) is entering a phase of design and construction of large border bridges, such as the I- 80 (let 2008 for $ 56 million) and US 34 bridges over the Missouri River and I- 74 over the Mississippi River. Compared to typical {{construction projects}}, these bridges generate more contractor <b>Requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>Information</b> (<b>RFIs),</b> Value Engineering (VE) proposals, <b>Requests</b> <b>for</b> Changes (RFCs), and shop drawings. Management of these submittals is a significant challenge for Resident Construction Engineers (RCEs) and other Iowa DOT staff. In addition, some submittals require cross-departmental and project consultant reviews. Commercially available software exists for managing submittals and project collaboration teams; in-house solutions may also be possible. Implementation is intended to speed construction submittal review time, reduce incidence of delay claims, and free up Iowa DOT staff from project management administrative tasks. Researchers from Iowa State University working with the Iowa DOT conducted a multi-pronged approach to indentify a web-based collaboration solution for Iowa DOT bridge projects.

40|$|This thesis {{extends the}} {{research}} into the influence of information and communications technology on relationship management by specifically exploring the use and influence of an online collaboration tool (OCT). An OCT is the web-based <b>information</b> infrastructure used <b>for</b> coordinating project activities, and the major market segment for OCTs is the construction sector. Following a literature review, a conceptual framework was developed to analyse the influence of an OCT on dispute resolution in the inter-organisational network of a construction supply chain, to answer the over-arching research question:  How do online collaboration tools influence relationships in inter-organisational networks? The research questions were explored using a case study approach by interviewing members of two construction supply-chains that used an OCT. Nine case studies were conducted, where a case’s unit of analysis is a project manager from the builder or consultants; four and five project managers, respectively, were interviewed from each project. The major contribution is the simplified trust-reputation model that relates attributional trust and issue resolution to corporate reputation. In effect, individuals on the project are very forgiving of supply chain members with regard to issues because of concern for their company’s reputation. Hence, while trust may vary, there was no breakdown in trust because this would affect their company’s reputation as a good partner. Furthermore, {{although there was a}} reported variance in trust by the project managers, it did not affect the project’s outcome, but it did affect the ease of doing business. With regard to managerial implications, {{there is a possibility that}} the introduction of an OCT may induce a behavioural change in the builders to issue a greater number of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> (<b>RFIs)</b> to get issues on the record. Hence, this change needs to be managed upfront at a kick-off meeting at which it should be agreed what constitutes a RFI that needs to be issued using the OCT.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{is fraught with}} waste and inefficiencies resulting in projects often failing to meet owners? expectations. Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is the newest project delivery system and changes the traditional roles and relationships of key project stakeholders. Through increased early collaboration IPD attempts to eliminate waste and deliver the highest value projects to owners. It {{is seen as a}} potential solution to many of the challenges impeding successful project performance. However, a transformational change towards IPD has yet to reach a ?tipping point? and its use is not prevalent throughout the {{construction industry}}. Little research has been done to quantitatively analyze IPD compared to the more commonly used delivery methods. Through substantial collection of quantitative project performance data and univariate statistical analysis, this study fills the gap in research by evaluating the effects of IPD on building construction projects across a wide range of performance metrics from the perspective of general contractors and construction managers. This research demonstrated that IPD/IPD-ish outperformed Non-IPD projects with respect to performance in communication, change management, and business performance areas. Evidence of superior communication performance was found {{in terms of the number}} of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> (<b>RFIs)</b> per million dollars; change management in terms of change order processing time; and business performance in terms of a project?s impact on company image and the potential for return business. A new term called the Project Quarterback Rating (PQR) that combines key performance metrics was used to quantitatively evaluate overall performance. Statistically significant evidence of overall superior IPD/IPD-ish performance was found compared to Non-IPD projects. This research also evaluated other project attributes and found evidence suggesting that higher overall performance was related to implementation of Lean construction techniques, a more engaged and empowered project leadership team, a higher level of stakeholder involvement throughout a project, and inclusion of an incentive clause in a construction contract. The results should encourage owners to consider the use of IPD, or the utilization of IPD principles in conjunction with other delivery methods, in future capital facilities endeavors...|$|R
40|$|The {{documentation}} of complete and timely as-built {{information related to}} construction projects is essential for tracking progress, planning corrective action, and analyzing the schedule. The collection of site information, however, is currently a challenging, time-consuming, and error-prone manual process. To improve the tracking of as-built information, this research focused {{on the development of}} a low-cost voice-visual framework that utilizes commonly available communication tools such as email and interactive voice response (IVR). The goal of this research was to create project-wide bidirectional communication between site personnel and head office to automate the tracking of daily site information. The research involved an in-depth analysis of the possible site events and progress-tracking needs related to construction activities. Accordingly, activity-specific email forms and logical-flow diagrams were developed as a means of facilitating site data collection. A framework was then developed that integrates several components: the developed tracking forms; a cloud-based IVR service; a customized scheduling application; and an email application. During construction, the automated system identifies eligible activities to be tracked; collects as-built details from the relevant supervisors; and uses the daily time segments of the schedule as an integrated depository for all as-built details, including progress information, events by all parties, and <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> (<b>RFIs),</b> quality/safety issues, and other video/audio/drawing-markup notes. The developed system generates detailed as-built schedule that clearly show the evolution of all as-built events and their accurate timing on the daily segments for each activity. The project schedule is thus converted from a static report into information-rich, visualization media, and decision-support tool that provides decision makers with timely progress details so that they can easily follow the project progress, facilitates schedule updates, facilitates accurate schedule forensics, delay analysis,, and the planning of appropriate corrective action. The developed framework was validated though a number of case studies that demonstrated its usefulness and practicality. This research contributes to construction efficiency through the facilitation of bidirectional communication between site personnel and head office and the provision of timely and legible as-built data for decision-making. Ultimately, the research will assist construction firms to have better control over construction projects and more effective decisions during construction through improved communication...|$|R

This is especially true when answering to <b>Requests</b> <b>For</b> <b>Information</b> (<b>RFI)</b> based on preliminary design investigations of first level. In order to reduce the time needed to perform these costly operations while improving the performances achieved, Snecma wishes to develop tools for dimensioning the engine and also for assessing key parameters such as mass, emissions, fuel burn, costs, etc. Unfortunately, the set of tools and the process used at the present time for preliminary design investigations of first level are not sufficient to meet the high standards sought-after by the company in terms of time and performances. As a consequence, efforts must be spent on redefining the whole process and the tools it is based on; here is the mission that has been conferred upon me.   Multiple exchanges with performances engineers and specialists allowed to draw the current process for preliminary design investigations of first level and raise all the associated concerns. At the same time, a status of the existing tools (called modules in this report), mainly developed under Excel, has been realised in order to identify the range of action for today's investigations. A prototype has been developed under SDK Python with the aim of proving the feasibility of a solution to a difficulty that shows up in the process for each new investigation: the one of generating the workflow on the optimisation software Optimus. A target process has finally been discussed considering all the information collected, and would allow dividing by five the time needed to perform investigations compare to now. The prototype developed lead to interesting results and this solution could thus probably be integrated in the target process as it would allow saving one day of work for an engineer for each study to be carried out.   Solutions have been proposed to all the concerns identified in the process and they will have to be discussed with many actors and investigated further in the near future in order to set the target process that will allow meeting the final objective of answering all types of RFIs emitted by aircraft manufacturer in a very short time with a high level of confidence in the results. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a model for}} implementing and continuously improving the automated change management process for construction megaprojects. Changes are inevitable in megaprojects. Their negative impact along with the necessity of the circulation of numerous change documents, such as; <b>Request</b> <b>For</b> <b>Information</b> (<b>RFIs),</b> Change <b>Request</b> (CRs), and Project Change Notice (PCNs) in real time {{and to the right}} person have required the stakeholders of mega-projects, especially project owners, to implement innovative change management systems. As well, in the industrial sector, the dominance of the “fast track” approach necessitates advanced change management that is based on formal process-based approaches using advanced Information Technology (IT). Thus, an automated workflow-based process with continuous improvement is required to effectively manage changes in construction megaprojects. Most current change management methods still rely on human discipline to follow blurred processes with repetitive tasks, which often break down due to human nature. However, automated change management is in its infancy. Thus, behaviour of and design principles for automated workflow-based change management processes are construction knowledge gaps based on which two main objectives are defined in this research. The first objective seeks to identify the levels of change management processes in the construction industry and then to evaluate and quantify the performance difference between these levels. This thesis, thus, introduces a model of three levels, or “generations”, of change management as an effective approach to understanding how change management can be continuously improved. The second objective seeks to develop and validate a model for continuous improvement of the third level “Generation Three” workflow-based process of change management as measured by improved compliance, reduction of workflow duration, better traceability, and achievement of desirable durations of workflow steady state. This “Generation Three” approach is assumed to be part of an Electronic Product and Process Management System (EPPMS), a tool supporting execution of megaprojects. To meet the aforesaid objectives, the research methodology uses a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) model developed based on a change management process implemented in a Canadian oil and gas megaproject. Mechanistic arguments and the results of the validated simulation model of change management, which was executed for the three identified generations led to the conclusions that the “Generation Three” approach should result in: a. 	better traceability of change documents throughout the automated workflow-based process due to the recordibility of date, time, and current status of the change documents in each task, b. 	better process compliance due to the elimination of rework in repetitive tasks prompted by the automated workflow engine, c. 	reduction of the duration of the change management workflow considering the limitations of IT for reducing the duration of professional work. This research has thus led {{to a better understanding of}} the potential of automated management systems for improving processes such as change management in terms of traceability, compliance, and duration, but also of the limitations of such systems such as their ineffectiveness in substantially expediting professional practices that require off-line analysis, communication, negotiation and judgement...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} carried out to examine two public {{construction}} projects delivered by traditional approach (Design/Bid/Build) with five issues of (1) formal and informal relationships between key parties involved in detailed design and construction phases; (2) project organization for construction; (3) decision-making process <b>for</b> resolving <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> changes (RFCs) of construction contractors; (4) communication process <b>for</b> reviewing <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> (<b>RFIs)</b> and submittals of construction contractors; and (5) influences of relationships between key parties on processes of time, cost and quality control during a construction phase. This research includes two main purposes. One of them is to recognize similarities and differences in the five above issues to understand and to learn from this. The other one is to suggest several recommendations to enhance performance of public construction projects that are delivered by traditional method (Design/Bid/Build). To answer the research questions, there are two project-cases formed in the study as foundations for comparison and analysis. One of them is River Nid bridge construction project in Norway {{and the other one}} is U Minh bridge construction project in Viet Nam. Furthermore, these two cases were established by using project materials and interviewing with key individuals involved in the projects. Throughout comparison and analysis between the theory and both the Vietnamese and Norwegian cases, and between these two project-cases, this study concluded: In the detailed design phase, that the management of the detailed design and review of the detailed design are conducted by two separate individuals in both the Vietnamese and Norwegian cases makes the degree of the functional relationships in both these two cases more complex than in the theoretical case. However, this can bring significant benefits for the project performance because there are potential chances of achieving a more feasible detailed design. In the construction phase, hiring the supervision consultants (SC) - the third party for supervising the contractors’ construction activities makes the functional relationships in both the Vietnamese and Norwegian cases more complex than in the theoretical case. This can bring both advantages and disadvantages for the project performance. There need to have (1) a suitable control system much focusing on the activities of both the third party and the construction contractors, and (2) a system for resolving conflicts to limit these disadvantages to increase the project performance. The trust and personal relationships can be established before or after the beginning of the project, and bring many benefits for the project performance. However, the trust relationships can have negative influences on the project performance since they cause subjectivity. Good personal relationships, and clear and sufficient contract terms can prevent the negative influences of the personal relations on the project performance. The level of the authority delegation for decision-making <b>for</b> resolving the <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> changes (RFCs) of the construction contractors in both the Norwegian and theoretical cases is deeper than in the Vietnamese case; and the time of the information exchange between the design consultants (DC) and the construction contractors in both the Norwegian and theoretical cases is less than in the Vietnamese case. This may lead a consequence that the project performance in both the Norwegian and theoretical cases are more effective than in the Vietnamese case. The positive attitude of the key parties is a decisive factor to achieve the positive influences of the functional relationships on the processes of the time, cost and quality control during the construction phase. The functional relations’ negative influences made by significant conflicts are more likely to perform in the processes of the cost and quality control than in the process of the time control. The high level of certain trust and good personal relationships can help to prevent the negative influences of the functional relationships. The trust relationships may help to increase the project performance since they result in conflict reduction in the processes of the time, cost and quality control during the construction phase. However, there need the high degree of certain trust relationships to achieve the actual positive relations of the trust relations on the processes of the cost and quality control. This is because these two processes are sensitive, so there need the high degree of certain trust relations to create chances for the less control of the construction activities of the construction contractors. The personal relationships can make the increase of the project performance due to better communication. This benefit is achieved mainly throughout what the personal relationships positively affect the processes of the time and cost control during the construction phase. Meanwhile, the impacts of the personal relationships on the process of the quality control are limited. Throughout the comparison and analysis, especially recognizing interesting points in both the Vietnamese and Norwegian cases, there are nine recommendations suggested to increase the performance of the public construction projects that are delivered by traditional approach (Design/Bid/Build). These recommendations address project owners, project managers and construction managers who are responsible for organizing and managing these public construction projects. </p...|$|R
