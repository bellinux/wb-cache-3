In the end, more than 200 homes were burnt to the ground.|$|E

There is no record of how many acres were actually razed. Ironically, two of the four Baath Party officials executed for the massacre lived in Dujail and the roadside farmland razed included land belonging to both.|$|E

40|$|Australia has {{experienced}} dramatic declines and extinctions of its native rodent species {{over the last}} 200 years, particularly in southern Australia. In the tropical savanna of northern Australia significant declines have occurred only in recent decades. The later onset of these declines suggests that the causes may differ from earlier declines in the south. We examine potential regional effects (northern versus southern Australia) on biological and ecological correlates of range decline in Australian rodents. We demonstrate that rodent declines have been greater in the south than in the tropical north, are strongly influenced by phylogeny, and are consistently greater for species inhabiting relatively open or sparsely vegetated habitat. Unlike in marsupials, where some species have much larger body size than rodents, body mass was not an important predictor of decline in rodents. All Australian rodent species are within the prey-size range of cats (throughout the continent) and red foxes (in the south). Contrary to the hypothesis that mammal declines are related directly to ecosystem productivity (annual rainfall), our {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that disturbances such as fire and grazing, which occur in non-rainforest habitats and <b>remove</b> <b>cover</b> used by rodents for shelter, nesting and foraging, increase predation risk. We agree with calls to introduce conservation management that limits the size and intensity of fires, increases fire patchiness and reduces grazing impacts at ecological scales appropriate for rodents. Controlling feral predators, even creating predator-free reserves in relatively sparsely-vegetated habitats, is urgently required to ensure the survival of rodent species, particularly in northern Australia where declines are not yet as severe as those in the south...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Noel Derecki, James Cronk & Jonathan Kipnis ### Abstract Here, we {{describe}} {{a method for}} determining phagocytic function of microglia isolated from mouse brains. ### Procedure To determine the phagocytic ability of microglial cells, we prefer to use apoptotic neural cells as targets, since they should most closely approximate natural microglial targets in vivo. 1. Dissociate neural progenitor cells in 0. 1 M PBS + 2 mg/ml papain (Worthington) at 37 º C for 30 m. - Treat dissociated neural progenitor cells (NPC) with UV light for 15 - 20 minutes; NOTE: this {{should be done in}} a thin plastic petri dish; thick plastic (eg. 15 or 50 ml conical tube) will block a significant portion of UV light, leading to suboptimal apoptosis. - Wash NPC in 50 ml conical tube with 40 ml PBS (RT), spin at 1200 RPM, 7 m, RT, low brake. Decant supernatant. - Resuspend NPC in 5 ml RT 0. 1 M PBS - Add 5 ul sta 5 (6) -TAMRA, SE (Invitrogen) to NPC, vortex immediately and let incubate at 37 º C in dark for 15 m. - Wash 3 X (as in Step 3) with 40 ml ice-cold 0. 1 M PBS. - Resuspend in 1 ml DMEM/F 12 (Invitrogen) + Anti-anti (Invitrogen); count cells using a hemacytometer. Dilute or concentrate to 5 X 10 e 6 per ml. - Feed onto microglial cells (previously allowed to adhere to glass cover slips in 24 -well plates) in 900 ul DMEM/F 12 + 10 % fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) + Anti-anti at a ratio of 10 NPC: 1 microglial cell. NOTE: We typically perform experiments using 5 X 10 e 4 microglia per coverslip such that cells are spaced sufficiently to allow later quantification, thus 5 X 10 e 5 NPC would be fed on in 100 ul DMEM/F 12 + Anti-anti. - Place cells in incubator, at 37 º and 5 % CO 2 - At desired timepoints (eg. one, two and five h) remove plates from incubator - In a sterile hood, <b>remove</b> <b>cover</b> slips with forceps, dip 20 X briskly in warm 0. 1 M PBS (to remove non-phagocytosed NPC), then place cover slips in 1 ml 4 % PFA in a 24 -well plate. Replace remaining cover slips in incubator until next desired time-point. - Fix cells on cover slips in dark for 20 m. Wash 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, at RT. - Block cover slips in 10 % serum in PBS containing 0. 3 % Triton X- 100 and 0. 5 % BSA, 1 h, RT in dark. - Incubate with anti-CD 11 b (eBioscience), 1 : 100) for 1 h at RT, in dark. - Wash cover slips 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - Incubate with desired secondary antibody (1 : 1000, Invitrogen) for 1 hour at RT. - Wash cover slips 1 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - Incubate in DAPI (1 : 20, 000) 5 m. - Wash cover slips 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - Mount cover slips with Aqua-Mount (Lerner Laboratories) on slides. Let dry O/N before imaging. - Typically, a “phagocytic index” can be calculated by dividing the total area of microglial cells (CD 11 b+) by the total area of labeled NPC. Alternatively, number of phagocytosed targets/cell may be used to quantify phagocytosis. - To check validity of phagocytosed (internal) vs. adhered targets, Z-stacks may be imaged on confocal microscope. ### Timing - NPC dissociation, 30 m - NPC labeling, 45 m - Incubations, variable (1 + h) - Immunohistochemistry, 3 h ### Troubleshooting - Problem: Little or no phagocytosis observed - Solution 1 : NPC were not adequately irradiated; use stronger UV source, extend irradiation time, confirm cell death by dye or antibody-based assay (eg. annexinV, PI). - Solution 2 : Insufficient incubation time; extend incubation. ### Anticipated Results Microglia are highly phagocytic cells. Even after a short period of time, high levels of phagocytosis may be seen, as in Figure 1. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Microglial Phagocytosis** ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") *At left is shown a representative Z-stack indicating that UV-irradiated TAMRA-labeled NPC (red) have been phagocytosed and are situated inside of microglia. Immunolabeling for CD 11 b is shown in green and nuclei are indicated by DAPI (blue) *. *At right are shown representative images of microglia immunolabeled with CD 11 b (green) after having phagocytosed UV-irradiated TAMRA-labeled NPC (red) for 2 h*. ### Associated Publications **Wild-type microglia arrest pathology in a mouse model of Rett syndrome**.
