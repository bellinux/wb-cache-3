40|$|Abstract—Computing {{platforms}} {{equipped with}} accelerators like GPUs {{have proven to}} provide great computational power. However, exploiting such platforms for existing scientific applica-tions is not a trivial task. Current GPU programming frameworks such as CUDA C/C++ require low-level programming from the developer {{in order to achieve}} high performance code. As a result porting of applications to GPUs is typically limited to time-dominant algorithms and <b>routines,</b> <b>leaving</b> the remainder not accelerated which can open a serious Amdahl’s law issue. The lattice QCD application Chroma allows to explore a different porting strategy. The layered structure of the software architecture logically separates the data-parallel from the ap-plication layer. The QCD Data-Parallel software layer provides data types and expressions with stencil-like operations suitable for lattice field theory and Chroma implements algorithms in terms of this high-level interface. Thus by porting the low-level layer one can effectively move the whole application in one swing to a different platform. The QDP-JIT/PTX library, the reimplementation of the low-level layer, provides a framework for lattice QCD calculations for the CUDA architecture. The complete software interface is supported and thus applications can be run unaltered on GPU-based parallel computers. This reimplementation was possible due to the availability of a JIT compiler (part of the NVIDIA Linux kernel driver) which translates an assembly-like language (PTX) to GPU code. The expression template technique is used to build PTX code generators and a software cache manages the GPU memory. This reimplementation allows us to deploy an efficient imple-mentation of the full gauge-generation program with dynamical fermions on large-scale GPU-based machines such as Titan and Blue Waters which accelerates the algorithm by more than an order of magnitude.

40|$|Background: Improvement in skin laxity can be {{difficult}} to achieve without invasive surgical procedures. Monopolar ra-diofrequency (RF) treatment is used by physicians to heat skin and promote tissue tightening and contouring. Radiofre-quency technology produces an electric current that generates heat through resistance in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The thermal effect depends on the conductivity features of the treated tissue. When heated, collagen fibrils will denature and contract, which is believed to lead to the observed tissue tightening. Methods: Ninety-three consecutive patients with mild to moderate laxity were included in the study. The Surgitron Dual Frequency ™ RF (Radiowave technology, Ellman International) was used to treat skin laxity. The application of RF en-ergy has been carried out in ambulatory settings with no need for skin sterilization or anesthesia. Results: Patients immediately noticed a microlifting retraction in the treated tissues according to the vectors mapped in the area. There were no significant complications and the majority of patients were satisfied with the procedure and able to return to their daily <b>routine</b> after <b>leaving</b> the office, thereby substantiating the popularity of noninvasive rejuve-nating procedures...|$|R

The simulated ship, Tug and VTS operating environments allowed us to have a high level of operational control, while conducting the study in a safe and repeatable manner. At the same time the simulation technology is maximally akin to real world settings and procedures, and therefore may provide some valuable insights that would not be obtainable in a classical laboratory setting. While high mental workload is generally implicit in critical task environments, particularly during emergency manoeuvres, it is worth nothing here that some steps can be taken to alleviate workload in routine but critical environments. Particularly, automation of <b>routine</b> tasks can <b>leave</b> the human operator with spare capacity for essential decision making; however there is a further risk here of automation-related errors compounding such emergency situations (Parasuraman & Riley, 1997).|$|R

40|$|Scientific background: Appendicitis is an {{inflammation}} of the appendix of the blind intestine. Appendicitis remains the most frequent cause for an acute abdomen. Both interventions, the open surgical (through opening of the abdominal cavity) {{as well as the}} laparoscopic approach (via insertion of an optic system and instruments into the abdominal cavity through three small incisions), are used for the excision of the inflamed appendix (appendectomy). Research questions: The performed evaluation addresses questions on the medical effectiveness of the use of laparoscopic appendectomy in comparison with the classical open appendix excision as well as on its cost-effectiveness based on the German health system. Methods: A literature search was conducted in October 2005 in the most important medical electronic databases. The medical analysis was performed {{on the basis of the}} most up to date systematic review (basic review) of randomized controlled studies (RCT), newly published RCT and on our own quantitative information synthesis of all studies as well as of selected methodologically high-value RCT. In the health economic analysis, relevant publications were evaluated and cost differences of both interventions were calculated. Results: One systematic review and 56 primary studies were included in the medical evaluation, 24 of these studies were included in the conducted subanalysis on the basis of methodologically high-value studies. In total, a relation of three avoided wound infections per one additional intraabdominal abscess has to be expected by the use of laparoscopic appendectomy in com-parison with the open operation. Diagnostic laparoscopy reduces the rate of unclear diagnoses within the scope of planned appendectomy in fertile women. By <b>routine,</b> <b>leaving</b> the macroscopically bland appendix in situ, the rate of negative appendectomy is reduced significantly and profound. The results speak for a small advantage of the laparoscopic appendec-tomy with regard to pain intensity, the time until reintroduction of liquid and solid diet, time until first stool as well as for a slightly better cosmetic result and slightly better quality of life. In the contemporary practice in Germany, a longer operation time, a reduced length of hospital stay and a similar time to return to work have to be expected by the use of laparoscopic appendectomy in comparison with open appendectomy. In the current health care situation in Germany, the use of laparoscopic appendectomy is associated with additional operation costs of approximately 150 to 200 Euro compared with the open appendectomy. By approximately 200 Euro costs savings due to the shorter length of hospital stay, the total (direct and indirect) costs of in-patient care of both interventions seem to be similar. Due to similar indirect costs, the total costs of both interventions lie also in the same range and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of both technologies are driven to zero. Discussion: The use of the results of the performed medical analysis in the cost calculations supports the conclusions of the health-economic evaluation on the same evidence level as in the medical analysis. Conclusions: Laparoscopic appendectomy shows both small advantages (diagnostics, wound infections, pain intensity, cosmetic result and quality of life) and disadvantages (intraabdominal abscesses) when compared with open appendectomy. From a health-economic view, laparoscopic and open appendectomies are generally similar with respect to the direct in-patient and indirect costs. Therefore, the decision between the two alternatives should be made by the physicians individually...|$|R
