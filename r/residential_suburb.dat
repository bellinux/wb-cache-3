5|$|Historically part of Gateshead Fell in County Durham, Sheriff Hill was {{the site}} of a battle between William the Conqueror and Malcolm III of Scotland in 1068. A road was built through Gateshead Fell in the early 13th century, {{attracting}} some settlers. A procession of bishops, sheriffs and noblemen known as the Sheriff's March took place on the road in 1282 and continued biannually until the 1830s. By then, Gateshead Fell had been enclosed and a village had grown around the road, largely populated by an influx of tinkers, coalminers working at Sheriff Hill Colliery and workers at the local pottery, mill and sandstone quarry. By the turn of the 20th century these industries were in steep decline. The local authority built a large council estate at Sheriff Hill to alleviate dangerous overcrowding in Gateshead, effectively turning the area into a <b>residential</b> <b>suburb.</b> It ceased to be an independent village on 1 April 1974 when it was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead {{under the terms of the}} Local Government Act 1972.|$|E
