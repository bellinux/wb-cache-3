5|$|Also in 1996, MTV invited Stiller to {{host the}} VH1 Fashion Awards. Along with SNL writer Drake Sather, Stiller {{developed}} a short film for the awards about a male model known as Derek Zoolander. It was so well <b>received</b> <b>that</b> he developed another short film about the character for the 1997 VH1 Fashion Awards and finally remade the skit into a film.|$|E
5|$|At the 79th Academy Awards, {{visual effects}} {{supervisors}} John Knoll, Hal Hickel, Charles Gibson, and Allen Hall won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects, {{which was also}} the first time since 1994's Forrest Gump that Industrial Light & Magic had <b>received</b> <b>that</b> particular Academy Award. The film was also nominated for Best Art Direction, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing.|$|E
5|$|From {{the autumn}} of 1894, the hall was adopted as the venue for the annual winter season of concerts of the Philharmonic Society of London, which had {{formerly}} been held at St James's Hall. At the first Philharmonic concert at the Queen's Hall, Alexander Mackenzie conducted the first performance in England of Tchaikovsky's Pathétique Symphony, which was so well <b>received</b> <b>that</b> it was repeated, by popular acclaim, at the next concert. During the 1894–95 season, Edvard Grieg and Camille Saint-Saëns conducted performances of their works. The Society remained at the Queen's Hall until 1941.|$|E

5|$|The Power of Four was so {{negatively}} <b>received,</b> <b>that</b> it {{was announced}} that future British and Irish Lions tours would have songs and themes chosen by a musical committee set up {{in the wake of the}} 2005 tour instead of by the team coach. After 2005, The Power of Four became largely forgotten. During the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, ESPN jokingly suggested that The Power of Four would be remixed into a hip hop song for the third test by Pharrell Williams and would be performed by Snoop Dogg.|$|E
5|$|The ruling {{clears the}} way for the plaintiff-respondents to collect from the roughly $1.75billion bank account, which will be enough to satisfy about 70% of their {{collective}} $2.5billion in judgments. They will not be eligible to collect from a $1billion fund—the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund—established by Congress in 2015 to pay victims of state-sponsored terrorism. That fund pays 30% of judgments until all applicants have <b>received</b> <b>that</b> amount; remaining funds will not be distributed until all claimants have received 30% of their judgment.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly <b>received</b> <b>that</b> they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E

The battalion {{was in the}} Mount Shiburangu area on 15 August when news came that the Japanese had surrendered following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The battalion's losses during its final campaign were 51 killed and 76 wounded.|$|E
5|$|After his {{national}} championship-winning season in 1953, Jim Tatum received Coach of the Year honors from the AFCA and the FWAA. He was also named {{coach of the}} year by the Southern Conference in 1951 and the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953 and 1955. The Sporting News named Jerry Claiborne the nation's top coach in 1974, and in 1982, his successor, Bobby Ross, <b>received</b> <b>that</b> distinction from the Touchdown Club. For his first-year turnaround of a team that had one winning season in the previous decade, Ralph Friedgen received national Coach of the Year plaudits from at least eight organizations.|$|E
5|$|Amanda Clement {{was born}} in Hudson, South Dakota, then part of the Dakota Territory, on March 20, 1888 to Harriet Clement, one of the {{original}} settlers of Eden, South Dakota, and her husband, who died when Amanda was very young. In 1904 Clement traveled to Hawarden, Iowa to watch her brother Hank pitch in a semi-professional game. The umpire for the amateur game taking place before Hank's did not show, and Hank suggested that Amanda, who had played baseball with her brothers and was knowledgeable about the game, serve as the umpire. In so doing, Clement became the first woman paid to umpire a baseball game. Her performance was so well <b>received</b> <b>that</b> she was hired to umpire further semi-professional games.|$|E

5|$|During his {{production}} tenure on Children's Ward, Davies continued to seek other freelance writing jobs, particularly for soap operas; his {{intention was to}} eventually work on the popular and long-running Granada soap Coronation Street. In pursuit of this career plan, he storylined soaps such as Families and wrote scripts for shows such as Cluedo, a game show based on the board game of the same name, and Do the Right Thing, a localised version of the Brazilian panel show Você Decide with Terry Wogan as presenter and Frank Skinner as a regular panellist. One writing job, for The House of Windsor, a soap opera about footmen in Buckingham Palace, was so poorly <b>received</b> <b>that</b> his other scripts for the show would be written under the pseudonym Leo Vaughn.|$|E
5|$|Gott ist mein König is a {{significant}} early work of Bach. It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation. It was so positively <b>received</b> <b>that</b> {{it was the first}} of Bach's works to be printed (paid for by the city council); it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime, at least in a version which has survived to this day. The printing is all the more remarkable as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance, and a new piece was commissioned the following year. Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year's council inauguration; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed, but no copies are known to survive.|$|E
5|$|Having {{performed}} in parlor theatricals as a child, from 1916 Simonovich-Efimova began staging puppet shows for fellow artists. The plays were so well <b>received</b> <b>that</b> {{she and her}} husband were invited to create a children's puppet theater by the Russian authorities in 1918, becoming two of the first professional puppeteers in Russia. She created innovative designs to make her manikins lifelike, promoting her work by publishing books and teaching puppetry theory and design. She and her husband are known as the first couple of Russian puppetry, though she was the one determined to elevate the craft. They performed over 1,500 shows throughout Russia between 1920 and 1940, moving from place to place with their traveling puppet theater.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, end Bill Supplee was {{selected}} to the Associated Press second team, which made him the first Maryland player to be named an All-American. Guard Bob Ward became the first Terrapin named to a first team when he <b>received</b> <b>that</b> honor from AP and the Football Writers Association of America in 1950. The following year, Ward became Maryland's first consensus All-American when he was unanimously chosen by every NCAA-recognized selector. Five other Terrapins have earned consensus All-America honors: Jack Scarbath in 1952, Stan Jones in 1953, Bob Pellegrini in 1955, Randy White in 1974, and linebacker E. J. Henderson in 2001. Henderson was also named a consensus All-American in 2002, which made him the first, and thus far only, Maryland player to receive the honor twice.|$|E
5|$|In January 1994, over 60,000 third–sixth {{graders in}} the state of Oklahoma {{selected}} from Shiloh 23 nominees as the winner of the Sequoyah Children's Book Award. The Sequoyah Award was presented to Naylor in April 1994 during the yearly Oklahoma Library Association conference. On April 14, 1994, at the annual conference of the Missouri Association of School Librarians, Shiloh <b>received</b> <b>that</b> year's Mark Twain Readers Award. The Mark Twain Award is decided annually through a vote by fourth–eighth graders {{in the state}} of Missouri. On October 29, 1994, Naylor received the William Allen White Children's Book Award for Shiloh. The award is decided through the tallying of over 55,000 children {{in the state of}} Kansas.|$|E
5|$|In July and August, the 9th Armoured Brigade {{worked in}} support of the 4th and 10th Indian Infantry Divisions in the central {{mountains}} south east of Florence, on the approach to the Gothic Line. In August, the order was <b>received</b> <b>that</b> all men with over 4½ years service overseas should be repatriated, and this reduced the regiment's strength by half. This made it impossible to function as a fighting unit and it was withdrawn from the line of battle. In October 1944, the regiment returned to England to train replacements for armoured regiments still fighting in Europe. It continued in this role until 1946, although the pace slowed after victory in Europe in May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, T-Force {{had moved}} into the Petit Palais. The {{main body of the}} Alsos Mission soon followed, and the Mission opened an office at the Place de l'Opéra. On 5 September, word was <b>received</b> <b>that</b> the British 21st Army Group was about to enter Brussels. There were two {{important}} Alsos Mission objectives in Belgium: the corporate headquarters of Union Minière du Haut Katanga, the world's largest supplier of uranium ore, in Antwerp, and its uranium processing plant in Olen. A six-man Alsos Mission team set out to secure them, led by Pash and the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, at ETOUSA, Colonel G. Bryan Conrad.|$|E
5|$|On 2 May 1945 {{news was}} <b>received</b> <b>that</b> all German forces {{west of the}} Isonzo River had surrendered. While this did not officially end the {{fighting}} in Italy, it was all but over. Five days later, {{on the night of}} 7 May, the battalion received the news that Germany had surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, and that the war in Europe was over. Nevertheless, tensions remained high and concerns about the intentions of Yugoslavia regarding the disputed province of Istria meant that the 28th (Māori) Battalion remained on high alert. This continued until early June when an agreement was reached and Yugoslavia withdrew its troops east of the Isonzo River.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, many Maryland {{players have}} {{received}} All-American honors. Eleven Terps {{have been named}} consensus (received a majority of votes) first-team All-Americans and one, E.J. Henderson, has <b>received</b> <b>that</b> honor twice. Additionally, some have been awarded prestigious awards, including the Bednarik Award, Butkus Award, Lou Groza Award, Outland Trophy, and Lombardi Award. While no Terrapin has ever received the Heisman Trophy, which is bestowed upon college football's most outstanding player, several have received votes by the award's selection committee. Quarterbacks Jack Scarbath and Bernie Faloney finished second and fourth in the voting in 1952 and 1953, respectively. Additionally, Bob Pellegrini, Gary Collins, Randy White, and Boomer Esiason all finished in the top-ten of the voting for a Heisman. Six Maryland players and four coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Bear Bryant, Jerry Claiborne, Clark Shaughnessy, and Jim Tatum were inducted as coaches. The players included Dick Modzelewski, Bob Pellegrini, Jack Scarbath, and Bob Ward. Stan Jones and Randy White were also inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
