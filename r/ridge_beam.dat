25|$|The north {{transept}} (or Priory End) windows, {{east and}} north, are 19th century but within 14th-century openings. The trussed roof is possibly 16th century with {{tie beam support}} added in the 19th. The south transept (or Hall End) east and south windows are 14th century although partly restored. The 15th-century south transept roof trussing is of hammer beam construction, with curved collar braces springing from beams which are supported by curved chamfered brackets. Running on the wall from the hammer beams to the roof line are wind braces, and to the <b>ridge</b> <b>beam</b> is roof truss framing. Both transepts are separated from the nave by c.20th-century panels and doors rising part {{way to the top}} of the arches. The north transept is solid panelling; the south with clear glazed doors to its full width. The north transept is today used as the church vestry room, and the south transept a meeting room with modern furniture. On the south wall of the south transept is a 14th-century piscina with a recessed trefoiled head, a re-cut quatrefoil drain, a head of a woman in a wimple carved at its apex, and a finial above.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} examine {{some of the}} factors {{affecting}} the brightness and the beam quality of high-power tapered lasers. The large volume resonators required to achieve a high-power, high-brightness operation make the beam quality sensitive to carrier lensing and a multimode operation.

The <b>beam</b> quality in the conventional and the distributed Bragg reflector tapered lasers is examined {{in the absence of}} the self-heating effects to investigate the effect of the carrier lensing effects. The influence of the front facet reflectivity and the taper angle on the beam quality is investigated. The beam quality was found to degrade with an increase in the front facet reflectivity and for the larger taper angles in the conventional tapered lasers, especially at low ridge waveguide currents. Finally, the performance of the conventional tapered lasers employing a beamspoiler was assessed. The beam quality was found to be comparable with that achieved in the DBR tapered lasers...|$|R

We compare our estimates of sea-ice volume flux (190 ± 50 km 3 yr - 1) and corresponding freshwater transport (140 ± 40 km 3 yr - 1) through the strait to values from previous surveys, commenting on differences in methodology between the studies. Our findings allow us to assess the utility of subsurface moored ADCPs in quantifying sea-ice presence, thickness, and velocity; the ADCP signal correlation parameter appears to provide a particularly good indication of sea-ice presence. In addition, we consider the use of similar methods to evaluate historical ADCP records and develop a more complete understanding of interannual sea-ice flux variability through the Bering Strait...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the presence, {{location}} and, multiplanar distance of the canalis sinuosus (CS) between the incisive foramen and the anterior maxillary alveolar <b>ridge</b> using cone <b>beam</b> computed tomography (CBCT). Therefore, 500 CBCT maxillary images obtained from male and female patients aged 20 to 80 years were selected to assist in the dental treatment. Low-quality tomographic images were discarded. All images were captured with the i-CATTM Classic tomograph and assessed using the XoranCatTM software. The axial sections were analyzed at the incisive foramen in order to verify the CS presence in laterality and location. Furthermore, linear measurements of the nasal cavity floor, buccal cortical bone, and alveolar ridge crest were made. All the collected data were statistically analyzed. Results show a variation of the CS in relation to the classification and distance of anatomical structures, but no significant difference between the right and left sides. It should be highlighted that CBCT is necessary before invasive procedures in order to preserve important anatomical structures. In conclusion, the location of the CS varies in relation to the alveolar ridge crest and buccal cortical bone, assuming that it is going to be located by the upper lateral incisor palatine...|$|R
50|$|There is some {{controversy}} over {{the interpretation of the}} mound structure which dominated the site. Sears, in his initial report, stated that he believed the mound to be a collapsed earth lodge analogous to the type found at the Macon Plateau site. He supported this claim by describing his discovery of horizontal molds of poles ranging in diameter from 4 to 6 inches and rocks scattered about the floor of the site underneath a layer of clay. He concluded that these had been rafters supporting a sod or earthen roof. He then speculated as to the method of construction which had been used to make such an “earth lodge” discussing the use of much wider support <b>beams,</b> a <b>ridge</b> pole, further rafters, and finally presenting a pen & ink artist’s rendering of how he believed the site would have appeared in cross section. Lewis Larson in his “The Case for Earth Lodges in the Southeast” disputes Sear’s claims. Larson hypothesizes that the mound at the Wilbanks site was not an earth lodge, but simply some sort of ceremonial mound, and that Sears misinterpreted the excavation. The absence of large support <b>beam,</b> <b>ridge</b> poles, or a hearth in Sears’s report indicated to Larson that the structure excavated was not an earth lodge. Larson also noted that the absence of platform or bench seating made of either timber or clay also indicated that there was most likely not an earth lodge present at the Wilbanks site. Finally, the overall rarity of earth lodges in the Southeast and the seemingly general insignificance of the site in the region also points, in Larson’s opinion, to an error in the interpretation of the site as an earth lodge.|$|R
