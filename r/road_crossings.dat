5|$|The {{success of}} the amphibious {{landings}} depended on {{the establishment of a}} secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to allow the buildup of a well-supplied force capable of breaking out. The amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter-attacks before the arrival of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be accomplished. To slow or eliminate the enemy's ability to organise and launch counter-attacks during this critical period, airborne operations were used to seize key objectives such as bridges, <b>road</b> <b>crossings,</b> and terrain features, particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas. The airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease the egress of the amphibious forces off the beaches, and in some cases to neutralise German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead.|$|E
5|$|By 1954, traffic {{entering}} {{the city by}} the Causeway had doubled, leading to renewed calls for a new bridge further west at The Narrows. That bridge was eventually built as the Narrows Bridge. Opened in 1959, the Narrows Bridge alleviated the traffic problems at the Causeway; the Narrows and the Causeway continued {{to be the only}} <b>road</b> <b>crossings</b> of the Swan River between Fremantle and Maylands until the Windan Bridge of the Graham Farmer Freeway opened in 2000. The opening of the latter eastern bypass coincided with the conversion of the Causeway's two centre lanes to bus lanes. It also lowered traffic levels on the Causeway from 107,000 cars per day to 70,000 within six months. The western roundabout, the state's worst black spot since 1989, was also remodelled in 2000 into a traffic light controlled raindrop roundabout, in conjunction with the other works on the Causeway.|$|E

5|$|The Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing, {{commonly}} known as the Dartford Crossing and until 1991 the Dartford Tunnel, is a major road crossing of the River Thames in England, carrying the A282 road between Dartford in Kent to the south with Thurrock in Essex to the north. It consists of two bored tunnels and the cable-stayed Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. The only fixed road crossing of the Thames east of Greater London, it is the busiest estuarial crossing in the United Kingdom, with an average daily use of over 130,000 vehicles. It opened in stages: the west tunnel in 1963, the east tunnel in 1980 and the bridge in 1991. The crossing, although not officially designated a motorway, is considered part of the M25 motorway's route, using the tunnels northbound and bridge southbound. Described {{as one of the most}} important <b>road</b> <b>crossings</b> in Britain, it suffers from heavy traffic and congestion.|$|E
5|$|North of {{the railway}} line, the 156th and 10th Parachute Battalions became engaged with the German {{defensive}} line as {{they attempted to}} seize the high ground in the woods north of Oosterbeek. Both battalions' advances were blunted against the well-defended German positions and by early afternoon they had not advanced any further than their original positions. Urquhart—realising the need to assume a more defensive stance and prevent the two battalions being cut off north of the railway—ordered them to fall back to Wolfheze and Oosterbeek. Making a fighting withdrawal with the Germans of Kampfgruppe Krafft closely pursuing them, the units fell back across LZ 'L', defended by the King's Own Scottish Borderers who were awaiting {{the arrival of the}} Glider borne elements of the Polish Parachute Brigade. Heavy fighting ensued as the gliders arrived {{in the middle of the}} retreat and Polish losses were heavy. All four Allied units streamed south and west toward the <b>road</b> <b>crossings</b> over the steep railway cutting at Oosterbeek and Wolfheze and gathered in ad hoc units in the woods on the south side, where most of them spent the night. Some German units followed them across the railway and an SS battalion reached Wolfheze where it was strafed by its own air force.|$|E

25|$|Shinkansen routes are {{completely}} separate from conventional rail lines (except Mini-shinkansen which goes through to conventional lines).

The lines have been built without <b>road</b> <b>crossings</b> at grade. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and viaducts to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000meters (2,500meters on the oldest Tōkaidō Shinkansen).|$|E
25|$|A {{particular}} kind of bhoot, that of a woman that died during pregnancy or childbirth, {{is known as a}} chudail (dakini in Nepal and eastern India). Chudails look like human women, but their feet are turned backwards or other features are turned upside down. They can change their forms at any time. Chudails often try to lure young men at <b>road</b> <b>crossings</b> and fields or similar places. If a man is enamored of a chudail, it is believed that she will cause his death. There are, however, stories of people living with a chudail, or even marrying one.|$|E

25|$|The pawned territories {{remained}} politically {{a part of}} the Kingdom of Hungary (and of its Esztergom diocese), {{while the}} revenue from the territories went to Poland. Poland also held some administrative powers in the area and was entitled to appoint a governor/administrator (starosta) for the territories, with his seat in Lubló, to manage them economically (especially to collect tax revenues) and to position guards at important <b>road</b> <b>crossings</b> even outside the pawned territories. One of the first Polish governors of Szepes was the famous knight Zawisza Czarny. Due to their complex political and economic status (German towns with Slovak subjects, although the number of Slovaks in the towns was less than 5% in the area pawned to Poland), the towns declined economically.|$|E

It is popular among cyclists, some of whom use it to commute to and from downtown, as well as runners. In late 2011, the MetroPath was extended and a [...] bridge was added over the freeway style entrance to the Snapper Creek Expressway (S.R. 878) near Dadeland North station to complete the M-Path {{with the exception of}} a few small breaks at major <b>road</b> <b>crossings</b> such as near the north end at Coral Way (SW 13 Street) in Brickell and the Douglas Road area around Bird Road in Coral Gables. Beyond Dadeland South, the M-Path connects with the [...] South Dade Rail Trail, which runs along the South Dade rapid transit busway, also former FEC right of way, all the way to Florida City. Together, the two paths form a continuous [...] off-road trail for pedestrians and cyclists. Both trails are part of the ambitious East Coast Greenway project. Many additional improvement projects are planned over the coming years as part of the Metropath Master Plan created in 2007, such as repaving, widening, and enhancing crosswalks at major intersections. As of 2014, there are plans to revamp the MetroPath as a linear park, taking after the popular Highline Park in New York City, by a group known as [...] "Friends of the GreenLink.
