40|$|Human interleukin- 29 (IL- 29), a helical {{cytokine}} with interferon-like activities, {{is currently}} being developed as a clinical biotherapeutic to treat chronic hepatitis C infection and some cancers. As such, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized a need for biological standardization of IL- 29 {{and the establishment of}} an internationally available <b>reference</b> <b>reagent</b> of IL- 29. In order to accomplish this, an international collaborative study that evaluates WHO candidate reference reagents of IL- 29 was instigated by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) in 2010 and was carried out in the succeeding year. Two preparations of human sequence recombinant IL- 29, one expressed in murine NS 0 cells and the other in Escherichia coli, were formulated and lyophilized at NIBSC before evaluation in the collaborative study for their suitability to serve as a <b>reference</b> <b>reagent.</b> The preparations were tested by 6 laboratories from 4 countries using in vitro bioassays and also evaluated for thermal stability within the NIBSC laboratory. On the basis {{of the results of the}} collaborative study, both preparations, 07 / 212 (NS 0 -derived) and 10 / 176 (E. coli-derived) were judged sufficiently active and stable to serve as a <b>reference</b> <b>reagent.</b> However, since IL- 29 produced in E. coli is in development for clinical applications, it was recommended that the preparation coded 10 / 176 be established as the WHO international <b>reference</b> <b>reagent</b> for human IL- 29. This recommendation was accepted, and the IL- 29 preparation coded 10 / 176 was formally established by the WHO ECBS at its meeting in October 2012 as the WHO international <b>reference</b> <b>reagent</b> for IL- 29 with an assigned unitage of 5, 000 reference units per ampoule...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs {{the latest}} {{addition}} to the sub-strain specific WHO Reference Reagents of BCG vaccine, an international collaborative study was completed to evaluate the suitability of a candidate BCG Moreau-RJ sub-strain as a WHO <b>Reference</b> <b>Reagent</b> of BCG vaccine. This follows the recent replacement of the WHO 1 st International Reference Preparation for BCG vaccine, by three sub-strain specific WHO Reference Reagents of BCG vaccine (Danish 1331, Tokyo 172 - 1 and Russian BCG-I) in order to complete the coverage of most predominant sub-strains used for BCG vaccine production and distribution for use worldwide. The study used cultural viable count and modified ATP assays to quantify the preparation and multiplex PCR to confirm {{the identity of the}} sub-strain. The establishment of this WHO <b>Reference</b> <b>Reagent</b> of BCG vaccine of Moreau-RJ sub-strain was approved by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization meeting in October 2012. This preparation is available for distribution by NIBSC-MHRA, UK. The data from real-time stability monitoring demonstrated that these Reference Reagents of BCG vaccine are very stable in storage condition at − 20 °C. They serve as the valuable source of BCG Reference Reagents for use as comparators (1) for viability assays (such as cultural viable count and modified ATP assays); (2) for in vivo assays (such as the absence of virulent mycobacteria, dermal reactivity and protection assays) in the evaluation of candidate TB vaccines in non-clinical models; (3) for identity assays using molecular biology techniques...|$|E
40|$|Background: The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) {{established}} a Working Group to investigate means {{of improving the}} comparability of immunoassays for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which was selected as a prototype glycoprotein analyte. The Working Group identified development of unambiguous nomenclature and production of new highly purified International <b>Reference</b> <b>Reagents</b> calibrated in substance concentrations as its primary objectives. Methods: Preparations of intact hCG, nicked hCG, hCG ß-subunit, nicked hCG ß-subunit, hCG -subunit, and hCG ß-core fragment were purified from a crude urinary hCG preparation, ampouled, lyophilized, and assigned values in substance concentrations (mol/L). Value assignment and accelerated degradation {{studies were carried out}} in accordance with WHO protocols for International <b>Reference</b> <b>Reagents.</b> Results: The ampouled standards were assigned final values based on the recovery of immunoreactive material after reconstitution. The degradation studies showed that the standards were highly stable. Conclusions: The nomenclature of hCG-related molecules and immunoassays has been adopted by the IFCC, and the standards prepared and characterized by the Working Group have been formally adopted by the WHO as the First International <b>Reference</b> <b>Reagents</b> for six hCG-related molecules. These developments will enable better understanding of what assays for hCG measure and should ultimately help to improve the clinical application of these assays.

Availability of dry CD 4 reagents can eliminate cold chain requirement reducing shipment and storage cost. An attempt was made in this study to validate the ReaPan and Rea T Count dry reagents developed by ReaMetrix against the original BD Biosciences liquid reagents. Method: Absolute counts and percentages of CD 4, CD 8 and CD 3 + T cells obtained in 100 HIV infected individuals using the test and <b>reference</b> <b>reagents</b> were analyzed for correlation and agreement using Pearson′s correlation and Bland Altman bias analysis. The stability of the reagents and of the stained samples was analyzed at ambient temperature and at 37 °C. Results: The absolute CD 4 + T cell count and percentages obtained using test and <b>reference</b> <b>reagents</b> showed correlation coefficients ranging from 833 to 981. A mean bias between dry and <b>reference</b> <b>reagents</b> ranged from 0. 8 to 26. 4. The ReaPan and Rea T Count reagents were stable up to one month at 37 °C also.

40|$|Induction of broadly {{cross-reactive}} neutralizing antibodies is a {{high priority}} for AIDS vaccine development but one that has proven difficult to be achieved. While most immunogens generate antibodies that neutralize a subset of T-cell-line-adapted strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), none so far have generated a potent, broadly cross-reactive response against primary isolates of the virus. Even small increments in immunogen improvement leading to increases in neutralizing antibody titers and cross-neutralizing activity would accelerate vaccine development; however, a lack of uniformity in target strains used by different investigators to assess cross-neutralization has made the comparison of vaccine-induced antibody responses difficult. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish standard panels of HIV- 1 reference strains for wide distribution. To facilitate this, full-length gp 160 genes were cloned from acute and early subtype B infections and characterized for use as <b>reference</b> <b>reagents</b> to assess neutralizing antibodies against clade B HIV- 1.

There are only five proviral clones available for viruses other than subtype B, and these represent only 3 of the 10 proposed (group M) sequence subtypes. This lack of reference sequences also confounds the identification and analysis of mosaic (recombinant) genomes, which appear to be arising with increasing frequency in areas where multiple sequence subtypes cocirculate. To generate a more representative panel of non-subtype B <b>reference</b> <b>reagents,</b> we have cloned (by long PCR or lambda phage techniques) and sequenced 10 near-full-length HIV- 1 genomes (lacking less than 80 bp of long terminal repeat sequences) from primary isolates collected at major epicenters of the global AIDS pandemic. Detailed phylogenetic analyses identified six that represented nonrecombinant members of HIV- 1 subtypes A (92 UG 037. 1), C (92 BR 025. 8), D (84 ZR 085. 1 and 94 UG 114. 1), F (93 BR 020. 1), and H (90 CF 056. 1), the last two comprising the first full-length examples of these subtypes. Four others were found to be complex mosaics of subtypes A and C (92 RW 009. 6), A and G (92 NG 083. 2 and 92 NG 003. 1), and B and F (93 BR 029. 4), again emphasizing the impact of intersubtype recombination on global HIV- 1 diversification. Although a number of clones had frameshift mutations or translational stop codons in major open reading frames, all the genomes contained a complete set of genes and three had intact genomic organizations without inactivating mutations. Reconstruction of one of these (94 UG 114. 1) yielded replication-competent virus that grew to high titers in normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. This panel of non-subtype B reference genomes should prove valuable for structure-function studies of genetically diverse viral gene products, the generation of subtype-specific immunological reagents, and the production of DNA- and protein-based subunit vaccines directed against a broader spectrum of viruses...|$|R

MOLT cells uninfected or chronically {{infected with}} recombinant HIV isolates bearing the NL 4 - 3 (X 4) or the BaL (R 5) envelopes have been previously described [1]. Infected cells are 90 % p 24 + and express similar levels of HIV envelope. Primary CD 4 T cells were isolated by immunomagnetic negative selection (Miltenyi Biotec) of PBMCs obtained from healthy donors through the local blood bank. Final preparations were> 95 % of CD 4 positive T cells as assessed by flow cytometry. Primary CD 4 T cells were used without any further treatment in coculture experiments. MT- 4 cells {{were obtained from}} Dr. D Richman through the AIDS Research and <b>Reference</b> <b>Reagent</b> Program. Before coculturing with MOLT cells, MT- 4 cells were stained with 10 µg/µL of the far red cell tracer DDAO (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 ºC in the dark. For membrane transfer experiments, MOLT cells were stained with 34 µM of the green lipophylic probe DiO (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 ºC. Cells were extensively washed before use {{in order to reduce}} non specific DiO transfer. Cocultures of infected and target cells (ratio 1 : 1) were performed in 96 well plates by mixing 200. 000 cells of each type in a final volume of 200 µL. The fusion inhibitor C 3...|$|E
40|$|Diagnosis of {{hepatitis}} E virus (HEV) is usually determined serologically by detection {{of the presence}} of immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies or rising anti-HEV IgG titers. However, serological assays have demonstrated a significant variation in their sensitivities and specificities. In this study, we present the systematic comparison of different immunological anti-HEV assays using complete seroconversion panels of 10 virologically confirmed HEV genotype 3 infected individuals. Assay sensitivities were further evaluated by testing serially diluted World Health Organization (WHO) <b>reference</b> <b>reagent</b> for hepatitis E virus antibody and one patient sample infected with HEV genotype 3. Anti-HEV IgM and IgG antibody presence was determined using the immunological assays Wantai HEV IgM/IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Sanbio, Uden, The Netherlands), recomWell HEV IgM/IgG (Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany), HEV IgM ELISA 3. 0, HEV ELISA, HEV ELISA 4. 0, Assure HEV IgM Rapid Test (all MP Biomedicals Europe, Illkirch Cedex, France) and Anti-HEV ELISA (IgM/IgG, Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany). The assays showed differences regarding their analytical and diagnostic sensitivities, with anti-HEV IgM assays (n = 5) being more divergent compared to anti-HEV IgG (n = 4) assays in this study. Considerable variations were observed particularly for the detection period of IgM antibodies. This is the first study systematically characterizing serologic assays on the basis of seroconversion panels, providing sample conformity for a conclusive comparison. Future studies should include the assay comparison covering the four different genotypes...|$|E
40|$|We have {{successfully}} developed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurement {{system for the}} on-site immunoassay of real samples. The system is composed of a portable SPR instrument (290 mm(W) x 160 mm(D) x 120 mm(H)) and a microfluidic immunoassay chip (16 mm(W) x 16 mm(D) x 4 mm(H)) that needs no external pump system. An integrated vertical capillary tube functions as a large volume (150 μL) passive pump and a waste reservoir that has sufficient capacity for several refill operations. An immunoassay was carried out that employed the direct injection of a buffer and a test sample in sequence into a microfluidic chip that included 9 antibody bands and 10 <b>reference</b> <b>reagent</b> bands immobilized in the flow channel. By subtracting a reliable averaged reference sensorgram from the antibody, we effectively reduced {{the influence of the}} non-specific binding, and then our chip successfully detected the specific binding of spiked IgG in non-homogeneous milk. IgG is a model antigen that is certain not to be present in non-homogeneous milk, and non-homogeneous milk is a model of real sample that includes many interfering foreign substances that induce non-specific binding. The direct injection of a real sample with no pretreatment enabled us to complete the entire immunoassay in several minutes. This ease of operation and short measuring time are acceptable for on-site agricultural, environmentaland medical testing...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{compare the}} International Normalised Ratio (INR) {{obtained}} {{directly with the}} two types of WHO plain International Reference Preparation for thromboplastin in patients treated with coumarin. METHODS: Prothrombin times were performed in parallel at four centres using WHO human plain IRP (BCT/ 253) and rabbit plain IRP (RBT/ 79). Sixty patients and 20 normal controls were tested at each centre. Differences in INR among the centres were assessed by one factor, analysis of variance. The bias for each centre was assessed by the t test. RESULTS: At all four centres higher INRs were consistently found with the rabbit plain reagent. Two of the centres showed significantly greater bias. CONCLUSIONS: There was a small but significant difference in INR results obtained directly with these two <b>reference</b> <b>reagents</b> at all four centres (mean 7. 35 %). This in part may result from the different responsiveness of the two IRP to the coumarin defect or to imprecision of the original ISI calibrations of the two plain WHO IRP. The findings support the adoption of a single master IRP, in accord with WHO recommendations, which would resolve the present anomalous situation...|$|R
40|$|While {{preparing}} slide agglutination test antisera and immunofluorescence conjugates for {{the identification}} of Legionella species and serogroups, we found {{that several of the}} reagents cross-reacted with Bordetella pertussis strains. To determine the extent of this problem and to estimate the specificity of Legionella reagents, we tested slide agglutination test antisera against 22 species and 35 serogroups with 92 bacterial strains representing 19 genera. The only cross-reactions observed were with Legionella pneumophila serogroup 10, L. maceachernii, L. gormanii, and L. feeleii serogroup 1 antisera and 4 of 10 B. pertussis strains. Nineteen conjugates, previously available from the Centers for Disease Control but no longer distributed as <b>reference</b> <b>reagents,</b> were tested with the four cross-reactive B. pertussis strains. Two conjugates, L. micdadei and L. wadsworthii, stained three of the B. pertussis strains at a fluorescence intensity of {{greater than or equal to}} 3 +. All cross-reactions were removed from the antisera and conjugates by absorption with the cross-reacting strain without diminishing the homologous reaction. Special emphasis should be placed on the identification and removal of cross-reactions in Legionella reagents with strains that have similar morphologic and growth characteristics...|$|R
