30|$|The strike plot {{is shown}} in Fig.  4. While {{comparing}} the different stations with each other, it gets obvious that GON 101, GON 102 and GON 201 are similar, but the azimuth of the polarization direction is slightly changing. GON 201 is the most upper station (within the sliding area) with a polarization azimuth of around 50 °, GON 102 around 40 ° and GON 101 around 20 – 30 °. The main direction of ground motion polarization is usually parallel to the slope deformation (e.g., Burjánek et al. 2010, 2017). Therefore, the slightly <b>rotating</b> <b>strike</b> angle could indicate that the rock-slide movement is not linear {{in the area of}} the three stations, but contains a rotation. Stations GON 202 (Fig.  4) and GONREF (Fig.  2) show both north–south polarized ground motion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{limitations on the}} constitutional right to strike that apply to public employees in France. While recognizing the right to strike for all salaried workers, whether employed in the private or public sector, the Preamble to the 1946 Constitution, incorporated by reference into the present Constitution, allows for limitations being imposed on that right by statute. Indeed, specific legislation has either prohibited or limited the right to strike for various classes of public employees. This has been held constitutionally valid insofar as the statutory bar or restriction is required to prevent essential functions of the State from being interrupted or {{to ensure that the}} vital needs of the country are being provided for. Even where no specific restrictive legislation applies, strikes by the staff of « public services » — including not only central and local government employees, but also employees of major nationalized industries, institutions such as hospitals, and even private undertakings providing some public utility or service — are subject, under the Labour Code, to a number of restrictions. In particular, five days' notice of the strike must be given by a representative union. And certains forms of <b>striking,</b> such as <b>rotating</b> <b>strikes,</b> are prohibited. In addition, the employer authority may, under the doctrine of « essential services », make administrative regulations identifying which units or staff positions are considered essential. These regulations are subject to review by the administrative courts on the basis that the constitutional right to strike may only be curtailed insofar as is needed to preserve State authority and security or the safety of the public...|$|R

40|$|On 2010 March 11, a {{sequence}} of large, shallow continental crust earthquakes shook central Chile. Two normal faulting events with magnitudes around M_w 7. 0 and M_w 6. 9 occurred just 15 min apart, located {{near the town of}} Pichilemu. These kinds of large intraplate, inland crustal earthquakes are rare above the Chilean subduction zone, and it is important to better understand their relationship with the 2010 February 27, M_w 8. 8, Maule earthquake, which ruptured the adjacent megathrust plate boundary. We present a broad seismological analysis of these earthquakes by using both teleseismic and regional data. We compute seismic moment tensors for both events via a W-phase inversion, and test sensitivities to various inversion parameters in order to assess the stability of the solutions. The first event, at 14 hr 39 min GMT, is well constrained, displaying a fault plane with strike of N 145 °E, and a preferred dip angle of 55 °SW, consistent with the trend of aftershock locations and other published results. Teleseismic finite-fault inversions for this event show a large slip zone along {{the southern part of the}} fault, correlating well with the reported spatial density of aftershocks. The second earthquake (14 hr 55 min GMT) appears to have ruptured a fault branching southward from the previous ruptured fault, within the hanging wall of the first event. Modelling seismograms at regional to teleseismic distances (Δ[*]> 10 °) is quite challenging because the observed seismic wave fields of both events overlap, increasing apparent complexity for the second earthquake. We perform both point- and extended-source inversions at regional and teleseismic distances, assessing model sensitivities resulting from variations in fault orientation, dimension, and hypocentre location. Results show that the focal mechanism for the second event features a steeper dip angle and a <b>strike</b> <b>rotated</b> slightly clockwise with respect to the previous event. This kind of geological fault configuration, with secondary rupture in the hanging wall of a large normal fault, is commonly observed in extensional geological regimes. We propose that both earthquakes form part of a typical normal fault diverging splay, where the secondary fault connects to the main fault at depth. To ascertain more information on the spatial and temporal details of slip for both events, we gathered near-fault seismological and geodetic data. Through forward modelling of near-fault synthetic seismograms we build a kinematic k^(− 2) earthquake source model with spatially distributed slip on the fault that, to first-order, explains both coseismic static displacement GPS vectors and short-period seismometer observations at the closest sites. As expected, the results for the first event agree with the focal mechanism derived from teleseismic modelling, with a magnitude M_w 6. 97. Similarly, near-fault modelling for the second event suggests rupture along a normal fault, M_w 6. 90, characterized by a steeper dip angle (dip = 74 °) and a <b>strike</b> clockwise <b>rotated</b> (<b>strike</b> = 155 °) with respect to the previous event...|$|R

25|$|In {{his prime}} Simpson {{was known for}} his {{technical}} correctness. At slightly below average height, his noted ability to bat for long periods was attributed to his high fitness and concentration levels. He had a wide array of shots, in particular off the back foot.

Simpson was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in <b>rotating</b> the <b>strike</b> with quick singles. Simpson's stance was easy and his style attractive, the result of a change of technique in the late 1950s when he turned from playing too square-on to side-on. Simpson found that it made all the difference to him in dealing effectively with the in-dipper and going-away balls. Standing 179cm and 13stone, Simpson was most effective as an attacking batsman. Simpson was best known for his straight-drive and powerfully hit square-cut, as well as an on-drive taken from his toes. He rarely played the hook shot, regarding it as risky, and used the pull shot in moderation. Early in his career, Simpson had a square-on stance but converted to a more side on position, finding it easier to deal with swing bowling.|$|R

Lawry was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in <b>rotating</b> the <b>strike</b> with quick singles. Lawry was known for his peculiar stance. He had little bend in his knees, and as a result batted with a stoop over his bat. He used his long reach to blunt spin bowling. He played with a very straight bat, combining well-organised defence with a somewhat limited range of strokes, marked by an efficiency of placement and an unusually heavy reliance on the hook shot. His strengths were regarded as his composure and intense concentration which powered a relentless single-mindedness. His defiant style was accentuated by his habit of tugging on his cap after every ball, as though starting afresh. John Snow wrote that 'He always had to be got out and even if you managed to knock all three stumps over he still stayed at the crease a moment looking round for some excuse to continue batting before reluctantly starting his walk back to the dressing room'. Lawry was also a left-hander during his winter baseball recreation, which equipped him with a powerful throwing arm.|$|R

They ended at 1/92 in 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, with 35 maidens, which was the slowest innings run rate to date in the series. Bradman finished unbeaten on 30 from 146 balls when the oft-interrupted match was finally terminated by a series of periodic rain interruptions. O'Reilly criticised the approach taken by the Australians in the closing stages of the match, attributing it to Bradman's orders. He said that the pitch was made so tame by the heavy rain that they could have played in a natural and attractive manner to entertain the spectators, rather than defending carefully. He said that Bradman's [...] "unwillingness to take a risk or to accept the challenging call of some particular phase of the game {{is one of the greatest}} flaws" [...] in his leadership.|$|R
