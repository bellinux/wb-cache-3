The mill was to the west, and now forms part of the Woodmill Outdoor Activities Centre, with the main building used as a canoe shop. The centre {{was set up in}} the late 1960s, and is a registered charity. The navigation officially continued downstream to a wharf at Northam, and although there was never a towpath on the tidal section, the Itchen Way long distance footpath follows the eastern bank of the river for most of the way. Nothing remains of Northam Quay, and the bridge has been rebuilt twice since the first construction of 1796, the last time in 1954. The river also passes under the A3035 Cobden Bridge, and a railway bridge built in 1866, with two sets of <b>round</b> <b>iron</b> columns supporting the structure over the main channel, which retains most of its original appearance and now forms part of the West Coastway Line.|$|E

60|$|The desert ceased, {{the caravan}} entered upon a vast but {{fruitful}} plain. In the extreme distance might be descried a long undulating line of palm-trees. The vanguard gave a shout, shook their tall lances in the air, and rattled their scimitars in rude chorus against their small <b>round</b> <b>iron</b> shields. All eyes sparkled, all hands were raised, all voices sounded, save {{those that were}} breathless from overpowering joy. After months wandering in the sultry wilderness, they beheld the great Euphrates.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} floor, two carts and a horse {{carriage}} were on display {{as the ground}} floor used {{to function as a}} garage. Most of the activities were held on the second floor, and where most of the artifacts are kept. As such, the living room, bedrooms, kitchen and dining room are all located in the upper floor.The living room and receiving area display an old Steinway piano, a gramophone, a sewing machine, an old telephone, and several paintings. Inside the bedrooms are four-post beds, chamber pots, and a birthing chair. The kitchen shows old items used for daily activities, such as the heavy chopped woods known as the prinsa de paa and prinsa de mano, as well as the <b>round</b> <b>irons</b> used to press clothes.|$|R

A {{piece of}} copper plate wrapped once <b>round</b> the <b>iron</b> {{cylinder}} like a socket, but with interposed paper to prevent contact, had its edges {{connected with the}} wires of the galvanometer.

5000|$|The few {{surviving}} <b>round</b> Scottish <b>Iron</b> Age towers {{known as}} brochs are often compared to tower houses, having mural passages and a basebatter, (a thickening {{of the wall}} that slopes obliquely, intended to prevent {{the use of a}} battering ram) although the entrances to Brochs are far less ostentatious.|$|R
60|$|The band {{consisted}} of two horns and three drums. Of the latter one was sheathed in leopard-skin and rubbed, not struck, with two curved sticks. A second was hourglass-shaped; the sticks were bent to right angles, and the drummer carried, by way of cymbal, a small <b>round</b> <b>iron</b> plate adjusted to the fingers with little rings loosely set in the edge. The horns were scrivelloes, elephant-tusks of small size. At times a horrid braying denoted the royal titles, and after every blast the liege lord responded mechanically, 'Kwámina Blay! atinásu marrah' (Monday Blay! here am I).|$|E
60|$|For a {{full minute}} she did not speak, possessed still by that strange terror and by a sort of shame. She did not even look at her son, but cast timid glances round his room. She saw a gallery at the far end, and a conical roof half made of glass. She saw {{curtains}} hanging all the gallery length, a table with tea-things and decanters, a <b>round</b> <b>iron</b> stove, rugs on the floor, and a large full-length mirror in {{the centre of the}} wall. A silver cup of flowers was reflected in that mirror. Mrs. Pendyce saw that they were dead, and the sense of their vague and nauseating odour was her first definite sensation.|$|E
6000|$|We {{rose and}} dressed {{ourselves}} for the fray, each {{putting on his}} chain armour shirt, for which garments at the present juncture we felt exceedingly thankful. Sir Henry went the whole length about the matter, and dressed himself like a native warrior. [...] "When you are in Kukuanaland, do as the Kukuanas do," [...] he remarked, as he drew the shining steel over his broad breast, which it fitted like a glove. Nor did he stop there. At his request Infadoos had provided him with {{a complete set of}} native war uniform. Round his throat he fastened the leopard-skin cloak of a commanding officer, on his brows he bound the plume of black ostrich feathers worn only by generals of high rank, and about his middle a magnificent moocha of white ox-tails. A pair of sandals, a leglet of goat's hair, a heavy battle-axe with a rhinoceros-horn handle, a <b>round</b> <b>iron</b> shield covered with white ox-hide, and the regulation number of tollas, or throwing-knives, made up his equipment, to which, however, he added his revolver. The dress was, no doubt, a savage one, but I am bound to say that I seldom saw a finer sight than Sir Henry Curtis presented in this guise. It showed off his magnificent physique to the greatest advantage, and when Ignosi arrived presently, arrayed in a similar costume, I thought to myself that I had never before seen two such splendid men.|$|E
5000|$|Mongolian {{barbecue}} (...) is a stir fried {{dish that}} was developed in Taiwanese restaurants {{beginning in the early}} 1950s. Meat and vegetables are cooked on large, <b>round,</b> solid <b>iron</b> griddles at temperatures of up to 300 °C (572 °F). Despite its name, the cuisine is not Mongolian, and is only loosely related to barbecue.|$|R
60|$|There was a pause, {{painful to}} Ursula and to Birkin. Hermione however seemed {{abstracted}} and calm.

5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, <b>rounded</b> <b>iron</b> kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|R
