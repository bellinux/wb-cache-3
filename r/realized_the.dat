5|$|After he had <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> {{validity}} of this geometric analogy, it took Einstein a further three years to find the missing cornerstone of his theory: the equations describing how matter influences spacetime's curvature. Having formulated what are now known as Einstein's equations (or, more precisely, his field equations of gravity), he presented his new theory of gravity at several sessions of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in late 1915, culminating in his final presentation on November 25, 1915.|$|E

Whale had one but refused to lend it, so Starfish kept him busy, telling him stories and grooming him to remove parasites, while the others stole the canoe. When Whale <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> trick he beat Starfish ragged, which is how Starfish still is today.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to {{government}} expectations the reform was neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests plummeted and the reform itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans.

Heinrich Himmler coordinated several design activities for Hitler, including: the all-black SS-uniform designed by Professor Karl Diebitsch and Walter Heck in 1933; the Dachau concentration camp, designed by Theodor Eicke, and prototypes for other Nazi concentration camps; and the Wewelsburg redesign commissioned by Heinrich Himmler in 1944.|$|E

40|$|By using a twin-core fiber (TCF), {{we propose}} and {{demonstrate}} a novel distributed SPR sensor, which employs both the {{time division multiplexing}} (TDM) technology and the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology together. The proposed sensor has two sensing passages with four sensing channels (and there are two sensing channels in each sensing passage). We employ the TDM technology to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> two passage distributed sensing, which are parallel-connection; and we employ the WDM technology to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> distributed sensing of two channels in a sensing passage, which are series-connected. In order to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> TDM technology, we employ a two-core fiber, which has two cores in a same cladding, being equal to dividing the traditional single core into two independent sensing zones; in order to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> WDM technology, we employ a fiber end polishing-connecting method to adjust the resonance angle/wavelength to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> dynamic range separation. This twin-passage four-channel twin-core fiber SPR sensor is suitable for applying in fields of the multi-channel liquid refractive index and temperature self-reference measurement...|$|R

5|$|Inquiries {{were made}} through {{official}} channels {{about the prospect of}} Murphy attending West Point upon his return to the United States, but he never enrolled. According to author Don Graham, Murphy suggested the idea and then dropped it, possibly when he <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam. Murphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, for temporary duty and reassignment.|$|E
