40|$|AbstractDisability {{requires}} a complete reorientation of roles by the individual. The disabled individual's redefinition of roles takes place through social interaction with his family, friends, co workers, other disabled persons {{and members of}} his community and the medical staff as well as <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>officers.</b> The important difficulty for the disabled is that his disability affects his interaction with others. He cannot rely on old patterns and role expectations. He must therefore reconstruct many of his social relationships with others as he rebuilds his roles and modifies his self- identity.

40|$|Sight loss is a {{major health}} issue that impacts on all aspects of {{wellbeing}} including daily functioning and mental health. Vision rehabilitation services aim to help people learn how to live as independently as possible, to build confidence and to maintain quality of life following full or partial sight loss. Vision rehabilitation services are provided by qualified vision <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>officers.</b> The services they offer include a range of interventions such as: orientation and mobility training; emotional support; communication skills; independent living skills; equipment training; and risk assessments. Vision rehabilitation services are usually funded by local councils and provided either by in-house teams or contracted-out services.

40|$|This paper {{affirms the}} {{importance}} of lighting as a technology {{in the context of}} people with sight loss. Its importance lies in the ability of appropriate lighting interventions to support independent living and to reduce the likelihood of falls and accidents. The concept of “assistive lighting” is introduced with a set of tenets by which the merits of different lighting interventions can be considered. The tenets are derived from research on lighting and sight loss, including a thorough review of the literature; and consultation in the period from 2008 to 2010 with over 80 rehabilitation workers and occupational therapists in the United Kingdom. They affirm the need for lighting to be appropriate, sufficient, even, adjustable, sustainable and energy efficient, simple and adaptable. Examples of different lighting interventions are provided and these are considered in relation to the tenets. One of the key outcomes of the research was publication of a guide to good practice on lighting interventions for people with sight loss. Implications for Rehabilitation • Assistive lighting has important implications for rehabilitation in relation to people with sight loss. • Simple lighting interventions carry the potential for improving the independence and quality of life of people with sight loss and can reduce the risk of accidents. • The tenets by which options for lighting interventions can be considered can assist <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>officers</b> and occupational therapists in their work. • Lighting can be considered as a factor of increasing importance within the broader context of universal design...|$|R

40|$|Background: Visual Rehabilitation Officers {{help people}} with a visual {{impairment}} maintain their independence. This intervention adopts a flexible, goal-centred approach, which may include training in mobility, use of optical and non-optical aids, and performance of activities of daily living. Although Visual Rehabilitation Officers {{are an integral part}} of the low vision service in the United Kingdom, evidence that they are effective is lacking. The purpose of this exploratory trial is to estimate the impact of a Visual <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Officer</b> on self-reported visual function, psychosocial and quality-of-life outcomes in individuals with low vision. Methods/design: In this exploratory, assessor-masked, parallel group, randomised controlled trial, participants will be allocated either to receive home visits from a Visual <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Officer</b> (n = 30) or to a waiting list control group (n = 30) in a 1 : 1 ratio. Adult volunteers with a visual impairment, who have been identified as needing <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>officer</b> input by a social worker, will take part. Those with an urgent need for a Visual <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Officer</b> or who have a cognitive impairment will be excluded. The primary outcome measure will be self-reported visual function (48 -item Veterans Affairs Low Vision Visual Functioning Questionnaire). Secondary outcome measures will include psychological and quality-of-life metrics: the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9), the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), the Adjustment to Age-related Visual Loss Scale (AVL- 12), the Standardised Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ- 5 D) and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The interviewer collecting the outcomes will be masked to the group allocations. The analysis will be undertaken on a complete case and intention-to-treat basis. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be applied to follow-up questionnaire scores, with the baseline score as a covariate. Discussion: This trial is expected to provide robust effect size estimates of the intervention effect. The data will be used to design a large-scale randomised controlled trial to evaluate fully the Visual <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Officer</b> intervention. A rigorous evaluation of <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Officer</b> input is vital to direct a future low vision rehabilitation strategy and to help direct government resources.

40|$|Metvest {{body armour}} is worn by over 30, 000 Metropolitan Police Officers patrolling {{the streets of}} London. Some {{officers}} have complained of lower back pain and have attributed the cause to wearing Metvest. This has raised {{the question as to}} whether or not wearing police body armour is related to low back pain issues. In order to investigate this, a study was carried out to determine the physiological effect of wearing body armour. This was assessed by measuring spinal torque / range of motion (RoM), muscle activity (EMG) during spinal flexion and extension, functional health score and subjective back pain, in both a Control Group and a non-specific Low Back Pain Group (LBP - identified by Occupational Health), to determine differences between these two groups. Additionally, the LBP group underwent an 8 week rehabilitation programme, devised and executed by Occupational Health, MPS. Functional and subjective assessments were taken group prior, mid and post rehabilitation. Data showed that wearing Metvest body armour did not have a significant effect on either spinal range of motion nor spinal muscle activity during forward flexion and backward extension in either the control or LBP subjects. Following completion of the MPS <b>rehabilitation</b> programme, the <b>officers</b> diagnosed with Low Back Pain exhibited improvements in spinal flexibility, control level spinal muscle activity, increased muscle power and physical capability and a significant decrease in subjective pain scores. It should be noted that during this <b>rehabilitation</b> period <b>officers</b> were still wearing MetVest whilst on normal duty.

Phase II of the Lottie Hobson Centre was completed. A merger between the Liverpool Workshops and Birkenhead Society for the Blind resulted in the opening of Henshaws Merseyside Resource Centre in The Strand, Liverpool, in April 1993. In June 1993, in collaboration with Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, the Society established a Patient Support Service to provide advice, information, support, counselling and rehabilitation to patients attending hospital appointments. In 1995 A Community Housing initiative in Newcastle was developed for people leaving long hospital stays. The project began in 1994 {{with the opening of}} a home for five people. In March 1995, Henshaws Head Office and Greater Manchester Resource Centre moved to new premises in Talbot Road, Old Trafford. John Derby House, named after the late 18th Earl of Derby, President of the Society for 46 years, was officially opened in September 1995 by his nephew, the 19th Earl of Derby. Its School of Visual Impairment Studies based at Henshaw's College opened to provide training for <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Officers.</b> It quickly became established as a leading training provider - the only one {{of its kind in the}} North of England. In 1996 The Godfrey Ermen Home officially opened on April 26. In 1997 The Society celebrated its 160th Anniversary by holding a range of fundraising and profile raising events.

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyse the {{short-term}} outcomes of the introduction of a scientist–practitioner model of education, comprising compulsory research, to the pre-registration training of osteopaths. Materials and methods Pre-registration training of osteopaths underwent a radical shift in 1994 with the commencement of osteopathic education at Victoria University. This new university programme used a scientist–practitioner model of education requiring that all students understand the scientific method, and develop skills in the analysis and conduct of clinical research. The programme comprised a double award: Bachelor of Science (Clinical Science) and Master of Health Science (Osteopathy). All students are required to complete research to the level of a Masters minor thesis prior to graduation. Cohort: Over the 1998 – 2001 academic years, Victoria University awarded 135 graduates with Master of Health Science (Osteopathy) degrees. This sample may be viewed as four subsamples (n = 23 graduates in 1998; n = 35 graduates in 1999; n = 35 graduates in 2000; and n = 42 graduates in 2001). Measures: Short-term outcomes of the scientist-practitioner education model were measured in terms of peer-reviewed publications and graduate employment pathways. Results All graduates completed theses/treatises assessed as ‘passed’ at the Masters level. Twenty-six progressed their work to peer-reviewed publication, comprising 21 peer-reviewed journal articles, 11 conference presentations, one conference poster presentation, and one book contribution (data used in development of a book chapter). Nine graduates published their work in more than one forum. Two graduates produced a combined publication. Presently, all graduates work at least part-time in private osteopathic practice (manual therapy). Two, and until recently three, graduates have permanent part-time employment in academia in osteopathic education. Many others contribute to the educational life of osteopaths, and other complimentary therapists (e. g. naturopaths) as sessional/casual teachers. Two graduates are employed full-time as <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>officers</b> for third-party providers (insurers). One graduate has commenced further research as a doctoral candidate. Conclusion The scientist–practitioner model of osteopathic education has led to increased research activity and subsequent peer-reviewed publication in osteopathy, and has broadened practise opportunities for graduates. It is noteworthy however that the vast majority of graduates seek, and obtain, full time employment in osteopathy (manual therapy), and engage in no research or publication in the years immediately following university graduation and osteopathic registration...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{measured}} the outcomes of low vision care but these have usually been longitudinal case series, thus constituting very low quality of evidence for effectiveness. To date, there have been no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which have evaluated the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of different models of care in low vision. The size of the low vision population and the paucity of systematic evaluation have created a pressing need for evidence about cost-effectiveness in order to inform service developments for low vision rehabilitation. This paper describes the study design and methodology of a three-arm RCT currently under way in Manchester. The baseline population recruited is also described. A traditional hospital-based optometric service is being compared with an integrated service (comprising the addition of community-based <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>officer</b> input) and with more generic community input (which is non-integrated and is not vision specific). A wide range of outcome measures are being assessed at recruitment and 12 months post-intervention, including low vision specific and generic quality of life measures, patterns of low vision aid use, and task performance.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} explore the role of Community Disability Workers (CDWs) in facilitating {{livelihood}} opportunities for disabled youth in rural Southern Botswana. The CDWs in the study worked in Community- based Rehabilitation (CBR) programmes. The elements of the Livelihood component of CBR Guidelines include skills development, self-employment, waged employment, financial assistance and social security. In particular, the study presented the knowledge, skills, practices (activities and methods), and strategies used by CDWs to facilitate access to the livelihood opportunities for disabled youths in rural areas. The literature review explored CBR as a strategy for addressing the needs and demands of people with disabilities. Botswana has implemented a CBR programme which is co-ordinated at the Rehabilitation Division of the Ministry of Health and involves disabled people, health professionals, the community and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). Community health workers coordinate disability activities in rural as well as urban areas and comprise a range of health care practitioners namely physiotherapists, social workers, <b>rehabilitation</b> technicians, <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>officers</b> and health education assistants. In this study, community health workers were referred to as CDWs and only those with tertiary qualifications (certificate, diploma or degree level of training) were used as participants. Methodology: A qualitative research approach using a case study design was adopted. Purposive sampling was used to select seven participants from districts {{in the southern part}} of Botswana to participate in the study. The unit of study were the practices of the CDW in facilitating access to livelihood opportunities for disabled youth. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews with the CDWs. Interviews were digitally recorded and later transcribed verbatim. Analysis of data involved coding for themes and categories emerging from the data in the context within which it appeared. The environmental chapters of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) were used for data interpretation. Findings: The findings of the study illustrated the role of CDWs in facilitating livelihood opportunities for disabled youth. Five themes that emerged were related to CDWsâ€™ own experience of disability and rural environments, their knowledge and experience in facilitating livelihoods; their practices and strategies; the barriers to participation experienced by disabled youth; and lastly, the CDWsâ€™ suggestions for increasing participation and inclusion of disabled youth in livelihood opportunities. The findings established that CDWs were involved in facilitating access to health facilities and assistive devices as well as education and skills development. Some strategies used were advocacy, networking, information dissemination, role modelling and follow-ups on former students. The barriers identified were inadequate disability policy; absence of disability friendly public facilities and transport; a poorly resourced public education system and inaccessible job markets. Suggestions made by CDWs included having inclusive policies and structures; addressing educational and training needs; accountability regarding employment; and community sensitisation and mobilisation. The Discussion chapter interpreted the findings in terms of current literature and developed two further themes. One addressed the environmental factors impacting on disability and the other one addressed successful strategies to enhance livelihood opportunities in light of these environmental factors. Recommendations included facilitating information on accessibility of assistive devices; minimising barriers to natural and made-made changes to the environment; building a network of supportive relationships; changing attitudes of community as well as government leadership; and facilitating implementation of inclusive services, systems and policies. In Conclusion, CDWs are well placed to facilitate accessibility of livelihood opportunities for disabled youth. However, they need to be empowered with necessary resources such as disability inclusive policies, systems and services, attitudinal changes and revision of their training modules...|$|R
