50|$|Without the {{rotation}} field, the four numbers specify a box {{the center of}} which isat (xpos, ypos) and is length across in x and width tall in y.All numbers in CIF are integers that refer to centimicrons of distance, unless subroutinescaling is specified (described later).The optional rotation field contains two numbers that define a vector endpointstarting at the origin.The default value of this field is (1, 0), which is a right-pointing vector.Thus the <b>rotation</b> <b>clause</b> 10 5 defines a 26.6-degree counterclockwise rotation from the normal.Similarly, 10 -10 will rotate clockwise by 45 degrees.Note that {{the magnitude of this}} rotation vector has no meaning.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to simply invoking the subroutine, a CALL statement can includetransformations {{to affect the}} geometry inside the subroutine.Three transformations {{can be applied to}} a subroutine in CIF: translation, rotation, and mirroring.Translation is specified as the letter T followed by an x, y offset.These offsets will be added to all coordinates in the subroutine, to translate itsgraphics across the mask.Rotation is specified as the letter R followed by an x, y vector endpointthat, much like the <b>rotation</b> <b>clause</b> in the BOX statement, defines a line to the origin.The unrotated line has the endpoint (1, 0), which points to the right.Mirroring is available in two forms: MX to mirror in x and MY to mirror in y.Mirroring is a bit confusing, because MX causes a negation of the xcoordinate, which effectively mirrors about the y axis.|$|E
