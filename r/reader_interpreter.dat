40|$|Thesis (MTh (Old and New Testament)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the trends that are found in commentaries on the book of Exodus and their {{appropriateness}} in the African context. The study also seeks to move from a socio-political understanding of Exodus as liberation theology to the cultural understanding of Exodus as African theology. The following three trends are found in modern commentaries on Exodus as explored by this thesis: • Historical-critical approach – dealing with the world behind the text or author centred criticism. Commentaries found under this group include those of M Noth (1962), TE Fretheim (1990), N Sarna (1991), B S Childs (1977) and WHC Propp (1999). • Literary-critical approach – this deals with the text itself or it is text centred. Commentaries found in this category include: W Brueggemann (1994), J G Janzen (1997) and C Houtman (1993). • Theological-critical approach – deals with the world {{in front of the}} text. Commentaries of GV Pixley (1987), J Durham (1987) and G Ashby (1998) are good examples of the latter named approach. Exploration into the study of the above listed three trends and their corresponding modern commentaries show that the commentaries are not fully appropriate in the context of Africa (except Ashby). This is so because the above modern commentaries have not directly addressed the ongoing issues of poverty, political, economic, oppression, marginalization, HIV / AIDS, cultural and social issues, famine, racial and sex discrimination, religious crises, and other epidemics and natural disasters prominently found in Africa - particularly among the third world countries. The modern commentaries mentioned above are indirectly relevant for Africa since the topics which they address, resonate with the <b>readers</b> and <b>interpreters</b> of Exodus in Africa. This resonance is possible if <b>readers</b> and <b>interpreters</b> of Exodus in Africa find similarities between modern commentaries and their own current context. The study also shows that the three trends found in modern commentaries on Exodus are dependent on one another to bring forth a meaningful interpretation. Based on this working relationship between the three trends mentioned above, it is suggested that the three trends should be considered in close connection with one another. Biblical interpretation in Africa must do justice to the literary, historical and theological aspects of the Bible to be meaningful and appropriate in Africa...|$|R

It is a story that is replete with allusions to Freudian psychoanalysis, both general ideas or theories and individual case studies. We argue here that its experimental status extends to this feature. Its incorporation of Freudian motifs represents the beginning of an attempt by Beckett to move beyond or improve upon his previous engagement with Freud in his fiction, with which he was somewhat dissatisfied. The change is signified in his parodic or unserious invocations of Freud, which differ from his earlier stories; while we concede that the approach is not very successful, in literary terms, in terms of Beckett’s corpus and development as a writer it deserves attention. Having identified many of his Freudian sources and the character of his deployment of them, we note the difficulties his chosen approach presents for both writers and <b>readers</b> or <b>interpreters.</b> We close by pointing out the critical shortcomings that must follow on failure to attend to the story’s essentially Freudian framework, exemplified in an essay on the story by Julia Kristeva...|$|R

An aspect of his work that has received less attention {{is a set of}} methodological reflections on intellectual history and on the relationship between philosophy and history. Hadot was trained initially as a philosopher and was interested in existentialism {{as well as in the}} convergence between philosophy and poetry. Yet he chose to become a historian of philosophy and produced extensive philological work on neo-Platonism and ancient philosophy in general. He found a philosophical rationale for this shift in his encounter with Wittgenstein's philosophy in the mid- 1950 s (Hadot was one of Wittgenstein's earliest French <b>readers</b> and <b>interpreters).</b> For Hadot, ancient philosophy must be understood as a series of language games, and each language game must be situated within the concrete conditions in which it happened. The reference to Wittgenstein therefore supports a strongly contextualist and historicist stance. It also supports its exact opposite: presentist appropriations of ancient texts are entirely legitimate, and they are the only way ancient philosophy can be existentially meaningful to us. Hadot addresses the contradiction by embracing it fully and claiming that his own practice aims at a coincidence of opposites (a concept borrowed from the Heraclitean tradition). For Hadot the fullest and truest way of doing philosophy is to be a philosopher and a historian at the same time...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{discuss the}} figures of Philomela and the {{nightingale}} as they originate in Ovid, and in representations of them in medieval English poetry as separate entities. The bird who migrates to England each spring serves as a positive symbol for springtime love, but her connections to Philomela as a victim are always present, producing literature that continues to silence her suffering and removing the nightingale from the woman who sought justice. I begin the discussion with a reading of Chaucer's The Legende of Good Women, where we see the male narrator becoming "infected" by that which he reads, and then re-enacts the silencing of Philomela by cutting her story short. This {{is followed by a}} discussion of Sir John Clanvowe's The Cuckoo and the Nightingale, where we encounter the nightingale independent of Philomela, where she serves as a source of relief for the troubled, lustful narrator. Lydgate's poem "The Nightingale" continues the written tradition of separating the two figures while drawing upon their past. Lydgate even lures his readers with a promise of content similar to that of previous tales as a template for learning mental and physical constraint. "The Nightingale" explores the human cognitive process and the function of <b>readers</b> as <b>interpreters,</b> assigning the nightingale a role of heightened importance to elevate her above sexist representation. His poem creates a complex relationship between the nightingale as a highly sexual pagan character, as a symbol of springtime love, and as a religious reminder of Christ's sufferin...|$|R
40|$|The Treatise on the Mahāyāna Awakening of Faith, an {{indigenous}} Chinese composition {{written in the}} guise of an Indian Buddhist treatise, {{is one of the most}} influential texts in the history of East Asian Buddhism. Its outline of the doctrines of buddha nature (foxing), buddha bodies (foshen), and one mind (yixin), among others, served from the medieval period onwards as one of the main foundations of East Asian Buddhist thought and practice. The Treatise is putatively attributed to the Indian writer Aṡvaghosa, and its current Chinese version was traditionally conceived of as a translation from an original Sanskrit text. In the course of the twentieth century, however, many important scholars of Buddhism have called into question the textual history of the Treatise. Even if the specific circumstances of its creation are still largely unknown, the view that the Treatise is an original Chinese composition (not necessarily written by a native Chinese) is now prevalent among scholars. Meanwhile, and for more than one hundred years, the text has also become a source of knowledge of Buddhism in the West thanks to a number of English translations. After examining the early textual history of the two existing versions of the text, this article will offer some examples of its modern appropriation by a novel group of <b>readers</b> and <b>interpreters,</b> an appropriation that took place during the first decades of the twentieth century amidst efforts to re-envision Chinese and East Asian Buddhist history and the place of Buddhism in modern society. © School of Oriental and African Studies...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{considers}} the novel of Joseph and Aseneth (J & A) as an allegorical text which was transmitted in various cultural environments, potentially from the poly-cultural background of Hellenistic Judaism {{to the time}} of the novel's extant manuscripts in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. While positing that J & A was conceived as a versatile text {{around the time of the}} rise of the ancient Greek novel, the thesis highlights the sophisticated literary features of this religious text. In fact, the imagery of J & A is loaded with further significance, touching upon mystical themes which can be compared with pagan testimonies of arcane lore and mysteries. Moreover, typical scenes in J & A are devised by means of complex rhetorical strategies, which contributed to the addition of further senses to the story. Indeed, the allegorical discourse which can be detected in J & A conferred to the novel a plain narrative surface, while leaving a deeper significance for its <b>readers</b> and <b>interpreters</b> to decode. In this respect, J & A is brought closer to Classical texts such as the ancient novels and Homeric literature, because its narrative allowed subsequent interpretations and even adaptations of the story in different cultural and religious contexts. While points of contact between J & A and pagan, Jewish and Christian allegorical texts may be only suggestive, the present analysis hopes to envisions a few proposals for the early purpose and aftermath of J & A from its hypothetical original milieu in Hellenistic Judaism to the end of Antiquity.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{unconventional}} {{history of the}} interpretation of Day One, Genesis 1. 1 - 5, in Hebrew and Greek texts up to c. 200 CE. Using the concept of ‘intertextuality’ as developed by Kristeva, Derrida, and others, the method for this historical exploration looks at the dynamic interconnectedness of texts. The results reach beyond deliberate exegetical and eisegetical interpretations of Day One to include intertextual, and therefore not necessarily deliberate, connections between texts. The {{purpose of the study}} is to gain a glimpse into the textual possibilities available to the ancient <b>reader</b> / <b>interpreter.</b> Central to the method employed is the identification of the intertexts of Day One. This is achieved, at least in part, by identifying and tracing flags that may draw the reader from one text to another. In this study these flags are called ‘intertextual markers’ and may be individual words, word-pairs, or small phrases that occur relatively infrequently within the corpus of texts being examined. The thesis first explores the intertextuality of Genesis 1. 1 - 5 in the confines of the Hebrew Bible and the Septuagint. The second half of the thesis identifies and explores the intertexts of Day One in other Hebrew texts (e. g. the Dead Sea Scrolls, Sirach) and other Greek texts (e. g. Philo, the New Testament) up to c. 200 CE. The thesis concludes with a summation of some of the more prominent and surprising threads in this intertextual ‘tapestry’ of Day One. These summary threads include observations within the texts in a given language and a comparative look at the role of language in the intertextual history of Day One.

Lisa Hopkins has called it [...] "a novel no more amenable to generic classification than the rest of Stoker's fiction" [...] due to its being [...] "Part Love story, part political tract, part treasure quest and part tale of the supernatural". Indeed, depending on the points of focus of the <b>reader</b> or <b>interpreter,</b> The Mystery of the Sea could easily be classified as a Gothic novel, an adventure novel, or a political novel. However, its amalgamation of the political and the supernatural bring it closest to the genre of [...] "Imperial Gothic" [...] as defined by Patrick Brantlinger. Imperial Gothic, according to Brantlinger, [...] "combines the seemingly progressive, often Darwinian ideology of imperialism with a seemingly antithetical interest in the occult." [...] The Imperial Gothic as a genre has been associated with works such as Dracula and Rider Haggard's appropriately, Hopkins designates these two novels as the [...] "closest antecedents" [...] to The Mystery of the Sea in terms of genre. While The Mystery of the Sea does not explicitly refer to colonization and does not address fears of degeneration into savagery as do many novels in the Imperial Gothic realm, Stoker's novel addresses the occult within a cross-cultural context, and race is a pervasive theme. Stoker creates a multi-layered historical and political background by setting the events of the novel during the Spanish–American War but with a centuries-old basis in the sixteenth-century conflict between England and Spain. In this manner, the Spanish are presented as a looming threat to Anglo-American society, and the struggle of power and values characteristic of Imperial fiction manifests itself here on a domestic level, with fears of invasion reminiscent of Dracula. The occult plays a role in confronting this foreign threat to power and stability through Archibald's gift of Second Sight and the presence of an ongoing dialogue on fate {{in the midst of the}} political intrigue.|$|R
40|$|Surrealism and the Art of Crime” {{examines}} {{the role of}} crime and crime discourse in the conceptual universe of the Surrealist movement. It focuses upon periods in the movement 2 ̆ 7 s history when the idea of crime becomes instrumental in reshaping the group 2 ̆ 7 s structure, politics, and intellectual affiliations. Not only did criminality provoke some of the group 2 ̆ 7 s most important collective projects, but it also provides a critical means for addressing {{some of the more}} daunting methodological problems encountered when writing about Surrealism and modernism. Indeed, if André Breton describes the “simplest Surrealist act” as an act of random assassination, then the “art” of crime can account for even the most complex of surrealist acts: its attempts to fuse philosophy, literature, and art with politics and experience. For the Surrealists, the local impact of contemporary crimes and their representation in the media afforded a means for addressing the problems and limits of the immediate cultural order. At the same time, the more broadly historical forms of detective mysteries, gothic novels, and the “criminal” fictions of Poe, Sade, and Lautréamont are instrumental to the Surrealists 2 ̆ 7 sense of historicity. The allusions to crime and crime literature in Surrealist art and writing form a condensed and dismembered body of knowledge that addresses the modalities of experience in the modern world. In turn, this surrealist intervention can throw new light on the more “populist” forms of Surrealism that have arisen {{in the aftermath of the}} Second World War, from the critical concept of film noir, to the violent comic universe of a hard-boiled American writer like Chester Himes. ^ Approaching the Surrealists as <b>readers</b> and <b>interpreters</b> of culture as well as avant-garde artists and agitators, “Surrealism and the Art of Crime” draws from both “high” and popular literature, film and philosophy, psychoanalysis and politics, journalism and public affairs. If revolution became the banner under which the Surrealists attempted to unify these fields of knowledge, then the group 2 ̆ 7 s more subtle, yet equally pervasive, interest in crime affords new ways of addressing how the movement, as well as how modernism itself, began to realize the stakes of this revolutionary project. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores and {{analyzes}} Origen of Alexandria’s {{conviction that}} Scripture is itself the enfleshed Christ, or that “in the Scriptures the Word became flesh {{that he might}} tabernacle among us” (Philoc 15. 19). For Origen, Scripture as the “Word of the Lord” {{is identical to the}} Word who was “with God,” and who “was God” in the Johannine Prologue. The Word assumes flesh not only in his birth, but also through the words and phrases of the patriarchs, prophets, and apostles. As a result, many scholars have noted the interesting “parallel” or “analogy” Origen draws between Scripture and the Incarnation, but this study provides the first comprehensive and focused treatment of Scripture as incarnate Word in Origen’s work. Ultimately, it demonstrates that for Origen, biblical interpretation is nothing less than a direct noetic encounter with the person of Christ, allowing the reader to know him in any time or place, to see him transfigured in the movement from the letter to the spirit, and even to consume his flesh and blood. Following an introductory chapter, the project consists of two parts. Part One (Chapters Two and Three) addresses the nature of “scriptural flesh” in Origen’s work. Chapter Two seeks to articulate what it means for the Word to become “flesh” in the first place, as well as what is required to “lift the veil” and perceive that flesh as divine. By examining the role of the cross in Origen’s Christology, it demonstrates that it is only in light of the Passion, through the lens of the crucified Christ, that the divinity of both man (Jesus) and text (Scripture) is made manifest. Chapter Three looks to define this scriptural “flesh” in Origen’s thought, specifically by relying on the doctrine of the epinoiai (the “aspects” or biblical titles of Christ). It is the epinoiai that clothe Christ and give him shape through the text. Part Two (Chapters Four and Five) addresses the theological and spiritual implications for the <b>reader</b> and <b>interpreter</b> of Scripture. Chapter Four examines the “coming of Christ” (parousia) as an individualized noetic phenomenon, brought about by the Christological reading of Scripture in any time or place. Finally, Chapter Five addresses the consumption of Christ through the Scriptures, which turns out to be much more about hermeneutics than about sacramental theology. A short conclusion follows, raising some of the broader implications for Origen studies {{as well as for the}} study of early Christian biblical exegesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficult}} questions of Toomas PaulToomas Paul, born in Tartu in 1939, is a prominent theologian,church historian, New Testament scholar and translator, as wellas an essayist, {{and a member}} of Academia Scientiarum et ArtiumEuropaea. He took part in the preparation of the Porvoo CommonStatement (1992) and attended the Lutheran-Orthodox Joint Commissionfor 12 years. Paul has published 19 books and countless articles,and still often gets press coverage concerning current problemsin different fields. He is deeply interested in science and culture andhas held a constant dialogue with physicists, neurologists, historiansand other professionals. His sermons, articles, conversations on theradio and TV have always interested different communities due tohis intellectual spirit, wittiness, honesty and broad mental horizon. At the same time, his chosen topics can be uneasy (data leaks, migration,prostitution, etc.), he is equally critical towards totalitarian andconsumer societies, while he even censures some church activities. Paul studied in Tallinn and worked at eight parish churches inthe countryside from 1960 to 1986. From then on he served at StJohn’s Church in the centre of Tallinn, and, since 1989, at SutlepaChapel on the premises of the Estonian Open Air Museum. Among other things, Paul’s connection to Tartu is that his teacherand collaborator Uku Masing (1909 – 1985), whose legacy he interpretsand publishes to this day in cooperation with Tartu scholars,resided there. Paul received his doctoral degree (1994, on the historyof Bible translation in Estonia) at the University of Tartu and hastaught at and {{been a member of the}} Religious Anthropology ProgramCommittee. Rector Volli Kalm, who presented Paul with the NationalThought Award on behalf of the University of Tartu, called Paul acustodian of basic values and stressed his importance in shaping socialmentality. Paul has been awarded many other prizes. In the article, I present biographical data and briefly characterizePaul as a <b>reader</b> and <b>interpreter</b> of theologians and philosophers likeMeister Eckhart or Spinoza, scientists and others, as well as an author. I am also publishing an unique questionnaire that he presentedto his audience already in the 1960 s as a young cleric, and outline the{{difficult questions}} about religion he has raised in his publications. I quote other authors and archival sources of the Consistory of theEstonian Evangelical Lutheran Church, adding passages from Paul’spersonal archives and our correspondence to show why he is highlyrecognised in both the religious and secular societies of Estonia...|$|R
