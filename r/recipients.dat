40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to model the}} sequence of events that occurs after amnioreduction, laser therapy, and digoxin administration in twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) with and without a hydropic <b>recipient</b> twin. STUDY DESIGN: We added amnioreduction, laser therapy, and digoxin administration to our mathematical TTTS model and simulated combinations of these therapies. RESULTS: With a nonhydropic <b>recipient,</b> simulated amnioreduction delays the onset of hydrops. Conversely, with a hydropic <b>recipient,</b> amnioreduction aggravates the degree of hydrops. Furthermore, amnioreduction increases the transplacental fluid flow and may temporarily cause a hydropic donor. Laser therapy terminates the cause of <b>recipient</b> hydrops. Digoxin reduces the degree of <b>recipient</b> hydrops, but increases arteriovenous fetofetal transfusion. CONCLUSION: Laser therapy is superior in TTTS with a hydropic <b>recipient,</b> because simulated amnioreduction aggravates the <b>recipient's</b> cardiovascular status. Digoxin benefits a hydropic <b>recipient</b> but slightly worsens the donor's condition. Therefore, TTTS presenting with a hydropic <b>recipient</b> prior to fetal viability (approximately 26 weeks) may be best treated with laser therapy, whereas more advanced gestations may be offered digoxin administration plus amnioreduction, to delay the progression of TTT...|$|R

5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German language: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its {{variants}} {{were the}} highest awards in the military of the Third Reich. <b>Recipients</b> are grouped by grades of the Knight's Cross. During or shortly after World War II, 318 German sailors and servicemen of the Kriegsmarine received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Of these, 316 presentations were formally made. Two <b>recipients</b> received the award after 11 May 1945, when Großadmiral Karl Dönitz ordered a cease of promotions and illegalized subsequent awards.
