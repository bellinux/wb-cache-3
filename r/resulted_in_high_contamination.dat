40|$|The {{demand for}} iodine- 125 (125 I) {{as a medical}} {{radioisotope}} {{for use in the}} treatment of prostate cancer continues to increase. However, due to uncertainties with current commercial production facilities, potential supply issues have emerged prompting several reactors worldwide to consider the development and installation of large-scale 125 I production facilities. In 2002, MNRC installed and operated successfully for ~ 1. 5 years, a closed loop system using aluminum material for containment of the enriched 124 Xe (99 %) target during irradiation. However, problems with design features and restrictions on serviceability and repairs ultimately forced MNRC to abandon it as a first target failure <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>contamination</b> levels in the whole system which further restricted personnel accessibility. Today, a new target and a multi-compartment (modular) transport and decay system with automatic operation and dispensing of high-level batches of 125 I and with ready access for maintenance and repairs have been designed to resume 125 I production activities. The new operating conditions provide ample opportunities for increased production with shorter irradiation times...|$|E

The germplasm of the species was collected from Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country, rich in unexplored Zingiberaceae genetic resources. Rhizome buds were directly regenerated on the Murashige and Skoog medium containing a growth regulator, 6 -benzyladenine and a commercial fungicide, Benlate (50 % of Benomyl). The pre-treatment protocol did not contain HgCl 2, a toxic pollutant for Curcuma amada, Curcuma longa, Zingiber barbatum and Kaempferia galanga. Plantlets were regenerated from the buds without any intervention of the callus phase. The contamination free survival of the bud explants from Curcuma, Zingiber and Kaempferia was more than 75, 57 and 53 %, respectively. Buds from immature rhizomes were difficult to regenerate on the media, as well as <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>higher</b> <b>contamination</b> percentages while the buds from mature rhizomes efficiently regenerated with very few contamination percentages.

The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the biodiversity of Bifidobacterium species in the informal dairy production chain in Abidjan and evaluate their potential antibacterial activity against pathogens. Bifidobacterium species were identified after sequencing of hsp 60 genes. Results showed that Bifidobacterium were present in 9 % of samples. Milkers' hands (14 %) and cows’s udders (14 %) were the most contaminated with Bifidobacterium. These isolates belong to five different species. Most Bifidobacterium isolated are Bifidobacterium minimum (53 %) and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. Globosum (24. 4 %). The other strains are composed of one strain of Bifidobacterium thermophilum, Bifidobacterium thermacidophilum subsp. suis and Bifidobacterium magnum. The isolated Bifidobacterium species have antibacterial activities that are not related to bacteriocins production, but to organic acids production (65 %), which exert in vitro inhibitory action against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella hadar and Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O 27 and Escherichia coli O 157 H 7.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of pathogen bacteria in surface waters {{is a threat}} to public health worldwide. In particular, inadequate sanitation <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>contamination</b> of surface water with pathogens of fecal origin is a serious issue in developing countries such as Lao P. D. R. Despite the health implications of the consumption of contaminated surface water, the environmental fate and transport of pathogens of fecal origin and their indicators (Fecal Indicator Bacteria or FIB) are still poorly known in tropical areas. In this study, we used measurements of flow rates, suspended sediments and of the FIB Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a 60 -ha catchment in Northern Laos to explore the ability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate watershed-scale FIB fate and transport. We assessed the influences of 3 in-stream processes, namely bacteria deposition and resuspension, bacterial regrowth, and hyporheic exchange (i. e. transient storage) on predicted FIB numbers. We showed that the SWAT model in its original version does not correctly simulate small E. coli numbers during the dry season. We showed that model's performance could be improved when considering the release of E. coli together with sediment resuspension. We demonstrated that the hyporheic exchange of bacteria across the Sediment-Water Interface (SWI) should be considered when simulating FIB concentration not only during wet weather, but also during the dry season, or baseflow period. In contrast, the implementation of the regrowth process did not improve the model during the dry season without inducing an overestimation during the wet season. This work thus underlines the importance of taking into account in-stream processes, such as deposition and resuspension, regrowth and hyporheic exchange, when using SWAT to simulate FIB dynamics in surface waters. clos...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of skin environmental factors {{has been investigated}} in five studies. In the first study, the microbial growth and rash development in diaper dermatitis were studied in order to evaluate a UVB radiation therapy in comparison with a combined antifungal-hydrocortisone cream. The effect of reducing skin environmental pH in experimentally induced Candida lesions was investigated in the second study. The effect of occlusion on vulvar skin temperature, humidity and surface pH, with and {{without the use of}} panty liners was investigated in study III and IV, with study IV also including measurements of the skin microflora. In the fifth study, string panties equipped with string panty liners were compared with regular panties with standard panty liners, to evaluate whether there was any difference in their impact on the vulvar skin microenvironment. Diaper dermatitis was susceptible to treatment with UVB therapy, the improvement effect in this study was comparable to the use of antifungal-hydrocortisone cream. Experimentally induced skin reactions caused by C. albicans, were significantly reduced when skin environmental pH was changed from 5. 7 to 5. 1 (study II). The results were not caused by reduced growth of C. albicans, but might be due to a pH dependence of the virulence of the yeast and/or a modulation of the host s defence capability. The <b>results</b> <b>in</b> study III indicated that vapour-impermeable panty liners increased vulvar temperature, humidity and pH, compared with the use of no liners. However, the use of vapour-permeable (breathable) panty liners kept the microclimate basically at an undisturbed level. Study IV showed that vulvar microclimate and microflora levels were significantly higher during use of a non-breathable panty liner, compared to the use of no liner. The use of a breathable and acidic panty liner <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> a microclimate and microflora close to the situation without panty liner. However, the numbers of microorganisms were low for all three circumstances (with or without the use of both panty liners) implying no significant microbial risk. The differences in panty and panty liner design in study V (string vs normal), seem to have negligible impact on the vulvar skin microclimate, skin surface pH and microflora. No support was found for the fear that a string panty system would <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>higher</b> <b>contamination</b> of vulvar skin with anorectal microflora.

40|$|Great {{interest}} was {{taken during the}} frenzied pace of the Apollo lunar sample return to achieve and monitor organic cleanliness. Yet, the first mission <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>higher</b> organic <b>contamination</b> to samples than desired. But improvements were accomplished by Apollo 12 [1]. Quarantine complicated the goal of achieving organic cleanliness by requiring negative pressure glovebox containment environments, proximity of animal, plant and microbial organic sources, and use of organic sterilants in protocols. A special low organic laboratory was set up at University of California Berkeley (UCB) to cleanly subdivide a subset of samples [2, 3, 4]. Nevertheless, the basic approach of handling rocks and regolith inside of a positive pressure stainless steel glovebox and restrict-ing the tool and container materials allowed in the gloveboxes was established by the last Apollo sample re-turn. In the last 40 years, the collections have grown to encompass Antarctic meteorites, Cosmic Dust, Genesis solar wind, Stardust comet grains and Hayabusa asteroid grains. Each of these collections have unique curation requirements for organic contamination monitor-ing and control. Here is described some changes allowed by improved technology or driven by changes in environmental regulations and economy, concluding with comments on organic witness wafers.

40|$|During the Cold War, {{production}} {{and testing of}} nuclear weapons in the United States and the Soviet Union led to major releases of radioactive materials to the environment. Although large studies have begun to clarify the magnitude and impact of releases in the United States, only since Perestroika, has information become available to begin {{an evaluation of the}} significance of releases to the environment in the former Soviet Union (FSU). The Radiation Safety of the Biosphere (RAD) Project at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), begun in 1995, is currently evaluating the radiation legacy of the nuclear weapons complex in the FSU. Because the three sites of Chelyabinsk- 65 (Mayak Production Association - MPA), Tomsk- 7 (Siberian Chemical Combine), and Krasnoyarsk- 26 (Mining and Chemical Combine - MCC) account {{for the vast majority of}} the radioactive materials released to the environment in the FSU, these sites are the focus of RAD's studies. Contamination of such sites has resulted from normal and emergency atmospheric releases (such as the 1993 tank explosion at Tomsk- 7), discharge of radioactively contaminated waste and cooling waters into rivers, spills and leaks, and deep-well injection disposal of liquid radioactive waste. This study is limited to the impact of past discharges of radioactive materials to the Yanisei River at the MCC and the Tom River at the SCC. Future studies are planned to asses the significance of deep-well injection of wastes at the MCC. This report draws on data ranging from published reports by Western scientists to unpublished data from the sites and affected regions to compile an initial picture of the currently most contaminated portions of these two rivers and to make a preliminary estimate of the potential doses. The report also considers two hypothetical scenarios. The first scenario examines the potential for redistribution of existing contamination by a major flood and the significance of the dose resulting from such an event. The second scenario considers a release of radioactively contaminated sediments from the surface storage basins into the adjacent river with an estimate of the resultant doses. This movement of the contaminated particles is based on an original, unvalidated model. Thus the results, based on incomplete data, provide insight into the magnitude of the problems that might occur but should not be used to determine regulatory compliance or degree of cleanup required. The results of the study indicate that some areas of the Yanisei River floodplain and island system are significantly contaminated. Conservative estimates of the maximum potential annual dose along the Yanisei are in the range of 5 - 15 millisieverts (mSv) per year. However, conservative estimates of the potential doses along much of the river are near or below the commonly accepted annual dose limit of 1 mSv per year. Contamination is mainly limited to relatively small areas, particularly in deposition zones around islands and depressions in floodplains that trap contaminated sediments during floods. Contamination is lower in the Tom River; only within the first few kilometers of the discharge point is there a potential for exceeding the 1 mSv annual dose limit. Doses along most of the river are substantially below this level. In addition, data on contamination of fish were available for the Tom River: based on conservative estimates, annual doses from fish consumption of up to 3 mSv are possible. This dose is primarily due to short-lived activity released from the control systems of the reactor at the SCC. At both sites, the discharge of radioactive material into the adjacent river has been significantly reduced by the shutdown of the single-pass reactors; at the MCC, additional reductions have resulted from reduced processing rates at the site's reprocessing plant. Based on the results of the hypothetical scenarios, there is no significant potential for extensive contamination downstream from the plants from existing contamination along the floodplains and islands. The resulting contamination would well below background levels and would be essentially undetectable. The increase in the annual dose resulting from such an event is likely to be less than 100 microsieverts in the Yenisei River, and substantially less in the Tom River. During a flood, the majority of contaminated sediments resuspended by the higher flows would remain in suspension for long distances, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> a more uniform distribution of radioactive material further downstream. However, release of highly contaminated sediments from the surface storage basins could <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>contamination</b> levels, particularly near the release point. Because accurate data on the characterization of a hypothetical release were not available, the authors assumed unit releases of a relatively small fraction of the contamination in these ponds. However, even these relatively limited releases <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> levels of <b>contamination.</b> <b>Higher</b> releases would likely <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>higher</b> levels of <b>contamination,</b> and a large-scale pulse release could <b>result</b> <b>in</b> annual doses exceeding the 1 sievert for tens of kilometers along the river if emergency responses were not carried out. It is important to note that discharges into the rivers are not only pathways for radiological contamination at these sites. Contamination has resulted from routine and emergency atmospheric releases of radioactivity (most probably from a 1993 high-level waste tank explosion at Tomsk), wastes have been injected underground at both sites, and there are likely to be significant areas of contaminated soil within the territory of each site. These releases are not evaluated in the current report. This report is therefore an initial step in evaluating the legacy of nuclear weapons production in the FSU. ...|$|R

30|$|One {{of the key}} {{considerations}} in fabricating a surface channel MOSFET using epi-GaAs is to achieve a good interface quality between the epi-GaAs substrate and gate oxide, which is vital for the device performance [13]. Fortunately, atomic layer deposition provides {{a unique opportunity to}} integrate high-quality gate dielectrics on bulk and epi-GaAs [2, 14, 15]. It was observed that ALD Al 2 O 3 provides a better interface with GaAs interface compared with other ALD high-k dielectrics [6, 8]. Although, by continuing effort on surface passivation, it is possible to grow a high-quality interface with low defect density, the hysteresis voltage for ALD high-k/GaAs gate stack is still high [2, 7, 15]. There are some attempts to achieve low hysteresis voltage using ALD SiO 2, directly deposited titanium oxide [TiO 2], and Si passivation on GaAs substrates [16 – 19]. On the other hand, GaAs grown at its optimum temperature on Ge will <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> Ge <b>contamination,</b> such as auto-doping and formation of Ge-based complexes, as significant Ge atoms will diffuse into the GaAs epilayer during growth. Chia et al. [20] suggested that a thin 10 -nm AlAs interfacial layer is sufficient to effectively block the out-diffusion of Ge atoms at a high growth temperature of 650 °C, eliminating Ge-based complexes and auto-doping effects in the GaAs layer. It is highly desirable to grow p-type epi-GaAs with good structural and electronic qualities for n-MOSFET device applications. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there is no report of a metal-oxide-semiconductor [MOS] capacitor using p-type epi-GaAs grown on Ge substrates.|$|R

Different treatment strategies based on advanced oxidation processes (ozonation and TiO 2 -photocatalysis), and their combination with biological treatment (MBR), are herein assessed for effluents of a recycled paper mill and a kraft pulp mill. Ozone treatment achieved the highest efficiency of all. The consumption of 2. 4 g O 3 L− 1 <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> about a 60 % COD reduction treating the effluent from the kraft pulp mill at an initial pH = 7; although it only reached about a 35 % COD removal for the effluent of the recycled paper mill.

In addition, the effluent from the recycled paper mill showed a higher biodegradability, so combinations of these AOPs with biological treatment were tested. As a result, photocatalysis did not report any significant COD reduction improvement whether being performed as pre- or post-treatment of the biological process; whereas the use of ozonation as post-biological treatment enhanced COD removal a further 10 %, summing up a total 90 % reduction of the COD for the combined treatment, {{as well as it}} also supposed an increase of the presence of volatile fatty acids, which might ultimately enable the resultant wastewater to be recirculated back to further biological treatment...|$|R

The genotype of the mother plant donor of explants and the kind of auxin play essential roles in conferring embryogenic competence. Once obtained somatic embryos may be encapsulated in alginate originating synthetic seeds that can be stored at low temperatures. Considering this the present work aimed at the assessment of five different genotypes, five periods of 2, 4 -D shock (20 mM for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 weeks) (), and different substances supplemented to sodium alginate to obtain synthetic seeds. Zygotic embryos of Feijoa sellowiana were inoculated in basal LP medium (von Arnold and Erikson, 1981) supplemented with Morel’s vitamins, sucrose (3 %) and phytagel (0. 2 %). The highest rates of somatic embryogenesis induction were observed in the genotypes 50 - 4 and 101.

In the present work we have studied the prevalence of multiresistant bacteria and resistance genes in the wastewater stream of Lausanne. Samples from hospital and municipal raw sewage, treated effluent from Lausanne’s wastewater treatment plant (WTP) as well as lake water and sediment samples obtained close to the WTP outlet pipe and a remote site close to a drinking water pump were evaluated for the prevalence of multiresistant bacteria. Selected isolates were identified (16 S rRNA gene fragment sequencing) and characterized with regards to further resistances, resistance genes, and plasmids.

For multilayer microstructures it makes sense to develop new photoresists whose properties are specially tailored for these applications. Electrodepostion techniques have been improved decisively in the source of the project. Still it does not meet the requirements of an industrial application. The further development should be possible utilizing the equipment, designed and manufactured within this project. The curtain coating technique is an important addition to spin coating.

The main objective {{of this study is}} the development of formulations and delivery systems for control of ticks with entomopathogenic fungi. Screening of entomopathogenic fungal isolates is the first step towards the development of mycoacaricides. Twelve isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnik.) Sorok. and three isolates of Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) were evaluated for pathogenicity against unfed Rhipicephalus pulchellus Gerstäcker (Acari: Ixodidae) adults under laboratory conditions. Out of the 15 isolates screened, 4 isolates were virulent against R. pulchellus, inducing significantly (F value = 11. 86; DF = 14, 75; P 1010 conidia ml- 1). Although the LC 50 value in SS was the lowest, it recorded the highest tick mortality among control ticks (24. 2 % at two weeks post-treatment) and (23. 3 % at three weeks post-treatment) in nymphs and adults respectively compared to SP (2. 5 and 5. 8 % respectively) and SW (0. 0 and 0. 0). Results show that among the modes of contamination tested, SP was the most appropriate for contaminating R. pulchellus adults. SW and SP were identified as appropriate techniques for infecting the R. pulchellus nymphs with conidia formulated in oil. The integrated use of semiochemicals and entomopathogenic fungus (hypocreales) may optimise the performance of a fungus as a biocontrol agent against ticks. Initially, experiments were conducted to evaluate the attraction of the hunter tick Amblyomma variegatum Fabriscius (Acari: Ixodidae) to semiochemicals. In one of the experiments, the simultaneous release of 1 -octen- 3 -ol and AAAP together with CO 2 from a trap in simulated field plots attracted up to 94 ± 6 % of adult ticks from a distance of 6 m, and up to 24. 0 ± 5. 1 % from 8 m. Formulations of M. anisopliae (dry powder, oil, and emulsifiable) applied within the trap baited with AAAP and 1 -octen- 3 -ol <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> levels of <b>contamination</b> of the ticks attracted to the traps. However, 48 hr after autoinoculation, 89. 1 and 33. 3 % of conidia were lost in dry powder and oil formulations, respectively. Emulsifiable formulation lost the lowest number of propagules (17. 1 %). Samples of ticks attracted to the baited traps were transferred to plastic basins containing grass and maintained for 5 weeks. The experiment was conducted in the rainy and dry seasons. The emulsifiable formulation gave the <b>highest</b> relative reduction <b>in</b> tick numbers in both seasons: 54. 7 and 46. 5 % in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively, followed by the oil formulation (32 and 23. 8 %) and the powder formulation (38. 0 and 24. 4 %). Following the <b>high</b> attraction and <b>contamination</b> of A. variegatum under semi-field conditions, experiments were done to evaluate the efficacy of M. anisopliae-treated semiochemical-baited traps for control of A. variegatum under field conditions. Unfed A. variegatum adults (118) were seeded in each 100 -m plot. An emulsifiable formulation of M. anisopliae (consisting of 49. 5 % sterile distilled water, fungal conidia, 49. 5 % corn oil [CHEF cooking oil, Premier Oil Mills LTD] and 1 % Tween 80) titrated at 109 conidia ml- 1 - was applied in a semiochemical-baited traps (900 cm 2) which were placed at 5 spots within the plot. The control and fungal treatments were repeated after 14 and 28 days soon after rotating the traps clockwise (45 o) in order to cover different sections of the plot. In the control plots, traps baited with semiochemicals only were used. Six weeks after the initiation of the experiments, five semiochemical-baited traps (untreated) were deployed in each plot for 3 successive days to trap ticks in the treated and control plots. The percentage of ticks recovered in the fungus-treated plots were significantly lower (31. 1 ± 5. 2 %) than in the control plots (85. 6 % ± 3 %) (P < 0. 001), which represented a relative tick reduction of 63. 7 %. Mortality of 93. 8 ± 2. 3 % was observed among the ticks that were recovered from the field and maintained in the laboratory for two weeks; while only 3. 3 ± 0. 9 % died from the control plots. The results of this study open up the possibility of developing an environmentally friendly, low cost product to control these economically important ticks.

40|$|Sediment, {{suspended}} particulate matter (SPM), water and clam Scrobicularia plana samples were collected in a temperate coastal lagoon with anthropogenic impact. Arsenic levels in sediments, SPM and water presented a spatial concentration gradient. A significant linear regression between arsenic levels in S. plana and SPM suggests particulate matter as the main route of arsenic exposure. Trend analysis showed that total arsenic concentrations in S. plana generally increased with size class, reflecting lifespan bioaccumulation. Despite being efficient in reflecting environmental contamination levels, results suggest that arsenic accumulation by S. plana {{may not be a}} passive process, given the proportionally lower accumulation <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>contamination</b> areas. Annual bioaccumulation rates ranged from 5. 6 to 1 mg kg− 1 year− 1, suggesting a possible toxicity risk for individuals of the most contaminated area. Despite the absence of regulatory guidelines, food safety assessment highlighted possible adverse effects of consuming S. plana in most contaminated areas...|$|R
