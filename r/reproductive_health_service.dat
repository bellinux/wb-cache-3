40|$|Purpose With over 20 million refugee {{women in}} the world today, health of refugee women has {{significant}} global health implications. Women affected by humanitarian crisis have significant trauma related mental health concerns that may affect reproductive health. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that poor mental health status impinges upon <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use within the population of refugee women living in temporary camps and settlements. Methods This study consisted of 1) psychometric validation of the Self Report Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Self Report Questionnaire-Suicide Ideation and Behavior (SRQ-SIB), 2) a mixed methods analysis of cross-sectional data and 3) data reduction of the SRQ-SIB, using data from the Reproductive Health Assessment for Conflict Affected Women survey conducted among Congolese refugee {{women in the}} summer of 2008. A qualitative component was added post hoc with interviews and written communication with key informants. The sample size was 810 participants. Results The SRQ and the SRQ-SIB demonstrated a high level of reliability at. 911 for both scales. Predictive validity revealed a highly significant model for both instruments in relation to women who experienced sexual violence. While the mean score on the SRQ-SIB was 6. 2 (SD= 5. 6), women who had experienced a traumatic event or reported suicidal behavior had much higher mean scores; 8. 2 (SD= 5. 8) and 14. 1 (SD= 5. 5) respectively. Antenatal care rates were high (90 %), as were HIV screening rates (81 %); alternatively, family planning use (11 %) and sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment seeking (7 %) were low among those at risk. No significant associations were found between mental health status and <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. Qualitative interviews revealed that while <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use was strongly encouraged, mental health assessment and care were not available. Conclusion This study provides details on mental health status and <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use in Rwandan refugee camps. Reproductive health is broadly available and reaches most women for HIV testing and antenatal care. Prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) in this sample was high.

This study investigate the correlation between knowledge, attitude, adolescent needs, access, familyacceptability, and the utilization of reproductive health services in Tegallalang I Health Centre. Methods: The design was a cross sectional analytic. From the population of 4725 adolescents in the Tegallalang IHealth Centre work area, 84 were selected through systematic random sampling. The independent variables wereknowledge, attitude, adolescent needs, access and family acceptability while the dependent variable was the utilizationof adolescent <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>service.</b> Data was collected through structured interviews and analysed usingunivariate, bivariate (chi-squared test), and multivariate (logistic regression) analysis.

40|$|Abstract Background Adolescents' {{consultation}} {{of primary}} health care services remains problematic despite their accessibility. The <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> seeking behavior of adolescents {{is the object of}} much research but little is known about how this behavior is influenced by the gatekeeping system. This study aimed to explore general practitioners' perceptions of the appropriateness of gatekeeping in adolescent reproductive health care. Methods Twenty in-depth interviews regarding factors affecting adolescent reproductive health care were carried out on a diverse sample of general practitioners and analyzed using grounded theory. Results The analysis identified several factors that shaped GPs' negative attitude to gatekeeping in adolescent reproductive health care. Its appropriateness in this field was questionable {{due to a lack of}} willingness on the part of GPs to provide reproductive health services for teenagers, their insufficient training, inadequately equipped surgeries and low perceived support for <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> provision. Conclusion Since factors for improving adolescent reproductive health concern not only physicians but also the health system and policy levels, complex measures should be designed to overcome these barriers. Discussion of a flexible model of gatekeeping, encompassing both co-ordination of care provided by GPs and the possibility of patients' self-referral, should be included in the political agenda. Adolescents tend to under-use rather than over-use reproductive health services and every effort should be made to facilitate the accessibility of such services. </p...|$|E

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldCONTEXT: Iceland has higher levels of fertility among both adult women and adolescents than many other western European countries. There {{is a need to}} make sexual and <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> more accessible to teenagers in Iceland. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional national postal survey was conducted in 1996 to explore the attitudes of 2, 500 young people aged 17 - 20 toward sexual and <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> in Iceland and to determine which factors might be of importance for the development of such services. RESULTS: Icelandic adolescents want specialized sexual and <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> offered within a broad-based service setting. Half of them would prefer to have these services located in a sexual and <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> clinic, and about one-third want such services to be located in community <b>health</b> centers. Having <b>services</b> that are free, that are anonymous and that do not require an appointment are important to teenagers who live in Reykjavik, but proximity and equal access to services are more highly valued by adolescents who live outside Reykjavik. Characteristics that young women, in particular, value include close proximity to services, access to a comfortable environment, a friendly staff, absolute confidentiality, and the ability to come with a friend and to have enough time for discussion. Adolescents who have already used contraceptive services mentioned that they need enough time for discussion and that they value high-quality client-provider interaction. CONCLUSIONS: The attitudes of adolescents should be considered when specialized sexual and <b>reproductive</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> are developed for young people in Iceland.
