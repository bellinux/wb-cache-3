Separated from the core, the individual ribbons are relatively fragile, and the core can be damaged by high temperatures. These factors make it difficult or impractical to terminate tinsel wire by soldering during equipment manufacture, although soldering is possible, with some difficulty, to repair a failed connection.

40|$|Excited state ultrafast {{conformational}} reorganization {{is recognized}} as an important phenomenon that facilitates light-induced functions of many molecular systems. This report describes the femtosecond and picosecond conformational relaxation dynamics of middle-ring and <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> twisted conformers of the acetylene pi-conjugated system bis(phenylethynyl) benzene, a model system for molecular wires. Through excitation wavelength dependent, femtosecond-transient absorption measurements, {{we found that the}} middle-ring and <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> twisted conformers relax at femtosecond (400600 fs) and picosecond (2024 ps) time scales, respectively. Actinic pumping into the red flank of the absorption spectrum leads to excitation of primarily planar conformers, and results in very different excited state dynamics. In addition, ultrafast Raman loss spectroscopic studies revealed the vibrational mode dependent relaxation dynamics for different excitation wavelengths. To corroborate our experimental findings, DFT and time-dependent DFT calculations were carried out. The FranckCondon simulation indicated that the vibronic structure observed in the electronic absorption and the fluorescence spectra are due to progressions and combinations of several vibrational modes corresponding to the phenyl ring and the acetylenic groups. Furthermore, the middle ring torsional rotation matches the room-temperature electronic absorption, {{in stark contrast to the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> torsional rotation. Finally, we show that the middle-ring twisted conformer undergoes femtosecond torsional planarization dynamic, whereas the <b>terminal</b> <b>rings</b> relax on a few tens of picosecond time scale...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} a new lab kit that is uniquely suited to teach power electronics: the Power NerdKit. The Power NerdKit is a self-contained prototyping system, which is easily incorporated into other {{systems such as}} an electric go-kart. Central to the kit is the card-rack prototyping area, where circuitry on PCB cards can be installed, interconnected, and tested. We present three prototyping PCB cards for use with the kit. Each of the cards has a common interconnection inter- face: up to five high current connections can be made via <b>terminal</b> <b>lugs,</b> and up to 26 low current connections can be made via card-edge connector. The first card provides solderless breadboard for constructing circuits and can connect with other cards through the standard interface. The second card {{is similar to the}} first, but is designed for circuits that must be soldered together. The last card, called the TriTotemII, implements three "totem-pole" circuits, which form the foundation of the converter topologies taught in the class. Finally the cards feature a unique method to attach oddly shaped devices using Unplated Through-hole Anchor Points. The lab exercises emphasize design. (cont.) In Lab 1, the student: learns why switching circuits are useful; learns a few necessary control circuits; and builds a switching audio amplifier. In Lab 2, the student constructs a 1500 W buck converter that drives an electric go-kart at variable speeds; they also design and build a 12 W boosting power supply for a switching stereo amplifier of their construction. In Lab 3, the student designs and builds a high-voltage flyback converter and an electric fluorescent lamp ballast. Lastly, in Lab 4, the student explores how power electronics are used to drive induction and permanent magnet machines using a teaching motor specifically designed for this course. by Mariano Alvira.
