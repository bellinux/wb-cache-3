5000|$|When faster {{computers}} were developed, however, {{the speed of}} card reading, magnetic tape, and early disk drives, along with newer high speed transistorized circuits, meant that processing could be done {{at a much higher}} speed, and a faster print mechanism was needed to match the resulting productivity. [...] IBM's early computers, such as the IBM 701, were developed for higher speed calculation than was possible with earlier electromechanical calculating machines. They did not have a demand for high speed printing, as the results of massive calculations produced very little printed output. Around the time that the 1403 was introduced, IBM's line of computers had been largely divided into two lines, [...] "scientific" [...] and [...] "business." [...] However, as newer {{computers were}} being used for a greater variety of purposes, there was a need to print a greater variety of characters from a single device, including upper and lower case alphabets. With type bars and type wheels, changing character sets was impractical. The advent of the chain printer, as used in the 1403, allowed the type chain assembly to be removed and replaced within a few minutes. With the cover open, the print unit was unlatched and swung open, the <b>ribbon</b> <b>roll</b> covering the front of the chain was removed, whereupon the print chain assembly could be unlatched and lifted out.|$|E

50|$|A constant-force {{spring is}} a spring {{for which the}} force it exerts over its range of motion is a constant. That is, it does not obey Hooke's law.Generally constant-force springs are {{constructed}} as a <b>rolled</b> <b>ribbon</b> of spring steel such that the spring is relaxed when it is fully rolled up. As it is unrolled, the restoring force comes primarily from {{the portion of the}} <b>ribbon</b> near the <b>roll.</b> Because the geometry of that region remains nearly constant as the spring unrolls, the resulting force is nearly constant.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we report on}} the results of {{investigation}} of the magnetocaloric effect in Gd 100 −xYx (x = 0, 5, 10, 15) cold <b>rolled</b> <b>ribbons.</b> It is shown that the magnetocaloric effect exists within a wide temperature interval 258 - 295 K and is comparable with magnetocaloric effect observed in bulk samples of pure gadolinium. The value of the magnetocaloric effect in the rolled samples is reduced as compared with the bulk samples and strongly depends on the degree of the plastic deformation. Heat treatment procedures can restore the values of the magnetocaloric effect in the cold <b>rolled</b> <b>ribbons</b> up to initial ones. Thus, cold rolling is proposed to be a promising technique for producing thin forms of magnetocaloric materials for heat exchangers of magnetic cooling devices, modifying microstructure of the materials and related magnetic properties.

5000|$|Carbon <b>ribbons</b> are on <b>rolls</b> and are fitted onto {{a spindle}} or reel holder within the printer. The used ribbon is rewound by a take-up spindle forming a <b>roll</b> of ‘used’ <b>ribbon.</b> It is termed a ‘one-trip’ ribbon because {{once it has}} been rewound the used roll is {{discarded}} and replaced with a new one. If one were to hold a strip of used carbon ribbon {{up to the light}} one would see an exact negative of the images that have been printed. The main benefit of using a one-trip thermal transfer ribbon is that providing the correct settings are applied prior to printing, an 100% density of printed image is guaranteed; compare this with a pre-inked ribbon on a dot matrix impact printer ribbon which gradually fades with usage.|$|R

40|$|Roll {{compaction}} {{is commonly}} used as a dry granulation technique in the pharmaceutical industry to produce tablets for formulations sensitive to heat and moisture. This thesis reports systematic studies {{on the behavior of}} pharmaceutical excipients in associated unit operations (i. e. roll compaction, milling, tabletting), as well as their correlations. Roll compaction experiments were carried out using an instrumented roll compactor with a gravity feeding system. The influence of the process parameters, material properties and powder conditioning were investigated <b>Ribbons</b> produced in <b>roll</b> compaction were granulated using an oscillating mill to investigate the milling process. A first order kinetics equation was introduced to describe the mass throughput of the granules. Using positron emission particle tracking technique, which provided a measurement of instantaneous velocity and the location of the ribbons, two milling regions (i. e. impact and abrasion) involving distinct fracture mechanisms were identified. Tabletting of the granules was performed using a universal test machine. A reduction in the compressibility and compactibility of the granules compared to the feed powders, due to work hardening, was also observed. A method was introduced to determine the optimized process conditions for roll compaction and milling through a close examination of the correlation between the unit operations. ...|$|R
5000|$|Convergent {{evolution}} occurs {{often in}} 3DVCE, as similar structures {{and behaviors of}} the creatures form to maximize fitness. Two-Armed Jumpers consist of a small core and two large symmetrical [...] "wings", and evolve in response to jumping and distance requirement. These creatures propel themselves forward using their limbs by jiggling or flapping them. Jumping Ribbons and Springs consist of a chain of segments and evolve in response to max height and distance. They contract or curl up and stretch out their body to leap into the air. <b>Rolling</b> <b>Ribbons</b> and Springs {{are very similar to}} the previous group, except they are often larger and segments are more repetitive. They evolve in response to average height, distance, and TOG (touching the ground). They roll on the ground to propel their head into the air to attain height while still touching the ground. Some simply roll in a horizontal fashion like a cylinder. Single-Joint Powered Creatures have more erratic structures and evolve in response to distance on bumpy terrain. They have one large segment in back which kicks the creature forward, but being poorly balanced they use the rest of their bodies to get back up after stumbling or prevent stumbles altogether.|$|R
40|$|Solid {{pharmaceutical}} tablets can {{be manufactured}} via three processing technologies: direct compression, dry granulation and wet granulation {{before the final}} compaction process. Dry granulation using roll compaction generally involves production of ribbons, followed by milling to produce granules {{and the production of}} tablets. The mechanical properties of <b>ribbons</b> produced during <b>roll</b> compaction can influence breakage behaviour in a mill and hence the performance of a drug formulation. Therefore it is important to explore critical factors that determine the quality of ribbons. In this study, MCC Avicel PH- 102 was used as the model powder for roll compaction and the critical operating factors affecting ribbon quality were studied. MCC 102 ribbons were manufactured at a range of process conditions (roll speed, feed screw speed and compaction pressure) using the TF mini roll compactor with a serrated die & punch (DPS), grooved roll surface. The key ribbon properties measured are the powder feed ratio (defined as the ratio of feed screw speed to that of roll speed) and mass throughput ratio (defined as the mass of ribbons produced in a given time to that of fines). The porosity of ribbons was observed to depend significantly on powder feed ratio into the compaction zone. Porosity remained constant at a fixed feed ratio irrespective of the absolute roll speed and the feed screw speed conditions used. Mass throughput ratio is another factor that was introduced to describe process efficiency i. e. to draw comparison between the amount of ribbons and fines. The amount of ribbons and fines generated at a given process condition depends significantly on the feed screw speed and the compaction pressure. In addition, ribbon porosity decreased with increasing pressure but there was negligible effect on ribbon porosity when excessively high pressure (> 60 bar) was used. Ribbon porosity was also observed to decrease with increasing feed screw speed but the converse is true with increasing roll speed. In conclusion, the impact of various roll compaction process parameters were critically investigated and a detailed insight into the main factors (powder feed and mass throughput ratios) that govern the behaviour of <b>roll</b> compacted <b>ribbons</b> was provided. In future, the focus is to relate these process properties (and ribbon porosity) to granule size distribution from a milling process...|$|R
