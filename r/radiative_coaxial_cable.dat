50|$|The {{most common}} use for <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> is for {{television}} and other signals with a bandwidth {{of several hundred}} megahertz to gigahertz. Although in most homes <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> have been installed for transmission of TV signals, new technologies (such as the ITU-T G.hn standard) open {{the possibility of using}} home <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> for high-speed home networking applications (Ethernet over coax).|$|R
40|$|<b>Coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> {{structures}} {{form the}} subject of substantial theoretical and experimental investigations either directly related, or which can be extrapolated, to the communications needs and environments of U. S. coal mines. Communication systems based on "guided" waves, of which "leaky" <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> are one implementation, are attractive candidates for providing a range of communication functions primarily along haulage ways, and possible also within sections up to the working face. (However, there are still strong reservations as to whether a practical <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> sys tem could provide sufficient communications coverage within a section.) In this Part, we present the results of some theoretical calculations {{of the performance of}} leaky <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> communication systems. We also analyze the applicability of the theoretical and experimental results obtained by other researchers to the needs of U. S. coal mines. In particular, this investigation has been focused on the utility of relatively low cost, conventional, flexible, <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> at frequencies covering the LF through HF bands and extending into {{the lower part of the}} VHF band, as opposed to relatively high cost, special semi-rigid, coaxial cable* at frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands. There are three major design alternatives for <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> communication systems considered in this chapter: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Base station feeding a <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> with high surface transfer impedance (holes in outer conductor, e. g., braid construction). 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Base station feeding a <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> with repeaters (U. K. experiments). 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 No base station, direct communication via a <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> with periodic <b>radiative</b> structures...|$|R
40|$|The semestral {{thesis is}} focused on <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables,</b> its {{development}} and current utilization. In the prologue of this paper, the history and origin of the cable is described with mentioning important dates and events in its development. Since the <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> is type of metallic cable, part of the paper deals with the theory, parameters and characteristics of metallic cables. The theory of all basic types of metallic cables is described, that implies twisted pair, structured <b>cabling</b> and <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable,</b> to which is dedicated most space. The next chapter presents brief description, basic division and utilization of fiber optic to enable comparison with <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable.</b> It presents main advantages and disadvantages as well as reasoning for prevalence of use of optic fibers. The current use of <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> is presented. Aside from cable television, computer and telephone networks, the <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> are also used as feeder lines for transmitting and receiving aerials and as television aerial lead. Due to great possibility of utilization of <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> exists {{a broad spectrum of}} cables with different parameters and properties. Therefore a separate chapter focuses on particular types of cabling, describes its significant parameters and practical utilization. The last part of the paper presents parameters of <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> that can be verified and that bear great importance in praxis. The methods of proper measurement are mentioned. Aforesaid parameters include impedance, cable loss and distance-to-fault. Described are also modern analyzers that are most commonly used for measuring said parameters of <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> and aerials...|$|R

50|$|<b>Coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> {{is used as}} a {{transmission}} line for radio frequency signals. Its applications include feedlines connecting radio transmitters and receivers with their antennas, computer network (Internet) connections, digital audio (S/PDIF), and distributing cable television signals. One advantage of coaxial over other types of radio transmission line is that in an ideal <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists only in the space between the inner and outer conductors. This allows <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> runs to be installed next to metal objects such as gutters without the power losses that occur in other types of transmission lines. <b>Coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> also provides protection of the signal from external electromagnetic interference.|$|R
50|$|Research in Ethernet {{transmission}} over <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> continued, as both {{consumers and}} telecommunications operators strive to use existing 75 ohm <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> installations (from cable television or CATV), to carry broadband data into {{and through the}} home, and into multiple dwelling unit (MDU) installations.|$|R

A 24 V power supply is also available over the <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> to deliver up to 13 W to the camera. Applications requiring more than a 13 W power supply utilize a separate power supply.

The use of <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> for Ethernet is still supported by the standard, but rarely used because <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> is more costly to purchase, install, and operate for local area networks.|$|R
40|$|A {{passive sensing}} node {{technology}} is introduced for monitoring {{the integrity of}} RF coaxial transmission lines and associated RF connectors in the UHF range of frequencies. Each passive sensing node {{is powered by a}} transmission line coupler inside the <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable.</b> Passive sensing node sensing elements, fine-line interconnect metallurgy, transmission line coupler, and electronics are packaged on a molded interconnect device. The molded interconnect device structure and substrate material are designed to minimize electrical disturbance to the <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> and preserve <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> mechanical integrity. A custom integrated circuit on the molded interconnect device measures <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> RF performance parameters, harvests operating power for the custom integrated circuit, and enables remote telemetry. The passive sensing node operates with a 60 µW power listening mode and a 900 µW power active mode for operating the three primary sensors, signal processing circuits, and backscatter telemetry. This paper proposes a network of passive sensing nodes in a <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> system, describes the operation of the sensors in each passive sensing node, and provides a mathematical model for the transmission line coupler. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> are {{commonly}} used at audio frequencies and above for convenience. A <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a dielectric layer. The current flowing {{on the surface of}} the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the outer tube. The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube. <b>Coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5GHz. For microwave frequencies greater than 5GHz, the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large, making waveguides a more efficient medium for transmitting energy. <b>Coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss.|$|R

50|$|The clamps of the {{grounding}} kits / earthing kits {{are composed}} of an ozone- and UV-resistant rubber coat with a device where the ripple can be lodged. The tin-plated ripple with a special alloying enables the bridging over big tolerances between kit and <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> which is important for a best possible voltage transmission. The ripple to the skinned <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> has a low contact resistance between 0.10 to 0.15 mΩ. It also enables a better length compensation as well as even and low contact pressures, which avoids damages on the <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable.</b> These characteristics are known as relaxation behaviour.|$|R
50|$|RG-62 is a 93 Ω <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> {{originally}} used in {{mainframe computer}} {{networks in the}} 1970s and early 1980s (it was the cable used to connect IBM 3270 terminals to IBM 3274/3174 terminal cluster controllers). Later, some manufacturers of LAN equipment, such as Datapoint for ARCNET, adopted RG-62 as their <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> standard. The cable has the lowest capacitance per unit-length {{when compared to other}} <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> of similar size. Capacitance is the enemy of square-wave data transmission (in particular, it slows down edge transitions), and this is a much more important factor for baseband digital data transmission than power handling or attenuation.|$|R
