5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields {{the newly formed}} peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{chemical}} chain reactions was first suggested in 1913 by the German chemist Max Bodenstein for {{a situation in}} which two molecules <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> not just the final reaction products, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the original substances to cause more to react. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction was first hypothesized by the Hungarian scientist Leo Szilard on 12 September 1933. Szilard realized that if a nuclear reaction produced neutrons or dineutrons, which then caused further nuclear reactions, the process might be self-perpetuating. Szilard proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts, although he did entertain the possibility of using uranium as a fuel. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple nuclear reactor the following year. The discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, opened up the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction with uranium or indium, but initial experiments were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{dissolve}} slowly in liquid ammonia, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M+ and e−, which <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide (MNH2, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a catalyst. Similar solutions are {{formed by the}} heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium, {{as well as the}} divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M+), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), diatomic alkali metal molecules (M2) and alkali metal anions (M−). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis.|$|E

25|$|Formic acid {{is unique}} among the {{carboxylic}} acids {{in its ability}} to participate in addition reactions with alkenes. Formic acids and alkenes readily <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> formate esters. In the presence of certain acids, including sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids, however, a variant of the Koch reaction occurs instead, and formic acid adds to the alkene to produce a larger carboxylic acid.|$|E
25|$|A process {{employing}} electrokinetic shocks waves {{can be used}} {{to accomplish}} membraneless desalination at ambient temperature and pressure. In this process, anions and cations in salt water are exchanged for carbonate anions and calcium cations, respectively using electrokinetic shockwaves. Calcium and carbonate ions <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> calcium carbonate, which precipitates, leaving fresh water. The theoretical energy efficiency of this method is on par with electrodialysis and reverse osmosis.|$|E

25|$|Dinitrogen tetroxide {{can also}} be made through the {{reaction}} of concentrated nitric acid and metallic copper. This synthesis is more practical in a laboratory setting and is commonly used as a demonstration or experiment in undergraduate chemistry labs. The oxidation of copper by nitric acid is a complex reaction forming various nitrogen oxides of varying stability which depends on the concentration of the nitric acid, presence of oxygen, and other factors. The unstable species further <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> nitrogen dioxide which is then purified and condensed to form dinitrogen tetroxide.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{chloramine}} {{is becoming}} more common as a disinfectant. Although chloramine is not as strong an oxidant, it does provide a longer-lasting residual than free chlorine {{and it will not}} readily form THMs or haloacetic acids. It is possible to convert chlorine to chloramine by adding ammonia to the water after addition of chlorine. The chlorine and ammonia <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> chloramine. Water distribution systems disinfected with chloramines may experience nitrification, as ammonia is a nutrient for bacterial growth, with nitrates being generated as a by-product.|$|E
25|$|In the acetalisation reaction, under acidic or basic conditions, {{an alcohol}} {{adds to the}} {{carbonyl}} group and a proton is transferred to form a hemiacetal. Under acidic conditions, the hemiacetal and the alcohol can further <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> an acetal and water. Simple hemiacetals are usually unstable, although cyclic ones such as glucose can be stable. Acetals are stable, but revert to the aldehyde {{in the presence of}} acid. Aldehydes can react with water to form hydrates, R−CH(OH)2. These diols are stable when strong electron withdrawing groups are present, as in chloral hydrate. The mechanism of formation is identical to hemiacetal formation.|$|E

25|$|Arsenic {{can cause}} {{oxidative}} stress through {{the formation of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Reactive oxygen species are produced by the enzyme NADPH oxidase, which transfers electrons from NADPH to oxygen, synthesizing a superoxide, which is a reactive free radical. This superoxide can <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> hydrogen peroxide and a reactive oxygen species. The enzyme NADPH oxidase is able to generate more reactive oxygen species {{in the presence of}} arsenic, due to the subunit p22phax, which is responsible for the electron transfer, being upregulated by arsenic. The reactive oxygen species are capable of stressing the endoplasmic reticulum, which increases the amount of the unfolded protein response signals. This leads to inflammation, cell proliferation, and eventually to cell death. Another mechanism in which reactive oxygen species cause cell death would be through the cytoskeleton rearrangement, which affects the contractile proteins.|$|E
500|$|Young, uninjured fruit {{bodies of}} L.deterrimus have sesquiterpenoides {{in the form}} of fatty acid dihydroazulene-esters. About 85% of the yellow-coloured dihydroazulene are esterified with stearic acid and about 15% with {{linoleic}} acid. If the fruit body is injured, the free sesquiterpene [...] – a dihydroazulene alcohol – is released enzymatically. Several products are produced from it through oxidation: the yellow-coloured aldehyde delicial (1-formyl-6, 7-dihydro-4-methyl-7-isopropenylazulene), the purple-coloured aldehyde lactarovioline (1-formyl-4-methyl-7-isopropenylazulene), and the blue-coloured alcohol deterrol (1-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-7-isopropenylazulene). The milk is first maroon through mixing with the different colours and discolours green. The dihydroazulene alcohol and delicial are unstable compounds, which <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> further products. Delicial polymerises particularly slight.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{isoquinoline}} derivatives can be synthesized {{by several}} methods, relatively few direct methods deliver the unsubstituted isoquinoline. [...] The Pomeranz–Fritsch reaction provides an efficient method for {{the preparation of}} isoquinoline. This reaction uses a benzaldehyde and aminoacetoaldehyde diethyl acetal, which in an acid medium <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> isoquinoline. Alternatively, benzylamine and a glyoxal acetal can be used, to produce the same result using the Schlittler-Müller modification.|$|E

2500|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{an intermediate}} product of combustion, {{and it is}} eliminated by oxidation. CO and OH <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> CO2 and H. This process, which consumes the CO, requires a relatively long time ("relatively" [...] is used because the combustion process happens incredibly quickly), high temperatures, and high pressures. This fact means that a low CO combustor has a long residence time (essentially {{the amount of time}} the gases are in the combustion chamber).|$|E
2500|$|Filamentous carbon {{can also}} form when {{acetylene}} decomposes on films of palladium and silicon dioxide. However, filamentous carbon does not {{form on the}} palladium and silicon dioxide films if they are preheated with hydrogen at temperatures of [...] This is because in those conditions, the palladium and silicon dioxide <b>react</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> palladium silicide. Iron and silicon dioxide together also act {{as a catalyst for}} formation of the structures. Sometimes, iron silicate forms during this reaction.|$|E
2500|$|For many strong acids, it is {{possible}} to form crystals of their hydronium salt that are relatively stable. [...] These salts are sometimes called acid monohydrates.
