2500|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesised}} (e.g. by James Surowiecki) that very unequal allocations are rejected {{only because the}} absolute amount of the offer is low. The concept here {{is that if the}} amount to be split were ten million dollars a 90:10 split would probably be accepted rather than spurning a million-dollar offer. Essentially, this explanation says that the absolute amount of the endowment is not significant enough to produce strategically optimal behaviour. However, many experiments have been performed where the amount offered was substantial: studies by Cameron and Hoffman et al. have found that higher stakes cause offers to approach closer to an even split, even in a 100 USD game played in Indonesia, where average per-capita income is much lower than in the United States. Rejections are reportedly independent of the stakes at this level, with 30 USD offers being turned down in Indonesia, as in the United States, even though this equates to two weeks' wages in Indonesia. However, 2011 research with stakes of up to 40 weeks' wages in India showed that [...] "as stakes increase, <b>rejection</b> <b>rates</b> approach zero".|$|E

The {{results show that}} As concentration in permeate water was less than 10 µg/L when the feed As concentration was less than 135 µg/L, whereas As concentration after RO was less than 10 µg/L in all cases even if feed As concentration was more than 199 µg/L; these values in permeate water nearly meet the arsenic content level prescribed by China’s drinking water standards. The As <b>rejection</b> <b>rate</b> decreased {{with the increase in}} feed As and coexisting ion concentration, whereas the opposite occurred with regard to pH and conversion ratio. The decreasing percentage of the As <b>rejection</b> <b>rate</b> remained the same when arsenic concentration increased by 1 µmol or when (SO 4) 2 -increased by 0. 5 mol.

This paper discusses four components of reporting qualitative empirical studies to guide researchers in developing a logical manuscript. “Research is central to the development of any field of study ” (Merriam & Simpson, 2000, p. 1). To contribute to a field of study, research needs to be presented at conferences or meetings and, ultimately, published in peer-reviewed journals to reach wider national and international audiences. Sharing research results with scholarly audiences is the final and focal point of research (American Psychological Association [APA], 2001). Publishing {{in scholarly}} journals also helps both experienced and novice researchers to establish and advance their academic careers, for example to receive promotions and achieve tenure-track positions (Chisholm, 2007). However, publishing in scholarly journals is a challenging and stressful process due to high, up to a 90 %, manuscript <b>rejection</b> <b>rate</b> (McKercher et al., 2007).

To differentiate from each others, terminals are required to provide higher service level, higher reliability, and lower cost to their customers.

50|$|An {{analysis}} by Gregory Francis in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review {{suggested that the}} number of rejections of the null hypothesis reported by Bem (eight out of nine experiments) is abnormally high, given the properties of the experiments and reported effect sizes. He calculated that the probability of Bem obtaining such results (0.058) is significantly less than the standard criterion used in tests of publication bias (0.1). According to Francis, this suggests that Bem's experiments cannot be taken as a proper scientific study, as critical data is likely unavailable. Francis also noted that Bem's experiments meet current standards of experimental psychology. Drawing on his own analysis and studies suggesting a discrepancy between the observed and expected null hypothesis <b>rejection</b> <b>rates</b> across the field of experimental psychology, he suggests that the standards and practices of the field are not functioning properly.|$|E

However, there were many difficulties during the initial phase of production causing high <b>rejection</b> <b>rates</b> due to faulty receivers.

50|$|The biggest {{risk that}} comes with a hip {{piercing}} is rejection or piercing migration. This is a result of your body recognizing a foreign object and pushing it out. <b>Rejection</b> <b>rates</b> vary depending on the person’s skin, the activities a person partakes in that may create tension in that area, and the jewelry or procedure used. Sitting down for a consultation with a professional piercer is highly recommended before this type of piercing. Another risk includes tissue damage, which is the damaging of blood vessels or nerves in the dermis or dermal layer. This is more likely to happen when the piercing is done by someone who is not a professional. If the piercing is too deep, the skin layers may pull together, resulting in embedding. Shallow piercings will result in migration or rejection. The last risk is bacterial infection, which occurs when the equipment used is not sterilized, or the piercing is not well cared for during the healing process. Pus and inflammation may develop if the piercing becomes infected, however, careful cleaning and aftercare can avoid this risk.|$|E
