In this paper, a high-efficiency 2. 5 -dimensional <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> strategy for mould core machining is presented. The strategy consists of three different tool paths. The first tool path is generated {{on the basis of the}} convex hull boundary of a machining region. Owing to the absence of concave tool path segments, the convex hull based tool path can eliminate the chip load fluctuation problem encountered in corner cutting. The second tool path is an enhanced unidirectional straight-line tool path, which has the virtue of maintaining a steady cutting resistance throughout. The large staircases left behind by these two tool paths are refined by using the third tool path which is a contour-parallel tool path that cuts the mould core layer by layer in an upward manner. After applying these three tool paths, the stock material left on the mould core surface can be post-processed by the subsequent finish milling operation.

40|$|In recent years, {{producers}} of solid wood dimension parts have emphasized improvements in lumber yield, focusing primarily on lumber grade and cutting technology rather than cutting bill design.

The results indicated that cutting bill requirements have a large influence on yield when the shortest part length in the bill is changed. Medium-length part sizes also affect yield except when the cutting bill requires an unlimited number of small parts; in this case, yield always will be high. When an all-blades-movable arbor is used, length changes in the bill affect yield more than changes in width.

40|$|From an {{analytical}} viewpoint, {{the relationship between}} <b>rough</b> <b>mill</b> cutting bill part requirements and lumber yield is highly complex. Part requirements can have almost any length, width, and quantity distribution within the boundaries set by physical limitations, such as maximum length and width of parts. This complexity {{makes it difficult to}} understand the specific relationship between cutting bill requirements and lumber yield, rendering the optimization of the lumber cntting process through improved cutting bill composition difficult. An approach is presented to decrease the complexity of cutting bills to allow for easier analysis and, ultimately, to optimize cutting bill compositions. Principles from clustering theory were employed to create a standadized way to describe cutting bills. Cutting bill part clusters are part groups within the cutting bill's total part size space, where all parts are reset to a given group's midpoint. Statistical testing was used to determine a minimum resolution part group matrix that had no significant influence on yield compared to an actual cutting bill.

The {{first part of}} this 2 -part series described how different cutting-bill part sizes, when added to an existing cutting-bill, affect lumber yield, and quantified these observations. To accomplish this, the study employed linear least squares estimation technique. This second paper again looks at the influence of cutting-bill requirements but establishes a measure of how preferable it is to have a given part size required by the cutting-bill. The influence of the number of different part sizes to be cut simulta-neously on lumber yield is also investigated. Using rip-first <b>rough</b> <b>mill</b> simulation software and an orthogonal, 220 – 11 fractional-factorial design of resolution V, the correlation between lengths, widths, and 20 part sizes as defined by the Buehlmann cutting-bill with high yield was established. It was found that, as long as the quantity of small parts is limited, part sizes larger than the smallest size are more positively correlated with high yield. Furthermore, only 4 out of the 20 part sizes tested were identified with having a significant positive correlation with above average yield (65. 09 %), while 10 were found with a significant negative correlation and above average yield. With respect to the benefit of cutting varying numbers of part sizes simultaneously, this study showed that there is a positive correlation between yield and the number of different part sizes being cut.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Because {{of their}} high cost, {{reducing}} the number of boards used to fill an order of dimension parts is an important goal in a lumber <b>rough</b> <b>mill.</b> FLCO (Fuzzy Logic Cutting Order) is a computer program that achieves this goal. Using the concepts of fuzzy logic control, FLCO provides a heuristic approach to this problem. FLCO incorporates a version of the CORY lumber cut-up software, and provides a model of a rough-mill system that is able {{to reduce the number of}} boards needed to fill a cutting order. FLCO allows different control methods to be used, including fuzzy logic control, dropping sizes from the cutting order as their demands are met, and no control. Because of the modularity of its design the FLCO code can easily incorporate other control methods. CORY lumber cut-up software provides sawing solutions for boards based on the values assigned to the sizes in a cutting order. After each board is sawn, the fuzzy logic controller adjusts the value of each size to achieve the objective of filling the demand for each size in a cutting order at about the same time. These new values are subsequently used by CORY when finding a sawing solution for the next board to be processed. Upon completion, FLCO reports the number of boards required to fill the cutting order, the average percent area yield, and the number of each piece recovered. Three cutting orders, three lumber grades and two types of control provide a means of determining the effects of fuzzy logic control on {{reducing the number of}} boards used to fill a cutting order. Across all lumber grades and cutting orders, fuzzy logic control greatly reduces the number of boards as compared with dropping sizes. Fuzzy logic control slightly reduces the number of boards as compared with a more complicated method of control across all lumber grades and most cutting orders, but the difference is not statistically significant. In addition, the effect of fuzzy logic control on individual sizes is also examined...|$|E

In this paper three <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> objectives are considered: minimum machining time, maximum removed material and maximum uniformity of the remaining volume {{at the end of}} roughing. Owing to the complexity of the modelled problem and the large number of parameters, typical genetic algorithms cannot achieve global optima without defining case-dependent constraints. Therefore, to achieve generality, a hierarchical game similar to a Stackelberg game is implemented in which a typical Genetic Algorithm functions as the leader and micro-Genetic Algorithms as followers. In this game, one of the leader's parameters is responsible for creating a follower's population and for triggering the optimisation. After properly weighing the three objectives, the follower performs single-objective optimization in steps and feeds the leader back with the objective values as they appear prior to weighing.
