5|$|In January 2005, the US101 was {{selected}} for the VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program, and was promptly re-designated as the VH-71. However, development was subject to delays, cost overruns, and engineering issues; Lockheed attributed much of these issues to unanticipated and extensive modifications being demanded by the government that had been absent from the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (<b>RFP)</b> issued. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report in 2011 also recognised {{that a lack of}} flexibility and compromise {{on the part of the}} government had negatively impacted the programme. By late 2008, the cancellation of the VH-71 was looking increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|During 1982, the U.S. Army {{initiated}} the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) {{program with the}} aim of producing a replacement for several existing rotorcraft, including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. It was a further six years until, during 1988, a formal <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (<b>RFP)</b> was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter. During October 1988, it was revealed that two separate teams, these being Boeing–Sikorsky and Bell–McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to proceed with further development work upon their submitted concepts. During the 1990s, it was announced that the program's name had been changed from LHX to simply Light Helicopter (LH). During April 1991, the U.S. Army decided to select the design proposal produced by the Boeing–Sikorsky team as the contest winner; shortly thereafter, the team received a contract for the construction of four prototypes, which were intended to be operated in an extended demonstration and evaluation phase. It was in that same month that the helicopter received its official designation, that being RAH-66 Comanche, issued by the U.S. Army.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the USAF {{released}} a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (<b>RFP)</b> {{for a new}} tanker program, KC-X, to be selected by 2007. Boeing had also announced it may enter an even higher capability tanker based on the Boeing 777, named the KC-777 Strategic Tanker. Airbus partnered with Northrop Grumman to offer the Airbus A330 MRTT, the tanker version of the A330, which was being marketed to the USAF under the company name, KC-30.|$|E
25|$|A <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (<b>RFP)</b> for the TFX was {{provided}} to industry in October 1961. In December of that year Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell, North American and Republic submitted their proposals. The proposal evaluation group found all the proposals lacking, but the best should be improved with study contracts. Boeing and General Dynamics were selected to enhance their designs. Three rounds of updates to the proposals were conducted with Boeing being picked by the selection board. Instead Secretary McNamara selected General Dynamics' proposal in November 1962 due to its greater commonality between Air Force and Navy TFX versions. The Boeing aircraft versions shared {{less than half of}} the major structural components. General Dynamics signed the TFX contract in December 1962. A Congressional investigation followed, but did not change the selection.|$|E

500|$|In 1981, the U.S. Air Force {{developed}} {{a requirement for}} an Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) as a new air superiority fighter to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. This was made more crucial by the emerging worldwide threats, including development and proliferation of Soviet MiG-29 and Su-27 [...] "Flanker"-class fighter aircraft. It would {{take advantage of the}} new technologies in fighter design on the horizon including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight-control systems, more powerful propulsion systems and stealth technology. [...] In 1985 the Air Force sent out technical requests for proposals to a number of aircraft manufacturing teams. The formal <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (<b>RFP)</b> was issued in July1986, and two contractor teams, Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics, along with Northrop and McDonnell Douglas, were selected on 31October1986 to undertake a 50-month demonstration phase, culminating in the flight test of the two teams' prototypes, the YF-22 and the YF-23.|$|E
500|$|Amtrak {{employed}} {{a mix of}} inherited cars on its long-distance trains in the Western United States. Most of these were conventional single-level cars, but Amtrak had also inherited 73 Hi-Level cars from the Santa Fe. The Budd Company built these between 1954 and 1964; the bilevel design, with its superior views and smooth riding characteristics, was well-suited to the long distances in the west. Michael R. Weinman, {{who worked at the}} design firm Louis T. Klauder & Associates, recalled that when Amtrak issued a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (<b>RFP)</b> in 1973 for a [...] "totally new" [...] passenger car, it [...] "was assumed" [...] that the design would be bilevel. Thirteen companies responded to the RFP; Amtrak selected the proposal by Louis T. Klauder & Associates. The design was finished by mid-1974 and Amtrak invited four companies to bid on its construction—Boeing, Budd, Pullman-Standard, and Rohr—with Pullman-Standard winning the contract.|$|E
500|$|American {{reconnaissance}} satellites first {{spotted the}} advanced Soviet Su-27 and MiG-29 fighter prototypes in 1978, which caused {{concern in the}} U.S. Both Soviet models were expected to reduce the maneuverability advantage of contemporary US fighter aircraft. In 1981, the USAF requested information from several aerospace companies on possible features for an Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) to replace the F-15 Eagle. After discussions with aerospace companies, the USAF made air-to-air combat the primary role for the ATF. The ATF was {{to take advantage of}} emerging technologies, including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight-control systems, more powerful propulsion systems, and stealth technology. [...] In October 1985, the USAF issued a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (<b>RFP)</b> to several aircraft manufacturers. The RFP was modified in May 1986 to include evaluation of prototype air vehicles from the two finalists. At the same time, the U.S. Navy, under the Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) program, announced that it would use a derivative of the ATF winner to replace its F-14 Tomcat. The NATF program called for procurement of 546 aircraft along with the USAF's planned procurement of 750 aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1992, the team could {{demonstrate}} portions of the new platform, including the Green OS, the Oak language, the libraries, and the hardware. Their first demonstration, on September 3, 1992, focused on building a personal digital assistant (PDA) device named Star7 that had a graphical interface and a smart agent called [...] "Duke" [...] to assist the user. In November of that year, the Green Project was spun off to become Firstperson, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Microsystems, and the team relocated to Palo Alto, California. The Firstperson team {{had an interest in}} building highly interactive devices, and when Time Warner issued a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (<b>RFP)</b> for a set-top box, Firstperson changed their target and responded with a proposal for a set-top box platform. However, the cable industry felt that their platform gave too much control to the user, so Firstperson lost their bid to SGI. An additional deal with The 3DO Company for a set-top box also failed to materialize. Unable to generate interest within the television industry, the company was rolled back into Sun.|$|E

The finalized RfP was issued in second quarter FY 2011 to which industry had a month to respond. A 12–18-month testing phase commenced and over 1 million rounds were to be fired. Testers looked at the consistency in accuracy of the carbines as they aged. Costs were also be considered. The Office of the Secretary of Defense monitored tests and the evaluation and there was congressional oversight to ensure the competition was full and open. [...] was spent on testing. The winner of the competition {{had to be a}} [...] "measurable improvement" [...] over the M4 carbine to replace it; otherwise, the program would instead convert all M4 carbines to the enhanced version.
