5|$|Incubation lasts {{thirteen}} days, {{although the}} last egg laid may take 24hours {{longer than the}} first to hatch. Both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs, but the female spends more time incubating them than does the male, {{and is the only}} parent to do so at night when the male returns to the communal roost. The young are born blind and naked. They develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days. Once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature, about six days after hatching, the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest. Prior to that, the fouling would wet both the chicks' plumage and the nest material, thereby reducing their effectiveness as insulation and increasing the risk of chilling the hatchlings. Nestlings remain in the nest for three weeks, where they are fed continuously by both parents. Fledglings continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks. A pair can raise up to three broods per year, frequently reusing and <b>relining</b> the same nest, although two broods is typical, or just one north of 48°N. Within two months, most juveniles will have moulted and gained their first basic plumage. They acquire their adult plumage the following year. As with other passerines, the nest is kept clean and the chicks' faecal sacs are removed by the adults.|$|E

25|$|When {{dentures}} {{no longer}} fit well, the correct action {{is to seek}} follow-up care. Using denture adhesive may improve the fit, but it tends to work better when {{only a small amount}} is used as covering the denture fitting surface in adhesive makes it stay in less well. Adhesives may compensate for gradual loosening of a denture, but it is only a temporary solution; it does not solve the problem. Fortunately, dentures can often be relined with <b>relining</b> materials to restore the proper fit, and this process costs less than creation of new dentures. Overall, a well-made denture should last about 5 years or more.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Bond Strengths among {{denture base}} resins and {{various types of}} <b>reline</b> {{materials}} are not always satisfactorily high. Therefore efforts {{have been made to}} use materials similar to resin base dentures and bonding agents to increase infirmity. This study compares bond strength and deflection of a hard chair side <b>reline</b> material with two denture base resins. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 54 resin specimens with the size of 65 × 10 × 2. 5 mm were prepared. These specimens included intact heat cure (M), cold cure (F), acrylic resin specimens bonded with the same resins (M-M, F-F) and specimens bonded to a hard chair side <b>reline</b> material (M-G, F-G). All specimens were stored in sodium hypochlorite 8 hours a day for 3 months and were then thermocycled (2000 cycles, 5 to 55 °C). The transverse bond strengths (FMax) and deflections (DFMax) were evaluated with three point loading test. The results were analyzed with two-way ANOVA followed by Games Howell & Gabriel’s and Kolmogrov-smirnor test (α = 0. 05). Results: F Max for different types of resins and <b>reline</b> materials showed significant differences (p value < 0. 05). Although DFMax differences between <b>reline</b> materials and their interactions with different types of resins were significantly different (p value < 0. 05), no significant difference among the types of resins could be found (p value = 0. 263). Comparing the <b>reline</b> materials with denture base resins, cold cure resin was shown to have statistically different FMax and DFMax (p value < 0. 05). Heat cure resins showed statistical differences on FMax between intact resins when <b>relined</b> with the same resins and <b>relined</b> with hard <b>reline</b> (p value < 0. 05). Conclusion: Bond strength of the cold cure denture base resin group (F) to the same resin was higher than hard <b>reline,</b> but bond strength of hard <b>reline</b> material with heat cure denture base was similar to the bond strength of the same <b>reline,</b> and in this group, maximum deflection in bonded resin with the same resins were showed.

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Triad visible light-polymerized (VLP) <b>reline</b> resin has the {{potential}} to repair denture bases from other resin systems with the elimination of flasking/deflasking procedures. PURPOSE: This study measured the tensile and shear bond strengths of Triad VLP, PMMA, and glass-fiber-reinforced PMMA (GF-PMMA) acrylic resins before and after repair with Triad VLP <b>reline</b> material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six specimens were fabricated from Triad VLP, PMMA, and GF-PMMA denture base resins. Both Triad VLP <b>reline</b> material and autopolymerizing acrylic resins were used to repair identical laboratory fabricated resin joints. Twenty-eight rectangular specimens (in 4 different groups of 7 each) were prepared to study the shear bond strength of Triad <b>reline</b> material used to repair different denture base resin joints. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P<. 0001) were found between the tensile strengths of specimens repaired with the Triad VLP <b>reline</b> resin used as a repair agent and those repaired with the autopolymerizing resin. The tensile strength of the Triad VLP denture base resin was found to be higher than that of both the PMMA and GF-PMMA acrylic resins. CONCLUSION: The low tensile and shear bond strengths found after the repair of PMMA and GF-PMMA acrylic resins with Triad VLP <b>reline</b> material were attributed to a lack of cohesion/adhesion between the Triad VLP <b>reline</b> material and the interfaces of the treated sites. The use of Triad VLP <b>reline</b> material to repair Triad VLP denture base resin produced the highest strengths. King Saud Universit...|$|R

60|$|Early in May {{the winter}} {{congregation}} breaks up, the cliff-breeders {{going back to}} the rocks and the village birds to their chimneys, where they presently set about <b>relining</b> their old nests. There are plenty of places for all, since there are chimneys in almost every cottage where fires are never lighted, and as ventilation is not wanted in bedrooms the birds are allowed to bring in more materials each year, until the whole flue is filled up. Year by year the materials brought in, sink lower and lower until they rest on the closed iron register and change in time to a solid brown mould. Thus, however long-lived a daw may be--and there are probably more centenarians among the daws than among the human inhabitants of the villages--it is a rare thing for one to be disturbed in his tenancy.|$|E

Material and Methods 					Specimens of each material (denture base acrylic resin - Lucitone 550 – L; autopolymerizing <b>reline</b> resins - Ufi Gel Hard–UH, Tokuyama Rebase II-TR, New Truliner–NT and Kooliner-K), were produced, notched and {{divided into two groups}} (n= 10) : CG (control group of autopolymerizing <b>reline</b> resins and L) : FT tests were performed after polymerization; TG (thermocycled group) : FT tests were performed after T (5 °C and 55 °C for 5, 000 cycles). Results: Results (MPa. m 1 / 2) were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p= 0. 05). L exhibited the highest FT mean values in both groups (CG - 2. 33; TG - 2. 17).

40|$|Tese de Mestrado, Medicina Dentária, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Medicina Dentária, 2015 A release {{delivery}} {{system for the}} treatment of denture stomatitis using chlorhexidine-incorporated self-cured resins has been investigated. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of chlorhexidine incorporation on shear bond strength and surface free energy of three acrylic <b>reline</b> resins, Kooliner, Ufi Gel Hard and Probase Cold. For all tests, the experimental specimens were incorporated with chlorhexidine 1 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5 % or 10 % (w/w) and the control specimens were left unloaded. Shear bond strength test was performed on specimens of <b>reline</b> resins attached to denture base resin (n= 10) and after this test, the failure mode was assessed. Specimens with 25 × 16 × 1 mm dimensions (n= 5) were submitted to contact angles determination, performed by the Wilhelmy plaque technique, in order to estimate surface free energy values. Statistical differences were observed among acrylic <b>reline</b> resins in shear bond strength values, with Kooliner showing significantly lower values than the other <b>reline</b> resins. Statistical differences weren’t found between groups from Kooliner and Ufi Gel Hard. Probase Cold specimens obtained a decrease of shear bond strength values with the increase of chlorhexidine concentration incorporated. Statistical differences were observed among acrylic <b>reline</b> resins in total surface free energy values, with Ufi Gel Hard demonstrating total surface free energy values significantly higher than the other <b>reline</b> resins, at cost of the increased values of dispersive component. Statistical differences were found between all groups in total surface free energy values from Kooliner, Ufi Gel Hard and Probase Cold. However, only Kooliner showed significant differences in dispersive and polar components. In sum, the incorporation of chlorhexidine has influence only on shear bond strength of Probase Cold specimens with higher concentrations of chlorhexidine.

40|$|Specimens {{of three}} {{different}} denture base resins were repaired with visible light cured (VLC) <b>reline</b> material and with the traditional sprinkle on autopolymerizing PMMA repair resin. Flexural properties were measured before and after repair and compared. These tests revealed that fiber reinforced polymethylmethacrylate, (PMMA) denture base joints repaired with autopolymerizing acrylic resin can produce superior bonding properties. Transverse strength of joints made and repaired with the VLC acrylic resin system gave favorable pre-repair strength and lower post-repair strength. Significant {{differences were found between}} the flexural properties of the denture base resins used before and after repair. Plain and fiber reinforced PMMA acrylic resin joints repaired with the VLC <b>reline</b> material, showed a reduction of transverse strength ranging from 48. 2 %- 56. 4 % of the original values. However, only 26. 1 % loss of strength was found for VLC denture base resin joints repaired with VLC <b>reline</b> material. This difference in strength reduction could be attributed to the poor adhesive bonding between the VLC <b>reline</b> material and the PMMA resin base. King Saud Universit...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Cylinders (3. 5 mm x 5. 0 mm) of the <b>reline</b> resins were bonded to cylinders of QC- 20 polymerized using cycle A (boiling water- 20 minutes) or B (boiling water; remove heat- 20 minutes; boiling water- 20 minutes). For each <b>reline</b> resin/polymerization cycle combination, 10 specimens (groups CAt e CBt) were thermally cycled (5 and 55 °C; dwell time 30 seconds; 2, 000 cycles); the other 10 were tested without thermal cycling (groups CAwt ad CBwt). Shear bond tests (0. 5 mm/min) were performed on the specimens and the failure mode was assessed. Data were analyzed by 3 -way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls post-hoc test (α=. 05). Results: QC- 20 resin demonstrated the lowest bond strengths among the <b>reline</b> materials (P<. 05) and mainly failed cohesively. Overall, the bond strength of the hard chairside <b>reline</b> resins were similar (10. 09 ± 1. 40 to 15. 17 ± 1. 73 MPa) {{and most of the}} failures were adhesive/cohesive (mixed mode). However, Ufi Gel Hard bonded to QC- 20 polymerized using cycle A and not thermally cycled showed the highest bond strength (P<. 001). When Tokuso Rebase Fast and Duraliner II were bonded to QC- 20 resin polymerized using cycle A, the bond strength was increased (P=. 043) after thermal cycling. Conclusions: QC- 20 displayed the lowest bond strength values in all groups.
