50|$|Since {{paper is}} {{produced}} from wood fibres, {{it was possible}} to transfer some of the developments achieved in wood technology to paper technology. Several technologies (e.g. chemical modification, nano-scale celluloses, polyelectrolytes, functional polymers based on cellulose, hemicelluloses and starch) were researched and used by different research groups around Europe (e.g. PTS and University of Goettingen, Germany; Kungliga Tekniska högskolan (KTH), Sweden.) There is already well established knowledge on chemical fibre modification of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres.</b> Adamopoulos and Mai (2011) modified <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> with N-methylol compounds and glutaraldehyde with significant improvement on fibre characteristics and paper sheet performance. Laboratory sheets manufactured with a variety of chemically modified <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> were found to be superior in stiffness and hygroscopic properties than these manufactured from unmodified ones.

40|$|Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRPs) {{have very}} {{impressive}} properties. particularly {{in terms of}} specific strength and stiffness. and they are widely used in many industries {{such as in the}} production of high-tech sports goods and the aviation industry In addition. the quantity of (,FRPs in use has increased significantly. especially during the past few decades. After Hoeing announced the shift in their aeroplanes from alloy based to composite aircraft. there has been a very large impact on the carbon fibre market. and it is estimated that by 2014. the carbon fibre market will reach £ l. 7 billion. However. the growth of carbon fibre utilisation has resulted in an increased quantity of CFRP waste which still {{has the potential to be}} al high value material and which can be recycled and reused in non-structural applications. The aim of this study is to <b>recycle</b> carbon <b>fibre</b> using a fluidised bed and to investigate the most suitable operating conditions in order to obtain the highest quality of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> in term of fibre length. tensile properties and surface energy. All aerospace grade composite was recycled using a fluidised bed process operating between 525 °C and 550 °C with a fluidising velocity of 0. 8 m/s and 1 m/s and a bed depth of 5 cm and Scm. As the recycling temperature can affect the residence time in the fluidised bed. there were two forms of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> resulted from this process: single fibre filaments elutriated from the bed and bundles of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> remained in the bed. The elutriated single filaments. <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> possessed approximately 46 % normalised tensile strength with 67 % average normalised tensile modulus while the bundles offered higher tensile properties (the <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> bundles had roughly 67 % normalised tensile strength and 73 % average normalised tensile modulus). Both <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> type had a clean surface with no visible damage. The efforts to improve the tensile properties of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> were carried out by controlling the oxygen content. However. it was found that low oxygen content, between 6 and 18 per cent. does not improve tensile strength of a <b>recycled</b> carbon <b>fibre.</b> The main parameter associated with the single filament <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> quality is temperature. An increasing temperature tends to decrease the fibre length degradation and tensile strength for recycled single filaments. both of which are due to faster char oxidation and hence. a lower residence Time before elutriation. For the <b>recycled</b> carbon <b>fibre</b> bundles. it was found that the <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> quality is related to fluidising velocity and bed depth. Regarding surface energy. it has been observed that the surface energy of <b>recycled</b> carbon <b>fibre</b> depends on the quantity of acid based functional groups and these changes are slightly dependent on the recycling conditions. Finally. degradation modelling of the composite has been developed and Shown to be a useful tool in determining the behaviour of the composite in the fluidised bed. The outcomes of this research are not only useful for understanding and optimising the fluidised bed process for recycling carbon fibre. but they are also helpful in developing a better understanding of carbon fibre recycling operations based on thermal processing.

40|$|Plastic macro fibres, {{inclusive}} of virgin and <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres,</b> {{are becoming more}} popular {{in the construction of}} concrete footpaths, precast panels and shotcrete mine tunnels. In particular, the use of <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres</b> has become increasingly attractive due to their low cost and sustainability. However, due to their production and service history, the <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres</b> normally have lower mechanical properties than the virgin plastic fibres. Therefore, the feasibility of using <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres</b> in concrete may be in doubt. This research assessed reinforcing effects of the <b>recycled</b> Polypropylene (PP) <b>fibre</b> and compared it with those of the virgin PP fibre. Crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) and round determinate panel test (RDPT) were carried out to assess the postcracking behaviours of the <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> reinforced concrete. The results showed that the <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> produced by the same process as the virgin PP fibre obtained lower tensile strength but higher Young’s modulus than the virgin PP <b>fibre.</b> Although the <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> had lower tensile strength, in the CMOD and RDPT the <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> showed comparable reinforcement to the virgin PP fibre owing to its higher Young's modulus...|$|R

The <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> sheet also showed better strength properties due to the better bonding between the fibres. The wet pressing seemed to have no significant improvement in the strength of the sheets. It was also proved that PAE resin significantly increased strength for handsheets made from all type of pulp.

40|$|Use of macro <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres</b> in {{reinforcing}} concrete footpaths and precast panels offers {{significant economic}} and environmental benefits over traditionally used virgin plastic fibres or steel fibre and mesh. However, wide adoption of <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres</b> by construction industries {{has not yet been}} seen due to limited data available on their durability, mechanical properties and performance in concrete. This paper reports findings from a laboratory study on the alkali resistance and performance of <b>recycled</b> polypropylene (PP) <b>fibres</b> in the 25 MPa and 40 MPa concretes, used for footpaths and precast panels, respectively. The <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> was proven to have very good alkali resistance in the concrete and other alkaline environments. The <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> showed excellent post-cracking performance in concrete, bringing in significant ductility. In the 40 MPa concrete the effectiveness of reinforcement of PP fibres depended on their Young's modulus and tensile strength in the crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) test. Since the <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> was found to have lower tensile strength but higher Young's modulus than those of virgin PP <b>fibre,</b> the <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> produced similar or slightly lower reinforcement than that of virgin PP fibre. In the 25 MPa concrete, the Young's modulus of fibres was more effective on their reinforcement than the tensile strength, thus the <b>recycled</b> PP <b>fibre</b> produced better reinforcement than that of virgin PP fibre...|$|R

40|$|The structure-property {{relationship}} for <b>recycled</b> carbon <b>fibres</b> is investigated by characterisation {{of the structure}} changes induced by the pyrolysis recycling process.

The oxidative effect results in surface defects, and the surface defects causes a reduction in tensile strength and lateral crystallite size.
