5|$|Freedom fries was a {{political}} euphemism for French fries in the United States. The term came to prominence in 2003 when the then <b>Republican</b> <b>Chairman</b> of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias in response to France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although originally supported with several restaurants changing their menus as well, the term fell out of use due to declining support for the Iraq War. Following Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, it was quietly reverted.|$|E

50|$|In May 2012, Harold {{was one of}} four finalists for the Republican {{nomination}} for Congress in Illinois's 13th district, a nomination selected by the <b>Republican</b> <b>chairmen</b> of the 14 counties covered by the 13th Congressional District, instead of a primary election. The <b>Republican</b> <b>chairmen</b> selected Rodney L. Davis, over Harold, and Davis was subsequently elected to Congress, in a close and expensive race.|$|R

25|$|Pataki was a {{first term}} state senator from Westchester County when he {{launched}} his bid for the Republican nomination for governor in 1994. He said he launched the campaign because of his frustration in the Senate regarding how Albany worked and on tax issues. He was little known statewide and his campaign received a boost when he was endorsed by U.S. Sen. Al D'Amato. He received the party's endorsement at the spring state convention and easily defeated former State <b>Republican</b> <b>Chairman</b> Richard Rosenbaum in the September primary. Pataki was considered an underdog from the start since he was running against three term Gov. Mario Cuomo and because Pataki had little name recognition statewide. D'Amato reportedly backed Pataki because of a poll that showed a pro-choice, fiscal conservative from the New York City suburbs could win statewide for governor. The poll also showed a female running mate for lieutenant governor would help the ticket, thus leading to the selection of academic Betsy McCaughey as Pataki's running mate.|$|E
25|$|The College Republicans summer 1973 {{convention}} at the Lake of the Ozarks {{resort in}} Missouri was quite contentious. Rove's opponent was Robert Edgeworth of Michigan. The other major candidate, Terry Dolan of California, dropped out, supporting Edgeworth. A {{number of states}} had sent two competing delegates, because Rove and his supporters had made credential challenges at state and regional conventions. For example, after the Midwest regional convention, Rove forces had produced {{a version of the}} Midwestern College Republicans constitution which differed significantly from the constitution that the Edgeworth forces were using, in order to justify the unseating of the Edgeworth delegates on procedural grounds, including delegations, such as Ohio and Missouri, which had been certified earlier by Rove himself. In the end, there were two votes, conducted by two convention chairs, and two winners—Rove and Edgeworth, each of whom delivered an acceptance speech. After the convention, both Edgeworth and Rove appealed to Republican National Committee Chairman George H. W. Bush, each contending that he was the new College <b>Republican</b> <b>chairman.</b>|$|E
500|$|Andrew's {{popularity}} {{made him}} the choice to head the Massachusetts delegation to the 1860 Republican National Convention. [...] He was nominated for governor at the state convention that year, despite {{an attempt by the}} more moderate Governor Banks to secure the nomination for Henry L. Dawes. Banks sought to put off the announcement of his retirement until the last possible moment, but state <b>Republican</b> <b>chairman</b> William Claflin leaked the news to Andrew supporters. [...] Andrew won the nomination by a wide margin, and defeated Constitutional Union Party candidate Amos A. Lawrence in the general election.|$|E

Richard Wager, a former aide to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and State Senator Stephen Saland had also been mentioned. Alexander [...] "Sandy" [...] Treadwell, the former New York Secretary of State and 2008 U.S. House challenger, had announced he would not run. On January 24, State Assembly Minority Leader Jim Tedisco received the endorsement of Saratoga County's <b>Republican</b> <b>chairman,</b> while the Greene County GOP endorsed Faso.|$|E
500|$|Governor Nelson Rockefeller (1959–1973) (R) {{tried to}} stimulate the city with grandiose, monumental {{architecture}} and large, government-sponsored building projects; he drove construction of the Empire State Plaza, SUNY Albany's uptown campus, {{and much of the}} W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus. Albany County <b>Republican</b> <b>Chairman</b> Joseph C. Frangella once quipped, [...] "Governor Rockefeller was the best mayor Albany ever had." [...] Corning, though opposed to the project, was responsible for negotiating the payment plan for the Empire State Plaza. Rockefeller {{did not want to be}} limited by the Legislature's power of the purse, so Corning devised a plan to have the county pay for the construction and have the state sign a lease-ownership agreement. The state paid off the bonds until 2004. It was Rockefeller's only viable option, and he agreed. Due to the clout Corning gained from the situation, he was able to get the State Museum, a convention center, and a restaurant, back in the plans—ideas which Rockefeller had originally vetoed. The county gained $35 million in fees and the city received $13 million for lost tax revenue. Having the state offices in the city enabled it to keep good jobs.|$|E
500|$|With the war {{fifteen years}} {{in the past and}} Union generals at the head of both tickets, the tactic was less {{effective}} than the Republicans hoped. [...] Realizing this, they adjusted their approach to claim that Democrats would lower the country's protective tariff, which would allow cheaper manufactured goods to be imported from Europe, and thereby put thousands out of work. This argument struck home in the swing states of New York and Indiana, where many were employed in manufacturing. Hancock did not help his own cause when, in an attempt to remain neutral on the tariff, he said that [...] "he tariff question is a local question," [...] which only made him appear uninformed about an important issue. [...] Candidates for high office did not personally campaign in those days, but as state <b>Republican</b> <b>chairman,</b> Arthur played a part in the campaign in his usual fashion: overseeing the effort in New York and raising money. The funds were crucial in the close election, and winning his home state of New York was critical. The Republicans carried New York by 20,000 votes and, in an election with the largest turnout of qualified voters ever recorded—78.4%—they won the nationwide popular vote by just 7,018 votes. [...] The electoral college result was more decisive—214 to 155—and Garfield and Arthur were elected.|$|E
