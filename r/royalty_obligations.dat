Over {{the last couple of}} years, the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) and SoundExchange have been working to impose <b>royalty</b> <b>obligations</b> on small Internet radio stations. Such obligations require small Internet radio stations to pay royalties that are far higher than that of terrestrial broadcasters. Due to the lack of equality in these obligations, many stations and their listeners campaigned and petitioned against the new royalty rules.|$|E
50|$|Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, {{as amended}} in 1978, {{and under the}} {{provisions}} of the DWRRA of 1995, relief from <b>royalty</b> <b>obligations</b> may be granted to increase production or to encourage development on certain producing or non-producing leases. Royalty relief may be applied to either active leases or to newly offered leases directly in their fiscal terms. The primary MMS royalty relief programs include those that were required for Gulf of Mexico deepwater leases (located in water depth greater than 200 meters or 656 feet) issued in 1996-2000 under the DWRRA. After certain sunset provisions in the DWRRA expired in November 2000, the MMS adopted a program that provides lower amounts of royalty relief to each lease. The Federal Government has also offered royalty relief incentives since 2001 for natural gas production from certain deep wells in shallow water (15,000 feet total well depth) for newly issued leases, and commenced a similar program for active shallow water leases where drilling started on or after March 26, 2003.|$|E

On 8 March 2002 the investment company Inwest made a competing offer valuing DRC at C$3.05 per share. CAT's offer would see DRC shareholders receiving CAT shares whilst Inwest's offer would see the DRC shareholder receiving cash. DRC's board of directors changed their decision and recommended Inwest's offer. After a number of deadline extensions from CAT the offer from Inwest was accepted by the DRC shareholders. Inwest purchased DRC on the 2 May 2002, and the company began operating as a private entity that continues operation today as DRI Capital.|$|R

Jac Holzman of Elektra wrote:"I was...searching {{for a way to}} take our specialized and distinctive catalog and have it heard by many people. As a fanatical moviegoer, I knew the value of the film trailer. I translated that to the record business. My concept...was a sampler LP: a collection of musical trailers, a compendium of carefully assembled material, with lyrics and notes, all on a 10-inch LP that would sell for a bargain price unheard of in 1954: $2.00...I inserted a [...] "sampler clause" [...] in all new artists' contracts, allowing me to use one track from any album, royalty-free...With no <b>royalty</b> <b>obligation</b> and only the raw cost of manufacturing to consider, a good sampler could net between ten and twenty thousand dollars.

5000|$|In 2003, the General Accounting Office (GAO) {{noted that}} the MMS had failed to develop [...] "clear {{strategic}} objectives linked to statutory requirements nor collected the necessary information to effectively monitor and evaluate the Royalty-in-Kind Program". [...] From 2003 to 2008, the GAO consistently challenged {{the legitimacy of the}} statistics published by the MMS that it used to support its claims that the RIK program was a success and justify its expansion. [...] Deficits in accounting practices, policies and procedures, and information systems used by the MMS led to concerns that the industry was significantly underpaying on their <b>royalty</b> <b>obligations.</b> [...] Computer systems in use by the Agency were considered to be sufficiently inadequate that a failure to report revenue or provide RIK by an industry member could not be reliably detected. [...] For instance, the GAO estimated that underpayments amounted to ~$160 million USD in 2006. [...] The GAO also disputed the practice of tracking oil and gas RIK deliveries on a monthly rather than daily basis, a practice used by the MMS and supported by the Department of the Interior, but potentially prone to abuse by producers. [...] Other contributing factors to the placing the accuracy of revenue streams at risk were insufficiently trained personnel and insufficient numbers of personnel working in the RIK program and a lack of standard reporting method by industry members, leading to manual rather than computer-based processing of {{more than half of the}} data required for RIK data inputs.|$|E

40|$|Technical standards, which enable {{products}} {{manufactured by}} different vendors to work together, {{form the basis of}} the modem technological infrastructure. Yet an obscure provision of the U. S. Copyright Act, enacted to allow authors and composers to profit from the later success of their works, now threatens to disrupt this critical technological ecosystem. Enacted in 1976, Section 203 of the Copyright Act permits the author of a copyrighted work to revoke any copyright license or assignment between thirty-five and forty years after the grant was made. For grants made in 1978, the first year to which Section 203 applies, terminations could first be made in 2013, and in the music and publishing industries such terminations, and the concomitant litigation, have already begun. Technical standards are also treated as copyrightable works, and arguably the provisions of Section 203 apply to them. Numerous standards published in 1978 are still in use, and each year the number of standards potentially subject to Section 203 termination will grow. But unlike the composers and authors whom Section 203 was intended to protect, contributors to technical standards are usually engineers employed by large corporations, research institutions, or government agencies who make such contributions without additional compensation. Standards are thus unburdened by the copyright <b>royalty</b> <b>obligations</b> that characterize musical compositions, books, and other works of authorship. The termination of customary royalty-free copyright licenses granted by contributors to standards organizations or their heirs could thus have a significant disruptive effect on the standardization process and impose a substantial new cost on industries that are standards-dependent (a cost most likely to be passed through to consumers). The application of Section 203 to technical standards, however, is not straightforward. This article, for the first time, assesses Section 203 in terms of its applicability to technical standards documents. In particular, it analyzes considerations of joint authorship, works-made-for-hire, and derivative works under Section 203 to an area that was clearly not contemplated by Congress when it enacted the statute. We conclude that, although Section 203 is theoretically applicable to technical standards, several statutory obstacles would impede the wholesale termination of standards-related license grants. Nevertheless, in order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, we recommend that Congress or the courts explicitly acknowledge the inapplicability of Section 203 to technical standards...|$|E
40|$|The {{well-known}} {{result that}} capital structure is irrelevant for firm value follows from {{a set of}} assumptions conducive to theoretical analysis. In this note we explore the implications of relaxing one of these assumptions: the independence of cash flows from capital structure. Unlike debt and equity, funding that {{is accompanied by a}} <b>royalty</b> payment <b>obligation</b> has the effect of increasing marginal cost, to which a profit-maximizing firm responds by reducing output, violating the independence assumption. We study the effect on optimal production plans of generalized <b>royalty</b> payment <b>obligations</b> in which the royalty rate need not be constant across partitions of cumulative output, resulting in piece-wise linear cumulative royalty schedules that are not everywhere differentiable. The associated optimization problem for intertemporal production planning is nonstandard as it is not time separable. Here we solve this nonstandard problem by formulating an equivalent problem that in turn can be solved by the Pontryagin Maximum Principle using numerical techniques. When generalized royalty-based finance is included in the financing mix, the optimal production plan is non-trivially related to capital structure and capital structure is relevant to firm value. Unless the financing mix is restricted to debt and equity, financing decisions and production planning decisions cannot be undertaken independently in general...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} South African Copyright Act No. 98 of 1978 as it {{pertains}} to the archived holdings at the International Library of African Music (ILAM) situated at Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa. The purpose of analysing this law is to advise and assist ILAM in fulfilling <b>royalty</b> payment <b>obligations</b> as stipulated in a contract signed between ILAM and the Smithsonian Global Sound (formally Global Sound Network) in 2001. In order to clearly comprehend the scope of the royalty payment clause in the Smithsonian Institutionâs contract with ILAM, this research includes an examination of: the history and nature of South African copyright as a sub-structure of intellectual property; specific internationally documented copyright infringement cases; the recording and documentation practices of Hugh Tracey (ILAMâs founder and director from 1954 to 1977); the contract between Global Sound Network and ILAM; and contentious issues surrounding collective ownership and indigenous knowledge. In conclusion, this research suggests equitable solutions to ILAMâs copyright concerns and proposes the Eastern Cape Music Archiving Project (ECMAP) as a practical vehicle to assist the South African Department of Trade and Industry in implementation of the South African Intellectual Property Amendment Bill (2008) if, and when, it is passed. ...|$|R
50|$|Licensees {{expect that}} the license will provide them with sales growth. This sales growth {{may be in the}} form of growth within {{existing}} market or the opportunity to enter a new market. To achieve this, licensees {{expect that the}} brand they are licensing has significant brand preference, that it will open doors and ultimately help them meet or exceed their business objectives. The licensing contract forces the licensee to achieve certain sales targets and royalties; therefore, the goal of the licensee is to quickly meet their business objectives, thereby achieving their contract <b>obligations.</b> <b>Royalties</b> are the monies paid to a licensor by the licensee for the right to use the licensed property. It is calculated by multiplying the Royalty Rate by the Net Sales.|$|R
50|$|<b>Royalties</b> are {{contractual}} <b>obligations</b> of the Issuer of the royalty, {{made for}} the benefit of the holder of the royalty. Royalties require the payment of an agreed percentage of revenue of the Issuer, for an agreed period of time. In the event a royalty is purchased from an Issuer, the future revenue upon which the royalty is based is unknown at the time of the original transaction. Therefore, the cumulative amount of the future royalty payments is also an unknown. Royalty payments are not interest and royalties expire without value at their maturity. To be usurious payments made and received for the use of funds must be considered interest for loaned funds which require repayment at the maturity of the loan. The value in gains by the use of the royalty should equal its payment value, excess cost or interest beyond its tangible value is illicit interest or usury.|$|R
40|$|License is a {{commercial}} previllege right, {{it means to}} give a right and authority in exploiting protected-copyright economically by giving permit in written-contract or in document form. Licensee has an authority to reproduce or to announce in exploiting licenced-copyright, and if its exploitation without permit from the licencee, so that activity is a legal infringement. Besides that, License is also a solution, which is taken by Licensor if the copyright holder has not intended in developing his own-copyright. The option that constitutes compromise between self authorization and to release it which makes the process of license becoming very sensitive. Involving parties {{have come from the}} different interest, suddenly, they togetherly should share the rights, obligations and trade risk proportionally in {{a certain period of time}} for the interest that maybe different each other. The proportion of right, obligation and trade risk, finally, bring two parties, those are licensee and licensor inside to the negotiation and long speaking that is contained in the agreement of license contract. By taking the title of "LICENSE IN THE FIELD OF COPYRIGHT", this thesis will do the reasearch on the implementation of license in Copyright whether it is about mechanism of its implementation, the payment of compensation or <b>royalty,</b> <b>obligation</b> in the notification of license contract, and the registration of Copyright, and also the solution of dispute in license of Copyright as refer to the stipulations as regulated in Law No. 19 Year 2002 on Copyright. The consideration that is based on this research to those matters where there is no appropriation the rule licenses in this law, and in that license has a nature of civil law. Besides that, Copyright object which is licensed has anykind of types, where all of those have different characteristic, so it has difficulty in giving the rule of license fully in a certain law. The problem of this research is how the mechanism of copyright license to the copyright object which is different and why the obligation in giving the royalty in the contract of license in Copyright should be guided by the agreement of professional association, why the agreement of Copyright License has an obligation to be notified in order to have a law impact for the third party, whereas that Copyright registration itself is not an obligation in having the right and how the parties accomplish the dispute which is happened in license implementation. Whereas, the objective of research to be achieved is for knowing and understanding the mechanism of implementation in Copyright license, including the mechanism of royalty payment, it is also to know the exist of administration in Copyright including the rule of Copyright registration and sinchronization the rule of obligation in the License notification in the Copyright Law with the contract law and also the legal effort which is burst to the dispute which is happened in the implementation of license. The methodology research is using the combination between normative research and sociological research. The reason of the combination in this two methods are merely based on the nature of problem concept and the objective of research which is different. From the result and the analysis of research are founded the strategic inventions as follow: 1. 	There is any differences in mechanism of Copyright license between one of Copyright object with others. This differences are because of differences in characteristic. The Copyright of song/ music is very close connecting to the Neighboring right (performers, sound recording, and broad casting) and the problem in "publication right"; the book publishing, is more concern to the "reproduction right" beside of the problem in "publication right", whereas in license of computer` program is more concern to the "using" of the computer program itself. Besides that, the license of computer program and license of song/ music are more dominant in using the agreement/ standar contract or crude, whereas the license of book publishing is not always using the standard contract/ crude. The three object of Copyright as mentioned above, is also having a difference in the system of royalty payment; 2. 	Any contradiction of regulation in the obligation of licence notification in the Law of Copyright with the stipulation of agreement in Civil Law. Besides that, in term of "Copyright Registration" deems to the public that the emerge of right is because of the registration, so it gives the opportunity for the devouted parties, and with bad faith to exploit that opportunity. 3. 	it is lack of decisive in regulating of license in the Law of Copyright, is that license constitutes object of commercial court or civil court. So it is lack in giving the guarantee to the public in putting the clause of "the dispute adjudication in civil court or commercial court" in the agreement which they have made. From the result of invention in this strategic research, at the end, there are recommendations as follow: 1. 	To give guideline and facilitation for the licensee and licensor, it is needed to make an Implementation guideline and Technical guideline on the mechanism of license in Copyright, and immediately to be arranged the regulation of implementation on the obligation of license notification; Besides that, it is needed to be detailly arranged one by one the object of Copyright which is licensed; 2. 	It is suggest to revise or delete on the stipulation about "obligation in License notification with the reason in order to have the legal impact to the third party" in the Law of Copyright. Besides that, the term "Copyright registration" as stated in the Copyright Law is changed by the term "the Copyright notification" 3. 	It is needed the assertive arrangement in the Law of Copyright, is the Copyright license is object of commercial court or civil court. In this matter, to give the certainity for the party who will make the license contract especially in making a clause the adjudication of license dispute through the court. Lisensi merupakan hak previllege yang bersifat komersial, dalam arti kata memberikan hak dan kewenangan untuk memanfaatkan hak cipta yang dilindungi secara ekonomis dengan pemberian ijin yang dituangkan dalam perjanjian tertulis atau dalam bentuk dokumen. Penerima lisensi berwenang melakukan perbanyakan atau pengumuman untuk memanfaatkan hak cipta yang dilisensikan dan apabila penggunaan tersebut tanpa ijin, maka hal tersebut merupakan suatu perbuatan yang melanggar hukum. Disamping itu, Lisensi juga merupakan jalan tengah yang diambil pemberi lisensi apabila pemegang hak atas hak cipta tersebut tidak bermaksud mengembangkan sendiri hak. ciptanya. Pilihan yang merupakan kompromi antara menguasai sendiri dan melepaskan sama sekali ini membuat proses lisensi menjadi amat sensitive. Pihak-pihak yang terlibat datang dari kepentingan yang berbeda, tiba-tiba hams bersama-sama membagi hak-hak, kewajiban-kewajiban dan resiko dagang secara proporsional selama jangka waktu tertentu untuk kepentingan yang mungkin sating. berbeda. Proporsi hak, kewajiban dan resiko dagang tersebut akhirnya membawa dua pihak yaitu pemberi lisensi dan penerima lisensi ke dalam suatu negosiasi dan pembicaraan panjang yang tertuang ke dalam perjanjian kontrak lisensi. Dengan mengambil judul "LISENSI DI BIDANG HAK CIPTA", thesis ini akan melakukan pengkajian mengenai pelaksanaan lisensi hak cipta baik itu menyangkut mekanisme pelaksanaan lisensi, pembayaran imbalan atau royalti, kewajiban pencatatan perjanjian lisensi dan pendaftaran hak cipta serta penyelesaian sengketa lisensi dibidang hak cipta terhadap ketentuan-ketentuan sebagaimana diatur di dalam Undang-undang Nomor 19 tahun 2002 tentang Hak Cipta. Pertimbangan yang mendasari pengkajian terhadap hal-hal tersebut adalah belum adanya kesesuaian pengaturan lisensi di dalam undang-undang, di mana lisensi itu mempunyai sifat keperdataan. Di samping itu obyek hak cipta yang dilisensikan terdapat berbagai macam jenis, yang kesemuanya mempunyai karakteristik yang berbeda-beda, sehingga terdapat kesulitan memberikan pengaturan lisensi secara menyeluruh di dalam suatu undang-undang. Masalah yang menjadi fokus dalam thesis ini adalah bagaimanakah mekanisme lisensi hak cipta terhadap obyek hak cipta yang berbeda dan mengapa kewajiban pemberiaan royalty dalam perjanjian lisensi hak cipta hams berpedoman kesepakatan organisasi profesi, mengapa perjanjian lisensi hak cipta wajib dicatatkan agar mempunyai akibat hukum terhadap pihak ketiga, sedangkan pendaftaran hak cipta itu sendiri bukan merupakan suatu kewajiban untuk memperoleh hak dan bagaimana pars pihak menyelesaikan sengketa yang terjadi dalam pelaksanaan lisensi. Sedangkan tujuan penelitian yang hendak dicapai adalah untuk mengetahui dan memahami mekanisme pelaksanaan lisensi hak cipta, termasuk di dalamnya mekanisme pembayaran royalti, untuk mengetahui pula keberadaan administrasi dibidang Hak Cipta termasuk pengaturan pendaftaran hak cipta dan sinkronisasi pengaturan kewajiban pencatatan lisensi di dalam undang-undang hak cipta dengan hukum perjanjian serta upaya-upaya hukum yang ditempuh terhadap sengketa yang terjadi dalam pelaksanaan lisensi. Metode penelitian yang dipergunakan adalah gabungan antara penelitian normatif dan penelitian sosiologis. Alasan penggabungan dua metode ini semata-mata didasarkan pada sifat rumusan permasalahan dan tujuan penelitian yang berbeda. Dari hasil penelitian dan analisis data diperoleh temuan-temuan strategis sebagai berikut : I. Mekanisme lisensi di bidang hak cipta terdapat perbedaan antara obyek hak cipta yang satu dengan obyek hak cipta yang lain. Perbedaan ini, dikarenakan adanya karakteristik yang berbeda-beda. Hak Cipta Lagu/musik sangat erat hubungannya dengan Neightboring right (Pelaku, Produser rekaman dan organisasi siaran) dan masalah "hak mengumumkan", penerbitan buku lebih menonjolkan pada "hak memperbanyak" di samping juga masalah "hak mengumumkan", sedangkan di dalam lisensi program komputer lebih menekankan pada "penggunaan" program komputer itu sendiri. Di samping itu, lisensi program komputer dan lagu/musik lebih dominan menggunakan perjanjian/kontrak standar atau baku, sedangkan lisensi penerbitan buku tidak selalu menggunakan kontrak standar/baku. Ketiga obyek hak cipta tersebut juga mempunyai perbedaan dalam hal sistem pembayaran royalti; 2. 	Adanya pertentangan pengaturan kewajiban pencatatan lisensi di dalam UU Hak Cipta dengan ketentuan perjanjian di dalam hukum perdata. Di samping itu, istilah "pendaftaran hak cipta" memberikan anggapan masyarakat bahwa timbulnya hak atas hak cipta karena adanya pendaftaran, sehingga memberikan peluang bagi pihak-pihak yang tidak jujur dan beritikad tidak baik untuk memanfaatkan kesempatan tersebut. 3. 	Kurang tegasnya pengaturan lisensi di dalam UU Hak Cipta, apakah lisensi itu merupakan obyek pengadilan Niaga atau Pengadilan negeri. Sehingga kurang memberikan kepastian kepada masyarakat dalam mencantumkan klausula "penyelesaiari sengketa di Pengadilan Negeri atau Pengadilan Niaga " dalam perjanjian yang mereka buat. Dari basil temuan strategis penelitian ini, pada akhirnya dapat diberikan rekomendasi sebagai berikut 1. 	Untuk memberikan pedoman dan kemudahan bagi pemberi dan penerima lisensi, perlu dibuatkan suatu Petunjuk Pelaksanaan (Juklak) atau Petunjuk Teknis (Jilaus) tentang Mekanisme Lisensi di bidang Hak Cipta dan segera dibentuk peraturan pelaksanaan tentang kewajiban pencatatan lisensi; Di samping itu perlu diatur secara rind satu persatu obyek hak cipta yang dilisensikan; 2. 	Agar dilakukan revisi atau dihapuskan mengenai ketentuan tentang "kewajiban pencatatan lisensi dengan alasan agar mempunyai akibat hukum terhadap pihak ketiga" dalam UU Hak Cipta. Disamping itu istilah "pendaftaran hak cipta" sebagaimana dianut oleh UU Hak Cipta diganti dengan istilah "pencatatan hak cipta" 3. 	Perlunya pengaturan secara tegas di dalam Undang-undang Hak Cipta, apakah lisensi hak cipta itu merupakan obyek dari Pengadilan Niaga atau Pengadilan Negri. Hal ini, untuk memberikan kepastian bagi para pihak yang akan membuat suatu perjanjian lisensi khususnya dalam membuat suatu klausula penyelesaian sengketa lisensi melalui pengadilan. ...|$|R
