25|$|The overall {{conversion}} of NH3 and CO2 to urea is exothermic, the <b>reaction</b> <b>heat</b> {{from the first}} reaction driving the second. Like all chemical equilibria, these reactions behave according to Le Chatelier's principle, and the conditions that most favour carbamate formation have an unfavourable effect on the urea conversion equilibrium. The process conditions are, therefore, a compromise: the ill-effect on the first reaction of the high temperature (around 190°C) needed for the second is compensated for by conducting the process under high pressure (140–175 bar), which favours the first reaction. Although {{it is necessary to}} compress gaseous carbon dioxide to this pressure, the ammonia is available from the ammonia plant in liquid form, which can be pumped into the system much more economically. To allow the slow urea formation reaction time to reach equilibrium a large reaction space is needed, so the synthesis reactor in a large urea plant tends to be a massive pressure vessel.|$|E
25|$|The {{dissolution}} of the different crystalline phases of calcium sulfate in water is exothermic and release heat (decrease in Gibbs free energy: Δ G < 0). As an immediate consequence, to proceed, the dissolution reaction needs to evacuate this heat that {{can be considered as}} a product of reaction. If the system is cooled, the dissolution equilibrium will evolve towards the right according to the Le Chatelier principle and calcium sulfate will dissolve more easily. The solubility of calcium sulfate increases thus when the temperature decreases. If the temperature of the system is raised, the <b>reaction</b> <b>heat</b> cannot dissipate and the equilibrium will regress towards the left according to Le Chatelier principle. The solubility of calcium sulfate decreases thus when temperature increases. This contra-intuitive solubility behaviour is called retrograde solubility. It is less common than for most of the salts whose dissolution reaction is endothermic (i.e., the reaction consumes heat: increase in Gibbs free energy: Δ G > 0) and whose solubility increases with temperature. Another calcium compound, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2, portlandite) also exhibits a retrograde solubility for the same thermodynamic reason: because its dissolution reaction is also exothermic and releases heat. So, to dissolve higher amounts of calcium sulfate or calcium hydroxide in water, it is necessary to cool down the solution close to its freezing point in place to increase its temperature or to use nearly boiling water.|$|E

40|$|Hydroxyapatite (HA) {{whiskers}} {{have been}} synthesized using {{a number of}} chemical solution methods, including the chelate de-composition method. Numerous previous studies have investi-gated {{the effects of the}} reagents, reagent concentrations, solution pH, and reaction temperature on HA whisker morphol-ogy and composition. However, purely kinetic effects, such as the <b>reaction</b> <b>heating</b> and stirring rates, have not been rigorously investigated and are rarely reported in the literature. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate kinetic effects on the morphology of HA whiskers synthesized using the chelate decomposition method. In order to study the kinetic effects on the morphology of HA whiskers, three experimental parameters were varied independently: the <b>reaction</b> <b>heating</b> rate (0. 361 – 3. 01 C/min), stirring rate (0 – 250 rpm), and temperature (801 – 2001 C). At all heating and stirring rates, precipitated whiskers were confirmed by XRD and FT-IR to comprise phase-pure, calcium-deficient HA (Ca/P 5 1. 57 – 1. 62). The length and as-pect ratio of HA whiskers increased with decreased heating rate, decreased stirring rate, and increased reaction temperature. The mean length and aspect ratio of HA whiskers increased approx-imately twofold with decreased heating rate over the range stud-ied, following a power-law relationship. Therefore, the <b>reaction</b> <b>heating</b> rate is a key variable that can be used to tailor the morphology of HA whiskers and ought to be reported in the literature. The <b>reaction</b> <b>heating</b> rate and temperature had rela-tively little effect on the width of HA whiskers.
