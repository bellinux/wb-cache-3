A <b>rigid</b> <b>blade</b> was first considered and the calculations were conducted at several thrust settings.

Four different sizes of gurney flaps were studied, 2 %, 1 %, 0. 5 % and 0. 3 % of the chord. The biggest flap proved to be the most effective. A second study considered elastic blades with and without the gurney flap.

These blades were made with a diamond cross-section, which could be more or less acute, depending on the purpose of the blade. Weapons such as the Estoc, for example, would have little to no cutting edge, but they would be very rigid and strong on the thrust.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{examination of}} flap-lag stability of a centrally hinged, spring-restrained <b>rigid</b> <b>blade</b> in both hover and forward flight is presented. Several {{differences in the}} equations of motion for blade flap-lag stability in the existing literature are identified. A rigorous and systematic development of these equations for a rigid articulated blade in forward flight shows the existence of some linear aerodynamic coupling terms associated with blade steady-state flapping and lagging in the perturbation equations. The differences identified are shown {{to be associated with}} the order in which the flap and lag transformations are taken in developing the equations of motion. The implications of these differences on stability are examined, and it is shown that the pitch-lag coupling terms associated with a flap-lag hinge transformation sequence have a marked influence on flap-lag stability. Some qualitative considerations on the role of the assumed transformation sequence in the development of the flap-lag equations for a hingeless elastic blade are also given. On the basis of these considerations, it is shown that aerodynamic coupling terms associated with blade steady-state flapping and lagging similar to those found for the <b>rigid</b> <b>blade</b> will also appear in the equations for the elastic blade...|$|E

Particular attention is given to: the importance of aerodynamic terms; the influence of coning angle; the influence of the flapping and lagging stiffnesses and the influence of the hinge inclination.

Using BT blades can also moderate the demands on the turbine generator above design conditions.

Rotor control in autorotation for teetering and articulated hub types is examined in more detail for a compound helicopter (rotor and fixed wing) using the comprehensive analysis CAMRAD II. Autorotation {{is found to be}} possible at two distinct trim conditions with different sharing of lift between the rotor and wing. Stability predictions obtained using the analytical rigid flapping blade analysis and a <b>rigid</b> <b>blade</b> CAMRAD II model compare favorably. For the flapping blade analysis, the teetering rotor is found to be the most stable hub type, showing no instabilities up to an advance ratio of 3 and a Lock number of 18.

40|$|Equations {{of motion}} for a coupled rotor-body system were derived {{for the purpose}} of {{studying}} air and ground resonance characteristics of helicopters that have bearingless main rotors. For the fuselage, only four rigid body degrees of freedom are considered; longitudinal and lateral translations, pitch, and roll. The rotor is assumed to consist of three or more <b>rigid</b> <b>blades.</b> Each blade is joined to the hub by means of a flexible beam segment (flexbeam or strap). Pitch change is accomplished by twisting the flexbeam with the pitch-control system, the characteristics of which are variable. Thus, the analysis is capable of implicitly treating aeroelastic couplings generated by the flexbeam elastic deflections, the pitch-control system, and the angular offsets of the blade and flexbeam. The linearized equations are written in the nonrotating system retaining only the cyclic rotor modes; thus, they comprise a system of homogeneous ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. All contributions to the linearized perturbation equations from inertia, gravity, quasi-steady aerodynamics, and the flexbeam equilibrium deflections are retained exactly...|$|R
5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the <b>rigid</b> <b>blades</b> of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|R

The lead-lag stability of a structurally simple rotor configuration in forward flight was determined. The model tested had no cyclic pitch control, and was therefore operated untrimmed at several collective pitch angles, at shaft angles from 0 deg to - 20 deg, and at advance ratios as high as 0. 55. Two inplane natural frequencies, 0. 61 /rev and 0. 72 /rev, were tested for configuration both with and without structural flap lag coupling. Concomitant hover testing of the model was also conducted. Representative plots of the frequency and damping data are presented to show general trends, and complete tabular data and model properties information are included for use in detailed correlation exercises. The most prominent feature of the forward flight data is an abrupt increase in damping with advance ratio at certain high-speed, high shaft-angle conditions, with high flapping loads. The hover data are consistent with previous experimental and theoretical results for hingeless rotors without kinematic couplings. Overall, the data quality is very good and the data {{are expected to be}} useful in the development and validation of rotor aeroelastic stability analyses...|$|R
