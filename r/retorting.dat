5|$|Hundreds {{of patents}} for oil shale <b>retorting</b> {{technologies}} exist; however, {{only a few}} dozen have undergone testing. By 2006, only four technologies remained in commercial use: Kiviter, Galoter, Fushun, and Petrosix.|$|E
5|$|The water {{needed in}} the oil shale <b>retorting</b> process offers an {{additional}} economic consideration: this may pose a problem in areas with water scarcity.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{advanced}} retort-house appliances {{were introduced}} for improved efficiency and convenience. The compressed-air or steam-driven clinkering pick {{was found to}} be especially useful in removing clinker from the primary combustion area of the indirectly fired benches - previously clinkering was an arduous and time-consuming process that used large amounts of <b>retort</b> house labor. Another class of appliances introduced were apparatuses - and ultimately, machines - for <b>retort</b> loading and unloading. <b>Retorts</b> were generally loaded by using an elongated scoop, into which the coal was loaded - a gang of men would then lift the scoop and ram it into the <b>retort.</b> The coal would then be raked by the men into a layer of even thickness and the <b>retort</b> sealed. Gas production would then ensue - and from 8 - 12 hours later, the <b>retort</b> would be opened, and the coal would be either pulled (in the case of [...] "stop-ended" [...] <b>retorts)</b> or pushed (in the case of [...] "through" [...] <b>retorts)</b> out of the <b>retort.</b> Thus, the <b>retort</b> house had heavy manpower requirements - as many men were often required to bear the coal-containing scoop and load the <b>retort.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Retorts</b> are {{operated}} in sets {{and have a}} heat carrier preparation unit and rotating water seals designed for the whole set instead of a single <b>retort</b> as in case of the Kiviter <b>retort.</b> Regenerative furnaces are located next to the <b>retorts</b> and they are operating in two cycles - the combustion cycle and the gas heating cycle. During the combustion cycle, a furnace is heated up to [...] by combustion gases. After the combustion cycle, <b>retort</b> gases from the condensation system is inserted into a furnace for their heating. [...] By alternating furnaces, one furnace is always available for heating <b>retort</b> gas. Twenty <b>retorts</b> typically share one condensation system {{and a set of}} heating furnaces.|$|R
500|$|By <b>retort</b> orientation: [...] "Ex-situ" [...] {{technologies}} are sometimes classified as vertical or horizontal. Vertical <b>retorts</b> are usually shaft kilns where {{a bed of}} shale moves {{from top to bottom}} by gravity. [...] Horizontal <b>retorts</b> are usually horizontal rotating drums or screws where shale moves {{from one end to the}} other. [...] As a general rule, vertical <b>retorts</b> process lumps using a gas heat carrier, while horizontal <b>retorts</b> process fines using solid heat carrier.|$|R
25|$|Alberta Taciuk Process {{technology}} extracts bitumen {{from oil}} sands through a dry <b>retorting.</b> During this process, oil sand is moved through a rotating drum, cracking the bitumen with heat and producing lighter hydrocarbons. Although tested, {{this technology is}} not in commercial use yet.|$|E
500|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} oil shale <b>retorting</b> and by this {{the viability of the}} shale oil production, researchers have proposed and tested several co-pyrolysis processes, in which other materials such as biomass, peat, waste bitumen, or rubber and plastic wastes are retorted along with the oil shale. [...] Some modified technologies propose combining a fluidized bed retort with a circulated fluidized bed furnace for burning the by-products of pyrolysis (char and oil shale gas) and thereby improving oil yield, increasing throughput, and decreasing <b>retorting</b> time.|$|E
500|$|In-situ {{processing}} involves {{heating the}} oil shale underground. Such technologies can potentially extract more oil from a given area of land than ex-situ processes, since they can access the material at greater depths than surface mines can. [...] Several companies have patented methods for in-situ <b>retorting.</b> However, {{most of these}} methods remain in the experimental phase. One can distinguish true in-situ processes (TIS) and modified in-situ processes (MIS). True in-situ processes do not involve mining the oil shale. Modified in-situ processes involve removing part of the oil shale and bringing it to the surface for modified in-situ <b>retorting</b> {{in order to create}} permeability for gas flow in a rubble chimney. Explosives rubblize the oil-shale deposit.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{increases}} in efficiency and safety were {{seen with the}} introduction of the [...] "through" [...] <b>retort,</b> which had a door at front and rear. This provided for greater efficiency and safety in loading and unloading the <b>retorts,</b> which was a labor-intensive and often dangerous process. Coal could now be pushed out of the <b>retort</b> - rather than pulled out of the <b>retort.</b> One interesting modification of the [...] "through" [...] <b>retort</b> was the [...] "inclined" [...] <b>retort</b> - coming into its heyday in the 1880s - a <b>retort</b> set on a moderate incline, where coal was poured in at one end, and the <b>retort</b> sealed; following pyrolysis, the bottom was opened and the coke poured out by gravity. This was adopted in some gas-works, but the savings in labor were often offset by the uneven distribution and pyrolysis of the coal as well as clumping problems leading to failure of the coal to pour out of the bottom following pyrolysis that were exacerbated in certain coal types. As such, inclined <b>retorts</b> were rendered obsolescent by later advances, including the retort-handling machine and the vertical <b>retort</b> system.|$|R
25|$|Coldharbour Mill {{generated}} its own {{coal gas}} on site for lighting the mill (and thus enabling the machinery {{to be run}} all night). Although the <b>retorts</b> have been removed and disposed of, the Gas <b>Retort</b> house which housed the <b>retort</b> bench is still standing. In fact, the original gas <b>retorts</b> have been discovered in the leat, where they served as weir components. English Heritage classifies the late 19th century Gas <b>Retort</b> House as a very rare survival of gas-making facilities.|$|R
5000|$|These two {{advances}} {{turned the}} old, [...] "directly fired" [...] <b>retort</b> bench into the advanced, [...] "indirectly fired", [...] "regenerative" [...] or [...] "generative" [...] <b>retort</b> bench, and lead coke usage within the <b>retort</b> benches (in the larger works) to drop from upwards of 40% of the coke {{made by the}} <b>retorts</b> to factors as low as 15% of the coke made by the <b>retorts,</b> leading to an improvement in efficiency of an order of magnitude. These improvements imparted an additional capital cost to the <b>retort</b> bench, which caused them to be slowly incorporated in the smaller gas-works, if they were incorporated at all.|$|R

500|$|The {{amount of}} {{economically}} recoverable oil shale is unknown. [...] The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded {{only when the}} cost of shale-oil production in a given region comes in below {{the price of crude}} oil or its other substitutes. According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation, the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface <b>retorting</b> complex in the United States (comprising a mine, <b>retorting</b> plant, upgrading plant, supporting utilities, and spent shale reclamation), would range between US$70–95 ($440–600/m3, adjusted to 2005 values). This estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency. In order to run a profitable operation, the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels.

500|$|Although {{there are}} several oil shale <b>retorting</b> {{technologies}}, only four technologies are currently in commercial use. These are Kiviter, Galoter, Fushun, and Petrosix. [...] The two main methods of extracting oil from shale are ex-situ and in-situ. In ex-situ method, the oil shale is mined and transported to the retort facility in order to extract the oil. The in-situ method converts the kerogen while it {{is still in the}} form of an oil shale deposit, and then extracts it via a well, where it rises up as normal petroleum.|$|E
500|$|Some have {{expressed}} {{concerns over the}} oil shale industry's use of water. In 2002, the oil shale-fired power industry used 91% of the water consumed in Estonia. Depending on technology, above-ground <b>retorting</b> uses between one and five barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil.
