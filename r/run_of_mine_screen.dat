40|$|Image {{analysis}} as a technique for fragmentation measurement of rock piles {{has been the}} subject of research since the 1980 ’s and to date, <b>run</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> (ROM) fragmentation optimisation studies have primarily relied on particle size measurement using photographic based 2 D imaging systems. Disadvantages of 2 D imaging systems include particle delineation errors due to variable lighting and material colour and texture variation; no direct measure of scale & perspective distortion; and inability to distinguish overlapped particles, non-overlapped particles and areas-of-fines. With the development of 3 D imaging technologies, there is an opportunity to develop techniques that could improve data collection and overcome the limitations of existing 2 D image based systems. This paper describes the first attempt to use 3 D high resolution laser scanning techniques to quantify “whole of muckpile” fragmentation from full scale production blasting. During two monitoring campaigns in 2013, high resolution laser scanning data was collected from production blasts at Esperanza Mine (Antofagasta Minerals Group). Fully automated analysis of the 3 D data was possible in all cases where the data was of sufficiently high resolution. Manual pre-processing was required when the data was of low resolution to specify the region of fines. Overall results indicated that <b>run</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> fragmentation requirements were meeting specified targets despite the marked differences in powder factors. This was particularly the case for those blasts conducted in similar geological domains. This work has demonstrated that high resolution laser scanning can be used as an alternative technique to measure “whole of muckpile” fragmentation in production blasting.

40|$|The South African {{economy is}} {{strongly}} based on coal as a mined resource, and various grades of coal are supplied to {{local and international}} customers. However, the environmental impacts associated with the preparation and production of different coal grades from <b>Run</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mine</b> (RoM) or raw coal are variable; specifically, the different mining methods used for coal extraction – opencast or underground mining – have different environmental impacts.
