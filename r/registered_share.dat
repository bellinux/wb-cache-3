50|$|In 1930 Herbert Victor Burlingham, who {{had been}} a sole trader, decided to sell the {{business}} to two local businessmen, Richard Eaves and Harry Lowcock. They set up H. V. Burlingham Ltd on 25 November 1930 with a <b>registered</b> <b>share</b> capital of £26,000. after which H. V. Burlingham himself set up in business as a caravan manufacturer in Garstang. Mr Eaves became the managing director and took great pride in motivating the design team. Styles were developed into the era of the saloon coach often now fully enclosed, windows only dropping to half depth and a sliding aluminium or folding canvas roof section optional. Pioneering styling features often appeared on Burlingham designs, including the use of curved sightseeing windows above the main windows. By the end of 1931 there was again pressure on space so a further site was acquired at Vicarage Lane. This was used for body assembly and from then until eventual closure finishing was undertaken at the Preston New Road factory, which also manufactured sub assemblies. Once Vicarage Lane came on stream Newhouse Road was solely devoted to servicing existing bodies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Steady {{and stable}} share market {{is one of}} the factors that determines the {{investment}} climate in the country and encourages redistribution of investment capital in promising sectors of the economy. Thus, it is important to study correlation between share market and economy. The paper analyzed the interaction between the parameters of Ukrainian share market (the volume of <b>registered</b> <b>share</b> issues, the volume of trading shares on the stock market, the volume of trading shares on a formal stock market and the number of issued shares in Ukraine) and economic development (GDP). The results of evaluation models suggest that the volume of <b>registered</b> <b>share</b> issues and the volume of trading shares on the stock market have no impact on Ukrainian GDP. But the variation in GDP determined by the variation of share trading volume on the formal share market and the number of issued shares in Ukraine...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} celebrated results of the theory of {{distributed}} computing is the impossibility, in an asynchronous system of n processes that communicate through <b>shared</b> memory <b>registers,</b> to solve the set agreement problem where the processes need to decide on up to n − 1 among their n initial values. In short, the result indicates that the register abstraction is too weak to implement the set agreement one. This paper explores the relation between these abstractions in a message passing system where a register is not a given physical device but is rather itself implemented by processes communicating through message passing. We show that, maybe surprisingly, the information about process failures that is necessary and sufficient to implement a <b>register</b> <b>shared</b> by two particular processes is sufficient but not necessary to implement set agreement. We later generalize this result by considering k-set agreement, where the processes can decide on up to k values, and comparing it with a <b>register</b> <b>shared</b> by any particular subset of 2 k processes. We prove that, for 1 ≤ k ≤ n/ 2, (a) any failure information that is sufficient to implement a <b>register</b> <b>shared</b> by 2 k processes is sufficient to implement (n − k) -set agreement but (b) a failure information that is sufficient for (n − k) -set agreement is not sufficient for a <b>register</b> <b>shared</b> by 2 k processes. We also prove that (c) a failure information that is sufficient for a <b>register</b> <b>shared</b> by 2 k processes is not sufficient for ((n-k) - 1) -set agreement...|$|R

Then, the samples’ features are extracted by performing wavelet decomposition {{to obtain the}} low-frequency coefficients. Next, DCT is exploited to the obtained low-frequency wavelet coefficients, and the DCT coefficients are calculated. The decoding exploits these features and <b>registered</b> <b>share</b> image to generate a public share image. The watermark is recovered by performing OR operation between secret and public share images and then used to verify the ownership.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{describe}} theoretical concepts related {{to the effects of}} state subsidies on enterprises and to discuss the magnitude and effect of state aid on enterprises during the transformation of the Czech economy. Subsidies to enterprises during transformation were high, often transparent, and above the European Union average. During 1997 - 2003 registered state aid reached 362 bn. CZK. More than 90 percent of the total registered state aid went to awards the rescue and restructuring of enterprises. It can be roughly estimated that during 1997 - 2000 state aid was twice as high as officially <b>registered.</b> <b>Share</b> of state aid to enterprises in public debt increased and reached 70 percent by 2003. Non-transparent channels of state aid distribution decrease the efficiency of state aid, as they distort market signals and decrease motivation for fair competition. market failure, competition, state aid, restructuring...|$|E

I find that the initiation {{of the program was}} associated with greater trading activity and enhanced liquidity overall, but there was a significant migration of its order flow back to Frankfurt during the first 6 months. While return volatility also increased significantly, this increase was not associated with the changes in trading activity, the changes in liquidity or the flow-back to Frankfurt. I argue that this new share structure to date has not improved the quality of the trading environment relative to other share structures...|$|E
