5000|$|Cleaving is done {{by driving}} a wedge between the fibres of a log, so as to split fibres apart along their weakest path. This work may appear strenuous, but is far less effort than <b>rip</b> <b>sawing</b> by hand. It is first done radially, to split the log into wedged segments. Timbers with {{medullary}} rays, such as oak, {{may be hard to}} split through these radial rays and so careful alignment is made to split between them. Segments are halved symmetrically at each step, as this encourages them to split more evenly than attempting to cleave off thin sheets repeatedly from one end.|$|E
40|$|Materials like medium density fiberboards (MDF) are {{characterized}} by a profile of density, with external layers heavier than the core. These differences generate a variable surface quality. Concerning the cutting energy, there are important variations when machining conditions are modified, or when some tool characteristics are changed. The aim {{of this research is}} to evaluate and quantify the cutting energy required to <b>rip</b> <b>sawing</b> MDF and to study the relationship with the resulting surface roughness across the profile when the material density changes. The finding lead to conclude a close relationship between cutting energy and surface roughness, being particularly sensitive to changes in density within the profile of the board, and in particular to changing cutting conditions expressed as mean chip thickness...|$|E

5000|$|The {{cutting edge}} of each tooth is angled in an {{alternating}} pattern. This design allows each tooth {{to act like a}} knife edge and slice through the wood in contrast to a <b>rip</b> <b>saw,</b> which tears along the grain, acting like a miniature chisel. Some crosscut saws use special teeth called [...] "rakers" [...] designed to clean out the cut strips of wood from the kerf.Crosscut saws generally have larger teeth than <b>rip</b> <b>saws.</b>|$|R
50|$|Types of {{hand saws}} {{used to make}} rip cuts are <b>rip</b> <b>saws,</b> frame saws {{some of which are}} whipsaws, and veneer saws.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{takes the}} option of using sound pressure signals to monitor the resulting surface roughness from <b>rip</b> <b>sawing</b> process of medium density fibreboards samples. Different cutting conditions were evaluated, namely cutting speed and feed, giving as a variable the mean chip thickness, being also assessed {{the effect of the}} climb cutting and conventional cutting mode. The main results lead to conclude that the sound pressure was closely related to the variation of the mean chip thickness giving adequate levels of correlation with the surface roughness. A positive, linear relationship was observed between feed rate and surface roughness, as well as for sound pressure. The best surface quality was achieved when climb cutting mode was applied. Then, the measurement of sound pressure results is a useful method to monitor MDF cut process, being possible to predict the surface roughness, as well as the effect of the change of cutting conditions...|$|E
40|$|Material-saving and {{energy-saving}} {{belong to}} the basic requirements imposed on contemporary manufacturing processes. The realization of these processes gives measurable profi ts, not only economical but also ecological. In the case of wood sawing with circular saw blades, material and energy-savings are dependent on total overall set of teeth (theoretical kerf) and teeth position accuracy {{in relation to the}} workpiece. Hence, it is necessary to achieve a decrease of both raw material and energy losses by the use of narrow-kerf saw blades, an increase of sawing accuracy, as well as a reduction of spacing in case of sawing with a gang of circular saws. However, meeting these requirements in the case of <b>rip</b> <b>sawing</b> with circular saw blades is a quite diffi cult issue and depends on many factors. The detailed analyses concerning ways of chip transportation in the kerf slot, saw blade stiffness, saw blade movement and workpiece feeding accuracy are the proof of these inconvenient technical problems in sawmills. Hence, the realization of economical wood sawing with circular saw blades seems not to be viable until the whole system of sawing fulfils the defined requirements. Thanks to the application of the proecological technology (circular saw blades of a new design), in the examined industrial case, the following results have been achieved: an increase of about 18 % in the amount of side lumber, roughly 16 % less sawdust (as an effect of kerf reduction) and about 16 % lower values of the cutting power consumption...|$|E
50|$|A <b>rip</b> <b>saw</b> is a {{wood saw}} that is {{specially}} designed {{for making a}} rip cut, a cut made parallel to {{the direction of the}} wood grain.|$|R
5000|$|Rip cut: In woodworking, a cut made {{parallel}} to {{the direction of the}} grain of the workpiece. A <b>rip</b> <b>saw</b> is used to make this type of cut.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to see this material removal mechanism in action by analyzing frame by frame footage of the cutting process. <b>Rip</b> <b>saws</b> typically have 4-10 teeth per inch, making them relatively coarse.|$|R
50|$|In woodworking, a rip-cut is {{to sever}} or divide {{a piece of}} wood {{parallel}} to the grain. The other typical type of cut is a cross-cut, a cut perpendicular to the grain. Unlike cross-cutting, which shears the wood fibers, a <b>rip</b> <b>saw</b> works more like a series of chisels, lifting off small splinters of wood. The nature of the wood grain requires the shape of the saw teeth to be different thus the need for both <b>rip</b> <b>saws</b> and crosscut saws; however some circular saw blades are combination blades and can make both types of cuts. A rip cut is the fundamental type of cut made at a sawmill.|$|R
5000|$|A {{saw with}} teeth along only one edge, like a Western saw. These are {{supplied}} as either <b>rip</b> <b>saw</b> or cross-cut type blades. An {{advantage of this}} saw {{is that it is}} easy to use with a saw guide.|$|R
5000|$|Logs are {{converted}} into timber by being sawn, hewn, or split. <b>Sawing</b> with a <b>rip</b> <b>saw</b> {{is the most}} common method, because sawing allows logs of lower quality, with irregular grain and large knots, to be used and is more economical. There are various types of sawing: ...|$|R

5000|$|Dovetail saw [...] - [...] a small backsaw used to cut {{dovetail}}s. Although most {{dovetail saw}} teeth are set for cross-cutting, a <b>rip</b> <b>saw</b> tooth pattern is more efficient. These saws will {{usually have a}} higher number of teeth per inch (around 15 - 20 T.P.I.) with teeth sharpened to favor ripping operations and set to leave a narrow kerf.|$|R

5000|$|All sawmills use <b>rip</b> <b>saws</b> {{of various}} types {{including}} the circular saw and band saw. Historically sawmills used one or more reciprocating saws more specifically known as an [...] "up-and-down" [...] or [...] "upright saw" [...] which are of two basic types, the frame saw or a muley (mulay) saw {{which is similar to}} the hand powered pit saw. Some sawmills also use crosscut saws to cut boards and planks to length.|$|R

Their subsequent decomposition, exacerbated by summer heat, led to a [...] "terrible smell" [...] and a cloud of flies that eventually led to their gruesome discovery.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{cultures}} developed {{two main}} types of saw teeth: the 'cross cut' saw teeth and the 'rip' saw teeth. These {{cut into the}} wood using different mechanisms. Wood is composed of many long cells running length-ways. Thus, crosscut saws have sawteeth that are usually shaped, often with a metal file, {{in such a way}} that they form a series of tiny knifelike edges.The wood cells are contacted by the knife-edge of the tooth and cut. <b>Rip</b> <b>saws,</b> on the other hand, are usually shaped so that they form a series of tiny chisel-like edges. The wood cells are contacted by the chisel and 'ripped' apart from the bundle of other cells. It is common that people do not recognize the difference and use saws both ways. However, a <b>rip</b> <b>saw</b> is much faster than a cross-cut saw when cutting with the grain but leaves a very rough cut, often with splinters on the surface, and has more difficulty maintaining a straight cut when cutting across the grain. The cross-cut saw can cut in any direction but is much slower than needs be when cutting with the grain.|$|R
40|$|A novel fin {{configuration}} {{for high}} temperature ceramic plate-fin heat exchanger (PFHE) was developed using the three-dimensional {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) FLUENT code. Numerical analysis was carried out for different types of fins and their results were compared with the selected design. The working fluids used in the model were sulfur trioxide, sulfur dioxide, oxygen and water vapor. Fluid flow, heat transfer, pressure drop and properties like Nusselt number, friction factor and j-factor were studied for various fin configurations. The <b>rip</b> <b>saw</b> fin design (case 9) with thickness of 0. 05 mm gives the maximum heat transfer performance with less pressure drop and friction factor. The numerical result was compared with the analytical result for rectangular fins and they {{were found to be}} in reasonable agreement. In addition to it, the results from the selected ripsaw design were compared with the result from the model with no fins (case 1). It was found that thermal enhancement factor of 2. 3211 and average Nusselt number of 4. 215 was obtained for the selected design. The results of the <b>rip</b> <b>saw</b> fin design were found in good agreement with the analytical results of a rectangular fin. Further effects of Reynolds number on pressure drop and Nusselt number were studied...|$|R
50|$|A {{frame saw}} or sash saw {{is a type}} of saw which {{consists}} of a relatively narrow and flexible blade held under tension within a (generally wooden) rectangular frame (also called a sash or gate). They are used for cutting wood or stone. The blade is held perpendicular to the plane of the frame, so that the material being cut passes {{through the center of the}} frame. Frame saws for use with wood are <b>rip</b> <b>saws</b> operated as a hand saw or powered in a sawmill. Frame saws used for cutting stone were powered saws in stone mills.|$|R
50|$|The Butter Box Factory is a timber-framed {{building}} with a corrugated iron roof and corrugated iron and timber walls. There are two enclosures within the factory, one a tongue and groove partition with a bench and shelves at the north-east section of the building, the other a small plywood office in the south-east corner. Machinery used for box production is in situ including a series of four multiple <b>saw</b> tables, separate <b>rip</b> <b>saw,</b> brand stamping machine and guillotine. A winch and drive shaft is also present, but removed from its original location. Spare, excess and disused equipment is currently stored in this factory.|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} the burned-out factory {{building}} were removed {{right down to the}} cement ground floor. Next, workers piped in steam from the heating plant to melt the ice in the water wheel, and power created by the water wheel was transferred to a shaft attached to the cement floor that operated a straight-line <b>rip</b> <b>saw,</b> planer and a few other machines. With manufacturing capability partially restored, workers re-sawed and planed spruce lumber from the company's lumberyard to build a new factory building around the machinery in place. At night, the machines were protected by removable wooden covers that resembled small chicken coops.|$|R

In 1973, musicologist Kip Lornell, then a recent college graduate, heard rumors about Joe and Odell Thompson's mastery of the old-time style, and urged the duo to make a comeback. Thompson and Odell began performing as the New String Band Duo across the United States and abroad, becoming popular fixtures at folk festivals. Among the notable gigs the duo played at included Carnegie Hall, the National Folk Festival, the Festival of American Fiddle Tunes, and the Tennessee Banjo Institute.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} they had reached the {{platform}} of the damaged saw-mill, and Bob pointed out, with elaborate care, {{the details of the}} mill in all its minute particulars, commenting specially on {{the fact that most of}} the telling improvements on it were due to the fertile brain and inventive genius of Tim Lumpy. He also explained the different kinds of saws--the <b>ripping</b> <b>saw,</b> and the cross-cut saw, and the circular saw, and the eccentric saw--just as if his mother were an embryo mill-wright, for he felt that she took a deep interest in it all, and Mrs Frog listened with the profound attention of a civil engineer, and remarked on everything with such comments as--oh! indeed! ah! well now! ain't it wonderful? amazin'! an' you made it all too! Oh! Bobby!--and other more or less appropriate phrases.|$|R
5000|$|By 1995, Trust Obey {{completed}} their first album for Nothing Records, Hands Of Ash, {{though it would}} never see release though the label. Trust Obey is John Bergin, an illustrator, designer, writer, filmmaker and musician. Originally a Pennsylvania native, Bergin had been [...] "drawing and painting {{for as long as}} I can remember." [...] By 1984, while attending the University of the Arts in Philadelphia (from 1984 - 1988), Bergin began experimenting in music, citing such acts as Swans and future Nothing Records act Einstürzende Neubauten as influences. Trust Obey was founded in 1988 in Kansas City, Missouri, beginning as a one-man project with a series of self-released cassettes; Fucking The Wound (1989), <b>Rip</b> <b>Saw</b> (1989), Locust (1990), The Veil (1990), Room 101 (1991) and Exit Wound (1991). In 1993, Bergin added guitarist Brett Smith as a permanent member of the band, in order to accommodate live performances.|$|R
5000|$|Set: The {{degree to}} which the teeth are bent out {{sideways}} away from the blade, usually in both directions. In most modern serrated saws, the teeth are set, so that the kerf (the width of the cut) will be wider than the blade itself. This allows the blade to move through the cut easily without binding (getting stuck). The set may be different depending on the kind of cut the saw is intended to make. For example, a <b>rip</b> <b>saw</b> has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel, so that it rips or tears the material apart. A [...] "flush-cutting saw" [...] has no set on one side, so that the saw can be laid flat on a surface and cut along that surface without scratching it. The set of the blade's teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw set.|$|R

This year, year, the contestant must build a heart-shaped box from a single sheet of plywood. Matt proceeds to cut a heart free-hand with his own <b>saw,</b> a <b>rip</b> <b>saw,</b> and so power saws were provided for him for this challenge. Despite this, he fails due to frustration, and ultimately only manages to produce a small, triangular box, which has a notch cut out {{an attempt to make}} it look like a heart. Ajay fails after building a box that is too big and has gappy sides. Rob injures himself and also has gappy sides, so he fails. Dan fails as his box is not heart-shaped (it is a rectangular box with a heart-shaped base).

5000|$|A pit saw was {{a two-man}} <b>rip</b> <b>saw.</b> In parts of early colonial North America, {{it was one of}} the {{principal}} tools used in shipyards and other industries where water-powered sawmills were not available. It was so-named because it was typically operated over a saw pit, either at ground level or on trestles across which logs that were to be cut into boards. The pit saw was [...] "a strong steel cutting-plate, of great breadth, with large teeth, highly polished and thoroughly wrought, some eight or ten feet in length" [...] with either a handle on each end or a frame saw. A pit-{{saw was a}}lso sometimes known as a whipsaw. It took 2-4 people to operate. A [...] "pit-man" [...] stood in the pit, a [...] "top-man" [...] stood outside the pit, and they worked together to make cuts, guide the saw, and raise it. Pit-saw workers were among the most highly paid laborers in early colonial North America.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{a number of}} work piece {{variations}} were evaluated whilst limiting the cutting conditions. Eight wood species controlled at four moisture levels were machined along and across the wood grain. The tool used during cutting was designed to resemble a <b>rip</b> <b>saw</b> tooth with zero rake angle and narrow edge width. Each work piece variation machined in the cutting tests was subjected to mechanical tests that evaluated bending properties across the grain and shear properties along the grain. The regression model establishes {{a relationship between the}} bending properties for cutting forces across the grain as well as shear properties for cutting forces along the grain. F and R 2 values show that the elastic properties of the wood in bending and shear have less influence on the cutting forces when compared to the strength and toughness. Additionally density is seen to have less influence on the cutting force along the grain. This is explained by the tool passing through an unquantifiable proportion of early and latewood fibres from the annual growth rings. Cutting across the grain, the tool is forced to machine through approximately the same proportion of earlywood and latewood fibres...|$|R
