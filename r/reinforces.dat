Three types of bond were considered, i. e. concrete confined by (1) flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer tube, (2) flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer tube with internal flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer rings and (3) flax fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer wrapping. They were termed as naturally, mechanically and adhesively bonded, respectively.
