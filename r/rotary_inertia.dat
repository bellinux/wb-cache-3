5000|$|The primary {{tool for}} {{structural}} analysis of beams is the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. This equation accurately describes the elastic behaviour of slender beams where the cross sectional dimensions are {{small compared to}} the length of the beam. For beams that are not slender a different theory needs to be adopted to account for the deformation due to shear forces and, in dynamic cases, the <b>rotary</b> <b>inertia.</b> The beam formulation adopted here is that of Timoshenko and comparative examples can be found in NAFEMS Benchmark Challenge Number 7. [...] Other mathematical methods for determining the deflection of beams include [...] "method of virtual work" [...] and the [...] "slope deflection method". Engineers are interested in determining deflections because the beam may be in direct contact with a brittle material such as glass. Beam deflections are also minimized for aesthetic reasons. A visibly sagging beam, even if structurally safe, is unsightly and to be avoided. A stiffer beam (high modulus of elasticity and/or one of higher second moment of area) creates less deflection.|$|E

40|$|A new {{mathematical}} model is {{developed for the}} nonlinear-static, linearized-dynamic, and fully nonlinear-dynamic behavior of drillstrings in arbitrary wellbore profiles. The formulation {{is based on a}} three-dimensional nonlinear finite beam element and accounts for the fully coupled flexibility of the drillstring, geometric nonlinearity (large displacement, small strain), automatic determination of wellbore contact points, friction acting between the drillstring and the wellbore, stabilizer clearance, three-dimensional wellbore profiles, added fluid mass and damping effects from the hydrodynamic forces generated between the drillstring and surrounding fluid, complex tool geometry (including steerable mud motors, rotary steerable systems, and eccentric stabilizers/components), shear beam deformations, lateral <b>rotary</b> <b>inertias,</b> and gyroscopic effects. The resulting model is numerically validated through comparisons with analytical formulas and previous nonlinear models, showing that it can readily be applied {{to a wide range of}} drilling engineering problems and used for practical analysis. Additionally, individual contributions of shear deformations, lateral <b>rotary</b> <b>inertias,</b> and gyroscopic effects are definitively shown to be insignificant when calculating the static and dynamic behavior of horizontal drilling assemblies within the rotational speed range of most drilling applications. An initial comparison with field data is also provided, which shows the practicality of the developed algorithms in predicting the characteristics of real drilling scenarios. The model is then adjusted and applied to the specific case of inducing lateral vibrations in unconventional horizontal wells. It is proposed that exciting a lateral resonance in the drill pipe lying on the low side of a horizontal wellbore can induce enough movement to help overcome parasitic axial drag acting on a drillstring. This, in turn, would help to increase weight transfer to the bit while slide-drilling with a steerable mud motor in long lateral sections of a wellbore. The change in this lateral resonant behavior due to variations in weight-on-bit (WOB), inclination, well path curvature, wellbore diameter, fluid properties, and tubular dimensions are clearly shown through linearized-dynamic sensitivity studies. Nonlinear time-domain simulations are also performed to better understand the limitations of linearized-dynamic modeling and to provide a more detailed assessment of how inducing lateral vibration influences the WOB while drilling. It is shown that induced lateral vibrations provide a noticeable dynamic WOB of up to ? 250 lbf about the static value, and a slight increase in the average WOB value of up to 150 lbf. The effects on WOB are dependent on the excitation frequency of the induced lateral vibrations, with the greatest benefits being seen at resonant conditions...|$|R

30|$|Inclusive work on {{the dynamic}} {{stability}} of cantilever cylindrical shells considering all types of follower loads and wide ranges of length and thickness ratios {{does not meet the}} needs. In this paper, dynamic stability of clamped-free cylindrical shells was studied to bring out the geometric regions in which the structure acts as a general shell or a beam. In developing the equations of motion, FST theory was used and <b>rotary</b> <b>inertias</b> were considered. The results for the equivalent beam were in complete agreement with those in the literature. Results consisted of tables containing critical longitudinal mode numbers and critical circumferential mode numbers, and also diagrams showing flutter load parameters against vast intervals of length and thickness ratios. Raising the load function degree increased critical circumferential mode numbers and critical longitudinal mode numbers in specific ranges of thickness and length ratios. The flutter load parameter decreased by increasing the length ratio and decreasing the thickness ratio. In some ranges of small length ratios, results obtained based on FST theory should be more carefully dealt with since the critical longitudinal mode numbers are obtained to be higher than 5, in which FST seems not to be accurate enough. For long and moderately thick shells, ranges of thickness ratios exist in which the shell can be analyzed with a simple equivalent beam model, which is almost independent of the loading scheme. For very short and thin shells, and also for beam-like (long and moderately thick) shells, the ratios of Leipholz's to Beck's, and Hauger's to Beck's nondimensional critical loads are the same as their corresponding values in beams. Moreover, the nondimensional frequency parameters in beam-like shells are equal in all three problems.|$|R

40|$|In the {{existing}} reports regarding free and forced vibrations of the beams, {{most of them}} studied a uniform beam carrying various concentrated elements using Bernoulli-Euler Beam Theory (BET) but without axial force. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to utilize the numerical assembly technique to determine the exact frequency-response amplitudes of the axially-loaded Timoshenko multi-span beam carrying a number of various concentrated elements (including point masses, <b>rotary</b> <b>inertias,</b> linear springs and rotational springs) and subjected to a harmonic concentrated force and the exact natural frequencies and mode shapes of the beam for the free vibration analysis. The model allows analyzing the influence of the shear and axial force and harmonic concentrated force effects and intermediate concentrated elements on the dynamic behavior of the beams by using Timoshenko Beam Theory (TBT). At first, the coefficient matrices for the intermediate concentrated elements, an intermediate pinned support, applied harmonic force, left-end support and right-end support of Timoshenko beam are derived. After the derivation of the coefficient matrices, the numerical assembly technique is used to establish the overall coefficient matrix for the whole vibrating system. Finally, solving the equations associated with the last overall coefficient matrix one determines the exact dynamic response amplitudes of the forced vibrating system corresponding to each specified exciting frequency of the harmonic force. Equating the determinant of the overall coefficient matrix to zero one determines the natural frequencies of the free vibrating system (the case of zero harmonic force) and substituting the corresponding values of integration constants into the related eigenfunctions one determines the associated mode shapes. The calculated vibration amplitudes of the forced vibrating systems and the natural frequencies of the free vibrating systems are given in tables for different values of the axial force. The dynamic response amplitudes and the mode shapes are presented in graphs.
