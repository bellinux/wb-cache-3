In his hand he held a shoe.|$|E

50|$|Free {{movement}} of stored materials, on a first-in, first-out basis, {{is essential in}} maximizing silo efficiency. The goal of silo efficiency {{is to ensure that}} oldest material is used first and does not contaminate newer, fresher material. Two main problems, <b>rat</b> <b>holing</b> and bridging, complicate silo efficiency. When <b>rat</b> <b>holing</b> occurs, powders adhere to the sides of silos. Bridging occurs when material blocks at the silo base.|$|R
50|$|The {{compressed}} air {{contained in the}} pressure vessel is instantly released, and the achieved blast, called the impact force, evacuates material sticking to the walls (<b>rat</b> <b>holing),</b> as well as breaking potential bridging thanks to the shock wave obtained.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the affair had begun to attract spectators. The noise of the {{revolver}} had proved a fine advertisement. The roof of {{the house next door}} began to fill up. Only a few of the occupants could get {{a clear view of the}} proceedings, for the chimney intervened. There was considerable speculation as to what was passing in the Three Points camp. John was the popular favorite. The early comers had seen his interview with Sam, and were relating it with gusto to their friends. Their attitude toward John was that of a group of men watching a dog at a <b>rat</b> <b>hole.</b> They looked to him to provide entertainment for them, but they realized that the first move must be with the attackers. They were fair-minded men, and they did not expect John to make any aggressive move.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rat</b> <b>Hole</b> Sink {{is located}} 10 m {{upstream}} {{of the main}} entrance where the water sinks. The entrance is normally covered with a grating. Below this a squirm downwards leads straight into the upstream passage of <b>Rat</b> <b>Hole.</b> When the stream is diverted, <b>Rat</b> <b>Hole</b> Sink provides easier access to the <b>Rat</b> <b>Hole</b> pitches than the traditional entrance.|$|E
50|$|Interest in <b>Rat</b> <b>Hole</b> then waned, and by 1960 the {{entrance}} passage was choked. In 1983 the Craven Pothole Club started {{to dig out}} the sink, P14, as well as {{the entrance}} to <b>Rat</b> <b>Hole</b> itself, and continued their efforts the following year. P14 was the first to go and was named <b>Rat</b> <b>Hole</b> Sink, and the main entrance succumbed soon after.|$|E
50|$|Its range {{comprises}} a {{wide variety}} of habitats. It is found in fields and low scrub jungle, as well as inhabited areas. It is known to take up residence in termite mounds, brick piles, <b>rat</b> <b>holes,</b> even inside houses. It is frequently found in water or in proximity to a water source.|$|R

The female snake usually lays between 10 and 30 eggs in <b>rat</b> <b>holes</b> or termite mounds and the eggs hatch 48 to 69 days later. The {{hatchlings}} measure between 20 and 30 cm in length. The hatchlings are independent from birth and have fully functional venom glands.|$|R

50|$|The {{successful}} house move {{allows the}} mouse family to remain while Timothy recovers {{before moving to}} their summer home. Although the rats have not yet had time to move everything they needed for The Plan, they manage to destroy their underground rooms, and create the illusion that they are just regular rats by placing rubbish in the remaining rooms. As the others move, ten rats stay behind so the exterminators would not think the <b>rat</b> <b>hole</b> has been abandoned. When the exterminators fill the <b>rat</b> <b>hole</b> with poisonous gas, eight of the ten rats manage to escape, while two rats die in the hole. It is not revealed exactly who these two are.|$|E

The value of such old, odd pieces is arbitrary and they wouldn’t total enough at an auction sale to bother about. My idea, Arthur, is that you remove whatever you care to retain, stop up the <b>rat</b> <b>holes,</b> and then seal up the place forever.” ...|$|R

50|$|The great plague {{pandemic}} {{which came}} to India and China during the late 1890s tore through Naushehra, killing {{a large percentage of}} its population.

The citizens of Naushehra moved to the new patti of Jagpur. Similarly, the villagers of nearby sub-village of Chaudriwala, decided to move from the original town center to the current location of Chaudriwala.|$|R

The Wipers and Poison Idea are the best known representatives of the scene, especially The Wipers, a major grunge influence. These bands played at The Met (now Dante's) and the Satyricon. Other hardcore bands in the 1980s included Lockjaw, Final Warning, The Jackals, and The <b>Rats.</b> <b>Hole</b> frontwoman Courtney Love spent time in Portland, and was active in the city's punk scene at the time. She initially met Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain at the Satyricon club in 1989.|$|R

Nothing but the grimly painted portrait of her poor dear man, which had been hung against the wall. She gave a heavy sigh to his memory, as she was accustomed to do, whenever she spoke of him in company; and went on adjusting her nightdress. Her sigh was re-echoed; or answered by a long-drawn breath. She looked round again, but no one was to be seen. She ascribed these sounds to the wind, oozing through the <b>rat</b> <b>holes</b> of the old mansion; and proceeded leisurely to put her hair in papers, when, all at once, she thought she perceived one of the eyes of the portrait move.|$|R
