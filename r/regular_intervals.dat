40|$|Abstract: Sequences of clicks {{comprising}} {{a dominant}} <b>regular</b> <b>interval</b> were investigated psychophysically. The first sequence pattern consisted of one <b>regular</b> interclick <b>interval</b> {{followed by two}} random intervals. The second sequence pattern consisted of one <b>regular</b> <b>interval</b> with a randomly interspersed click, followed by a single random interval. These stimuli had a single normalized autocorrelation peak of identical height at the <b>regular</b> <b>interval.</b> They were also equated in average rate. In a pitch matching experiment, the stimuli {{were found to have}} different pitches even though the <b>regular</b> <b>interval</b> was identical. The pitch shift persisted when the stimuli were high-pass filtered at 3 or 6 kHz and low-pass noise was added. The combined effects of auditory filtering and hair-cell transduction provide a possible basis for this perceptual shift. This emphasizes the need for physiologically-based models for pitch perception...|$|R

5|$|Adult frogs {{lay their}} eggs in moist places, {{including}} on leaves, in plants, among exposed roots, and elsewhere. Once the eggs hatch, the adult piggybacks the tadpoles, one at a time, to suitable water, either a pool, or the water gathered in the throat of bromeliads or other plants. The tadpoles remain there until they metamorphose, fed by unfertilized eggs laid at <b>regular</b> <b>intervals</b> by the mother.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{we find the}} {{potential}} function by using nodal parameters for the p-Laplacian Bessel operator on a <b>regular</b> <b>interval</b> [1,a]. Especially, we have used the Prüfer substitution which is also used for regular problems. However, we consider the p-Laplacian operator on a <b>regular</b> <b>interval,</b> one can consider it at the origin {{that the problem is}} singular. In that time, the results are more interesting.|$|R
50|$|Some FRP {{systems such}} as Yampa use sampling. On a <b>regular</b> <b>interval,</b> samples are pushed through a signal network. This {{approach}} has two drawbacks: it is very computation intensive to process samples on a <b>regular</b> <b>interval,</b> and the network has to wait up to {{the duration of the}} sampling interval to find out about changes to the input. Sampling is an example of push-based FRP.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a definition of}} admissibility for subintervals in interval exchange transformations. Using this notion, we prove a property of the natural codings of interval exchange transformations, namely that any derived set of a <b>regular</b> <b>interval</b> exchange set is a <b>regular</b> <b>interval</b> exchange set with {{the same number of}} intervals. Derivation is taken here with respect to return words. We characterize the admissible intervals using a branching version of the Rauzy induction. We also study the case of <b>regular</b> <b>interval</b> exchange transformations defined over a quadratic field and show that the set of factors of such a transformation is primitive morphic. The proof uses an extension of a result of Boshernitzan and Carroll...|$|R

5|$|Diagnosis {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} {{clinical}} appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature {{is a history of}} recurrent, self healing ulcers at fairly <b>regular</b> <b>intervals.</b> Although there are many causes of oral ulceration, recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme, ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history.|$|E

However, minor problems affecting the breed can include hypothyroidism, primary closed angle glaucoma and Cushing's syndrome. In order to combat glaucoma in the breed, the breed clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at <b>regular</b> <b>intervals</b> throughout their lives. The Dandie is also at slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average. The average life expectancy of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 1113 years.|$|E

5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at <b>regular</b> <b>intervals</b> among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
