5|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, Diệm ordered that all VNAF {{aircraft}} be grounded, and all aerial combat missions suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for any possible anti-regime tendencies. This was achieved by placing tanks on the runway at Bien Hoa Air Base. Without assistance from accompanying fighter craft, the U.S. deemed it too <b>risky</b> <b>for</b> American helicopters to operate in the jungles against the communists.|$|E
5|$|In late 1956, {{parliamentary}} elections in Jordan resulted in major victories for Arab nationalist and other left-leaning parties. Hussein subsequently appointed Suleiman Nabulsi, an Arab nationalist, socialist {{and one of}} the leading pro-Nasser MP-elects, as prime minister in October. Roughly coinciding with Nabulsi's appointment, the British, French and Israelis launched a tripartite invasion of the Suez Canal and the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, mainly in response to Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company among other reasons. Hussein {{declared a state of emergency}} and his opposition against the invasion and agreed to Egyptian chief of staff Abdel Hakim Amer's request for Jordanian military intervention. To that end, Hussein instructed Abu Nuwar to immediately execute Amer's order to launch Operation Beisan, which entailed a Jordanian-Syrian armored invasion of the Israeli coastal plain, which was seen as Israel's most vulnerable region due to the short length between the coast and the Jordanian-held West Bank. However, Abu Nuwar viewed the operation as far too <b>risky</b> <b>for</b> the Jordanian army and advised Hussein to await Syria's adherence to the plan; Egypt, Syria and Jordan had formed a defense pact days before the Israeli occupation of Sinai on 29 October.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{performance}} guarantees, and one may often choose them à la carte, with higher risk charges for guarantees that are <b>riskier</b> <b>for</b> the insurance companies.

5|$|Lark {{received}} missions from London (sometimes via Stockholm), and {{constituted the}} leadership of Milorg in Trøndelag where they in practice were the same entity. Gjems-Onstad started his operations in Trondheim by establishing radio connection with London and operating the radio transmitter, and he soon {{became one of the}} most important persons in {{the leadership of}} Milorg. His saboteur activity included to prepare the sinking of Tirpitz, but the plans were never realised as the ship had left the Trondheimsfjord in early 1943. Sørli commanded Gjems-Omstad to a spontaneous assassination of Nazi collaborator Ivar Grande after spotting him incidentally, but Gjems-Onstad aborted after noticing a division of Russian POWs, fearing for what in turn might happen to them if he went through with the assassination. Some days later he again plotted to assassinate Grande together with Sørli and Ingebrigt Gausland. They delivered a box booby trapped with an egg hand grenade to his home, but Grande foiled the attempt with advice Norwegian Gestapo agent Henry Rinnan (who was present at the time) had received on not to open such boxes. Following the attempted assassination, he was ordered to not get himself involved in any further such attempts, as it was considered too <b>risky</b> <b>for</b> him. Gjems-Onstad took over as leader of the group from Sørli in October 1943, and it was decided to pull him out of Norway and close the radio station following news that Pevik had been arrested. He left Trondheim for Stockholm later that month, and received training in psychological warfare.|$|E

50|$|Many {{economic}} {{properties of}} carbon pricing hold {{regardless of whether}} carbon is priced with a cap or a tax. However, {{there are a few}} important differences. Cap-based prices are more volatile and so they are <b>riskier</b> <b>for</b> investors, consumers and for governments that auction permits. Also, caps tend to short-out the effect of non-price policies such are renewables subsidies, while carbon taxes do not.|$|R
50|$|If no {{interline}} ticketing agreement exists, {{then two}} separate tickets {{will need to}} be issued and passengers will have to retrieve their bags and carry it to the connecting airline for check-in. Itineraries with interline connections such as this are <b>riskier</b> <b>for</b> travelers since the second carrier may be unaware of delays or issues with the incoming flight and it is more likely for luggage to be lost.|$|R
40|$|The Distribution View {{provides}} {{a model that}} integrates four distributional concerns {{in the evaluation of}} risky prospects.

25|$|Animal ambush predators usually remain {{motionless}} (sometimes hidden) {{and wait}} for prey to come within ambush distance before pouncing. Ambush predators are often camouflaged, and may be solitary animals. This mode of predation may be less <b>risky</b> <b>for</b> the predator because lying-in-wait reduces exposure to its own predators.|$|E
25|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} end of the 20th century, North Dakota's {{population}} gradually declined, interrupted by a couple of brief increases. Young adults with university degrees were particularly likely to leave the state. With the advancing process of mechanization of agricultural practices, and environmental conditions requiring larger landholdings for successful agriculture, subsistence farming proved to be too <b>risky</b> <b>for</b> families. Many people moved to urban areas for jobs.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, {{during the}} 16th century {{the system of}} independent, family-possessed estates as power centra, like Austrått, was {{ultimately}} replaced in favour of fiefs to which the King himself appointed lords. A few Norwegian noblemen were given such fiefs, for example Knight Trond Torleivsson Benkestok, Lord to Bergenhus Fortress, but over time these would find themselves possessed almost exclusively by immigrants. Nevertheless, during the 17th century fiefs were transformed into high offices. Also they were considered too <b>risky</b> <b>for</b> the King.|$|E

5000|$|A second {{mortgage}} is a lien on a property which is subordinate {{to a more}} senior mortgage or loan. Called lien holders positioning, the {{second mortgage}} falls behind the first mortgage. This means second mortgages are <b>riskier</b> <b>for</b> lenders and thus generally come with a higher interest rate than first mortgages. This is because if the loan goes into default, the first mortgage gets paid off first before the second mortgage. Commercial loans can have multiple loans {{as long as the}} equity supports it.|$|R
25|$|A venture {{capitalist}} {{is a person}} who makes venture investments, and these {{venture capitalist}}s are expected to bring managerial and technical expertise as well as capital to their investments. A venture capital fund refers to a pooled investment vehicle (in the United States, often an LP or LLC) that primarily invests the financial capital of third-party investors in enterprises that are too <b>risky</b> <b>for</b> the standard capital markets or bank loans. These funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm, which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds (scientists, researchers), business training and/or deep industry experience.|$|E
25|$|Opponents contend {{the project}} is based on {{uncertain}} projections about maritime trade and the world economy. Roberto N. Méndez, {{an economist at the}} University of Panama, alleges that the economic and financial projections are based on manipulated data. Independent engineers, most notably Humberto Reynolds and Tomás Drohan Ruiz, the former head of engineering and dredging of the Panama Canal, say that the project will cost much more than currently budgeted and that it is too <b>risky</b> <b>for</b> Panama. M. A. Bernal, a professor at the University of Panama, argues that confidence in the ACP's budget is undermined because of the involvement of engineering and consultancy firm Parsons Brinckerhoff.|$|E

Moreover, it may well be an optimal arrangement to have only dependents migrate, thus rationalizing the recent dependent-oriented migration flows from places like Hong Kong and Taiwan.

50|$|In {{economics}} and finance, risk neutral preferences are neither risk averse nor risk seeking. A risk neutral party's decisions are {{not affected by}} the degree of uncertainty {{in a set of}} outcomes, so a risk neutral party is indifferent between choices with equal expected payoffs even if one choice is <b>riskier.</b> <b>For</b> example, if offered either $50 or a 50% chance each of $100 and $0, a risk neutral person would have no preference. In contrast, a risk averse person would prefer the first offer, while a risk seeking person would prefer the second.|$|R

XXX Corps to the west would send the 7th Armoured Division across the Odon River to take Évrecy and Hill 112. The 1st Airborne Division would then drop between the pincers but Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, the Allied air commander exercised a veto of the airborne plan as too <b>risky</b> <b>for</b> the transport aircraft.|$|E
500|$|In March, {{after the}} {{beginning}} of the British Dardanelles Campaign against the Ottoman Empire, Germany began to pressure Austria-Hungary to assist their ally; Haus considered sending Novara with a cargo of munitions.

On 2 May, Novara towed the German U-boat [...] from Pola out of the Adriatic Sea. They evaded French patrols until 6 May, off Cephalonia, they were spotted by a French vessel. Novara cut the tow and sped north, while UB-8 submerged and evaded the French patrol. Following the Italian declaration of war against the Central Powers on 23 May, the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet sortied to bombard Italian coastal targets. Novara took part in the operation; along with a destroyer and two torpedo boats, she bombarded Porto Corsini near Ravenna. Defensive fire from Italian coastal guns killed six men aboard Novara.|$|E
