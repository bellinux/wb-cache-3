50|$|Proposal 3 was a {{proposed}} constitutional amendment {{which would have}} required electric utilities to provide at least 25% of their annual <b>retail</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> from renewable energy sources, which are wind, solar, biomass, and hydropower, by 2025, limited to not more than 1% per year electric utility rate increases charged to consumers only to achieve compliance with the renewable energy standard, allowed annual extensions of the deadline to meet the 25% standard {{in order to prevent}} rate increases over the 1% limit, and required the Legislature to enact additional laws to encourage the use of Michigan made equipment and employment of Michigan residents.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{electricity}} generated at the Four Corners Generating Station located in northwest New Mexico is transmitted for export and sold in neighboring states. In 1975 New Mexico enacted the Electrical Energy Tax Act, which imposed a tax on electricity generated by power plants within the state. The tax amounted to about 2 percent of the retail value of electricity. The Act further allowed electric companies in New Mexico to credit the amount of this tax against their existing tax liability from an existing 4 percent gross receipts tax on <b>retail</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity,</b> essentially eliminating {{the effect of the}} tax upon New Mexico's in-state users of electricity. Electricity generated from in-state power plants but exported for sale to out-of-state customers did not have any gross receipts tax liability to credit the energy tax against.|$|E

40|$|The State of Delaware {{deregulated}} the <b>retail</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> in 2002, enabling {{buyers to}} procure power on a real-time price schedule and sell excess generated {{power to the}} grid. This initiative has prompted industrial sites, especially those with on-site generation capability, to evaluate the benefits and risks of the deregulated market. Deregulation can offer significant potential savings to industrial customers. However, with this opportunity comes exposure to turbulent fluctuations in electricity prices, which can sometimes reach $ 1, 000 /MW-hr. If a customer is unprepared for high electricity prices, an entire year <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> cost savings can quickly be erased.

40|$|A recent {{ruling by}} the United States Supreme Court makes it more likely than ever that the cost overruns {{associated}} with nuclear power plant construction will {{be passed on to}} consumers. The ruling of the court did not address the <b>retail</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> directly. However, an implication of the opinion is that wholesale electric price increases will be passed on to the final consumers. This paper employs an input-output framework, theRAS matrix updating technique, and an energy price model to determine the intersectoral price impact of an electric rate hike on a plains state economy. The purpose was to generate information on the process of price shock transmission throughout a regional economy and to identify the sectors most affected. Moreover, the upper limit of the price shock to the household sector also is discussed. The major findings of the paper are that the services sector is most affected by the electric rate hike and agriculture is least affected. Furthermore, the results indicate that no sector is significantly impacted. However, the cumulative result on households could be substantial and cause a reduction in their purchasing power...|$|R

40|$|Nebraska is {{currently}} ranked 4 th {{in the nation}} for wind energy potential, but ranks low in actual wind power production. The lack of wind energy production could {{be the result of}} Nebraska’s unique public power districts that have eminent domain of distribution and <b>retail</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> in the State. Public Power districts are prohibited from receiving benefits of state and federal tax incentives for the development of wind farms, however some Nebraska power districts still pursue wind energy as a renewable source of energy. Recent legislation changes, including the passing of laws LB 629 and LB 1048, have provided the State of Nebraska with the ability to remove certain barriers of tax restrictions and aid in the development of wind farms throughout the State. Changes in Nebraska legislation have allowed private utilities, {{in and out of the}} State, the ability to invest in wind energy and incorporate into Nebraska’s energy portfolio. Currently, certain public power districts in Nebraska have set a goal of achieving 10 percent of their energy supply from renewable resources by 2020.

These increases were primarily due to economic growth, evident by a 2. 1 -percent increase in the real gross domestic product for the U. S. {{in the first quarter}} of 2007 over the first quarter of 2006. The average U. S. retail price of electricity for March 2007 showed a 5. 0 -percent increase from March 2006. For the twelve month period ending March 2007, the U. S. average retail price increased by 7. 2 percent over the previous twelve month period ending March 2006. Electricity generation in March 2007 from all major fuel categories saw little change from March 2006. The exception was petroleum liquids which increased 79. 3 percent, as petroleum liquid-fired generators drew on reserves that were purchased at lower prices than current petroleum liquid prices.

For the month, heating degree days were 26. 1 percent higher than January 2006, but still 8. 9 percent lower than normal. In January 2007, increased demand for winter heating, coupled with economic strength, as observed by growth in industrial production, resulted in a 7. 7 percent growth in electricity generation compared to January 2006. (Industrial production increased 1. 92 percent from January 2006 to January 2007.) January 2007 <b>retail</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> increased 3. 7 percent when compared to January 2006. The lower growth rate for sales of electricity is influenced by the fact that the utility billing cycles tend to lag electricity production in many areas. These lags were significant this month, given the fact that the latter part of January 2007 was significantly colder than the first part of the month. The average U. S. retail price of electricity in January 2007 showed a 4. 3 percent jump from January 2006, and a 2. 2 percent increase from December 2006. Electricity generation in January 2007 from all major fuel categories was up from January 2006, with the exception of hydroelectric generation, which was down by 4. 7 percent due to lower than normal precipitation in the Northwestern region.
