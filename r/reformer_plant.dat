40|$|An {{emerging}} DOE-sponsored {{technology has}} been deployed. The technology recovers light ends from a catalytic <b>reformer</b> <b>plant</b> using waste heat powered ammonia absorption refrigeration. It is deployed at the 17, 000 bpd Bloomfield, New Mexico refinery of Western Refining Company. The technology recovers approximately 50, 000 barrels per year of liquefied petroleum gas that was formerly being flared. The elimination of the flare also reduces CO 2 emissions by 17, 000 tons per year, plus tons per year reductions in NOx, CO, and VOCs. The waste heat is supplied directly to the absorption unit from the Unifiner effluent. The added cooling of that stream relieves a bottleneck formerly present due to restricted availability of cooling water. The 350 oF Unifiner effluent is cooled to 260 oF. The catalytic reformer vent gas is directly chilled to minus 25 oF, and the FCC column overhead reflux is chilled by 25 oF glycol. Notwithstanding a substantial cost overrun and schedule slippage, this project can now be considered a success: it is both profitable and highly beneficial to the environment. The capabilities of directly-integrated waste-heat powered ammonia absorption refrigeration and their benefits to the refining industry have been demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The Mantova Chemical District is a Site of National (and European) Interest (SIN). It {{comprises}} an {{oil refinery}} specialized in gasoline owned by Mol and Ies societies, a petrochemical plant (olefins) owned by Eni Versalis, an {{air separation unit}} and a <b>reformer</b> <b>plant</b> owned by Sapio {{and a series of}} industries working in the area of chipboard. Nowadays the oil refinery is off and the industrial network is deeply suffering from it; authorities at all levels (town, province, region, and ministry) are moving fast to convert the old facility into a biorefinery. This paper illustrates the studies and partial results of the funded project BioMAN for the conversion of the old refinery into a lignocellulosic biorefinery. A process framework was proposed for the establishment of an integrated biorefinery based on stablished and emerging technologies. In future works, a further elaboration of such scheme will allow determining optimal operating conditions through optimization algorithms. A preliminary economical assessment of methanol production showed potential for revenue production: accumulated net income was 61 mi £ in five years. Methanol production was 50 kt per year; the yearly amount of biomass required, approximately 160 kt, is in agreement with current reports of local availability...|$|E
40|$|Metal dusting {{corrosion}} {{has been}} a serious problem in the petroleum and petrochemical industries, such as reforming and syngas production systems. This form of deterioration has led to worldwide material loss for 50 years. For the past three years, we have studied the mechanism of metal dusting for Fe- and Ni-base alloys. In this report, we present a correlation between the weight loss and depth of pits that form in Ni-base alloys. Nickel-base alloys were also tested at 1 and 14. 8 atm (210 psi), in a high carbon activity environment. Higher system pressure was found to accelerate corrosion in most Ni-base alloys. To reduce testing time, a pre-pitting method was developed. Mechanical scratches on the alloy surface led to fast metal dusting corrosion. We have also developed preliminary data {{on the performance of}} weldments of several Ni-base alloys in a metal dusting environment. Finally, Alloy 800 tubes and plates used in a <b>reformer</b> <b>plant</b> were examined by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, and Raman spectroscopy. The oxide scale {{on the surface of the}} Alloy 800 primarily consists of Fe{sub 1 +x}Cr{sub 2 -X}O{sub 4 } spinel phase with high Fe content. Carbon can diffuse through this oxide scale. It was discovered that the growth of metal dusting pits could be stopped by means of a slightly oxidized alloy surface. This leads to a new way to solve metal dusting problem...|$|E
50|$|The {{capital cost}} of methane <b>reformer</b> <b>plants</b> is {{prohibitive}} for small to medium size applications because the technology does not scale down well. Conventional steam reforming plants operate at pressures between 200 and 600 psi with outlet {{temperatures in the}} range of 815 to 925 °C. However, analyses have shown that even though it is more costly to construct, a well-designed SMR can produce hydrogen more cost-effectively than an ATR. To lower the costs both pressure and used temperature are lowered which allows for the use of cheaper materials.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} mechanistic kinetic {{model for the}} upgrading of the low component fractions petroleum naphtha (generic) of Nigerian reformer reactors. Four main constituent lumps were considered in the synthesis of the rate equations that describe the mass action velocity for the depletion processes of the feed in the reactors. The reactors under study is a continuous catalyst reforming stacked reactors, one reactor {{on top of the}} other with gravity mobile flow of catalyst from reactor 1, 2 and 3. The plant design brings to the barest minimum the deactivation of catalyst by the precursors of the reactions. Energy and component mass balance approach were adopted to develop the dynamic model for the research. The models were parameterized by benchmarking against industrial <b>reformer</b> <b>plant</b> data. The equations are non-linear intractable partial differential equations describing the dynamics of the reactors are very stiff to solve. The resolution of the model equations depends on the obtaining the values of the activation energies for the four lumps chemical species reactions. A constrained optimization which considers the minimization of the sum of the squares of difference of the objective function was carried out by integrating the differential equations numerically. The dynamic equations were converted into a set of ordinary differential equations by applying numerical method of lines (MOL) of finite difference approximation of the spatial derivatives, and the equations integrated with respect to time. The dynamic equations were resolved using the mat-lab ode solver- 23. The comparison of deviations of dynamic model with the steady state model results showed naphthene 2. 2 percent...|$|E
40|$|This project {{focused on}} the {{demonstration}} of an innovative technology, {{referred to as the}} Sunexus CO 2 Solar Reformer, which utilizes waste CO 2 as a feedstock for the efficient and economical production of synthetic diesel fuel using solar thermal energy as the primary energy input. The Sunexus technology employs a two stage process for the conversion of CO 2 to diesel fuel. A solar reforming system, including a specially designed reactor and proprietary CO 2 reforming catalyst, was developed and used to convert captured CO 2 rich gas streams into syngas (primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide) using concentrated solar energy at high conversion efficiencies. The second stage of the system (which has been demonstrated under other funding) involves the direct conversion of the syngas into synthetic diesel fuel using a proprietary catalyst (Terra) previously developed and validated by Pacific Renewable Fuels and Chemicals (PRFC). The overall system energy efficiency for conversion of CO 2 to diesel fuel is 74 %, due to the use of solar energy. The results herein describe modeling, design, construction, and testing of the Sunexus CO 2 Solar Reformer. Extensive parametric testing of the solar reformer and candidate catalysts was conducted and chemical kinetic models were developed. Laboratory testing of the Solar Reformer was successfully completed using various gas mixtures, temperatures, and gas flow rates/space velocities to establish performance metrics which can be employed for the design of commercial plants. A variety of laboratory tests were conducted including dry reforming (CO 2 and CH{sub 4 }), combination dry/steam reforming (CO 2, CH{sub 4 } & H{sub 2 }O), and tri-reforming (CO 2, CH{sub 4 }, H{sub 2 }O & O{sub 2 }). CH{sub 4 } and CO 2 conversions averaged 95 - 100 % and 50 - 90 % per reformer cycle, respectively, depending upon the temperatures and gas space velocities. No formation of carbon deposits (coking) on the catalyst was observed in any of these tests. A 16 ft. diameter, concentrating solar dish was modified to accommodate the Sunexus CO 2 Solar Reformer and the integrated system was installed at the Pacific Renewable Fuels and Chemicals test site at McClellan, CA. Several test runs were conducted without catalyst during which the ceramic heat exchanger in the Sunexus Solar Reformer reached temperatures between 1, 050 F (566 C) and 2, 200 F (1, 204 C) during the test period. A dry reforming mixture of CO 2 /CH{sub 4 } (2. 0 / 1. 0 molar ratio) was chosen for all of the tests on the integrated solar dish/catalytic reformer during December 2010. Initial tests were carried out to determine heat transfer from the collimated solar beam to the catalytic reactor. The catalyst was operated successfully at a steady-state temperature of 1, 125 F (607 C), which was sufficient to convert 35 % of the 2 / 1 CO 2 /CH{sub 4 } mixture to syngas. This conversion efficiency confirmed the results from laboratory testing of this catalyst which provided comparable syngas production efficiencies (40 % at 1, 200 F [650 C]) with a resulting syngas composition of 20 % CO, 16 % H{sub 2 }, 39 % CO 2 and 25 % CH{sub 4 }. As based upon the laboratory results, it is predicted that 90 % of the CO 2 will be converted to syngas in the solar reformer at 1, 440 F (782 C) resulting in a syngas composition of 50 % CO: 43 % H{sub 2 }: 7 % CO 2 : 0 % CH{sub 4 }. Laboratory tests show that the higher catalyst operating temperature of 1, 440 F (782 C) for efficient conversion of CO 2 can certainly be achieved by optimizing solar reactor heat transfer, which would result in the projected 90 % CO 2 -to-syngas conversion efficiencies. Further testing will be carried out during 2011, through other funding support, to further optimize the solar dish CO 2 reformer. Additional studies carried out in support of this project and described in this report include: (1) An Assessment of Potential Contaminants in Captured CO 2 from Various Industrial Processes and Their Possible Effect on Sunexus CO 2 Reforming Catalysts; (2) Recommended Measurement Methods for Assessing Contaminant Levels in Captured CO 2 Streams; (3) An Assessment of Current Commercial Scale Fisher-Tropsch (F-T) Technologies for the Conversion of Syngas to Fuels; (4) An Overview of CO 2 Capture Technologies from Various Industrial Sources; and (5) Lifecycle Analysis for the Capture and Conversion of CO 2 to Synthetic Diesel Fuel. Commercial scale Sunexus CO 2 Solar <b>Reformer</b> <b>plant</b> designs, proposed in this report, should be able to utilize waste CO 2 {{from a wide variety of}} industrial sources to produce a directly usable synthetic diesel fuel that replaces petroleum derived fuel, thus improving the United States energy security while also sequestering CO 2. Our material balance model shows that every 5. 0 lbs of CO 2 is transformed using solar energy into 6. 26 lbs (1. 0 U. S. gallon) of diesel fuel and into by-products, which includes water.

Sulfuric, as well as nitric, acid plant heat recovery boilers are examples {{of the use of}} heat recovery due primarily to process considerations. On the other hand, cost and payback are main considerations in the case of gas turbine and incineration plants, where large quantities of gases are exhausted at temperatures varying from 800 ?F to 1800 ?F. This gas, when recovered, can result in a large energy savings and steam production.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of carbon from carbonaceous gaseous environments is prevalent in many chemical and petrochemical processes such as, hydrogen-, ammonia-, and methanol-reforming systems, syngas production systems, and iron-ore reduction plants. One {{of the major}} consequences of carbon deposition is the degradation of structural materials by a phenomenon known as ''metal dusting''. There are two major issues of importance in metal dusting. First is formation of coke and subsequent {{deposition of}} coke on metallic structural components. Second is the initiation and subsequent propagation of metal dusting degradation of the structural alloy. In the past, we reported on the mechanism for metal dusting of Fe- and Ni-base alloys. In this report, we present metal dusting data on both Fe- and Ni-base alloys after exposure in high and atmospheric pressure environments that simulate the gas chemistry in operating hydrogen reformers. We have also measured the progression of pits by measuring the depth {{as a function of}} exposure time for a variety of Fe- and Ni-base structural alloys. We have clearly established the role of transport of iron in forming a non-protective spinel phase in the initiation process and presence of carbon transfer channels in the oxide scale for the continued propagation of pits, by nano-beam X-ray analysis using the advance photon source (APS), Raman scattering, and SEM/EDX analysis. In this report, we have developed correlations between weight loss and pit progression rates and evaluated the effects of carbon activity, system pressure, and alloy chemistry, on weight loss and pit propagation. To develop pit propagation data for the alloys without incurring substantial time for the initiation of pits, especially for the Ni-base alloys that exhibit incubation times of thousands of hours, a pre-pitting method has been developed. The pre-pitted alloys exhibited pit propagation rates similar to those of materials tested without pre-pitting. We have also developed a substantial body of metal-dusting data on the performance of Fe- and Ni-base weldments. During the course of this project, we have developed new Ni-base and Cu-base alloys and tested them in simulated metal dusting environments at 1 atm and at high pressures. Results clearly showed superior performance of both classes of alloys in resisting metal dusting. We also developed an approach to mitigate metal dusting by performing an intermediate oxidation step for extending the life of alloys in which metal dusting has initiated and pits are in progression. Finally, we have analyzed several components that have failed in plants such as hydrogen <b>plant,</b> pilot <b>plant</b> <b>reformer,</b> and a gas boiler...|$|R
