5|$|The {{concept of}} a mass rapid transit for New Delhi first emerged from a traffic and travel {{characteristics}} study which {{was carried out in}} the city in 1969. Over the next several years, many official committees by a variety of government departments were commissioned to examine issues related to technology, <b>route</b> <b>alignment,</b> and governmental jurisdiction. In 1984,the Urban Arts Commission came up with a proposal for developing a multi-modal transport system, which would consist of constructing three underground mass rapid transit corridors as well augmenting the city's existing suburban railway and road transport networks.|$|E
5|$|The Travis Branch is {{a branch}} of the Staten Island Railway in New York City, that {{operates}} from Arlington Yard to Fresh Kills, which is used for freight transportation along the West Shore, Staten Island. The branch was built in 1928, in order to serve Gulf Oil along the Arthur Kill, and was built south from Arlington Yard into the marshes of the island's western shore to Gulfport. In 1957, the line was extended to Travis in order to serve the newly built Consolidated Edison power plant. In 2005, the Travis Branch was being renovated and was extended from the old Consolidated Edison plant to the New York Sanitation dump at Fresh Kills. Regular service to the facility began in April 2007. A proposed <b>route</b> <b>alignment</b> for light rail on the west shore of Staten Island would have the light rail go on the North Shore rail right-of-way to the Travis Branch of the line, and from there, onto the median of the West Shore Expressway.|$|E

25|$|The {{status of}} the <b>route</b> <b>alignment</b> of the Asian Highway 2 {{crossing}} the Malaysia–Singapore border is in dispute.

Meanwhile, Singapore had commissioned the Johor–Singapore Causeway and the Bukit Timah Expressway as part of AH2, as the Johor–Singapore Causeway is the main gateway to Singapore from Malaysia, which could mean that the Skudai Highway would {{be included in the}} <b>route</b> <b>alignment</b> instead of the Second Link Expressway.|$|E
25|$|Rapid transit is an {{intracity}} system {{built in}} large cities and has the highest capacity of any passenger transport system. It is usually grade-separated and commonly built underground or elevated. At street level, smaller trams can be used. Light rails are upgraded trams that have step-free access, their own right-of-way and sometimes sections underground. Monorail systems are elevated, medium-capacity systems. A people mover is a driverless, grade-separated train that serves only a few stations, as a shuttle. Due {{to the lack of}} uniformity of rapid transit systems, <b>route</b> <b>alignment</b> varies, with diverse rights-of-way (private land, side of road, street median) and geometric characteristics (sharp or broad curves, steep or gentle grades). For instance, the Chicago 'L' trains are designed with extremely short cars to negotiate the sharp curves in the Loop. New Jersey's PATH has similar-sized cars to accommodate curves in the trans-Hudson tunnels. San Francisco's BART operates large cars on its well-engineered routes.|$|E
