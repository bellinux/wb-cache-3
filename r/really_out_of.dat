500|$|I {{like the}} whole dance. It was really {{different}} and weird for me, because I usually don't, you know, be a crazy person every time. It was so fun to do and it was <b>really</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the box and it expanded me a lot, because I'm used to competition dances where you're like, [...] "Point your toes!" [...] But {{this time it was}} like, you just need to let go and feel it.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{played the}} song during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival while {{promoting}} her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). She performed the song wearing {{a tank top}} and high boots, with a silver glitter band around her hair. It was also performed at London's Koko Club. Madonna was dressed in an all-purple ensemble of jacket, velvet pedal pushers and knee-high boots. Before performing [...] "Everybody", she announced that, [...] "I feel like I'm <b>really</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> shape right now, I don't like falling off horses, so I'm going to do one more song." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite their lasting {{influence}} on modern music, the band {{has attempted to}} disassociate themselves {{with many of the}} bands they inspired. Following the band's reformation, guitarist Jim Suptic undertook an interview with website Drowned in Sound, in which he said, [...] "The punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It's like glam rock now. We played the Bamboozle fests this year and we felt <b>really</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place... If this is the world we helped create, then I apologise." [...] He went on to say they were grateful for the acknowledgements they have received, though explaining [...] "the problem is most of [...] aren't very good." ...|$|E

500|$|Fichtner {{said that}} his role on Prison Break ended up being [...] "a lot longer" [...] than he had {{originally}} thought. He was signed on to appear for a further two seasons, after being convinced by Olmstead to appear in a fourth (and final) one. The series' move from Dallas to Los Angeles for filming was also an inducement for Fichtner, who previously had to leave his family for filming. When Olmstead asked Fichtner to return for the fourth season, his only request was to make it challenging by making his character's journey difficult. Fichtner believes that in Mahone's journey, [...] "All {{of a sudden the}} blinders went up... And little by little, he's trying to make his way back." [...] He thinks that his character's journey should end with [...] "something <b>really</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the blue": [...] "What if he totally loses it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down. It moved the plot along, but at a feverish pace and with built in leaps in faith and storyline that just haven’t been explained enough. (How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t <b>really</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold. [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{obstacles}} {{written for}} the pair included the opposition of Colleen's family to the pairing, J.T.'s music career, and third party characters who came between them. In 2003, J.T. cheated on Colleen with Anita Hodges, an older woman considered a [...] "sexy cougar". Luckinbill explained J.T. as being [...] "weak in a desperate moment", and that he [...] "felt really sorry for someone he's known his whole life, and the good side of J.T. emerged to offer Anita some comfort. Then it got <b>really</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand." [...] He added that J.T. [...] "cares deeply" [...] for Colleen and [...] "realizes she will be devastated by his actions". Luckinbill felt that J.T. [...] "wouldn't hurt her for the world, and yet {{that is exactly what}} he'll end up doing". In May 2004, Fonseca's contract was not renewed and she was confirmed to exit. Within the storyline, Colleen leaves Genoa City and J.T. because she does not want to {{stand in the way of}} his music career. However, she returned to reprise the role briefly that December. [...] J.T. had begun dating Brittany Hodges (Lauren Woodland) and the writers wanted to bring Colleen back to [...] "add more complications to the story". Luckinbill described his character's feelings for Colleen and Brittany as extremely different, saying: [...] "J.T. saw Colleen as somebody so opposite himself that he considered himself undeserving of her love. She was too angelic [...] Brittany has more of the 'black sheep' in her." [...] Fans of the pair campaigned for a reunion between J.T. and Colleen when Fonseca returned, and pushed for her to be put back on contract. Fonseca and Luckinbill also anticipated the repairing of their characters because of a positive viewer response. Fonseca described it as being [...] "the best part of coming back", stating: [...] "Already it seems the fans [...] excited to see us together again." [...] Luckinbill stated: [...] "When they were together, they were like some sort of supercouple and there is a huge amount of fans who still want them together." [...] News of Fonseca's second exit incited a fan outcry and a campaign pushing for the actress's permanent return. Fonseca made her final appearance as Colleen in February 2005.|$|E
