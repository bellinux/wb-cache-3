5|$|The philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts {{was active}} in the East End, {{alleviating}} poverty by founding a sewing school for ex-weavers in Spitalfields and building the ornate Columbia Market in Bethnal Green. She helped to inaugurate the London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, was a keen supporter of the 'Ragged School Union', and operated housing schemes {{similar to those of the}} Model Dwellings Companies such as the East End Dwellings Company and the Four Per Cent Industrial Dwellings Company, where investors received a financial <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> philanthropy. Between the 1890s and 1903, when the work was published, the social campaigner Charles Booth instigated an investigation into the life of London poor (based at Toynbee Hall), much of which was centred on the poverty and conditions in the East End. Further investigations were instigated by the 'Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09', the Commission found it difficult to agree, beyond that change was necessary and produced separate minority and majority reports. The minority report was the work of Booth with the founders of the London School of Economics Sidney and Beatrice Webb. They advocated focusing on the causes of poverty and the radical notion of poverty being involuntary, rather than the result of innate indolence. At the time their work was rejected but was gradually adopted as policy by successive governments.|$|E

Throughout the Society's history, the allocation of bonuses (at regular intervals of up to five years) was a carefully thought-through decision based on actuarial advice, designed to promote fairness and equity between different groups and generations of policyholders.|$|E
40|$|Low {{commercial}} fertilizer use by smallholder farmers in developing {{regions of the}} world commonly limits productivity. Many of these farmers do not have the financial capacity to purchase enough fertilizer to maximize net <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> limited investment per hectare. High fertilizer costs and low commodity prices often reduce profit potential, and competing needs for money often take priority. Such farmers need high net <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> investments to justify the application of fertilizers...|$|R

25|$|In some online lotteries, {{the annual}} {{payments}} are only $25,000, with a balloon payment {{in the final}} year. This type of installment payment is often made through investment in government-backed securities. Online lotteries pay the winners through their insurance backup. However, many winners choose lump sum, since they believe {{they can get a}} better rate of <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> investment elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{proceeds}} from the disposal of the vessel and its equipment raised a total of around £12,500. By the time creditors had been paid off there was no cash available to allow a significant return of capital to the Radio 270 shareholders. As far as is known, none of the shareholders ever achieved a direct financial <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> investment.|$|E

25|$|Moral hazard is the {{prospect}} that a party insulated from risk may behave differently from the way it would behave if it were fully exposed to the risk. A person's belief that {{they are responsible for}} the consequences of their own actions is an essential aspect of rational behavior. An investor must balance the possibility of making a <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> investment with the risk of making a loss – the risk-return relationship. A moral hazard can occur when this relationship is interfered with, often via government policy.|$|E
25|$|Below the colonnades are catacombs {{which were}} {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} cheaper alternative burial to having a plot in {{the grounds of the}} cemetery. Unfortunately, the catacombs were not a success and only about 500 of the many thousands of places in them were sold. The Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 gave the government powers to purchase commercial cemeteries. The shareholders of the cemetery company were relieved to be able to sell their shares as the cost of building the cemetery had overrun and they had seen little <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> investment and there were few burials at first.|$|E
25|$|A close {{examination}} of Medieval trade in Europe shows that numerous significant credit based trades were not bearing interest. Hence, pragmatism and common sense called for a fair compensation for the risk of lending money, and a compensation for the opportunity cost of lending money without using it for other fruitful purposes. In order to circumvent the usury laws edicted by the Church, other forms of reward were created, in particular through the widespread form of partnership called commenda, very popular with Italian merchant bankers. Florentine merchant banks were almost sure to make a positive <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> loans, but this would be before taking into account solvency risks.|$|E

40|$|For {{an economy}} with altruistic parents facing {{productivity}} shocks, the optimal estate taxation is progressive: fortunate parents should face lower net <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> inheritances. This progressivity reflects optimal mean reversion in consumption, which ensures that a long-run steady state exists with bounded inequality - avoiding immiseration. ...|$|R
50|$|The Neglected firm {{effect is}} the {{phenomenon}} of lesser-known firms producing abnormally high <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> stocks. The companies that are followed by fewer analysts will earn higher <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> average than companies that are followed by many analysts. The abnormally high return exhibited by neglected firms {{may be due to}} the lower liquidity or higher risks associated with the stock.|$|R
25|$|Corbyn claims renationalisation {{would save}} money by both joining up a {{fragmented}} market, thereby reducing duplication in the privatised rail market (estimated by Ian Taylor as costing up to £1.2 billion in a 2012 report written for trade unions, but the Rail Delivery Group notes this amount includes the cost of leasing trains {{as well as the}} cost of Network Rail using private contractors, something which British Rail did as well, thus would be an inaccurate estimate of savings) and keeping what is currently profit for the energy and train operating companies. Both the energy and the train operating companies claim that they make a low <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> money (3.9% for the energy companies and 3.4% for the train companies).|$|E
25|$|Metro's {{efforts to}} develop the land at the Anacostia station have been {{strongly}} criticized. When Metro began operations in 1976, the transit agency created the Joint Development Program cooperatively promote retail, office, and residential development on land owned by Metro, by state or local governments, or private owners in order to boost bus and rail ridership on the system, generate operating income for Metro, and help {{state and local governments}} see a <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> investment in Metro (through revenues or increases in tax assessments). By 2007, Metro had signed 56 joint development projects generating $129 million (over 30 years) in income. At least one study showed that Metro-sponsored developments significantly outperformed developments built solely by the private sector. Nonetheless, Metro was only generating a rather small $4.3 million a year from its joint development projects, and anecdotal evidence indicated that Metro had a very mixed history in actually bringing development online.|$|E
25|$|In January 1944 Whittle {{was awarded}} the CBE in the New Year Honours. By {{this time he was}} a Group Captain, having been {{promoted}} from Wing Commander in July 1943. Later that month after further negotiations the Ministry made another offer of £135,500 for Power Jets, which was reluctantly accepted after the Ministry refused arbitration on the matter. Since Whittle had already offered to surrender his shares he would receive nothing at all, while Williams and Tinling each received almost £46,800 for their stock, and investors of cash or services had a threefold <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> original investment. Whittle met with Cripps to object personally to the nationalisation efforts and how they were being handled, but to no avail. The final terms were agreed on 28 March, and Power Jets officially became Power Jets (Research and Development) Ltd, with Roxbee Cox as Chairman, Constant of RAE Head of Engineering Division, and Whittle as Chief Technical Advisor. On 5 April 1944, the Ministry sent Whittle an award of only £10,000 for his shares.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} film production, Turkey {{shared the same}} fate {{with many of the}} {{national}} cinemas of the 20th century. Film production wasn't continuous until around the 1950s and the film market in general was run by a few major import companies that struggled for domination in the most population-dense and profitable cities such as Istanbul and İzmir. Film theatres rarely ever screened any locally produced films and the majority of the programs consisted of films of the stronger western film industries, especially those of the United States, France, Italy and Germany. Attempts at film production came primarily from multinational studios, which could rely on their comprehensive distribution networks together with their own theatre chains, thus guaranteeing them a <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> investment. Between the years 1896–1945, the number of locally produced films did not even reach 50 films in total, equal to less than a single year's annual film production in the 1950s and 1960s. Domestically produced films constituted {{only a small fraction of}} the total number of films screened in Turkey prior to the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Some {{money went}} to Vysotsky, {{the rest was}} {{distributed}} amongst this circle. At first this was a reasonable <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> efforts; however, as his addiction progressed and his body developed resistance, the frequency and amount of drugs needed to keep Vysotsky going became unmanageable. This culminated {{at the time of}} the Moscow Olympics which coincided with the last days of his life, when supplies of drugs were monitored more strictly than usual, and some of the doctors involved in supplying Vysotsky were already behind bars (normally the doctors had to account for every ampule, thus drugs were transferred to an empty container, while the patients received a substitute or placebo instead). In the last few days Vysotsky became uncontrollable, his shouting could be heard all over the apartment building on Malaya Gruzinskaya St. where he lived amongst VIP's. Several days before his death, in a state of stupor he went on a high speed drive around Moscow in an attempt to obtain drugs and alcohol – when many high-ranking people saw him. This increased the likelihood of him being forcibly admitted to hospital, and the consequent danger to the circle supplying his habit. As his state of health declined, and it became obvious that he may die, his associates gathered to decide what to do with him. They came up with no firm decision. They did not want him admitted officially, as his drug addiction would become public and they would fall under suspicion, although some of them admitted that any ordinary person in his condition would have been admitted immediately.|$|E

On March 27, 1851, the company of 50 to 60men reached {{what is now called}} Old Inspiration Point, from where Yosemite Valley's main features are visible. Chief Tenaya and his band were eventually captured and their village burned, fulfilling the prophecy an old and dying medicine man had given Tenaya many years before. The Ahwahnechee were escorted by their captor, Captain John Bowling, [...] to the Fresno River Reservation, and {{the battalion}} was disbanded on July 1, 1851. Life on the reservation was unpleasant and the Ahwahneechee longed for their valley. Reservation officials consented and allowed Tenaya and some of his band to <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own recognizance.|$|E

500|$|Early European landowners {{were eager}} to secure their {{investment}} in land in southwest Tennessee. Years before Randolph would be founded, wealthy and influential investors tried {{to find ways to}} get a <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> share of land. In 1818, Judge John Overton wrote to General James Winchester that [...] "We must not let the owners of the property on the Bluffs at the Mississippi above us be beforehand in laying off town—as it might damp the sale of ours". Overton and Winchester founded Memphis, Tennessee along with Andrew Jackson in 1819. Overton, Winchester and Jackson were trying to secure investments in property in the Memphis area that they owned and not give the advantage to investors [...] "above", north of Memphis on the Mississippi River, in Randolph. Andrew Jackson (1767–1845) would become the 7th President of the United States in 1829.|$|E
