5|$|Motivations for {{clitoral}} modification and mutilation vary. Those taking hormones {{or other}} medications {{as part of}} female-to-male transition usually experience dramatic clitoral growth; individual desires and the difficulties of phalloplasty (construction of a penis) often result in the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> the original genitalia with the enlarged clitoris as a penis analogue (metoidioplasty). However, the clitoris cannot reach {{the size of the}} penis through hormones. A surgery to add function to the clitoris, such as metoidioplasty, is an alternative to phalloplasty that permits <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> sexual sensation in the clitoris.|$|E
