50|$|Luis v. United States, 578 U.S. ___ (2016) {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the pre-trial <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> needed to retain a defendant's counsel of choice when those assets have not been used in {{conjunction}} with criminal activity.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the federal}} {{government}} has vastly increased its use of asset forfeiture, the seizure of property connected to illegal activities. As authorized under federal law, the government is also able to restrain assets prior to trial when the government belives those assets will ultimately be found to be forfeitable. This pretrial restraint potentially implicates the constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel for criminal defendants. In the upcoming Supreme Court case of Luis v. United States, the Court will address the question of whether a pretrial <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> which are not traceable to any illegal activity is permissible when those assets are needed to hire defense counsel. In this Commentary, the Author argues that the right to counsel of one’s own choosing is not unlimited and that pretrial restraint is necessary to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes...|$|E
40|$|In 1984 Congress {{amended the}} {{criminal}} forfeiture {{provisions of the}} RICO and CCE statutes. The Department of Justice has interpreted the amended laws {{to allow for the}} <b>restraint</b> and forfeiture <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> transferred by a defendant to defense counsel as compensation for legitimate legal services. This comment explores the legislative history of the amendments, as well as the constitutional and ethical concerns which arise under the Department 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation, to conclude that Congress did not intend bona fide attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees to be subject to the forfeiture provisions of the RICO and CCE statutes...|$|R
5000|$|Writing for a {{plurality}} of the Court, Justice Stephen Breyer held that [...] "the pretrial <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> legitimate, untainted <b>assets</b> needed to retain counsel of choice violates the Sixth Amendment". In an opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Clarence Thomas concluded that [...] "the Sixth Amendment prevents the Government from freezing untainted assets {{in order to secure}} a potential forfeiture". Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the plurality opinion and Justice Thomas's opinion both [...] "create perverse incentives and provide protection for defendants who spend stolen money rather than their own". Justice Elena Kagan also wrote a dissenting opinion in which she stated that [...] "I am not altogether convinced that ... the Government’s interest in recovering the proceeds of crime ought to trump the defendant’s (often highly consequential) right to retain counsel of choice", but ultimately concluded that United States v. Monsanto should control the outcome of the case because Luis never asked the Court to overrule Monsanto in her arguments before the Court.|$|R

In {{the case}} of merger either for monopoly or market dominance, a postmerger price equal to the premerger, competitive price is proved a reasonable possibility.

In cases where a postmerger price increase is optimal, asset salvageability is shown to have a restraining effect on {{the magnitude of the}} increase. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LLM) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} restraints in post-employment cases in England, South Africa and Germany. The {{attempt was made}} to compare the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine that was developed in England and is still used in the common law countries, on one the hand, and the German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade rules on the other. Therefore the development <b>of</b> the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine in England is described, as well as the modifications <b>of</b> the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine in South Africa. Also it is given an overview <b>of</b> the German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade rules. As far as the English and South African law is concerned, the historical developments and applicable principles <b>of</b> the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine are emphasised, whereas the main aim in the German part is to give an overview about the codified <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade rules. While comparing the common law doctrine and the German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade law it is emphasised that in the common law countries the reasonableness and public interest plays an important role, whereas in German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade law, on the other hand, the payment of compensation is an important matter.

One of eminent importance id the treatment <b>of</b> <b>restraints</b> <b>of</b> {{trade in the}} sport sector. The application <b>of</b> the <b>restraints</b> <b>of</b> trade rule to the sport sector is highly complicated and controversial.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article {{is to examine the}} {{relationship}} between a so-called "garden leave" clause and a post-termination <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade clause in employment contracts, in view of the decision in Vodacom (Pty) Ltd v Motsa 2016 3 SA 116 (LC). The Labour Court grappled with the question of whether the enforcement of the garden leave provision impacts on the enforcement <b>of</b> a post-termination <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade clause. Enforcement of both these types of clauses may be problematic. It can result in unfairness if an employee ends up being commercially inactive for a long period. The author argues that garden leave has a direct effect on the enforcement of a post- termination <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade clause. Accordingly, a <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade will be enforced only if the employer's proprietary interest requires additional protection beyond what is achieved under the garden leave clause...|$|R

50|$|Although general <b>restraints</b> <b>of</b> trade are unlawful, {{the court}} of the Queen's Bench, per Chief Justice Parker (Lord Macclesfield), held this <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade {{reasonable}} and therefore lawful. It was ancillary to a legitimate transaction (the rental or sale of the bakeshop business) and it was reasonably necessary to effectuate the main purpose. Its extent was limited to what was necessary to accomplish {{the main purpose of}} the transaction. If Reynolds reopened his bakery business, he would attract his old customers and deprive Mitchel of the benefit of his bargain with Reynolds, which included the goodwill of the business (i.e., the habit of the customers to continue to buy baked goods at the same location). Although a <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade without a good reason to support it is presumed unlawful, the court ruled, the presumption can be rebutted and overcome by facts such as those present here: the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade was necessary and ancillary to a lawful transaction.|$|R
