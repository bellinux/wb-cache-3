5000|$|T-94 ZSG (Ziviles Sportgewehr, [...] "Civilian Sport Rifle"): Turkish MP5 semi-automatic-only clone {{manufactured}} by MKE for the civilian European sport shooting market. The models available are the T-94P (HK94A2), T-94A (MP5A2), T-94K (MP5K), and T-94SD (MP5SD2). The T-94SD {{comes with a}} functioning integral silencer. The solid stocks are welded to the lower receiver to prevent the mounting of a retractable stock or <b>receiver</b> <b>cap.</b> The AT-94 series, designed for the American market, is modified so that full-auto and 90-series trigger packs cannot be fitted.|$|E
50|$|When the {{distillation}} is complete: {{the heat}} is removed, the vacuum connection is closed, and inert gas is purged through the distillation head and the distillate receiver. While under the inert gas purge, remove the distillate <b>receiver</b> and <b>cap</b> it with an air-tight <b>cap.</b> The distillate <b>receiver</b> can be stored under vacuum or under inert gas by using the side-arm on the distillation flask.|$|R
50|$|The Stoner 63 has {{a unique}} {{buffering}} system contained within the bolt carrier. In front of the carrier cap are a steel shim {{and a set of}} 27 saucer-shaped Belleville washers oriented in opposing sets of three, which absorb energy from the piston stroke by deforming into a flat plate when the bolt carrier strikes the <b>receiver’s</b> end <b>cap.</b> When the plates return to their original shape they release a pulse of strain energy which propels the reciprocating parts forward in counter-recoil with a speed only slightly below that of the original recoil velocity. The plates will function without failure for between 40,000 and 50,000 rounds (depending upon the type of ammunition used and cyclic rates employed). This feature was designed to extend the weapon’s service life.|$|R
50|$|The Hawkeyes {{rolled to}} 613 yards of total offense in a blowout win on Senior Day. Iowa raced to a 35-0 lead {{and never looked}} back in {{retaining}} Floyd of Rosedale. Running backs Damian Sims and Albert Young both rushed for more than 100 yards. Wide <b>receiver</b> Ed Hinkel <b>capped</b> his home career in grand style with four touchdown receptions, tying a school record and setting the Kinnick Stadium record. He finished the game with 151 yards on seven receptions.|$|R
5000|$|Pregame line: Florida -13 [...] As the Gators {{came into}} their annual rivalry game with Georgia, they were heavily favored. Florida scored {{on their first}} {{possession}} of the game, moving the ball very effectively with a blend of running and passing. Wide <b>receiver</b> Andre Caldwell <b>capped</b> off the drive with a 12-yard touchdown run off a reverse. Florida's defense, which had been touted {{as one of the}} best in the SEC, lived up to their billing, stifling the Georgia offense for the entire first half.|$|R
25|$|Improvised {{firearms}} are {{not solely}} {{the province of}} the criminal element. They are also used by insurgents. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II, the paliuntod, a type of improvised shotgun, was commonly used by guerrillas and the joint American and Filipino soldiers who remained behind after Douglas MacArthur's withdrawal. Made of two pieces of pipe that fit snugly together, the paliuntod was a simple, single shot open-bolt design. The shell was placed in the breech of the barrel, which was then fitted into the larger-diameter receiver. The <b>receiver</b> was <b>capped</b> at the breech end, and had a fixed firing pin placed to strike the primer of the shell. When the barrel was pulled sharply to the rear, the firing pin would strike the primer and fire the gun. These improvised firearms are still in use by both criminals and rebels in the Philippines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{determine}} the minimum meansquare error (MMSE) {{performance of a}} 2 –D carrierless AM/PM (<b>CAP)</b> <b>receiver</b> with an ideal (analog feedforward and infinitelength baud-spaced cross-connected) decision feedback equalizer (DFE), {{in the presence of}} data-like cross-talks. The MMSE at the slicer is firstly derived for a generic multi-dimensional CAP system with cross-connected DFEs. However, this result requires the explicit factorization of the channel spectral matrix. In the case of the standard 2 –D CAP line code, we are able to overcome this difficulty by exploiting the Hilbert transform-pair property of the shaping filters. I...|$|R
50|$|The MP5SD is {{produced}} exclusively by H&K in several versions: the MP5SD1 and MP5SD4 (both have a <b>receiver</b> end <b>cap</b> {{instead of a}} buttstock), MP5SD2 and MP5SD5 (equipped with a fixed synthetic buttstock) and the MP5SD3 and MP5SD6 (fitted with a collapsible metal stock). The MP5SD1, MP5SD2 and MP5SD3 use a standard 'SEF' trigger group (from the MP5A2 and MP5A3), while the MP5SD4, MP5SD5, and MP5SD6 use the 'Navy' trigger group—a trigger module with a mechanically limited 3-round burst mode and ambidextrous selector controls (from the MP5A4 and MP5A5). A suppressed version was produced for the U.S. Navy - designated the MP5SD-N, which is {{a version of the}} MP5SD3 with a retractable metal stock, front sight post with tritium-illuminated dot and a stainless steel suppressor. This model has a modified cocking handle support to account for the slightly larger outside diameter of the suppressor. The design of the suppressor allows the weapon to be fired with water inside, should water enter the device during operation in or near water.|$|R

40|$|Underground mines rely {{on alarm}} systems, such as stench gas, audible or visual alarms, pager phones, telephones, and {{messengers}} to warn miners {{of a fire}} or other emergency. These systems are often slow, unreliable, and limited in mine coverage. This report describes the evaluation of a wireless signaling and warning system for underground mines. This system is applicable to both coal and noncoal mines. The work was conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in cooperation with TeleMagnetic Signalling Systems (TSS) under Cooperative 3 Research and Development Agreement No. BOM-CRDA- 6200 - 0119. A TSS wireless ultra-low-frequency electromagnetic signaling system was installed at the Experimental Mine at Lake Lynn Laboratory near Fairchance, Fayette County, PA. A commercial smoke sensor was interfaced to a remote portable transmitter, and the alarm of the sensor was used to trigger the central evacuation and paging transmitter system during experimental mine fires. The underground/surface <b>receivers</b> flashed <b>cap</b> lamps and activated remote devices, such as strobe lights, within 30 to 40 s after the encoded signal was received.

50|$|The Stoner 63/63A LMG is an {{automatic}} weapon that fires {{from the open}} bolt and the trigger mechanism permits only fully automatic firing though burst size can be controlled by the shooter. The entire trigger unit has four trigger pins that give the unit its modularity. The front pin holds a flapper-type magazine catch/release (used in the Rifle/Carbine variants and the left-hand feed LMG with a 150-round drum-type belt container), a full dust cover (used with the top-feeding Automatic Rifle or vertically mounted ammo box on any belt-fed system) or a half size dust cover (used with the right-hand-feed bottom box carrier). The next two pins retain the timer and hammer, {{both of which are}} absent in the open bolt configurations. The final pin acts as the trigger’s axis shaft; the spring-loaded sear pivots on the selector lever’s axis pin. The selector is disconnected when firing from the open bolt and a sliding manual safety installed near the trigger guard disables the trigger when pushed to the rear. The rear portion of the trigger housing serves as a <b>receiver</b> end <b>cap</b> and is used to attach the shoulder stock. The black polycarbonate pistol grip is also attached to the trigger housing. The checkered grip is flared at the bottom to prevent the shooter’s hand from sliding off and has an internal storage compartment sealed by a hinged cover with a spring-loaded hatch.|$|R
40|$|The carrierless {{amplitude}} and phase (CAP) modulation is {{a promising}} candidate for visible light communication (VLC) {{because of its}} high frequency efficiency and low implementation complexity. However, the <b>CAP</b> <b>receiver</b> is highly sensitive to timing errors because of the bad eye diagram performance and requires a complex synchronisation circuit. In this study, the conventional CAP pulse is extended to a generalised CAP pulse. The zero inter-symbol interference (zero-ISI) and the zero cross-channel interference (zero-CCI) constraints are assumed for the generalised CAP pulses. Two new sets of wider eye opened two-dimensional (2 D) CAP pulses {{and a set of}} frequency efficient 3 D CAP pulses are proposed to meet the zero-ISI and zero-CCI constraints for VLC. Simulation results show that the proposed new 2 D CAP pulses are more tolerant to the timing offset than the existing CAP pulses in VLC systems, but the corresponding bit error rate performances are poorer when the accurate timing synchronisation is obtained. Moreover, the proposed new 3 D CAP pulses are more sensitive to the timing offset than the existing CAP pulses...|$|R
50|$|The Eagles {{jumped out}} to an early 10-0 lead in the 1st quarter, {{recovering}} from a quick turnover on their first possession. Philadelphia quarterback Donovan McNabb was sacked, losing {{the ball in the}} process. The loose ball was picked up by Denver's Darrell Reid. The Philadelphia defense was able to keep the Broncos from turning it into any points, forcing a punt, and scored on their next possession with a 2-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson. Soon after, David Akers' 39 yard field goal pushed the Eagles' lead to 10, closing the first quarter. Denver answered with an 11-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Kyle Orton to wide <b>receiver</b> Jabar Gaffney, <b>capping</b> off a 12 play, 70 yard drive on their very first possession of the second period. Up 10-7, the Eagles immediately responded on the following drive as Donovan McNabb hit his tight end Brent Celek for a 47-yard passing touchdown. The Eagles forced another punt, David Akers added 3 more points on his second field goal of the day, and the Eagles' halftime lead stood at 13.|$|R
40|$|Carrierless {{amplitude}} and phase (CAP) modulation {{is generally}} regarded as a bandwidth efficient two-dimensional (2 -D) passband line code. It {{is closely related to}} the pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes. CAP has been proposed for various digital subscriber loop (DSL) systems over unshielded twisted pairs of copper wires. In this thesis, our main focus is on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) performance of the ideal (i. e., infinite length) linear and non-linear (decision feedback) CAP receivers/equalisers in the presence of additive, coloured Gaussian noise, and/or data-like cross-talks. An in-depth analysis is given on the performance of both receiver structures. In the case of the linear receiver, one possible view of the overall CAP transceiver system which includes both data and cross-talk transmission paths {{is that it is a}} linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Accordingly, the existing MMSE results for a general MIMO system are applicable also to CAP systems. However, up to date, this approach was shown to be unsuccessful in the sense that the derived MMSE expressions are too complex and offer little insights. In our analysis, in order to find a more incisive MMSE expression, we reconsider the problem of minimisation of the MSEs at slicers. By exploiting the Hilbert transform pair relationship between the impulse responses of the inphase and quadrature transmit shaping filters, we are able to obtain an elegant and more meaningful MMSE expression, as well as the corresponding transfer functions of the optimum linear receive filters. In the case of the nonlinear, or decision feedback equaliser (DFE), receiver, we start our analysis with the receiver structure of a generic multidimensional (>/= 3) CAP-type system. This receiver consists of a bank of analog receive filters, the number of which equals the dimension of the CAP line code, and a matrix of cross-connected, infinite-length, baud-spaced feedback filters. It is shown that the optimum filters and the corresponding MMSE of the DFE receiver require the factorisation of a discrete-time channel spectral matrix. This mathematically intractable step can be avoided, however, when the DFE results are specialised to a standard 2 -D CAP system where we are able to again exploit the Hilbert transform pair relationship to derive a further and more useful MMSE expression. Three sets of numerical studies are given on the MMSE performance of the <b>CAP</b> <b>receivers.</b> In the first set of studies. we model the sum of all crosstalks as an additive, Gaussian noise source and select three test transmission channels over which we compare the MMSE performance of the linear and DFE receiver structures. In the second set of studies, we compare the performance of the two receiver structures, but in a data-like cross-talk environment. The results demonstrate the importance of NEXT equalisation in the design of <b>CAP</b> <b>receivers</b> operating in a NEXT dominant environment. In the final set of studies which follows from the second set of studies, we investigate the relationship between the MMSE performance of the DFE receiver and system parameters which include excess bandwidth, data rate, CAP scheme. and relative phase between the received signal and the NEXT signal. The results show that data-like cross-talks can be effectively suppressed by using a large excess bandwidth (alpha > 1 in the case of a RC transmit shaping filter) alone. The relative phase also affect; the receiver performance. but to a lesser degree. In addition to the MMSE performance analysis. implementation issues of an adaptive linear <b>CAP</b> <b>receiver</b> are also considered. We propose a novel linear receiver by appending two fixed analog filters to the front-end of the existing adaptive linear receiver using fractionally-spaced equalisers (FSE). We show that if the analog filters are matched to the transmit shaping filters, then inphase and quadrature finite-length FSEs in the proposed receiver have the same NINISE solution. We further propose a modified least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm which takes advantage of this feature. The convergence analysis of the proposed LMS algorithm is also given. We show that the modified LMS algorithm converges approximately twice as fast as the standard LMS algorithm, given the same misadjustment, or alternatively, it halves the misadjustment, given the same initial convergence rate...|$|R

Algorithmic concerns such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit-error rate (BER) along with VLSI constraints such as power dissipation, area, and speed, were addressed in a common framework. The first step is to obtain a thorough understanding of major channel impairments. For the LAN environment, these include near-end crosstalk (NEXT), intersymbol interference (ISI) and impulse noise. The broadband access environment suffers from far-end crosstalk (FEXT), ISI, radio-frequency interference (RFI), impulse noise and splitter losses. Measured characteristics of the channel are compared with analytical models. These are then employed {{in the design of the}} transmitter and receiver algorithms. The carrierless amplitude/phase (CAP) transmission scheme is presented as a practical bandwidth-efficient scheme for these applications. An adaptive fractionally-spaced linear equalizer (FSLE), employed in a <b>CAP</b> <b>receiver,</b> eliminates ISI, suppresses NEXT (in case of ATM-LAN) and FEXT (in case of broadband access) and provides robustness to timing jitter. However, fractional tap spacing in combination with the high-data rates results in a high sample rate adaptive computation. Fortunately, throughput enhancing techniques such as pipelining can be employed for high-speed and low-power operation. An hardware-efficient pipelined architecture for the adaptive FSLE equalizer is presented. This architecture has been developed via the technique of relaxed look-ahead, [...] ...|$|R
