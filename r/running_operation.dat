25|$|In April 1960, {{a review}} of minutes from the inquiry found {{inconsistencies}} and possibly a fraudulent document in Gibli's original testimony that seemed to support Lavon's account of events. During this time, it came to light that Elad (the Israeli agent <b>running</b> <b>Operation</b> Susannah in Egypt) had committed perjury during the original inquiry. Elad was also suspected of betraying the group to Egyptian authorities, though the charges were never proven. He was eventually sentenced to a jail term of 10 years for trying to sell Israeli documents to the Egyptians in an unrelated matter. Ben-Gurion scheduled closed hearings with a new board of inquiry chaired by Haim Cohn, a supreme court justice.|$|E
500|$|In 1946, the SBS, {{whether of}} Commando or SAS parentage, were disbanded. The {{functional}} title SBS {{was adopted by}} the Royal Marines. It became part of the school of Combined Operations under the command of [...] "Blondie" [...] Hasler. Their first missions were in Palestine (ordnance removal) and in Haifa (limpet mine removal from ships). The SBS went on to serve in the Korean War deployed on operations along the North Korean coast as well as operating behind enemy lines destroying lines of communication, installations and gathering intelligence. It was during the Korean War that the SBS first started operating from submarines. In 1952, SBS teams were held at combat readiness in Egypt in case Gamal Abdel Nasser's revolution turned more violent than it did. The SBS were also alerted during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and coup against King Idris I of Libya (1959), but in both cases they did not see action. In 1961, SBS teams carried out reconnaissance missions during the Indonesian Confrontation (see Operation Claret). In the same year, Iraq threatened to invade Kuwait for the first time, and the SBS put a detachment at Bahrain. In 1972, the SBS and SAS came into prominence when members of a combined SBS and SAS team parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean after a bomb threat on board the cruise liner [...] A thorough search of the ship found no evidence of any device drawing the conclusion that it was a hoax. The SBS conducted operations in Northern Ireland during The Troubles including with submarines. [...] In January 1975, two SBS kayak teams were inserted from HMS Cachalot to conduct an anti gun <b>running</b> <b>operation</b> in the area between Torr Head and Garron.|$|E

The ships left Gothenburg on 23 January 1941 and ran the German blockade of the Skagerrak. They narrowly avoided being intercepted by the two German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau who were just starting Operation Berlin in the Kattegat. The ships navigated the North Sea with various warships being dispatched from the UK to act as escorts. These escorts included HMS Naiad, HMS Aurora, HMS Edinburgh and HMS Birmingham and the destroyers HMS Escapade, HMS Echo, HMS Electra.

5000|$|The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine—General Command (PFLP-GC) was {{the first}} suspect, in light of a threat it issued against U.S. and Israeli {{interests}} before the bombing.

In his 1994 film The Maltese Double Cross, Allan Francovich suggested that rogue CIA agents were implicated in a plot that involved them turning a blind eye to a drug <b>running</b> <b>operation</b> in return for intelligence. Evidence presented at Megrahi's trial, together with concerns about the reliability of his conviction, spawned a theory that Libya was framed. Abu Nidal allegedly confessed to the bombing before his death, thereby triggering another theory, while Joe Vialls put forward his own explanation that relied on the bomb being detonated remotely. Finally, in December 2013, Patrick Haseldine suggested that the bombing was an assassination by South Africa's apartheid government of United Nations Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson.|$|E
