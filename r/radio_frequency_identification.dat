40|$|Existing {{methods for}} the {{management}} of multidimensional data typically do not scale well with an increased number of dimensions or require the unsupported augmentation of the kernel. However, the use of multidimensional data continues to grow in modern database applications, specifically in spatio-temporal databases. These systems produce vast volumes of multidimensional data, and as such, data is stored in commercial RDBMS. Therefore, the efficient management of such multidimensional data is crucial. Despite it being applicable to any multidimensional vector data, we consider <b>Radio</b> <b>Frequency</b> <b>Identifications</b> (RFID) systems in this work. Due to RFID's acceptance and rapid growth into new and complex applications, together with the fact that, as with commercial applications, its data is stored within commercial RDBMS, we have chosen RFID as a pertinent testbed. We show that its data can be represented as vectors in multidimensional space and that the VG-curve combined with Multidimensional Dynamic Clustering Primary Index, which can be integrated into commercial RDBMS, can be used to efficiently access such data. In an empirical study conducted on three, five and nine dimensional RFID data we show that the presented concept outperforms available off-the-shelf options with a fraction of the required space.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the integration of vehicular sensor network (VSN) technology, and crowd sensing leveraging pervasive sensors called onboard units (OBUs), like smartphones and <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>IDentifications</b> to provide sensing services, have attracted increasing attention from both industry and academy. Nowadays, existing vehicular sensing applications lack good mechanisms to improve the maximum achievable throughput and minimizing service time of participating sensing OBUs in vehicular sensor networks. To fill these gaps, in this paper, first, we introduce real imperfect link states to the calculation of Markov chains. Second, we incorporate the result of different link states for multiple types of vehicles with the calculations of uplink throughput and service time. Third, in order to accurately calculate the service time of an OBU, we introduce the steady state probability to calculate the exact time of a duration for back-off decrement, rather than using the traditional relative probability. Additionally, to our best knowledge, we first explore a multichannel scheduling strategy of uplink data access in a single roadside unit (RSU) by using a non-cooperative game in a RSU coverage region to maximize the uplink throughput and minimize service time under saturated and unsaturated traffic loads. To this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis and find the equilibrium point of the scheduling.

30|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to promote use of the RFID (<b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> of <b>identification)</b> system in {{exportation}} of eel from Taiwan to Japan. Eel culture has been one of the most important aquaculture sectors in Taiwan and most of the products (about 90 %) are exported to Japanese market. However, average production per farm is small and agencies are required to collect the eels for export. Eels also need to be graded at packing plants where there is a possibility of them getting mixed together. When an eel is found with drug residues, it is difficult to determine the farm where it was produced. Some farmers may take this as an opportunity to use drugs that are banned by the government. To solve the problem of use of prohibited drugs, the Taiwanese government take two responses. One is enforcement of two stages of inspection, and the other is accreditation of good aquaculture farms. Nevertheless, there are still some drawbacks of the two methods. Here, we suggest the adoption of the RFID system to establish traceability and prevent the use of drugs.|$|R

In particular, a mixed system for electromagnetic (EM) and thermal energy harvesting (EH), conceived for passive nodes of wireless sensor networks and <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (RF) <b>identification</b> tags, is described. The proposed system aims at increasing the effectiveness and {{the efficiency of the}} EH system by integrating an antenna and a rectifier with a thermo-electric generator (TEG) able to perform thermal EH. The energy provided by the thermal harvester is exploited twice: to increase the rectifier efficiency by providing a voltage usable to improve the bias condition of the rectifying diode, and to provide additional dc energy, harvested for free. Ultimately, a great efficiency improvement, especially at low incident RF power, has been observed. The design methodology and the EM performance of a quarter-wavelength patch antenna, integrated with the TEG are resumed. Then, a test campaign to evaluate the thermal EH performance has been carried out. Afterward, a rectifier with variable bias voltage, operating at the same frequency of the antenna, has been opportunely designed to exploit the harvested thermal energy to bias the diode. A measurement campaign has been then carried out to test the efficiency increment obtained and to validate the proposed solution...|$|R
