5000|$|The EU Commission {{released}} a fact sheet saying that [...] "once triggered, 50 cannot be unilaterally reversed. Notification {{is a point}} of no return. Article 50 does not provide for the unilateral withdrawal of notification." [...] Similarly, the European Parliament Brexit committee headed by Guy Verhofstadt has stated that [...] "a <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> Article 50 needs to be subject to conditions set by all EU27, so that it cannot be used as a procedural device or abused in an attempt to improve on the current terms of the United Kingdom’s membership".|$|R
5000|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Member States can rescind their {{declaration}} of withdrawal during the negotiation period when their country still is a Member of the European Union. The European Parliament's (EP) negotiating position is that EU treaties do not explicitly allow a member state to unilaterally halt its withdrawal although the issue is untested in court. The EP's resolution pointed to a concern that “A <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> needs {{to be subject to}} conditions set by all EU27 states so they cannot be used as a procedural device or abused in an attempt to improve the actual terms of the United Kingdom’s membership.” ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{an appeal}} to be admissible, amongst other requirements, notice of appeal must be filed at the EPO within two months <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the contested decision, and the fee for appeal must be paid. In addition, within four months <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the decision, a {{statement}} setting out the grounds of appeal (i.e., the appeal grounds) must be filed, which must contain the appellant's complete case. The appellant must also be adversely affected by the appealed decision. A party is only adversely affected by an appealed decision if {{the order of the}} appealed decision does not comply with its request (i.e. what the party requested during the first instance proceedings). For instance, when [...] "the order of the decision of the opposition division is the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the patent, an opponent who requested <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the patent in its entirety is not [...] "adversely affected by" [...] said decision... irrespective of the reasons given in the decision." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{provision}} {{allowing for}} <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> naturalisation {{as a consequence}} of residence abroad has been criticised as creating two classes of Liberian citizens and for reducing the capabilities of naturalised Liberians to pursue employment and educational opportunities abroad. The provision for the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> a minor's naturalisation following the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the father's naturalisation has been criticised as unfair to the child.|$|R
