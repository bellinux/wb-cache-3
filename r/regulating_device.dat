Each of these devices begins conducting at a specified voltage and will conduct as much current as required to hold its terminal voltage to that specified voltage by diverting excess current from a non-ideal power source to ground, often through a relatively low-value resistor to dissipate the excess energy. The power supply is designed to only supply a maximum amount of current that is within the safe operating capability of the shunt <b>regulating</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Series {{regulators}} {{are the more}} common form; they are more efficient than shunt designs. The series regulator works by providing a path from the supply voltage to the load through a variable resistance, usually a transistor (in this role it is usually termed the series pass transistor); {{it is in the}} [...] "top half" [...] of the voltage divider - the bottom half being the load. The power dissipated by the <b>regulating</b> <b>device</b> is equal to the power supply output current times the voltage drop in the <b>regulating</b> <b>device.</b> For efficiency and reduced stress on the pass transistor, designs try to minimize the voltage drop but not all circuits regulate well once the input (unregulated) voltage comes close to the required output voltage; those that do are termed Low Dropout regulators, A series regulator can usually only source (supply) current, unlike shunt regulators.|$|E
40|$|Voltage {{regulation}} in distribution systems is typically {{performed with the}} aid of multiple voltage <b>regulating</b> <b>devices,</b> such as on-load tap changer and step voltage regulators. These devices are conventionally tuned and locally coordinated using Volt/VAR optimization strategies in accordance with the time-graded operation. However, in case of distribution systems with distributed generation (DG), there could be a possibility of simultaneous responses of DG and multiple voltage regulators for correcting the target bus voltage, thereby resulting in operational conflicts. This paper proposes an online voltage control strategy for a realistic distribution system containing a synchronous machine-based renewable DG unit and other voltage <b>regulating</b> <b>devices.</b> The proposed strategy minimizes the operational conflicts by prioritizing the operations of different <b>regulating</b> <b>devices</b> while maximizing the voltage regulation support by the DG.

40|$|Nowadays, {{integration}} of small-scale electricity generators, known as Distributed Generation (DG), into distribution networks {{has become increasingly}} popular. This tendency together with the falling price of DG units has a great potential in giving the DG {{a better chance to}} participate in voltage regulation process, in parallel with other <b>regulating</b> <b>devices</b> already available in the distribution systems. The voltage control issue {{turns out to be a}} very challenging problem for distribution engineers, since existing control coordination schemes need to be reconsidered to take into account the DG operation. In this paper, a control coordination approach is proposed, which is able to utilize the ability of the DG as a voltage regulator, and at the same time minimize the interaction of DG with another DG or other active devices, such as On-load Tap Changing Transformer (OLTC). The proposed technique has been developed based on the concepts of protection principles (magnitude grading and time grading) for response coordination of DG and other <b>regulating</b> <b>devices</b> and uses Advanced Line Drop Compensators (ALDCs) for implementation. A distribution feeder with tap changing transformer and DG units has been extracted from a practical system to test the proposed control technique.

40|$|Voltage {{regulation}} {{by means}} of coordinated voltage control {{is one of the}} challenging aspects in an active distribution system operation. Integration of distributed generation (DG), which can also be operated in Volt/VAr control mode, may introduce adverse effects including control interactions, operational conflicts, steady-state voltage variations, and oscillations. Therefore, examining and analyzing the phenomenon (both steady state and dynamic) of the control interactions among multiple Volt/VAr support DG units and voltage <b>regulating</b> <b>devices</b> such as tap changers and capacitor banks would be essential for effective voltage control in active distribution systems. In this paper, the interactions among DG units and voltage <b>regulating</b> <b>devices</b> are identified using their simultaneous and nonsimultaneous responses through time-domain simulations.

40|$|The {{extensive}} city expanding North-west of Naples {{metropolitan area}} lies onto a territory that was formerly endowed with peculiar identities, {{related to the}} agricultural use of soils and landscape. At the time Giuseppe Samonà was studying the development dynamics of the extensive city, this area was characterized by the horizontal agricultural landscape, whose background was the morphological structure of the plain and its borders, marked by geographical landmarks. A territory where Samonà???s wish for dialectics between the aspiration to build and {{the preservation of the}} natural landscape could have been very fruitfully fulfilled. This, however, did not happen. Onto the agricultural layout and the reclamation system, new networks have been overlapped, which support major or minor self-referring urban fragments along with infrastructural lines on a large scale. Through the physical overlapping of textures and uses of the territory, the fundamental geographical roots of landscape can still be recognized. Starting from this recognition, project-sites have been identified. The design works onto the fine-tuning of <b>regulating</b> <b>devices,</b> meant as elements for the re-figuration of the territory to build public space.

50|$|In electronics, {{a linear}} {{regulator}} {{is a system}} used to maintain a steady voltage.

The <b>regulating</b> <b>device</b> is made to act like a variable resistor, continuously adjusting a voltage divider network to maintain a constant output voltage and continually dissipating the difference between the input and regulated voltages as waste heat. By contrast, a switching regulator uses an active device that switches on and off to maintain an average value of output. Because the regulated voltage of a linear regulator must always be lower than input voltage, efficiency is limited and the input voltage must be high enough to always allow the active device to drop some voltage.|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{simulation}} of water distribution systems using computer software {{appears to have}} reached a very mature level of practice. There {{does not appear to}} be many other improvements that can be made to the basic underlying solution algorithms. While this statement is mostly true, there still remains one area that results in problems when developing simulation models. In discussions with water distribution modeling practitioners, the most commonly mentioned remaining problem is stability of computers programs in the presence of pressure <b>regulating</b> <b>devices.</b> The three most common pressure <b>regulating</b> <b>devices</b> are pressure reducing valves, flow control valves and pressure sustaining valves. The difficulty in computer codes is that the status of the device is not known a priori. Consider a pressure reducing valve (PRV) — it may have one of three states. For the first state, the valve operates normally - such that the valve is in a partially closed or throttling position to maintain the set pressure on the downstream side of the valve. The second state occurs when the pressure downstream of the valve cannot be maintained and drops below the set pressure. In this case the valve moves to a fully open position. For the third state, the PRV acts as check valve. If there is more than one pressure regulating valve in a water distribution system then each device may be in one of three states. In computer codes, a guess is made to the status of each of the pressure <b>regulating</b> <b>devices</b> and the system is solved for to determine the flows and pressures. A check is then made to determine if the guesses of status are consistent with the results. If the assumed status of the device is inconsistent with the results the status is altered and the hydraulic solver is re-run. This paper demonstrates with a simple example that has a combination of a pressure reducing valve and a flow control valve that many commonly available commercial programs and Government programs cannot properly model even the simplest of systems.
