Since that time it consists of two parabolic antennae of 7 m and 5 m diameter separated by 100 m and a lab building containing the spectrometers and other electronics. For the first time, a fully digitized and <b>remotly</b> controlled receiver was used. Frequency-agile spectrometers were applied initially. Now digital filter banks and FFT (Fast Fourier transform) spectrometers are in operation. The initital frequency range of 100 - 1000 MHz was enlarged to 10 MHz - 5 GHz. This range is the largest for solar radio observations since 2005. Starting in 2014, the observatory is being converted to observe preferentially non-solar radiation of extragalactic and cosmological origin.|$|E

The coefficients of determination between estimated and measured concentrations are at least 0. 82 for such substances as starch and chlorophyll.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the actual structure and 'intensity of land cover is a fundamental information for the urban planning. Some aspects of the seeked information can be extracted from satellite imagery. This presentation gives some exemples over the Metropolitan area of Lisbon. First, an image segmentation is accomplished over an XS 3 band. This process leads to a rather valid subdivision of the region in morphological units. Secondly, the urban and vegetal categories, issued from a land cover classification, are modeled {{in the form of}} statistical surfaces. The statistical surfaces take advantage of the analytical power of a raster solving approach. Fi-nally, the urban and vegetal intensity surfaces are merged. The result can be considered as an attempt of ecozoning the considered region. The paper discuss also the possibilities of using <b>remotly</b> sensed data for urban planning...|$|E
40|$|The ever growing {{software}} complexity {{suggests that}} they will never be bugfree and therefore secure. Software compagnies regulary publish updates. But maybe {{because of lack of}} time or care or maybe because stopping application is annoying, such updates are rarely if ever deployed on users' machines. We propose an integrated tool allowing system administrators to deploy critical security updates on the fly on applications running <b>remotly</b> without end-user intervention. Our approach is based on an aspect weaving system, Arachne, that dynamicaly rewrites binary code. Hence updated applications are still running while they are updated. Our second tool Minerve integrates Arachne within the standart updating process: Minerve takes a patch produced by dif and eventually builds a dynamic patch that can later be woven to update the application on the fly. In addition, Minerve allows to consult patches translated in a dedicated language and hence eases auditing tasks...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, two {{different}} control technics for SMA actuators are presented {{depending on the}} nature of the robotic application. The first one based on a position feedback loop permits to control accurately the phalanx joint position for manipulation application. The second one is based on a temperature feedback loop to <b>remotly</b> steer an endoscope by a joystick. Their simplicity permits to integrate them in a micro-systems volume. 1. Introduction In recent years, Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuation has been considered in numerous proposals of micro-actuators. Its very attractive capacities in both tensile stress (up to 250 MPa) and motion (up to 6 % of its length) match the requirements of many microrobotic applications. Basically, SMA actuators exploit a phase transformation in the alloy, called martensite transformation, by heating and/or applying external stress. At high temperature, an SMA wire is basically elastic. At low temperature, in the martensite phase, it exhibits an elas [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Warsaw University is {{the largest}} Polish university, the second largest higher {{education}} institution in Poland. The university comprises 18 faculties and 24 inter-departamental units, {{and the number of}} students exceeds 58 thousand. It offers courses of studies in 33 fields of arts and sciences. In the last years the number of candidates applying each year for university places exceeded 40 thousand. The candidates come from various parts of Poland, many from cities laying in a long distance from War-saw. Until 1996 all admission activities were carried out locally by faculties. Then a central admission procedure (registration and assessment) with some computer-based support was devel-oped by the Faculty of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Mechanics. Other faculties were encouraged to join on volun-tary basis. Two years ago for the first time candidates could register <b>remotly</b> using a new web-based software application. This software has been used since then and improved every year. However it will soon have to undergo major revisions due to a new system of maturity examinations that is to be in-troduced starting from 2005, which will serve as a basis for the admission procedures used by higher education institutions in Poland. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the organizational and technical aspects of the computer based systems for students admission used in Warsaw University over the last decade and in particular describe requirements for the new system to be deployed in 2005, which may become a national standard in Poland...|$|E
40|$|The future SurfaceWater and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission {{would provide}} new cartographic {{measurements}} of ocean surface and inland water surfaces dynamics, and especially river height, width and slope. The highlight of SWOT will be its almost global coverage and temporal revisits {{on the order}} of 1 to 4 times per 22 - days repeat cycle [1]. The estimation of hydraulic parameters from water surface observations is still an open question. Several methods have recently been proposed for retrieving river discharge from SWOT data ([2, 3, 4]). The method introduced by [2] and {{used in the present study}} is based on Manning equation. The first step consists in retrieving an equivalent bathymetry profile for a river given one in situ depth measurement and SWOT like data of the water surface, that is to say water elevation, free surface slope and width. From this equivalent bathymetry, the second step consists in solving mass and Manning equation in the least square sense. Nevertheless, for cases where no in situ measurement of water depth is available, it is still possible to solve a system formed by mass and Manning equations in the least square sense (or with other methods such as Bayesian ones, see e. g. [3]). The approach is tested with synthetic data generated from hydraulic models for several river reaches around the world (cf. [5]). We show that a good a priori knowledge of bathymetry and roughness is required for such methods. The identifiability of the roughness geometry couple is also investigated for different space time sampling and hydraulic regimes. Indeed, the knowledge of effective hydraulic representation and limitations might be a cornerstone in identifications of hydraulic or hydrologic variables through data assimilation chains.

Defesa: Curitiba, 23 / 03 / 2017 Inclui referências : f. 46 - 49 Resumo: Os aplicativos e dispositivos móveis têm sido cada vez mais utilizados no monitoramento dos cuidados com a saúde, como no acompanhamento de atividades físicas. Em 2016, cerca de 7 milhões de pessoas foram monitoradas remotamente por meio de dispositivos e aplicações médicas. Isso é possível, com o auxílio das redes e tecnologias sem fio, as quais oferecem mobilidade aos usuários. Precisamente, graças às redes corporais sem fio (WBANs) que possibilitam monitorar continuamente a saúde dos pacientes, e com isso, identificar as doenças em seus estágios iniciais. A Organização Mundial de Saúde aponta que quanto antes detectado os eventos críticos, como ataques cardíacos e paradas respiratórias, e transmitidos os alertas médicos sobre esses eventos para os centros hospitalares, maiores são as chances de prevenir os pacientes de futuras implicações. Porém, as redes sem fio apresentam limitações na comunicação, sendo vulneráveis a interferências e perdas. Sendo que perda de dados vitais pode acarretar em sérias consequências na vida dos pacientes. As soluções existentes para mitigar essas limitações em redes WBANs e redes locais sem fio (WLANs) ora se preocupam com a detecção de eventos críticos, ora com a transmissão prioritária de alertas médicos, sendo inexistentes soluções abordando os dois aspectos juntos. Além do mais, os métodos da {{literatura}} detectam os eventos críticos na saúde quando estes já estão em progresso e delimitam-se a limiares particulares dos sinais vitais. Apesar das WBANs oferecerem tratamentos prioritários para a transmissão dos alertas médicos, ainda se encontram lacunas no seu envio até o destino final. Desta forma, a identificação antecipada de eventos críticos na saúde dos pacientes atinge seu ápice quando associada à entrega imediata dos alertas aos profissionais da saúde. Visto que não adianta identificar um evento crítico se não for capaz de alertar os médicos a tempo de tomar ações de precaução. Diante disso, este trabalho apresenta SANTE (do inglês, System for Anticipated identificatioN and Transmission of mEdical alerts on WBAN/WLAN), o primeiro sistema de identificação antecipada e transmissão prioritária de alertas médicos no contexto híbrido WBAN/WLAN. Particularmente, SANTE prediz tendências sobre a iminência de eventos críticos no comportamento dos sinais vitais por meio de um conjunto de indicadores estatísticos genéricos. Uma vez identificadas essas tendências, SANTE gera alertas médicos que recebem o maior nível de prioridade para transmissão e oferece prioridade de acesso ao meio através da redução da janela de contenção e intervalo AIFS na WLAN. A avaliação de desempenho do sistema SANTE, por meio de análises estatísticas e experimentos de simulação em ambientes de redes, mostra que os indicadores genéricos podem indicar a iminência de eventos críticos em sinais vitais reais. Também, os resultados apontam que SANTE, mesmo em um cenário denso, apresenta uma redução média de 39 % na latência de transmissão dos alertas sem prejudicar os outros tipos de tráfego presentes no meio sem fio, como voz e vídeo.

Abstract: Applications {{and mobile}} devices have been increasingly {{used to monitor}} health care, such as physical activity monitoring. In 2016, about 7 millions of people were monitored <b>remotly</b> by medical devices and applications. This is possible {{with the aid of}} the wireless networks and technologies, which provide mobility to the user. Precisely, thanks to wireless body area networks (WBANs), which allow monitoring continuously the patients' health and with this, identify diseases in their early stages. World Health Organization points out that the sooner detected critical events, such as heart attacks and respiratory arrest, and transmited the medical alerts about these events to the hospital, greater are the chances of preventing patients from future implications. Nevertheless, wireless networks suffer from communication constraints, being vulnerable to interferences and losses. Once loss of vital data can result in serious consequences in patients' life. The existing solutions to mitigate these limitations in WBANs and WLANs are either concerned with the detection of critical events or with the priority on medical alerts transmission, being inexistent solutions addressing jointly both aspects. Moreover, literature methods detect the critical events when they are already in progress and are limited to particular thresholds of vital signs. Although WBANs offer priority treatments for the medical alerts transmission, there are still gaps in their delivery to the final destination. In this way, the anticipated identification of critical events in patients' health reaches its paramount importance when associated to the urgent delivery of the alerts to healthcare professionals. Since, there is no use identifying a critical event if you are not able to alert doctors in time to take precaution measures. Therefore, this work presents SANTE, the first System for Anticipated identificatioN and Transmission of mEdical alerts on WBAN/WLAN. Particularly, the system foresees trends about the imminence of critical events on patients' vital signs through a set of generic statistical indicators. When these trends are identified, SANTE generates medical alerts. It assigns the highest level of priority to these alerts and offers priority on medium access by reducing contention window and AIFS range on the WLAN. The performance evaluation of SANTE, through of statistical analysis and simulation experiments in networks environments, shows that generic indicators can indicate the imminence of critical events in real vital signs. Also, the results shows that SANTE, even in a dense scenario, present an average reduction of 39 % in the medical alerts transmission latency without affect the other types of traffic present in the wireless environment, such as voice and video.
