40|$|An interneurone, the S cell in {{the central}} nervous system of the leech, regenerates its severed axon and forms an {{electrical}} synapse with its target, another S cell, entirely within the ensheathment of two glial cells. After the two glial cells were killed selectively by intracellular injection of protease, axonal regeneration and synapse formation occurred in a normal fashion during the month following nerve injury. Soon after <b>reconnexion</b> of S cells, the conduction of impulses across the non-rectifying electrical junction between the cells was more reliable from the target than into it from the thinner regenerating axon. The distal segments of severed S-cell axons survived for weeks or months after destruction of their glial cells, indicating that the ensheathing glia is not required for long-term survival of axon segments. The distal axon segment of the S cell remained connected to the target axon at the normal region of synapse midway between ganglia within the nerve cord. In about half the cases in which <b>reconnexion</b> between injured S cell and target S cell occurred between 10 and 25 days following nerve crush, the regenerating neurone had formed an electrical synapse with its severed distal axon and had thereby become reconnected, indirectly, with its target. In the other cases, <b>reconnexion</b> was by direct contact. By 4 weeks, the proportion of injured S cells that were coupled and making direct contact with their targets rose to more than 80 % of the total population, indicating that regeneration continued until the two S cells contacted one another directly. This is similar to the course of S-cell regeneration {{in the presence of the}} ensheathing glia. Microscopy of the regenerating neurone and both its distal axon segment and its target showed that the site of synapse formation in the absence of the usual glial sheath was normal. Fluorescence microscopy following intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow dye, which crosses between S cells at the electrical synapse, showed that the regenerated synapse formed specifically between S cells. Moreover, the target did not form alternative synapses when regeneration failed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a general {{overview of the}} practical applicability of non-linear potential flow solvers for water wave propagation. Those numerical models are unable to describe explicitly the wave breaking phenomena, including free surface <b>reconnexion,</b> energy dissipation, etc. This reduces their range of application in real sea waves, which are in the most general context irregular and directional wave fields. This study covers the influence of discretization, water depth, directional spreading and spectral peakedness on the limitations {{in the use of}} such non-linear potential models. The approach at use relies on a highly non-linear model based on the High-Order Spectral method...|$|E
40|$|We {{review and}} assess the {{importance}} of processes thought to drive ionospheric outflows, linking them as appropriate to the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field, and to the spatial and temporal distribution of their magnetospheric internal responses. These begin with the diffuse effects of photoionization and thermal equilibrium of the ionospheric topside, enhancing Jeans' escape, with ambipolar diffusion and acceleration. Auroral outflows begin with dayside <b>reconnexion</b> and resultant field-aligned currents and driven convection. These produce plasmaspheric plumes, collisional heating and wave-particle interactions, centrifugal acceleration, and auroral acceleration by parallel electric fields, including enhanced ambipolar fields from electron heating by precipitating particles. Observations and simulations show that solar wind energy dissipation into the atmosphere is concentrated by the geomagnetic field into auroral regions with an amplification factor of 10 - 100, enhancing heavy species plasma and gas escape from gravity, and providing more current carrying capacity. Internal plasmas thus enable electromagnetic driving via coupling to the plasma, neutral gas and by extension, the entire body " We assess the Importance {{of each of these}} processes in terms of local escape flux production as well as global outflow, and suggest methods for their implementation within multispecies global simulation codes. We complete 'he survey with an assessment of outstanding obstacles to this objective...|$|E

40|$|Ionospheric {{outflows}} {{are directly}} responsive to solar wind disturbances, {{particularly in the}} dayside auroral cusp or cleft regions. Inputs of both electromagnetic energy (Poynting flux) and kinetic energy (particle precipitation) are closely correlated with these outflows.
