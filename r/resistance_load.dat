Solar cells have a complex relationship between solar irradiation, temperature and total resistance that produces a non-linear output efficiency known as the I-V curve.

50|$|The {{higher the}} voltage {{the higher the}} power {{consumption}} {{in the case of}} a pure <b>resistance</b> <b>load.</b> A reduction in voltage does not affect the energy used by the domestic appliances which use resistive loads except in devices such as kettles and toasters which will take longer to do their job due to atmospheric losses. The main commercial benefit when installing VO units, is on inductive loads, like motors which run pumps, fans and the like. In the home, the potential energy saving can be up to 12% on electricity bills. A VO device will lower the voltage to the most efficient level to maximise the savings on electricity consumption, so you may notice certain things taking a little longer, such as a kettle may take a little longer to boil.|$|E

5000|$|EMG, or electromyography, {{amplitude}} is {{the measure}} of the electric potential of motor units. Maximum EMG amplitude is more commonly referred to as maximum neuronal output. Studies have shown that maximum EMG amplitude increases with continual resistance training. These increases can range from minuscule to as much as a 50 percent increase after as little as a one-month training period. On average, {{at the end of a}} one-month period of consistent and repetitive resistance training, EMG amplitude reaches a plateau. Further increases in amplitude after this one-month period occur if the training regimen is varied. [...] This plateau effect is assumed to occur as a result of sufficient neuronal adaptation to the <b>resistance</b> <b>load.</b> Variance in load or repetition causes the neuron to increase its output, and therefore EMG amplitude, to allow for increased muscular force of contraction after this plateau occurs.|$|E

40|$|Studies in arm motor {{adaptation}} {{suggest that}} introducing small errors during the adaptation period {{may lead to}} a longer retention of the aftereffect than introducing large errors. However, it is unclear whether this notion can be generalized to locomotor adaptation in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). We hypothesized that a smaller error size may lead to longer retention of the aftereffect in patients with SCI. We recruited 12 subjects with incomplete SCI for this study. They were instructed to walk on a treadmill while light-, medium-, and heavy-resistance loads were applied to the right ankle to perturb leg swing. Each of the three resistance-load conditions were specific to the subject and determined by each subject's maximum voluntary contraction of the hip flexors. We observed that subjects tended to make larger errors when the resistance-load condition was greater. Following <b>resistance</b> <b>load</b> release, subjects showed an aftereffect consisting of an increase in stride length.
