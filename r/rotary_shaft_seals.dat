40|$|The use of <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> made of PTFE {{material}} is ever increasing in the sealing of moving machine elements {{as a consequence}} of their high thermal and chemical resistance. Primarily in the sector of pressure-loadable <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals,</b> there is a high development demand. High circumferential velocity and high pressure of the liquid to be sealed make the use of elastomer seals impossible. A promising alternative is presented by PTFE <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals.</b> The relieved rotary shaft lip seal represents a special design among PTFE <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals.</b> Not relying on thermal resistance of the PTFE material alone, the relieved rotary shaft seal as far as possible reduces the heat generating frictional moment for the permissible pressure range of the liquid to be sealed. Besides a high relative velocity at the sealing edge, thus, at the same time, high pressure of the liquid to be sealed is possible. Within the scope of this report, a contribution was made to the optimization of the relieved rotary shaft seal. Earlier designs of the relieved rotary shaft seal, similar to other commercially available <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals,</b> sometimes exhibited temporary surge-like leakages, the cause of which is the thermal expansion of the PTFE material. This was remedied by a functional analysis of the sealing system, experimental investigations, and by the use of FE simulations. In this way, the plastic memory effect, the temperature-dependent re-deformation capability of pre-deformed workpieces, proved to be a helpful measure against thermal expansion. (orig.

Starting {{from the general}} model, special {{attention is paid to}} field-surface and flow-surface interactions. Since in some situations these feedback interactions can be partly or even fully neglected, simpler models can be derived. The application of such models to the numerical simulation of dissipative systems, <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals,</b> equilibrium shapes of ferrofluid drops, and pattern formulation in the normal-field instability of ferrofluid layers is given.

40|$|In {{practice}} <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> {{will experience}} a small-amplitude dynamic excitation. It is shown that under periodic excitation circumferentially nonuniform clearances develop due to viscous seal material behaviour. The nearby fluid will fill these gaps, so entrainment and squeeze effects can develop fluid pressures, which are sufficiently high {{to overcome the}} radial preload. Viscous seal properties are essential {{in this type of}} EHD lubrication. Hence it is designated viscoelastohydrodynamic (VEHD) lubrication. At present, this lubrication concept is the only macrohydrodynamic theory that explains the existence of a consistent circumferentially nonuniform film geometry of appreciable dimensions. Moreover, calculated values of film thickness and friction are in agreement with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} test of two <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> variants of {{a gear pump}} is presented. The test parameters are chosen in a way, that differences on dynamical qualities {{as well as on}} wear behaviour can be judged. Two different tests have been performed. At the first test, severe test conditions have been set, partly based on the material limits, {{in order to reduce the}} test time. At the second test the test parameters are closer to the actual practical conditions. The results are discussed and further assessment criterions are set. The tests show that an unequivocal decision can be taken in favour of a variant. The bench test shows to be a suitable method for comparing two different rotary shaft seal variants. For these tests, the existence of a comparison seal is important, so that for a new construction the test can only be used as a complement...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} a thin, {{incompressible}} Newtonian fluid layer trapped between two almost parallel, sliding surfaces has been actively pursued in the last decades. This subject includes lubrication applications such as slider bearings or the sealing of non-pressurized fluids with rubber <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals.</b> In the present work we analyze numerically the flow of lubricant fluid through a micro-gap of sealing devices. The first stage {{of this study is}} carried out assuming that a 'small-gap' parameter delta attains an extreme value in the Navier-Stokes equations. The precise meaning of small-gap is achieved by the particular limit delta = 0 which, within the bounds of the hypotheses, predicts transport of lubricant through the sealed area by centrifugal instabilities. Numerical results obtained with the penalty function approximation in the finite element method are presented. In particular, the influence of inflow and outflow boundary conditions, and their impact in the simulated flow, are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hydrodynamic {{seal ring}} {{is based on}} the {{hydrodynamic}} effect of <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seal,</b> Kalsi sealing ring is the typical type of products, and the design of sealing lip adopts unique waveform structure. Based on geometry analysis of the sealing ring, the 3 D model of the ring was established by using SolidWorks software, and then the model was introduced into finite element software ANSYS, which was used to analyse stress for the Kalsi of rubber sealing ring. Through the analysis of the stress of rubber ring, the position of the maximum stress value of the rubber seal in hydrodynamic pressure was wave crest (valley) in the edge of the wave side. When the pressure of seal was 10 MPa, the maximum value of stress of rubber sealing was up to 6. 54 MPa...|$|R
40|$|Dr. Salant {{has made}} a bold attempt towards {{understanding}} the pumping mechanism of <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>seals.</b> By postulating an empirical film height within the gap, he bypasses the dif-ficulties of elastohydrodynamic modeling and, by means of rigid bearing analysis for the very particular film height he considers, he {{comes up with a}} bearing where side leakage decreases with increasing speed until a certain speed is reached where side leakage becomes zero. I am not an expert in cav-itation boundary conditions, but that such strong cavitation can occur {{on one side of the}} seal even when the other side of the seal is under a pressure of 0. 1 MPa (equal to a head of oil of 10 m!) is to me remarkable. My first question is, since less than one percent of all lip seals are under pressure, why is this pressure in the model? Second, if such pressure is absent, will cavitation occur on both sides of the seal, which has only...|$|E

Three self acting bearing configurations, designed to supply load support at the interface of the stationary carbon seal and rotating seal race, were tested. Two configurations, the shrouded taper and shrouded flat step, were incorporated {{on the face of}} the stationary carbon seal element. The third configuration, inward pumping spiral grooves, was incorporated on the hard faced surface of the rotating seal race. Test results demonstrated seal leakage air flow rates from 75 to 95 % lower that can be achieved with best state-of-the-art labyrinth designs and led to identification of the need for a more geometrically stable seal design configuration which is presently being manufactured for subsequent test evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) {{nanoparticles}} are {{objects of}} intense research activities {{due to their}} broad range of applications covering technological, medical, and environmental applications. They are used e. g. for <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing,</b> oscillation damping, position sensing, magnetic inks for jet printing, as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging, and to remove heavy metals from wastewater. In addition, magnetite is a half-metal with a predicted negative spin polarisation making magnetite interesting for spintronics. For all applications, a high quality of magnetite is crucial to obtain the desired properties. In this work, we studied {{the influence of the}} surface on the electronic and magnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles by means of x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and its associated magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). In particular, we investigated ensembles of magnetite nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 3 nm, 6 nm or 9 nm and the influence of capping the particles with a 3 nm thick silica shell or organic ligands. XANES and XMCD gives the unique possibility to distinguish between the three different Fe species in magnetite, i. e. tetrahedrally coordinated Fe 3 + ions, octahedrally coordinated Fe 3 +, and octahedrally coordinated Fe 2 +, by using different photon energies for hysteresis measurements. Besides changes in the electronic structure, i. e. in the density of unoccupied 3 d states monitored by XANES, and the effective spin magnetic moments, we obtained a different spin canting behaviour of Fe ions in magnetite at different lattice sites from the magnetic field dependent XMCD as shown in the figure below. The results are discussed regarding different exchange mechanisms and possible advantages and drawbacks for applications.

First problem {{they found a}} {{solution}} for {{was related to the}} manufacture of semiconductor "chips" for use in electronic systems.

Magnetic field confines the ferrofluid in the regions between the stationary elements and the <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> of the <b>seal.</b> Result is a series of liquid barriers that totally bar passage of contaminants. Seal is virtually wear-proof and has a lifetime measured in billions of shaft revolutions. It has reduced maintenance, minimizes "downtime" of production equipment, and reduces the cost of expensive materials that had previously been lost through seal failures. Products based on ferrofluid are exclusion seals for computer disc drives and inertia dampers for stepper motors. Uses are performance-improving, failure-reducing coolants for hi-fi loudspeakers.
