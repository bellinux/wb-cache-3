5000|$|Ideally, a car {{traveling}} {{at a constant}} velocity on level ground in a vacuum with frictionless wheels could travel at any speed without consuming any energy beyond {{what is needed to}} get the car up to speed. Less ideally, any vehicle must expend energy on overcoming <b>road</b> <b>load</b> forces, which consist of aerodynamic drag, tire rolling resistance, and inertial energy that is lost when the vehicle is decelerated by friction brakes. With ideal regenerative braking, the inertial energy could be completely recovered, but there are few options for reducing aerodynamic drag or rolling resistance other than optimizing the vehicle's shape and the tire design. <b>Road</b> <b>load</b> energy, or the energy demanded at the wheels, can be calculated by evaluating the vehicle equation of motion over a specific driving cycle. The vehicle powertrain must then provide this minimum energy in order to move the vehicle, and will lose a large amount of additional energy in the process of converting fuel energy into work and transmitting it to the wheels. Overall, the sources of energy loss in moving a vehicle may be summarized as follows: ...|$|E

Based on analysis of AMT motion and force, the measuring points of <b>road</b> <b>load</b> spectrum are determined, and the accelerometers and strain gauges are installed. Then the <b>road</b> <b>load</b> spectrum of AMT actuating mechanism is collected on Xiangfan Automobile Proving Ground according to related standards. At the same time the acquired <b>road</b> <b>load</b> {{spectrum is}} analyzed, such as pretreatment, repeatability checking and statistical analysis. The results indicate that the acquired <b>road</b> <b>load</b> spectrum is well reliable and repeatable, which provides effective basic data for design, analysis and verification of AMT actuating mechanism...|$|E

[...] There were a substantial number of depots that were not on the pipeline network. In the 1970s most of these were closed down. In the 1980s it was decided by the government that large scale strategic storage of petroleum as a civil reserve was no longer required. The salt cavities and some of the storage depots previously used for civil reserve storage were either closed or leased commercially.|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the fuel economy and emissions {{of a vehicle}} using a chassis dynamometer, the load to which the vehicle is subjected when it actually runs on a road, or the <b>road</b> <b>load</b> specifications, must be simulated when the dynamometer is applied. The most commonly used method to measure <b>road</b> <b>load</b> specifications is coastdown testing. Currently, <b>road</b> <b>load</b> is measured and provided by the manufacturer of the vehicle. Verification of {{the accuracy of the}} manufacturer’s reported <b>road</b> <b>load</b> specifications by a third party may reveal that the specifications are inaccurate, possibly because of different testing locations, test drivers or test equipment.

40|$|Vehicle {{durability}} {{assessment in}} {{the automotive industry}} requires a good knowledge of the <b>road</b> <b>load</b> input the vehicle will experience while in service. This research explores the approach of artificial intelligence for predicting the <b>road</b> <b>load</b> input for <b>road</b> <b>load</b> simulation in the CAE environment prior {{to the development of}} a vehicle prototype. The multi-body dynamics (MBD) simulation of a quarter vehicle test rig, built with the specification of a commercial SUV, and the full vehicle of the same SUV were modelled and validated in SIMPACK using a simple tyre model developed using the tri-axial tyre test rig at the University of Birmingham. The models were used to carry out a <b>road</b> <b>load</b> data characterisation based on the variation in vehicle parameters. An artificial road input tool (ARIT) based on an optimised NARX artificial neural network architecture was developed to predict the road input for variants of vehicle for a particular vehicle behaviour over a road event. The results of the ARIT were used to run MBD simulations and compared with those from drive file iteration. The results of this research show a successful method of artificial intelligence for the generation of <b>road</b> <b>load</b> data from CAE simulations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study firstly {{conducted}} measurement of load history profiles at brake guide pins using strain gages subject to random <b>road</b> <b>load</b> history obtained from vehicle durability tests. Then, this study developed a {{simple mathematical model}} capable of estimating guide pin load history using the principle of energy conservation for a given <b>road</b> <b>load</b> profile. The model took into account the effect of impact that occurs {{from a range of}} acceleration levels and frequency content of the road input. The mathematical model also utilized the measured stiffness of the guide pin specimens and strain versus load relationship to increase the accuracy of the predictions. The estimated loads at a brake guide pin subject to a given random <b>road</b> <b>load</b> history were then computed using the mathematical model and compared to the load history obtained from the measurement. This study also compared cumulative fatigue damages calculated using Smith-Watson-Topper equation with the measured and predicted load profiles at the guide pin. The comparison study showed that the developed simple model is applicable to predict load profiles for fatigue life calculation at brake guide pins...|$|E

Tests were conducted on a local subcompact car to measure engine speed, throttle position and air fuel ratio while Global Positioning Systems (GPS) recorded data of the vehicle speed and position. Also, dynamometer testing was done to reflect the vehicle characteristics. The results of on the road roll down test and cruising test were combined to get the <b>road</b> <b>load</b> characteristics of the vehicle.

40|$|A {{special-purpose}} dynamometer, the <b>road</b> <b>load</b> simulator (RLS), {{is being}} used at NASA's Lewis Research Center to test and evaluate electric vehicle propulsion systems developed under DOE's Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Program. To improve correlation between system tests on the RLS and track tests, similar tests were conducted on the same propulsion system on the RLS and on a test track. These tests are compared in this report. Battery current to maintain a constant vehicle speed with a fixed throttle {{was used for the}} comparison. Scatter in the data was greater in the track test results. This is attributable to variations in tire rolling resistance and wind effects in the track data. It also appeared that the RLS <b>road</b> <b>load,</b> determined by coastdown tests on the track, was lower than that of the vehicle on the track. These differences may be due to differences in tire temperature...|$|E

40|$|On {{one hand}} {{automotive}} manufacturers {{are trying to}} reduce product development times, while {{on the other hand}} they are aiming to bring more products to the market. Since safely and reliability must always be guaranteed, they use CAE to achieve this. For calculating <b>road</b> <b>loads</b> accurately, the tire and road model are key components of the CAE model. TNO has developed the MF-Swift tire model, which is a Magic Formula based rigid ring model. In combination with its enveloping model, MF-Swift can be used to simulate the tire dynamic response to arbitrary road unevenness. MF-Swift is aimed to be an all-encompassing tire model {{that can be used for}} handling, ride comfort and durability applications. Since it is based on Pacejka's Magic Formula, its application for handling events is well-known. Recently the OpenCRG road format has been released which makes it possible to describe large pieces of digitized 3 D road surfaces in a uniform and efficient way. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the combination of the MF-Swift tire model and the OpenCRG road format can be used to accurately simulate <b>road</b> <b>loads</b> for typical durability events, showing that the rigid ring model concept is an alternative to much more complex flexible ring models, while maintaining the advantages of using Pacejka's Magic Formula for describing the slip forces. © 2011 SAE International...|$|R
40|$|Real-world CO 2 {{emissions}} of passenger cars very often deviate from the Type Approval value. The Type Approval value for CO 2 {{emissions of}} passenger cars {{is based on}} a chassis dynamometer test in a laboratory. The total vehicle resistance of a vehicle, or 'road load', is simulated on the chassis dynamometer to obtain representative emissions. The <b>road</b> <b>load</b> of a vehicle is determined by means of a coast down test. As a large number of parameters and external conditions influence the coast down test, the Type Approval procedures for performing the coast down test allow for certain margins within which certain test parameters should lie. These margins can partly explain the difference between the real-world and Type Approval CO 2 emissions. TNO investigated the effect of variations in test parameters during the execution of a coast down test on the vehicle’s <b>road</b> <b>load</b> by performing a series of coast down measurements.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a technique to}} identify the important features in fatigue <b>road</b> <b>load</b> data that cause {{the majority of the}} total damage. Fatigue damaging events, called bumps, are extracted from the original <b>road</b> <b>load</b> time history using a wavelet-based algorithm, called Wavelet Bump Extraction (WBE). WBE can be used to produce a mission signal that retains most of the fatigue damage whilst preserving the cycle sequences. Bumps are identified from characteristics frequency bands by means of the orthogonal wavelet transform based on 12 th order of Daubechies wavelet functions. The bump identification process has been evaluated by analysing two variable amplitude fatigue loadings with WBE in which both data sets were measured on a road vehicle suspension arm. In this study the total damage caused by the combination of all bump events was close to the original data sets. The findings suggest that WBE is a suitable approach for mission synthesis applications by producing a shortened mission signal for accelerated fatigue test...|$|E
