50|$|The {{covenant}} may {{be shown}} in the deed and should be disclosed to prospective purchasers; {{it may also be}} recorded, {{or in the case of}} Commonwealth countries shown in Torrens title. <b>Real</b> <b>covenants</b> and easements or equitable servitudes are similar and in 1986, a symposium discussed whether the law of easements, equitable servitudes, and <b>real</b> <b>covenants</b> should be unified. As time passes and the original promisee of the covenant is no longer involved in the land, enforcement may become lax.|$|R
5000|$|A {{covenant}} {{is a type}} {{of contract}} in which the covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to do (affirmative covenant) or not do some action (negative <b>covenant).</b> In <b>real</b> property law, the term <b>real</b> <b>covenants</b> is used for conditions tied to the use of land. A [...] "covenant running with the land", also imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to easements and equitable servitudes, leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified; the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes. <b>Real</b> <b>covenant</b> law in the United States has been referred to as an [...] "unspeakable quagmire" [...] by one court.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} stated {{as a fundamental}} requirement of a <b>real</b> <b>covenant</b> or covenant 2 ̆ 2 running with the land 2 ̆ 2 that there must exist 2 ̆ 2 privity of estate. 2 ̆ 2 An examination {{of the nature of}} such a requirement [...] a problem which has troubled many of the great legal scholars [...] has much of interest to the legal student not merely because the authorities are in confusion and discord but especially because it is apparent that here the courts in defining an expression of some degree of antiquity in the law are powerfully influenced by modern and diverse views of public policy towards encumbrances on real estate titles. In certain jurisdictions a policy against such encumbrances is so strongly felt that except as to covenants in leases the obligations of all covenants are in general unenforceable except against the original covenantors. In the majority of jurisdictions in this country, however, covenants may run with the land, but only if there exists privity of estate as defined by the local law...|$|R
2500|$|An {{easement}} is a non-possessory {{right to}} use and/or enter onto the real property of another without possessing it. It is [...] "best typified in {{the right of way}} which one landowner, A, may enjoy over the land of another, B". It is similar to <b>real</b> <b>covenants</b> and equitable servitudes; in the United States, the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes.|$|R
50|$|A {{servitude}} is {{a qualified}} beneficial interest severed or fragmented from {{the ownership of}} an inferior property (servient estate) and attached to a superior property (dominant estate) or to some person (personal beneficiary) other than the owner. At civil law, ownership (dominium) is the only full real right whereas a servitude is a subordinate real right on par with wayleaves, <b>real</b> burdens (i.e. <b>real</b> <b>covenants),</b> security interests, and reservations. There are two types: predial, attaching to property, and personal, attaching to a person.|$|R

50|$|An {{encumbrance}} {{is a right}} to, interest in, {{or legal}} liability on real property that does not prohibit passing title to the property but that diminishes its value. Encumbrances can be classified in several ways. They may be financial (ex: liens) or non-financial (ex: easements, private restrictions). Alternatively, they may be divided into those that affect title (ex: lien, legal or equitable charge) or those that affect the use or physical condition of the encumbered property (ex: restrictions, easements, encroachments). Encumbrances include security interests, liens, servitudes (e.g. easements, wayleaves, <b>real</b> <b>covenants,</b> profits a prendre), leases, restrictions, encroachments, and air and subsurface rights. Also, those considered as potentially making the title defeasible are encumbrances, e.g. charging orders, building orders and structure alteration. Encumbrance: charge upon or claim against land arising out of private grant or a contract.|$|R
50|$|The Arthur W. Perdue Stadium is a {{baseball}} stadium in Salisbury, Maryland. It {{is the home}} of the Baltimore Orioles Class A affiliate Delmarva Shorebirds, and was named for the founder of Perdue Farms, Arthur Perdue. It features the Maryland Eastern Shore Baseball Hall of Fame. The stadium seats 5,200 fans and was opened in 1996. As the second-largest seating venue in Salisbury, it also occasionally is used for concerts or other events. The larger Wicomico Youth and Civic Center has a <b>real</b> <b>covenant</b> against serving alcohol. As such, the stadium was chosen as the venue for Fernando Guerrero's middleweight title-winning boxing match in October 2009. Mechanical, plumbing and electrical systems for the stadium were designed by Richard C. Sokoloski, P.E., who also provided engineering services for many commercial buildings in Maryland, along with Daniel S. Frawley Stadium in Wilmington, DE.|$|R
40|$|Writing to Pollock in 1928, Holmes {{mentioned}} that 2 ̆ 2 some cove 2 ̆ 2 {{was trying to}} get him to review a forthcoming little book on covenants running with the land and went on, 2 ̆ 2 It gave me a spell of the dry grins too remember and to write that very nearly half a century had gone by since that was a burning question for me. 2 ̆ 2 In fact, it was in 1880, in the lectures which became famous as The Common Laz, that Holmes had defined 2 ̆ 2 privity of estate 2 ̆ 2 in <b>real</b> <b>covenants</b> in a manner which for clarity, perspicacity, and practical point has never been surpassed. Holmes 2 ̆ 7 s own departures on the Massachusetts supreme bench from these conclusions [...] made necessary by the force of local precedent [...] were understandable, but regrettable, as he himself indicates; and other attempts to evade them have been at best confusing, at worst, disastrous.

50|$|From {{the outset}} of his career, Broderick, a Roman Catholic, refused to {{participate}} in <b>real</b> estate <b>covenants</b> against Jews. He adopted this policy as early as his time at John Davis and Company: around 1904 he refused to have the firm manage a large apartment complex that excluded Jews. As a result, his own firm attracted many Jewish clients.|$|R
50|$|Following World War II, Chicago’s South Side Black Belt {{had become}} {{increasingly}} overcrowded as African Americans {{moved from the}} South in the second wave of the Great Migration.

40|$|Easements and {{covenants}} {{are second}} only to the 2 ̆ 2 fee tail 2 ̆ 2 or perhaps to 2 ̆ 2 springing uses 2 ̆ 2 {{as a symbol of the}} mindless formalism of traditional property law. Aside from that, when we consider what easements and <b>real</b> <b>covenants</b> do—bind land owners to some previous owners 2 ̆ 7 agreements in which the current owners have had no say—the puzzle is that a free and rational nation permits these legal arrangements at all. Even the name, 2 ̆ 2 servitude, 2 ̆ 2 which Professors Reichman and French prefer to use in their excellent articles, has a slight ring of involuntarism. As these two authors tell us, we tolerate these 2 ̆ 2 dead hand 2 ̆ 2 arrangements because they provide a long lasting security for land development and encourage property owners to invest in the long term improvements that are essential to the productive use of real estate. As Jeremy Bentham told us over a century ago, secure expectations of return are a sine qua non of enterprise; if the community wants to encourage my neighbor to invest time and effort in a solar heating panel, it had better let him agree with me that I and my successors will keep my trees from overshadowing his roof...|$|R
50|$|Following the Supreme Court {{ruling in}} Shelley v. Kraemer, banning {{restrictive}} <b>real</b> estate <b>covenants,</b> middle-class black families {{moved to the}} north Kenwood area. Ostracized from white communities, neighborhoods like Kenwood fostered the Chicago Black Renaissance, a surge of black artistic expression. Typical of the era, the Sutherland refused to serve black clientele. However, a change of ownership to Maxwell Rubin, Lee Gould, and Samuel Cohen in the early 1950s resulting in the building's 1952 integration.

5000|$|In 1966, Bevel chose Chicago as {{the site}} of SCLC's long-awaited Northern Campaign. He worked to create tenant unions and build {{grassroots}} action to [...] "end" [...] slums. From previous discussions with King, and from work of American Friends Service Committee activist Bill Moyer, Bevel organized, and directed the Chicago open housing movement.

This movement ended within a Summit Conference that included Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley.|$|R
2500|$|Since its beginning, {{the city}} was {{geographically}} divided by ethnicity. In the 1920s, Los Angeles was {{the location of the}} first restrictive <b>covenants</b> in <b>real</b> estate.

Minorities who had served in World War II or worked in L.A.'s defense industries returned to face increasing patterns of discrimination in housing.

[...] Such real-estate practices severely restricted educational and economic opportunities.|$|R
25|$|Though other {{techniques}} to maintain housing segregation had been used, by 1927 the political leaders of Chicago began to adopt racially restrictive <b>covenants.</b> The Chicago <b>Real</b> Estate Board promoted a racially restrictive covenant to YMCAs, churches, women's clubs, PTAs, Kiwanis clubs, chambers {{of commerce and}} property owners' associations. At one point, as much as 80% of the city's area was included under restrictive covenants.|$|R

5000|$|An {{issue of}} major {{importance}} in the First Chronicles {{is the question of}} the reality of the Land. From Covenant's perspective, the Land may well be just a delusion of his disturbed mind; early in his adventure, he gives himself the title of [...] "The Unbeliever". Donaldson goes to great lengths to make this explanation as plausible as any other theory (e.g., Covenant is (to varying degrees) mentally unbalanced, events in the Land seem to parallel his subconscious struggles, his physical condition upon exiting the Land is always exactly the same as his condition upon entering it, etc.). This {{is the heart of the}} [...] "Fundamental Question of Ethics" [...] that appears at the very start of the Chronicles, which can be rephrased as [...] "Do one's actions in dreams have any <b>real</b> significance?" [...] <b>Covenant's</b> despicable act early in the first book (the rape of a teenage girl who befriends him when he first arrives in the Land) has consequences throughout the story and can be seen as an attempt to test this theory. The First Chronicles sees the reality of the Land eventually 'proven' to Covenant; another interpretation of Covenant's eventual decision to aid the Land is the realization that, whether the Land is real or not, it matters to him.|$|R
25|$|Los Angeles had racial {{restrictive}} covenants {{that prevented}} blacks and Mexican Americans from renting and buying in certain areas, even {{long after the}} courts ruled them illegal in 1948.

50|$|Of {{particular}} concern are widely formulated reservations which essentially render ineffective all Covenant rights {{which would require}} any change in national law to ensure compliance with <b>Covenant</b> obligations. No <b>real</b> international rights or obligations have thus been accepted.

40|$|Private {{transfer}} fee <b>covenants</b> against <b>real</b> property are increasingly {{under fire from}} Congress, federal regulators, and state legislatures. This fire has been fueled by strong advocacy from the National Association of Realtors. It will only {{be a matter of}} time before private {{transfer fee}}s will also be challenged in state courts as not meeting the common law requirements for a servitude. As these bodies take aim at the private transfer fee, they literally must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. A private transfer fee that benefits conservation and environmental stewardship is consistent with the traditional use of a servitude and can provide a valuable benefit to property owners and the public. This article argues that private transfer fees, when used to fund conservation and environmental stewardship, meet the historical and modern requirements for a valid servitude, that courts should hold them enforceable, and that policymakers should exempt them from general private transfer fee restrictions...|$|R
5000|$|Among {{contemporary}} authors, Scott Hahn, an American theologian {{and convert}} from Calvinism, has written much about filiation {{in the context}} of the theology of the covenant. He sees the <b>covenant</b> as a <b>real</b> family bond. He has also written about filiation {{in the context of}} his journey as a member of Opus Dei, whose founder, St. Josemaría Escrivá, is a leading writer on this topic. Escriva saw filiation as the [...] "foundation of the Christian life," [...] and had a mystical experience in early years of Opus Dei (1931) that led him to emphasize this aspect of Christian life. Fernando Ocariz, who wrote God as Father (1998) is another theologian who has several works on divine filiation.|$|R
40|$|A private {{transfer}} fee (PTF) is typically created when a developer or homeowner decides {{to attach a}} covenant to {{the title of the}} home. This covenant, the PTF covenant, attaches the PTF to the <b>real</b> property. These <b>covenants</b> require payment of a fee—typically stated as one percent of the property 2 ̆ 7 s sale price—upon each resale or transfer of the property and often survive for a period of ninety-nine years. The recipients or owners of the PTF (PTF beneficiaries) can be almost anyone, including property developers, PTF developers, home owner associations (HOA), private investors, state governments, and non-profit charities. Usually, the PTF payment is designated to a trust in which a trustee retains a portion of the fee for expenses and pays the remainder of the fee to the PTF beneficiaries. Are PTFs a form of financial exploitation by developers or a reasonable financing vehicle? Proponents of PTF covenants argue that PTFs are financial instruments designed to spread out housing development costs and lower the costs of homeownership. Their opponents argue that PTFs lower housing values, surprise homebuyers with extra fees, create unreasonable restraints on alienation, and impair the marketability of tide. * PTFs can surprise potential homebuyers even when the PTF covenant is recorded and clearly identified;buyers often do not know that the property they are buying has a PTF convent until the closing.

40|$|With free cash flows, borrowers can {{accumulate}} cash or voluntarily {{pay down}} debts. However, sometimes creditors impose a mandatory repayment covenant called "excess cash flow sweep" in loan contracts to force borrowers to repay debts ahead of schedule. About 17 percent of borrowers in the authors' sample (1995 - 2006) have this covenant attached {{to at least}} one of their loans. The author finds that the sweep covenant {{is more likely to be}} imposed on borrowers with higher leverage (i. e., where risk shifting by equity holders is more likely). The results are robust to including borrower fixed effects or using industry median leverage as a proxy. The covenant is more common also in borrowers where equity holders appear to have firmer control, e. g., when more shares are controlled by institutional block holders, when firms are incorporated in states with laws more favorable to hostile takeovers, or when equity holders place higher valuation on excess cash holdings. These determinants suggest that the sweep covenant may be motivated by creditor-shareholder conflicts. Finally, the author shows that the <b>covenant</b> has <b>real</b> effects: borrowers affected by the sweep covenant indeed repay more debts using excess cash flows, and they spend less in capital investment and pay out fewer dividends to shareholders.

40|$|With {{positive}} free cash flows, firms {{choose between}} saving cash and reducing debt. However, sometimes creditors include an “excess cash flow sweep ” covenant in loan contracts to capture free cash flows to reduce loan balances ahead of schedule. About 17 % of publicly-traded borrowers {{in our sample}} (1995 - 2006) have this covenant attached {{to at least one}} of their loans. We find that the sweep covenant is more frequently observed among more highly leveraged borrowers (i. e., where risk shifting by equity holders is more likely). The results are robust to including borrower fixed effects (for those taking out multiple loans) or using industry median leverage as a proxy. We also find that the covenant is more common in borrowers that appear more strongly controlled by shareholders, i. e., when more shares are controlled by institutional block holders, when firms are incorporated in states with laws more favorable to hostile takeovers, or when shareholders place higher valuation on excess cash holdings. The positive relation between leverage and the covenant is stronger when block holders control more shares. These determinants suggest that the sweep covenant may be used to mitigate creditor-shareholder conflicts of interests as in Jensen and Meckling (1976). Finally, we show that the <b>covenant</b> has <b>real</b> effects: borrowers affected by the sweep covenant indeed repay more debts using free cash flows, and they spend less in capital investment and pay out fewer dividends to shareholders...|$|R
