5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of Weston's new colony was profit, rather than the <b>religious</b> <b>reasons</b> of the Plymouth settlers, and this {{dictated}} how the colony would be assembled. Weston believed that families were a detriment to a well-run plantation and so he selected able-bodied men only but not men experienced in colonial life. In total, there were several advanced scouts and fifty to sixty other colonists. The final complement also included one surgeon and one lawyer. The party was outfitted with enough supplies to last the winter.|$|E

5|$|Why Æthelberht {{chose to}} convert to Christianity is uncertain. Bede {{suggests}} that the king converted strictly for <b>religious</b> <b>reasons,</b> but most modern historians see other motives behind Æthelberht's decision. Certainly, given Kent's close contacts with Gaul, {{it is possible that}} Æthelberht sought baptism in order to smooth his relations with the Merovingian kingdoms, or to align himself with one of the factions then contending in Gaul. Another consideration may have been that new methods of administration often followed conversion, whether directly from the newly introduced church or indirectly from other Christian kingdoms.|$|E

Added in 1974, this stated that parents who did not provide medical treatment for a child for <b>religious</b> <b>reasons</b> would not be considered negligent.

Despite the punishment, prosecution, and {{banning of}} Protestants in Besançon, Archbishop Antoine struggled {{to contain the}} spread of Protestant ideas. The preaching of William Farel, Theodore Beza and John Calvin had resulted in people converting to Protestantism; Protestant propaganda, religious gatherings, and iconoclastic attacks on Catholic imagery had also maintained the Protestant community in Besançon. On 1 March 1562, the murder of Huguenots in Wassy, France began the French Wars of Religion. By then, Besançon had become part of an independent republic protected by the Holy Roman Empire, which mostly untouched {{in the beginning of}} the conflict. Despite the oppression in Besançon, many French Protestant reformers continued to flock to the city.|$|E

It was republished several times by groups that were critical of the Spanish realm for political or <b>religious</b> <b>reasons.</b> The first edition in translation was published in Dutch in 1578, during the religious persecution of Dutch Protestants by the Spanish crown, followed by editions in French (1578), English (1583), and German (1599) – all countries where religious wars were raging. The first edition published in Spain after Las Casas's death appeared in Barcelona during the Catalan Revolt of 1646. The book was banned by the Aragonese inquisition in 1659.|$|E
5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over daughters in India {{is rooted in}} social, economic and <b>religious</b> <b>reasons.</b> Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. One {{of the main reasons}} behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often have to pay a dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E

Theophilus Lindsey, who had helped establish Unitarianism in Britain, wrote to the Reverend Newcome Cappe to express his displeasure at a review in {{the first issue of}} the Analytical, demonstrating that Unitarian theology was not being promulgated by the journal. Furthermore, Johnson chose as his theological reviewer, not a Dissenter as his friend Joseph Priestley urged, but Alexander Geddes, a talented Scot who had been ordained in Paris as a Roman Catholic priest. However, modern scholars have suggested that he did so not for <b>religious</b> <b>reasons,</b> but because Geddes lived in London and had close connections both to Wollstonecraft and Johnson's friend, Henry Fuseli.|$|E

Hamilton viewed his roles of being a father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, placing his family's welfare in jeopardy and his moral and religious stances as reasons not to duel, but he felt it impossible to avoid due to having made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and <b>religious</b> <b>reasons</b> and the codes of honor and politics. He intended to accept the duel and throw away his fire in order to satisfy his morals and political codes, respectively.

5|$|The ice trade {{enabled the}} {{consumption}} {{of a wide range}} of new products during the 19th century. One simple use for natural ice was to chill drinks, either being directly added to the glass or barrel, or indirectly chilling it in a wine cooler or similar container. Iced drinks were a novelty and were initially viewed with concern by customers, worried about the health risks, although this rapidly vanished in the US. By mid-19th century, water was always chilled in America if possible. Iced milk also popular, and German lager, traditionally drunk chilled, also used ice. Drinks such as sherry-cobblers and mint juleps were created that could only be made using crushed ice. There were distinct differences in 19th-century American and European attitudes to adding ice directly to drinks, with the Europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit; British visitors to India were surprised to see the Anglo-Indian elite prepared to drink iced water. Some Hindus in India regarded ice as unclean for <b>religious</b> <b>reasons,</b> and as such an inappropriate food.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Fascism in {{particular}} frequently encouraged greater state involvement. In Italy, {{between the end}} of the war and 1923 local groups and organisations had established their own local memorials in villages and towns. Not all villages agreed that memorials were appropriate, either for political or <b>religious</b> <b>reasons.</b> With the Fascist revolution, this process became more centralised; veteran groups were assimilated by the Fascist government in 1926, and a systematic attempt to construct suitable national and local memorials followed. In Germany, the political and economic chaos of the immediate post-war years discouraged the construction of civic war memorials and comparatively few civic memorials in their larger towns, mainly due to the shortage of funds in the inter-war German economy and political disagreements between local groups as to what to commemorate and how. Those memorials that were constructed were often built instead by local movements, representing particular factional interests. It was only after the rise of the German Nazi party to power in 1933 that substantial funding began to flow into construction programmes, controlled from Berlin.|$|E

As Richelieu's agent, therefore, this modern Peter the Hermit manoeuvered at the Diet of Regensburg (1630) to thwart the aggression of the emperor, and then advised the intervention of Gustavus Adolphus, reconciling himself to the use of Protestant armies by the theory that one poison would counteract another.|$|R
