In neutralization, the presence of chromium (VI) in skins is observed, in a concentration that depends on the pH to which they have been neutralized. However, chromium (VI) practically disappears once the skins have been fatliquored and thoroughly washed. Analysis of skins not <b>retanned</b> and finished exposed to UV light showed a marked increase in chromium (VI) content. By contrast, skins <b>retanned</b> with quebracho withstood the same conditions without noticeable quantitaties of chromium (VI) being detected.

The retanning technique influenced the thickness of the leather which became inferior (1. 30 to 1. 53 mm) to other treatments due to the chromium salts (T 1 = 0. 61 to 0. 68 mm). The course of the leather did not influence the thickness.

A polimerização foi conduzida pelo processo em massa, usando CuBr/PMDETA como sistema catalítico e EBP como iniciador.

Twelve samples of the residual chromium liquors were collected randomly from ALNASR and the White Nile Tanneries.

The average quantity of chromium oxide "Cr 2 o 3 " for both tanneries which discharged as waste to the drain {{was found to be}} 5. 58 g/L. This quantity is equivalent to 32 % of the chromic oxide added {{at the beginning of the}} tannage. This mean, that more or less one third of the basic chromium sulphate used in tannage is lost as waste. Then two Evaporation experiments were carried out at the White Nile Tannery laboratory by direct heating to determine the optimum evaporation level for maximum chromium oxide recovery. This level of evaporation was found to be about 27 % of the water, can be evaporated without much loss of chromium oxide. Then Eight tanning Experiments were carried out at the White Nile Tannery pilot plant in the following manner:- A residual chrome liquor (R 1) was taken from the White Nile tannery and it was evaporated to the required level (C 1). Then the chromium oxide in (C 1) was determined and was adjusted with fresh chromium powder to maintain the tanning percentage to 7 %. Then it was used to tan a delimed, bated, pickled pelt. The residual liquor(R 2) from (C 1) was again evaporated to (C 2). Then the chromium oxide in (C 2) was determined and adjusted to the required level with fresh chromium powder. Then it was used to tan a delimed, bated, pickled pelt. This process was repeated eight times untill (C 8) and (R 9). The average quantity of basic chromium sulphate required to be added as a make-up was found to be 4. 9 %. That means 2. 1 % of basic chromium sulphate is saved all through the year, in addition to the following savings:- 1) 4 % in the sodium chloride 2) 60 - 70 % in the water 3) 0. 1 - 0. 2 % in the sulphuric Acid Then four pelts tanned with (C 8), (C 7), (C 6) plus one side from the White Nile Tannery were <b>retanned</b> as usual and they were paste- Dried.

They worked together on dozens of books, including I Am a Bunny, which Risom wrote and Scarry illustrated. First published in 1963, it is still in print."

40|$|Three {{types of}} humic acids of {{different}} sources have been analysed {{in order to}} quantify the functional groups that may be liable to react with the proteins of leather. The quantification serves {{to determine the extent}} to which each of these acids can be used as tanning or <b>retanning</b> agents. The three types of humid acids have been compared mathematically according to their content within the aforementioned functional groups. Humic acids have structures similar to those of vegetable tannins. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} three different types of humic acids (natural humic acids, regenerated humic acids, and sulphited humic acids) {{with regard to their}} penetration and fixation to the leather. More specifically, through the tests carried out the curves of penetration and fixation were drawn, and from these the optimum pH intervals of penetration and fixation to the leather were determined. The data obtained is essential in view of the subsequent application of humic acids as tanning agents and/or <b>retanning</b> agentsPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Appropriate {{protective}} gloves {{are essential for}} industry workers to avoid hands and wrists injuries. Leather is a common material used by professionals for technical gloves. Mechanical resistance, protection against water and high temperature has to be fulfilled by leather that is intended for using in {{protective gloves}}. In this study recipes using various fatliquoring agents with different properties such as lesitin based, lanolin based, polymeric based and water proofing fat liquor were applied to produce technical glove leather and effect of each fatliquoring product on protective performance of leathers were analyzed in terms of physical and mechanical properties including tensile (ISO 3376), stitch tear (ISO 23910), tear resistance (ISO 3377 - 2), static (ISO 2417) and dynamicwater absorption (ISO 5403 - 1) and thermal stability such as dry heat (ISO 17227) and heat stability (ISO 11645). For this purpose, chromium tanned split calf leathers were used and <b>retanning</b> of protective leather gloves were performed by using tara and phosphonium combination. Performance testing results obtained from four different <b>retanning</b> processes was compared according {{to the type of}} fatliquoring material used in the production. Post-tanning with different types of fatliquoring products have significant effect on the protective performance properties of leather gloves, in terms of mechanical and thermal properties...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} it is aimed to combine usage of valonia or modified valonia with oxazolidine {{to obtain an}} increase in hydrothermal stability, thus to devolope tanning efficiency and to produce leathers that have better properties then the ones tanned with valonea only. On the other hand, oak trees, which produce tannins of valonea, grow in the western parts of Turkey and its extract is known as valex. So, an increase in valonea consumption was also expected. Experiments conducted with 94 halfs of pickled kid skins that have same properties as a uniform party. Natural and three modified valonia extracts and oxazolidine were used as tanning materials. Skin samples {{were divided into two}} main groups according to the tannage system. In first group which was called A, valonia extracts were used as tanning materials in a fix ratio of 20 % and oxazolidines as <b>retanning</b> ones. Group A was divided into 4 subgroups according to the used extracts types. And each subgroup was also seperated into four lots according to the oxozolidine percentages used (e. g. 0 - 2 - 4 and 6 which use as <b>retanning</b> materials). In group B, oxazolidines were used as pretanning agents and extracts as tannin...|$|R
