2500|$|Antibiotics {{have been}} used in poultry farming in mass {{quantities}} since 1951, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved their use. Three years prior to the FDAâ€™s approval, scientists were investigating a phenomenon in which chickens who were <b>rooting</b> <b>through</b> bacteria-rich manure were displaying signs of greater health than those who did not. Through testing, it was discovered that chickens who were fed a variety of vitamin B12 manufactured with the residue of a certain antibiotic grew 50 percent faster than those chickens who were fed B12 manufactured from a different source. [...] Further testing confirmed that use of antibiotics did improve the health of the chickens, resulting in the chickens laying more eggs and experiencing lower mortality rates and less illness. Upon this discovery, farmers transitioned from expensive animal proteins to comparatively inexpensive antibiotics and B12. Chickens were now reaching their market weight at a much faster rate and at a lower cost. [...] With a growing population and greater demand on the farmers, antibiotics appeared to be an ideal and cost-effective way to increase the output of poultry. Since this discovery, antibiotics have been routinely used in poultry production, but more recently have been the topic of debate secondary to the fear of bacterial antibiotic resistance.|$|E

As well as production bed covers, the fabric was cut into discs and (a) used to cover the tops of plant containers (pot toppers) and (b) inserted to cover {{the holes in the}} bottoms of plant containers (disc inserts). These were all tested as barriers to the passage of infective zoospores of Phytophthora cryptogea in enclosed re-circulating irrigation systems growing test plants of Chamaecyparis lawsoniana. Bed covers and disc inserts significantly reduced disease spread, as indicated by the incidence of symptoms and infection, and by bait and colony-forming unit tests of re-circulating water, both in overhead- and trickle-irrigated systems. Pot toppers were not effective. This may be explained by the mode of spread of Phytophthora in such irrigation systems, which appears to be largely via capillary water and therefore not intercepted by toppers. These results were supported by in vitro studies on the passage of zoospores through fresh and used fabric samples which showed that all Tex-R Pro fabric materials significantly reduced the survival of zoospores and zoospore cysts (to between 0 % and 4. 8 %) compared with untreated fabrics (between 32. 3 % and 42. 8 %). Analysis of Cu 2 + concentrations in re-circulating irrigation water and in matting samples {{at the end of the}} field experiments showed that the majority of the active ingredient stayed bound to the fabric. These results demonstrate that it is possible to deploy Spin Out-treated fabrics in nurseries to help prevent the spread of Phytophthora propagules in addition to their primary use for controlling weeds and <b>rooting</b> <b>through...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Direct {{observations}} of underwater behaviour of free-living marine mammals are rare. This {{is particularly true}} for large and potentially dangerous species such as the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus). Walruses are highly specialised predators on benthic invertebrates â€“ especially bivalves. The unique feeding niche of walruses has led to speculations as to their underwater foraging behaviour. Based on {{observations of}} walruses in captivity and signs of predation left on the sea floor by free-living walruses, various types of feeding behaviour have been suggested in the literature. In this study, however, the underwater feeding behaviour of wild adult male Atlantic walruses (O. r. rosmarus) is documented {{for the first time}} in their natural habitat by scuba-divers. The video recordings indicated a predisposition for use of the right front flipper during feeding. This tendency towards dextrality was explored further by examining a museum collection of extremities of walrus skeletons. Results During July and August 2001, twelve video-recordings of foraging adult male walruses were made in Young Sound (74 Â° 18 N; 20 Â° 15 V), Northeast Greenland. The recordings did not allow for differentiation among animals, however based on notes by the photographer at least five different individuals were involved. The walruses showed four different foraging behaviours; removing sediment by beating the right flipper, removing sediment by beating the left flipper, removing sediment by use of a water-jet from the mouth and <b>rooting</b> <b>through</b> sediment with the muzzle. There was a significant preference for using right flipper over left flipper during foraging. Measurements of the dimensions of forelimbs from 23 walrus skeletons revealed that the length of the right scapula, humerus, and ulna was significantly greater than that of the left, supporting our field observations of walruses showing a tendency of dextrality in flipper use. Conclusion We suggest that the four feeding behaviours observed are typical of walruses in general, although walruses in other parts of their range may have evolved other types of feeding behaviour. While based on small sample sizes both the underwater observations and skeletal measurements suggest lateralized limb use, which is the first time this has been reported in a pinniped. </p...|$|E
