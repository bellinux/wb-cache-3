40|$|The recent {{drive to}} install {{residential}} installation of photovoltaic <b>roof</b> <b>systems</b> has generated {{the need to}} re-examine the structural capacity of residential structures.

With the goal of finding ultimate capacities of wood <b>roof</b> <b>systems,</b> empirical tests were conducted in a laboratory setting and results were compared with current building and design codes.

25|$|Copper roofs {{may be used}} as part of a {{lightning}} protection scheme where the copper skin, gutters and rainwater pipes can be linked and bonded to an earth termination facility. The thickness of copper specified for roofing materials is usually adequate for lightning protection.

40|$|Moisture {{intrusion}} is {{the major}} reason why low-slope <b>roofing</b> <b>systems</b> fail prematurely. With approximately 75 % of all roofing activity being reroofing, the roofing professional is faced with deciding {{what to do with}} an existing wet roof on almost a daily basis. Problems can originate from moisture entering the <b>roofing</b> <b>system</b> by two completely different mechanisms. In the wintertime, the vapor pressure in the building interior typically exceeds the vapor pressure in the <b>roofing</b> <b>system,</b> causing water vapor to migrate from the building interior into the <b>roofing</b> <b>system.</b> If the vapor pressure gradient is severe and persists for a long time, sufficient water vapor may build up under the roofing membrane to allow condensation to occur. The second mechanism that allows an appreciable amount of water into the <b>roofing</b> <b>system</b> is membrane failure. Breaks in the membrane will allow water to enter the <b>roofing</b> <b>system</b> from the exterior. Depending on the roof construction, the water will either build up in the roof or migrate to the roof deck where it may manifest itself as a leak. The net effect of water entering the <b>roofing</b> <b>system</b> by either mechanism is the same: reduced energy efficiency, corrosion of metal components (decks and fasteners), mechanical degradation of the insulation materials, and bond failures between adhered components. These impacts lead to reduced durability, shorter service life, and health/safety issues. This paper describes finite-difference computer modeling performed to address moisture control in low-slope <b>roofing</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on a large database of finite difference modeling results, algorithms have been developed that allow the roofing practitioner to simply determine if a <b>roofing</b> <b>system</b> design requires a vapor retarder or if the system can be modified to enhance its tolerance for small leaks. This paper illustrates how modeling results were obtained, describes the process employed to develop the algorithms, anddemon-strates how these algorithms can be used to design a moisture-tolerant low-slope roof. The range of applicability and limitations of these algorithms are also detailed...|$|R
