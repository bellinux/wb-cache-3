5|$|After Mr. Garrison gets a nose job, {{his face}} <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of David Hasselhoff, the actor and singer {{best known for}} the series Knight Rider and Baywatch. Mr. Garrison refers disparagingly to the 1997 science fiction drama film Contact. Parker and Stone said they {{went out of their way}} to include the {{reference}} due to their own strong distaste for the film.|$|E
5|$|HIV-2’s closest {{relative}} is SIVsm, {{a strain}} of SIV found in sooty mangabees. Since HIV-1 is derived from SIVcpz, and HIV-2 from SIVsm, the genetic sequence of HIV-2 is only partially homologous to HIV-1 and more closely <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of SIVsm.|$|E

5|$|Hydnellum ferrugineum fruit bodies {{contain the}} {{pigments}} hydnuferrigin (dark violet) and hydnuferruginin (yellow), {{as well as}} small amounts of the polyphenol compound atromentin. Hydnuferrigin has a chemical structure that closely <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of thelephoric acid, a pigment found in other species of Hydnellum and Hydnum, and they may originate from a common precursor compound.|$|E
5|$|In caecilians, {{fertilisation}} is internal, {{the male}} extruding an intromittent organ, the phallodeum, and inserting {{it into the}} female cloaca. The paired Müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm. Fertilisation probably {{takes place in the}} oviduct.|$|E
5|$|M1 {{is similar}} to M2, but {{somewhat}} smaller. The ectoflexus is less apparent, the stylar shelf is narrower, there is no crest behind the metaconule, and the lingual cingulum is continuous. The condition of the parastyle more closely <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> in Afrotarsius.|$|E

5|$|Neptune's {{internal}} structure <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% {{of the way}} towards the core, where it reaches pressures of about 10GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere.

5|$|Rai school sugata <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of {{the late}} Heian/early Kamakura period being both gentle and graceful, but grander and with a more {{vigorous}} workmanship. Starting with Kunimitsu, the kissaki becomes larger. The jihada is small-grain mokume-hada, dense with ji-nie, yubashiri and chikei. The quality of the jigane is slightly inferior {{to that of the}} Awataguchi school. The hamon shows medium suguha with chōji midare.|$|E

5|$|The {{lower jaw}} of Dermotherium major <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of living colugos in the {{presence}} of a strong angular process (a projecting piece of bone at the lower side of the back of the jawbone) and a retromolar space (a flat space behind the last molars). The coronoid process (a projecting piece of bone directly behind the molars) rises steeply, with its front wall virtually vertical.|$|E
5|$|The {{workmanship}} {{of early}} Ichimonji smiths such as Norimune <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of the Ko-Bizen school: tachi have a narrow mihaba, deep koshi-zori, funbari and an elegant sugata with small kissaki. The hamon is small midare or small midare with small chōji midare in small nie.|$|E
5|$|Tufa {{deposits}} {{formed in}} the lake. The continental environment Pleistocene sediments were formed from lacustrine carbonate deposits. These rocks contain amphibole, clay minerals such as illite, kaolinite and smectite, feldspar, plagioclase, potassium feldspar, pyroxene and quartz. The composition of these rocks <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of the Altiplano soils.|$|E

5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|Artificial selection, the {{deliberate}} selective breeding of domestic animals, {{is being used}} to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E
5|$|Being in {{the genus}} Acinonyx, the {{morphology}} of the cheetah differs notably {{from the big}} cats (genus Panthera). The face and the jaw are unusually shortened and the sagittal crest is poorly developed, possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed. In fact, the skull <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of the smaller cats. Another point of similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine, {{in contrast to the}} stiff and short one of other large felids. A 2001 study of felid morphology stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the cheetah at a relatively younger age than other felids could be a major reason for the peculiar morphology of the cheetah. Interestingly, the cheetah appears to show convergent evolution with canids in morphology as well as behaviour. For example, the cheetah has a relatively long snout, long legs and deep chest, tough foot pads and blunt, semi-retractable claws; moreover, its hunting behaviour <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of canids. In the 2001 study, it was observed that the claws of cheetah have features intermediate between those of felids and the wolf. In the Puma lineage, the cheetah's skull morphology {{is similar to that of}} the pumaboth have short, wide skullswhile that of the jaguarundi is different.|$|E

5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin {{in this manner}} to {{distinguish}} the coin from the half crown, as there had been complaints of confusion. He probably based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and ex officio Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of the Edwardian florin.|$|E
5|$|E {{is usually}} {{classified}} as a mixed language deriving ultimately from the Tai-Kadai and Sino-Tibetan families, which both inhabit southern China and Southeast Asia. Some non-Chinese scholars, however, consider it a Tai-Kadai language with Chinese influence. Whatever its classification, the grammar <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> of the Tai branch of Tai-Kadai. Specifically, scholars consider E's grammatical features a blend of Northern Zhuang, Mulam, and Kam. The Caolan language of Vietnam displays many similarities with E.|$|E

GroupA has more than fifty mounds arranged around the three plazas. Monuments dating to the period when Seibal was a vassal of Dos Pilas (AD 735761) are situated in the Central Plaza of the group. In this group, there is also a ball court that is dated to the Terminal Classic and stylistically <b>resembles</b> <b>that</b> at Uxmal.|$|E
