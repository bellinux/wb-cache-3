40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present the design {{procedure}} for determining mod-ification coefficients of toothed wheels of involutes planetary gear train with internal conjunction of teeth. It is possible to obtain a higher load-carrying capacity which depends also on correction coefficients. For example, we take into consideration a concept of planetary gears in which the teeth can be corrected, which allows better fatigue and contact surface strength. Two cases are considered when the namely zero center distance (without cor-rections) of the central and satellite wheels is the same or not, in relation to the zero center distance between the satellite and the sun wheel. Geometrical dimensions are described with regard to the technological teeth correction scope, and inequality restriction conditions are determined with respect to the ISO standards recommendations and the literature. The procedure can be applied to any other planetary gears with another kinematic connection of wheels. 1. Fundamental design relation and restrictions of planetary gears The scheme of a stage planetary gear with correction coefficients is shown in Fig. 1. The basic mechanical configuration consists of two co-operating pairs of gears with the same distance of the rotation axis. We assume that the tools which generate the teeth have the module “m”, the profile angle “α”, the addendum factor y= 1 and the tip clearance factor co = 0. 25. On the basis of a standard <b>rack,</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> can generate toothed wheels with different coefficients of corrections.

The metal cutting industry houses several actors providing machine <b>tools</b> and <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> with a fierce competition as a consequence. Extensive efforts are made to improve the performance of both machine <b>tools</b> and <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> Performance improvements are not solely restricted to produce stronger and more durable machine <b>tools</b> and <b>cutting</b> <b>tools.</b> They also include knowledge about how the machine <b>tools</b> and <b>cutting</b> <b>tools</b> should be used to perform at an optimum of their combined capacity. Information about the dynamic properties of the machine <b>tool</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> assembly is one of the aspects that carries the most potential in terms of productivity increase and process reliability. This work presents a methodology to synthesise the dynamic behaviour of a machine <b>tool</b> and <b>cutting</b> <b>tool</b> assembly based on component models of the machine <b>tool</b> and the <b>cutting</b> <b>tool.</b> The system is treated as an assembly of subcomponents in order to reduce measurement effort.
