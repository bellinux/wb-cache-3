50|$|For {{production}} machine tools, the shank type is usually {{one of the}} following: a standard taper (such as Morse or Brown & Sharpe), a straight round shank to be held by a collet, or a straight <b>round</b> <b>shank</b> <b>with</b> a flat for a set screw, to be held by a solid toolholder. For hand tools, the shank end is usually a square drive, intended for use with {{the same type of}} wrench used to turn a tap for the cutting of screw threads.|$|R
50|$|Tools with an R8 taper are {{inserted}} {{directly into}} the machine's spindle. R8 collets are typically used to hold tooling <b>with</b> <b>round</b> <b>shanks,</b> although any shape can be held if the collet has the correct corresponding shape cut in it. The collets have a precision bore with axial compression slots for holding cutting tools and are threaded for the drawbar. The R8 system is commonly used with collets {{ranging in size from}} ″ to ″ in diameter or tool holders with the same or slightly larger diameters. The collets or tool holders are placed {{directly into the}} spindle and the drawbar is tightened into the top of the collet or tool holder from above the spindle. Other tools such as drill chucks, fly cutters, indexable insert cutters, etc. may have an R-8 taper shank built into or added to the tool.|$|R

50|$|Old USS and SAE {{standards}} defined {{cap screws}} as fasteners <b>with</b> <b>shanks</b> that were threaded {{to the head}} and bolts as fasteners <b>with</b> <b>shanks</b> that were partially unthreaded. The relationship of this rule {{to the idea that}} a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the grip, was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have unthreaded sections of shank.|$|R

50|$|Shank boutons have {{a hollow}} {{protrusion}} {{on the back}} through which thread is sewn to attach the button. Button shanks may be a separate piece added {{to the back of}} a button, or be carved or moulded directly onto the back of the button, in which case the button is referred to by collectors as having a 'self-shank'. This is a common construction for older shell and glass buttons, for example. Buttons <b>with</b> <b>shanks</b> have no holes in the button blank (the main part of the button) itself because they are not needed for sewing. Buttons <b>with</b> <b>shanks</b> are more expensive to produce than shankless buttons.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePhelan McDermid Syndrome (PMDS) is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} characterized by features of Autism spectrum disorders. Similar to reports of Zn deficiency in autistic children, we have previously reported {{high incidence of}} Zn deficiency in PMDS. However, the underlying mechanisms are currently not well understood. Here, using inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry to measure the concentration of Zinc (Zn) and Copper (Cu) in hair samples from individuals with PMDS with 22 q 13. 3 deletion including SHANK 3 (SH 3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3), we report {{a high rate of}} abnormally low Zn/Cu ratios. To investigate possible underlying mechanisms, we generated enterocytes from PMDS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and used Caco- 2 cells <b>with</b> knockdown of <b>SHANK</b> 3. We detected decreased expression of Zn uptake transporters ZIP 2 and ZIP 4 on mRNA and protein level correlating <b>with</b> <b>SHANK</b> 3 expression levels, and found reduced levels of ZIP 4 protein co-localizing <b>with</b> <b>SHANK</b> 3 at the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that especially ZIP 4 exists in a complex <b>with</b> <b>SHANK</b> 3. Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemistry on gut sections from Shank 3 αβ knockout mice and confirmed a link between enterocytic SHANK 3, ZIP 2 and ZIP 4. We conclude that apart from its well-known role in the CNS, SHANK 3 might play a specific role in the GI tract...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Intensification of soil {{compaction}} process under no-tillage (NT) is motivating {{the search for}} alternatives to mitigate {{soil compaction}} state. This study evaluated changes in soil physical and hydraulic properties caused by seeder <b>with</b> fertilizer <b>shanks</b> at different depths compared with the double discs lagged seeder, to investigate the possibility of soil decompaction by sowing under NT in southern Brazil. The {{study was conducted in}} a clayed Oxisol, for 27 years under NT. Treatments were three planting mechanisms: S 0. 10 m: cutting disc combined <b>with</b> <b>shank</b> acting to 0. 10 m depth; S 0. 15 m: cutting disc combined <b>with</b> <b>shank</b> acting to 0. 15 m depth and, D 0. 07 m: double discs lagged acting to 0. 07 m depth in an experimental randomized block design with four replications. We evaluated the soil mechanical resistance, water infiltration rate, soil bulk density, pore size distribution and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Results indicated that the use of seeder <b>with</b> fertilizer <b>shanks</b> acting at 0. 15 m deep promoted the soil decompaction by the reduction of penetration resistance and increase of porosity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. To have significant increase in water infiltration rate the fertilizer shanks of the seeder must be deepened to the lower limit of the compacted surface layer...|$|R
