5|$|Fellini secured {{financing}} {{through the}} producers Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti, {{who wanted to}} cast Silvana Mangano (De Laurentiis' wife) as Gelsomina and Burt Lancaster as Zampanò, but Fellini refused these choices. Giulietta Masina had been {{the inspiration for the}} entire project, so Fellini was determined never to accept an alternative to her. For Zampanò, Fellini had hoped to cast a nonprofessional and, to that end, he tested a number of circus strongmen, to no avail. He also had trouble finding the <b>right</b> <b>person</b> for the role of Il Matto. His first choice was the actor Moraldo Rossi, {{who was a member of}} Fellini's social circle and had the right type of personality and athletic physique, but Rossi wanted to be the assistant director, not a performer. Alberto Sordi, the star of Fellini's earlier films The White Sheik and I Vitelloni, was eager to take the role, and was bitterly disappointed when Fellini rejected him after a tryout in costume.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2008, Brown's {{leadership}} {{was presented with}} a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign. This event was dubbed the 'Lancashire Plot', as two backbenchers from (pre-1974) Lancashire urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of {{holding on to the}} Labour Party leadership. Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest. However, certain prominent MPs, such as Jacqui Smith and Bill Rammell, suggested that Brown was the <b>right</b> <b>person</b> to lead Britain through its economic crisis. In the Autumn, Siobhain McDonagh, a MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government, spoke of the need for discussion over Brown's position. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterwards, on 12 September. Whilst McDonagh did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour party to hold a leadership election, she was sacked from her role shortly afterwards. McDonagh was supported by Joan Ryan (who applied, as McDonagh had, for leadership nomination papers, and became the second rebel to be fired from her job), Jim Dowd, Greg Pope, and a string of others who had previously held positions in government, made clear their desire for a contest.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} his MBA {{degree in}} 1975, Carper {{went to work}} for the State of Delaware's economic development office. In 1976, after developing good relationships with members of the state party leadership, he took out a $5,000 personal loan to fund his campaign for the Treasurer of Delaware. After convincing the party leaders, and later the voters, that he was the <b>right</b> <b>person</b> to be Delaware State Treasurer, he defeated the favored Republican Party candidate, Theodore Jones. He served three terms, from January 18, 1977 through January 3, 1983, during which time he oversaw the development of Delaware's first cash management system.|$|E
25|$|The {{minister-president}} of Rhineland-Palatinate (1969-1976) {{was a young}} reformer in {{a somewhat}} backward state, and a newcomer who heavily criticized the older party leaders. The national media, {{for as much as}} they took notice of him, regarded him with curiosity. But this changed when Kohl became chair of the federal party in 1973, and even more dramatically when in late 1975 his party made him candidate for the chancellery. His opponents within the federal party, but also journalists and other observers, had their doubts whether the parochial but successful modernizer of a manageable smaller state was the <b>right</b> <b>person</b> to lead the Federal Republic, a huge and complicated industrial country.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, Bose was placed under house-arrest by the Raj. He escaped in {{disguise}} {{and made his way}} through Afghanistan and Central -Asia.

There he -sought to raise an army of Indian soldiers from prisoners of war captured by Germany, forming the Free India Legion and the Azad Hind Radio. The Japanese ambassador, Oshima Hiroshi, kept Tokyo informed of these developments. From the very start of the war, the Japanese intelligence services noted from speaking to captured Indian soldiers that Bose was held in extremely high regard as a nationalist and was considered by Indian soldiers to be the <b>right</b> <b>person</b> to be leading a rebel army.|$|E

25|$|Rumsfeld {{resigned}} from Congress in 1969– his fourth term– to serve President Richard Nixon in his administration, {{and he would}} serve {{in a variety of}} executive branch positions throughout the Nixon presidency. In 1969, Nixon sought to reform and reorganize the United States Office of Economic Opportunity, an organization created during the Kennedy administration and greatly expanded as a part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs, rather than eliminate it outright. He appointed Rumsfeld Director of the organization with Cabinet rank. Rumsfeld had voted against the creation of OEO when he was in Congress, and initially rejected Nixon's offer, citing his own inherent belief that the OEO did more harm than good, and he felt that he was not the <b>right</b> <b>person</b> for the job. He only accepted after personal pleas from the president.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than one}} week later Glentoran {{appointed}} head coach Alan McDonald as manager. Roy Walker gracefully walked away but stated in the Belfast Telegraph {{that he would not}} rest until director of football Tom Dick stood down. Mr Dick then did so, but also criticised the club chairman Stafford Reynolds. Reynolds confirmed that he would step down if the <b>right</b> <b>person</b> could be found to take over. Alan McDonald, the new manager, has so far secured former Glentoran player Rory Hamill, Daryl Fordyce from Portsmouth, winger Jamie McGovern from West Bromwich Albion and Dungannon Swifts winger David Scullion and has re-signed Chris Morgan and Tim McCann. Darren Lockhart left the club at the time to join Crusaders on a one-year load deal along with defender Gary Smith. In January Glentoran managed to bring in Shane Mcabe from Dungannon and Darren Boyce from Coleraine.|$|E
25|$|Thompson and Governor James Withycombe, both Republicans, {{agreed that}} Bernard Daly, Lake County's long-time county judge and a Democrat, was the <b>right</b> <b>person</b> to be Lake County's new {{district}} court judge. As a result, {{just three days}} after the 1915 legislative session adjourned, Withycombe appointed Daly to Lake County's new district judge position. Thompson filed for re-election to his state senate in January 1916. He ran unopposed in the Republican primary. Shortly after the primary, he announced he would seek a second term as Senate President and began meeting with carry-over senators and Republican candidates for the senate. However, Thompson lost his senate seat in the general election to Judge George T. Baldwin of Klamath Falls by one vote. Thompson won Crook, Jefferson, and Lake counties with a 325-vote margin, but lost Klamath County by 326 votes. At the time, newspapers speculated that he may have lost his seat {{as a result of his}} litigation work dealing with disputed water rights in south central Oregon.|$|E

25|$|The main cast were {{designed}} by manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima, {{who at the time}} was working on the long-running manga series Oh My Goddess!. Before Fujishima joined the project, the characters had placeholder designs created by Red Company staff. There was resistance from Fujishima's editors due to his heavy work load, including his commitment to Oh My Goddess!. Sakura Wars was the first time Fujishima had ever worked with Sega or been associated with a Sega property, and he was skeptical due to state the project was in when he was first approached, being in a very early stage of development before story or gameplay mechanics had been finalized. Red Company's placeholder character designs were in place {{at a time when it}} was uncertain whether Fujishima would join, but Hiroi was adamant that Fujishima would be character designer. Fujishima eventually joined the project by the end of 1994, with his first design being for Sakura. His initial sketches for Sakura moved Hiroi to tears, and fully convinced both Red Company and Sega that Fujishima was the <b>right</b> <b>person.</b> The positive reception of Fujishima's work, together with his understanding for the project's goals, helped raise staff morale for the entire project.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{identification}} of a suspect can help police with their inquiries, and evidence of identification is accepted in some courts. The most approved method of identification is for the hound to jump up, and place its paws on the subject’s chest. In {{the case of a}} lost person or a known fugitive identification will not be significant, {{and in the case of}} a potentially violent, possibly armed, fugitive a bloodhound handler will not want his dog to approach the quarry for fear of injury to the bloodhound. Many bloodhounds reaching the end of a trail will show no interest in the person they have been trailing, and are difficult to train to identify. Leon Whitney recommended a method of initial training in which identification was the first thing learned, based on giving the young hound a scent-article from someone who walks a very short distance out of sight into a barn, where he stands with a piece of liver, while another person, also smelling of liver, stands nearby. The hound is led along the 'trail', and if it shows an inclination to go to the wrong person it is chastised, but gets the liver if it goes to the right one. When the hound goes to the <b>right</b> <b>person</b> almost infallibly, the number of people is increased, making the choice more difficult, and eventually the brief walks are extended into full trails.|$|E
