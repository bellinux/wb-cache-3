40|$|Exposure to {{particulate}} matter (PM) air pollution {{is associated with}} increased asthma morbidity. <b>Residual</b> oil <b>flash</b> ash (ROFA) is rich in water-soluble transition metals, which {{are involved in the}} pathological effects of PM. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of intranasal administration of ROFA on pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary responsiveness, and excess mucus production in a mouse model of chronic pulmonary allergic inflammation. BALB/c mice received intraperitoneal injections of ovalbumin (OVA) solution (days 1 and 14). OVA challenges were performed on days 22, 24, 26, and 28. After the challenge, mice were intranasally instilled with ROFA. After forty-eight hours, pulmonary responsiveness was performed. Mice were sacrificed, and lungs were removed for morphometric analysis. OVA-exposed mice presented eosinophilia in the bronchovas-cular space (p <. 001), increased pulmonary responsiveness (p <. 001), and epithelial remodeling (p =. 003). ROFA instillation increased pulmonary responsiveness (p =. 004) and decreased the area of ciliated cells in the airway epithelium (p =. 006). The combined ROFA instillation and OVA expo-sure induced a further increase in values of pulmonary responsiveness (p =. 043) and a decrease in the number of ciliated cells in the airway epithe-lium (p =. 017). PM exposure results in pulmonary effects that are more intense in mice with chronic allergic pulmonary inflammation...|$|R
