5|$|By 1944, Belgian collaborationist groups {{began to}} feel {{increasingly}} abandoned by the German government as the situation deteriorated. As resistance attacks against them escalated, collaborationist parties became more violent and launched <b>reprisals</b> against civilians, including the Courcelles Massacre in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Belgium in World War I, many Belgian workers {{had refused to}} work for the German administration as a form of passive resistance. This had led to large-scale <b>reprisals</b> against civilians as the occupiers had attempted to enforce their policies by armed force.|$|E
5|$|Operations {{against the}} Japanese {{observation}} posts began in June. On the {{fifth of the}} month a patrol of American troops attacked the position at Awul, causing its garrison to retreat into {{the centre of the}} island. Other attacks by the AIB force followed, and by early September all of the Japanese observation posts west of Wide Bay had been destroyed. Japanese troops conducted small scale <b>reprisals</b> against the native population of the Wide Bay hinterland, and the AIB officers attempted to persuade the population of this area to move inland before more severe <b>reprisals</b> were conducted.|$|E
50|$|Defense {{contractor}} employees seeking whistleblower <b>reprisal</b> protection {{must continue}} to report allegations directly to the DoDIG. The Defense Hotline is designated to receive <b>reprisal</b> complaints {{on behalf of the}} Directorate for Military <b>Reprisal</b> Investigations. They will determine if a complaint meets the criteria required to initiate a <b>reprisal</b> investigation. The MRI will notify the complainant in writing of their decision and tell the complainant specifically what action will be taken regarding the complaint.|$|R

5000|$|But the October 1998 {{revision}} to Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034 (10 USC 1034), the [...] "Military Whistleblower Protection Act", contained {{significant changes}} in how the Military Department Inspectors General and DODIG will process <b>reprisal</b> allegations. The most significant change is that Military Department IGs now {{have the authority to}} grant the protections of 10 USC 1034 to <b>reprisal</b> allegations they receive. This means that military members are no longer required to submit <b>reprisal</b> allegations directly with the DODIG for coverage under 10 USC 1034. Military Department IGs must notify the DODIG within ten working days of receiving <b>reprisal</b> allegations. The DODIG Directorate for Military <b>Reprisal</b> Investigations will maintain a system to track those notifications. Military Department IGs will then conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the allegations merit investigation under 10 USC 1034. All decisions by Military Department IGs not to investigate allegations of military Whistleblower <b>reprisal</b> are subject to the review and concurrence of the Director, DODIG Directorate for Military <b>Reprisal</b> Investigations. As before, all final reports of investigation under 10 USC 1034 must be approved by the Director, DODIG Directorate for Military <b>Reprisal</b> Investigations.|$|R
5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} German retreat from Southern France as German soldiers plundered and burned down towns. French civilians were brought before ad-hoc military courts {{and sentenced to}} death because of alleged partisan activities. These atrocities did not help to subdue the French uprising. Instead, the German <b>reprisals</b> had the opposite effect and encouraged the French population to engage in partisan fighting.|$|E
5|$|Belgium had {{pursued a}} policy of {{neutrality}} since its independence in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In World War I, the German Empire invaded Belgium. During the ensuing occupation, the Allies encouraged Belgian workers to resist the occupiers through non-compliance, leading to large-scale <b>reprisals</b> against Belgian civilians by the German army.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of Saturday 23–24 January, the rebels met at the Mission church in Mbombwe, where Chilembwe gave a speech {{stressing}} {{that none of them}} should expect to survive the <b>reprisals</b> that would follow the revolt but that the uprising would draw greater attention to their conditions and destabilise the colonial system. This, Chilembwe believed, was the only way change would ever occur.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the service}} IGs may also {{independently}} receive and investigate <b>reprisal</b> allegations, Title 10 U.S.C. 1034 charges the DoD IG with a critical oversight role—to approve any {{decision made by}} a service IG that investigation of military whistleblower <b>reprisal</b> is not warranted and to approve the results of all military whistleblower <b>reprisal</b> investigations conducted by service IGs. MRI has the primary authority and responsibility to conduct investigations concerning allegations of <b>reprisal</b> against military members, nonappropriated fund employees and Defense contractor employees. Military Members now {{have the option of}} directly contacting their Military Department Inspector General or reporting their complaints to the DODIG Directorate for Military <b>Reprisal</b> Investigations through the Defense Hotline.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} FY 2011, DoD IG merged the {{military}} <b>reprisal</b> investigations and civilian <b>reprisal</b> investigations into the newly established Whistleblower <b>Reprisal</b> Investigations Directorate within the Office of the Deputy Inspector General for Administrative Investigations. The consolidation of these directorates enabled DoD IG to increase efficiency and consistency in investigative procedures.|$|R
5000|$|The Civilian <b>Reprisal</b> Investigations (CRI) directorate, {{working in}} {{coordination}} with U.S. Office of Special Counsel, reviews and investigates allegations of <b>reprisal</b> filed by DoD appropriated fund civilian employees.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1790s, Paine fled from France to the United States, where he wrote Part III of The Age of Reason: An Examination of the Passages in the New Testament, Quoted from the Old and Called Prophecies Concerning Jesus Christ. Fearing {{unpleasant}} and even violent <b>reprisals,</b> Thomas Jefferson convinced {{him not to}} publish it in 1802; five years later Paine decided to publish despite the backlash he knew would ensue.|$|E
5|$|Later, the United Nations Security Council issued {{resolution}} 248 which {{condemned the}} Israeli raid on Jordanian territory and {{the violation of}} the cease-fire line, it recalled on resolutions 237 which had encouraged Israel {{to ensure the safety}} of civilians in military areas. The resolution affirmed that <b>reprisals</b> were not to be tolerated and that repetitions of such violations would have forced the Security Council to take further steps.|$|E
5|$|Low, {{like other}} pirates of the time, tried to intimidate his victims into {{surrendering}} {{by threatening to}} kill or torture them. The crew of the targeted ship would hinder the officers from defending the ship, so afraid were they of <b>reprisals.</b> One failed torture session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred.|$|E
5000|$|The Military <b>Reprisal</b> Investigations (MRI) {{directorate}} has {{the statutory}} responsibility to investigate allegations of whistleblower <b>reprisal</b> filed by military members, DoD non-appropriated fund employees, and DoD contractor employees.|$|R
5000|$|DoD {{component}} Inspectors General may accept <b>reprisal</b> allegations from nonappropriated fund employees. DoD Directive 1401.3, [...] "Reprisal Protection of Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality Employees/Applicants", revised on October 16, 2001, {{provides that}} DoD Component Inspectors General may accept <b>reprisal</b> allegations from nonappropriated fund employees. The Directive further provides that the Component Inspectors General must forward the <b>reprisal</b> allegations to the DODIG for resolution.|$|R
50|$|On October 24, 1776, Wickes {{was ordered}} by Congress {{to proceed to}} Nantes, France, in <b>Reprisal,</b> taking to his post Benjamin Franklin, who had been {{appointed}} Commissioner to France. Franklin brought two of his grandsons, Temple Bache and Benjamin Franklin Bache. <b>Reprisal</b> afterwards was to cruise in the English Channel. En route to France, <b>Reprisal</b> captured two brigs, reaching Nantes on November 29. <b>Reprisal</b> was the first vessel of the Continental Navy to arrive in European waters. She set sail again about the middle of January 1777, cruising {{along the coast of}} Spain, in the Bay of Biscay and in the mouth of the English Channel. On February 5, <b>Reprisal</b> captured the Lisbon packet, two days out of Falmouth, after a hard fight of 40 minutes, in which two officers of <b>Reprisal</b> were seriously wounded and one man killed. Five other prizes were captured on this cruise, which ended on February 14.|$|R
5|$|On 16 September 2005, Danish {{news service}} Ritzau {{published}} an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer Kåre Bluitgen, who was initially unable to find an illustrator prepared {{to work on his}} children's book The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad (Danish:Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv). Three artists declined Bluitgen's proposal out of fear of <b>reprisals.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{specific}} events have attracted the help and attention of Weiquan activists. In the March 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province, shoddy school construction {{resulted in the}} collapse of several schools full of students. A number of Weiquan lawyers, including Tan Zuoren, were involved in advocating for the rights of parents, and in investigating allegations that corrupt officials were responsible for the poor construction. Parents and lawyers met with <b>reprisals</b> from Chinese officials for their activism.|$|E
5|$|Although press freedoms have {{improved}} {{since the first}} decade of the 21st century, the press is corrupt and beholden to special interests and political groups. Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government <b>reprisals.</b> The major radio and television stations are state-run and other communications, such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, are largely under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since {{the first decade of}} the 21st century and are largely unregulated.|$|E
50|$|DoD IG {{currently}} has five cases of alleged <b>reprisal</b> against civilian {{employees of the}} intelligence community engaged in national intelligence work and ten cases of alleged <b>reprisal</b> against civilians engaged in military intelligence work.|$|R
50|$|On September 14, 1777, <b>Reprisal</b> left France, for the United States. About October 1, <b>Reprisal</b> {{was lost}} off {{the banks of}} Newfoundland and all 129 on board, except the cook, went down with her.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the second}} half of FY 2010, CRI {{continued}} to select cases involving protected disclosures in five core mission areas: aviation maintenance, health and welfare of service members deployed or returning from Southwest Asia, chemical weapons safety, supply logistics, and intelligence operations. DoD IG investigated <b>reprisal</b> allegations involving civilian employees of the military departments and the Defense Intelligence Agency. With respect to the intelligence and counterintelligence communities, DoD IG conducted two oversight actions on Defense Intelligence Agency investigations and completed a full investigation into alleged <b>reprisal</b> within the Department of the Navy. Other activities reviewed included alleged <b>reprisal</b> against sources reporting avionics maintenance, emergency response planning, supply management, and media access violations. On September 30, 2010, DoD IG had 21 open cases and one oversight action. During {{the second half}} of FY 2010, DoD IG conducted 48 intakes, accepted five complaints for investigation, and closed 10 investigations, substantiating 4 cases of <b>reprisal.</b> Twenty-seven percent of open DoD IG civilian <b>reprisal</b> cases involve intelligence or counterintelligence activities and the remaining cases involve procurement fraud sources. Examples of substantiated civilian whistleblower <b>reprisal</b> cases: ...|$|R
5|$|During the Civil War {{the largest}} {{substantial}} {{conflict in the}} area was the Battle of Naseby in 1645, although a minor skirmish in the town resulted {{in the killing of}} a parliamentarian officer Captain John Sawyer. Severe <b>reprisals</b> followed which included the carrying off to Northampton of the parish priest, Thomas Jones, and 40 prisoners by a group of Roundheads. However, after the Civil War Wellingborough was home to a colony of Diggers. Little is known about this period.|$|E
5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1778, Brant {{achieved}} an undeserved reputation for brutality. He {{was not present}} at Wyoming — although many thought he was — and he actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley. Diaries belonging to British soldiers during the campaign state the regiment as being the butchers and given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition, there is controversy with whom actually ordered or failed to restrain the killings. The massacre contributed to calls for <b>reprisals,</b> leading to the 1779 Sullivan Expedition which drove the Iroquois out of western New York.|$|E
5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighboring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF <b>reprisals</b> for the Rwandan Genocide. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire, and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the Interahamwe paramilitary group. By late 1996, the Hutu militants represented a serious threat to the new Rwandan regime, and Kagame launched a counteroffensive.|$|E
5000|$|The {{letter of}} marque and <b>reprisal</b> first arose in 1295, 50 years after wartime {{privateer}} licenses were first issued. According to Grotius, letters of marque and <b>reprisal</b> were akin to a [...] "private war", a concept alien to modern sensibilities but related to an age when the ocean was lawless and all merchant vessels sailed armed for self-defense. A <b>reprisal</b> involved seeking the sovereign's permission to exact private retribution against some foreign prince or subject. The earliest instance of a licensed <b>reprisal</b> recorded in England was in the year 1295 under the reign of Edward I. The notion of <b>reprisal,</b> and behind it that just war involved avenging a wrong, clung to the {{letter of marque}} until 1620 in England, in that to apply for one a shipowner had {{to submit to the}} Admiralty Court an estimate of actual losses.|$|R
5000|$|An Army {{sergeant}} alleged {{his first}} sergeant recommended {{him for an}} Article 15 in <b>reprisal</b> for reporting unsafe conditions during a field exercise to an inspector general. An Army investigation substantiated <b>reprisal</b> against the first sergeant.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "letter of marque and reprisal" [...] {{would include}} {{permission}} to cross an international border {{to effect a}} <b>reprisal</b> (take some action against an attack or injury) authorized by an issuing jurisdiction to conduct <b>reprisal</b> operations outside its borders.|$|R
5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF <b>reprisals</b> for the Rwandan genocide. The camps were crowded and squalid, and thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including cholera and dysentery. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide, who began rearming in a bid to return to power in Rwanda.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent <b>reprisals</b> by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Dhondup Wangchen {{and friend}} Jigme Gyatso, a senior Tibetan monk, {{conceived}} of a documentary interviewing ordinary Tibetan {{people on their}} views of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government in the year {{leading up to the}} 2008 Beijing Olympics. The documentary was to be called Leaving Fear Behind. The pair coordinated their efforts with a Dhondup Wangchen's cousin Gyaljong Tsetrin, who remained in Switzerland. In preparation for likely <b>reprisals</b> by the Chinese government, Dhondup Wangchen moved his wife, Llamo Tso, and their four children to Dharamsala, India.|$|E
5000|$|Nearly 40 {{percent of}} senior {{official}} cases and 33 percent of civilian <b>reprisal</b> cases were {{of interest to}} the Congress and the Secretary of Defense; the majority of military <b>reprisal</b> cases involving congressional interest were answered by the service IGs; ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{civilian}} engineer {{assigned to}} an office engaged in developing biometrics technology alleged constructive termination in <b>reprisal</b> for disclosures of fraud, waste, abuse, and gross mismanagement associated with the fielding of various biometric products and systems.
