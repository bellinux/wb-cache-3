40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the low {{pressure}} environment of commercial aircraft, hypoxaemia may be common and accentuated in patients with lung or heart disease. Regulations specify a cabin pressure not lower than 750 hPa {{but it is not}} known whether this standard is met. This knowledge is important in determining the hazards of commercial flight for patients and the validity of current flight simulation tests. METHODS: Using a wrist-watch <b>recording</b> <b>altimeter,</b> cabin pressure was recorded at 60 s intervals on 45 flights in Boeing 747 - 400 aircraft with three airlines. A log was kept of aircraft altitude using the in-flight display. Change in cabin pressure during flight, relationship between aircraft altitude and cabin pressure and proportion of flight time with cabin pressure approaching the minimum specified by regulation were determined. RESULTS: Flight duration averaged 10 h. Average cabin pressure during flight was 846 hPa. There was a linear fall in cabin pressure as the aircraft cruising altitude increased. At 10, 300 m (34, 000 ft) cabin pressure was 843 hPa and changed 8 hPa for every 300 m (1000 ft) change in aircraft altitude (r(2) = 0. 993; P < 0. 001). Lowest cabin pressure was 792 hPa at 12 200 m (40, 000 ft) but during only 2 % of flight time was cabin pressure less than 800 hPa. CONCLUSIONS: Cabin pressure is determined only by the engineering of the aircraft and its altitude and {{in the present study was}} always higher than required by regulation. Current fitness-to-fly evaluations simulate cabin conditions that passengers will not experience on these aircraft. There may be increased risks to patients should new or older aircraft operate nearer to the present minimum standard. 5 page(s...|$|E

40|$|This {{article has}} been {{submitted}} to Hydrology and Earth System SciencesThis article presents the use of new remote sensing data acquired from airborne full-waveform lidar systems. They are active sensors which <b>record</b> <b>altimeter</b> profiles. This paper introduces a set of methodologies for processing these data. These techniques are then applied to a particular landscape, the badlands, but the methodologies {{are designed to be}} applied to any other landscape. Indeed, the knowledge of an accurate topography and a landcover classification is a prior knowledge for any hydrological and erosion model. Badlands tend to be the most significant areas of erosion in the world with the highest erosion rate values. Monitoring and predicting erosion within badland mountainous catchments is highly strategic due to the arising downstream consequences and the need for natural hazard mitigation engineering. Additionaly, beyond the altimeter information, full-waveform lidar data are processed to extract intensity and width of echoes. They are related to the target reflectance and geometry. Wa will investigate the relevancy of using lidar-derived Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and to investigate the potentiality of the intensity and width information for 3 D landcover classification. Considering the novelty and the complexity of such data, they are presented in details as well as guidelines to process them. DTMs are then validated with field measurements. The morphological validation of DTMs is then performed via the computation of hydrological indexes and photo-interpretation. Finally, a 3 D landcover classification is performed using a Support Vector Machine classifier. The introduction of an ortho-rectified optical image in the classification process as well as full-waveform lidar data for hydrological purposes is then discussed...|$|R

The Southeast Asian sea regional sea level trends {{are some of the}} highest observed in the modern satellite <b>altimeter</b> <b>record</b> that now spans almost 2 decades. Initial comparisons of global sea level reconstructions find that 17 -year sea level trends over the past 60 years exhibit good agreement with decadal variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and related fluctuations of trade winds in the region. The Southeast Asian sea region exhibits sea level trends that vary dramatically over the studied time period. This historical variation suggests that the strong regional sea level trends observed during the modern satellite <b>altimeter</b> <b>record</b> will abate as trade winds fluctuate on decadal and longer timescales. Furthermore, after removing the contribution of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) to sea level trends in the past 20 years, the rate of sea level rise is greatly reduced in the Southeast Asian sea region. As a result of the influence of the PDO, the Southeast Asian sea regional sea level trends during the 2010 s and 2020 s are likely to be less than the global mean sea level (GMSL) trend if the observed oscillations in wind forcing and sea level persist. Nevertheless, long-term sea level trends in the Southeast Asian seas will continue to be affected by GMSL rise occurring now and in the future...|$|R

After the remarkably successful 13 -years of mapping the ocean surface T/P lost its ability to maneuver and was de-commissioned January 2006. T/P revolutionized the study of the Earth s oceans by vastly exceeding pre-launch estimates of surface height accuracy recoverable from radar altimeter measurements.

The expected quality of orbit knowledge had limited the measurement accuracy expectations of past altimeter missions, and still remains a major component in the error budget of all altimeter missions.

40|$|International audienceThe {{exponential}} {{increase in}} the use of altimeter data in oceanographic studies {{in the past two decades}} has improved the knowledge of the processes that govern the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere. One of these processes is the response of the ocean to atmospheric pressure variations, which has been deeply analysed in the past. That response is based on the isostatic assumption used to establish a standard correction for altimetric purposes, the Inverse Barometer Correction (IBC). As a general rule, the ocean goes up/down 1 cm when the atmospheric pressure goes down/up 1 mbar. However, in light of recent works in some oceanic regions, discrepancies arise when the real response is compared to the hypothetical one. It is important to quantify this discrepancy, in order to improve the accuracy of the correction, which is one of the most significant geophysical corrections applied to <b>altimeter</b> <b>records.</b> Some aspects of this response remain unclear, such as the real space-temporal scales where IBC can be applied, the influence of wind, non-isostatic atmospheric pressure-driven signals, and the effect of aliasing from high frequency signals. This paper is an attempt to gain insight into this phenomenon. The data used are the residuals obtained between sea surface heights from the ERS- 2 altimeter and the outputs of a global barotropic ocean model. Significant departures from the hypothetical isostatic response in all data series (spatial and temporal domain) have been found, especially in the case of <b>altimeter</b> <b>records.</b> By applying the collinear track method, we observe that the estimated Atlantic Ocean response is quite similar to the one deduced from the isostatic assumption at all latitudinal bands. Nonetheless, the Indian and Pacific Oceans show important departures from the hypothetical value at low latitudes. Results obtained with the crossover track method show important deviations at low latitudes in the three basins. In order to understand why the Atlantic Ocean response is different from the one obtained in the other two, we can infer some explanations based on the interaction of seasonal and intraseasonal signals with the isostatic one.

It was generated in the Indian Ocean off the western coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia at 0 : 58 : 53 (GMT) by one of the largest earthquake of the century with a moment magnitude of Mw = 9. 3. In the study, we focus on best fitted tsunami source for tsunami modeling based on geophysical and seismological data, and the use of accurate bathymetry and topography data. Then, we simulate the large scale features of the tsunami propagation, runup and inundation. The numerical simulation is performed using the GEOWAVE model. GEOWAVE consists of two components: the modeling of the tusnami source (Okada, 1985) and the initial tsunami surface elevation, and the computation of the wave propagation and inundation based on fully nonlinear Boussinesq scheme.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} interannual climate {{variability}} and {{change on the}} historic, directional wave climate of the Southern Hemisphere is presented. Owing {{to a lack of}} in situ wave observations, wave climate in the Southern Hemisphere is determined from satellite altimetry and global ocean wave models. Altimeter data span the period 1985 to present, {{with the exception of a}} 2 -year gap in 1989 â 1991. Interannual variability and trends in the significant wave height are determined from the satellite <b>altimeter</b> <b>record</b> (1991 to present), and the dominant modes of variability are identified using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. Significant wave heights in the Southern Ocean are observed to show a strong positive correlation with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), particularly during Austral autumn and winter months. Correlation between altimeter derived significant wave heights and the Southern Oscillation Index is observed in the Pacific basin, which is consistent with several previous studies. Variability and trends of the directional wave climate are determined using the ERA- 40 Waves Re-analysis for the period 1980 â 2001. Significant wave height, mean wave period and mean wave direction data are used to describe the climate of the wave energy flux vector. An EOF analysis of the wave energy flux vector is carried out to determine the dominant modes of variability of the directional seasonal wave energy flux climate. The dominant mode of variability during autumn and winter months is strongly correlated to the SAM.

An instrumented quadrapod frame moored approximately 43. 5 km {{off the coast}} of Wilmington, NC in Onslow Bay, at a depth of approximately 30 m, was present on the shelf when the hurricane passed approximately 160 km from Onslow Bay.

Simultaneous measurements of flow velocities from the surface to the seabed along with acoustic backscatter measurements and seabed elevation were obtained during this storm event. Three days prior to the direct effects of the hurricane, long-period swells (14 â 17 s) began to impact the area causing sediment transport to occur on the mid-shelf.

Further, it is found that these life cycles can be accurately modeled in terms of the large-amplitude excursions of a stochastic process.

The basic qualitative and quantitative statistical properties of these series can be remarkably well reproduced with an extremely simple stochastic model, in which the SSH increments between successive time points are random numbers, and the eddy life cycles are represented by excursions exceeding a given threshold.

Tide gauge measurements have a long temporal record but limited spatial coverage and satellite altimetry provides global measurements but has only been available for 20 years. Reconstructions extend spatially dense datasets, such as those from satellite altimetry, by decomposing the dataset into basis functions and fitting those functions to in-situ tide gauge measurements with a longer temporal record. A longer temporal record allows one to separate signals that cannot be found in the relatively short <b>altimeter</b> <b>record.</b> However, the fidelity and utility of sea level reconstructions is still a topic of discussion. I compare and evaluate two methods for reconstructing sea level and show how reconstructions can be beneficial where other sea level datasets are limited. The compared sea level reconstruction methods differ in the technique for calculating basis functions, i. e. empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) versus cyclostationary EOFs (CSEOFs). Additionally, I use published sea level reconstruction datasets to analyze changes in the North Equatorial Current bifurcation point, in regional trends in the Southeast Asian Seas, and in the contribution of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) to global sea level over the last 60 years. These results give direction for making high quality sea level reconstructions and identify significant scientific findings made possible through reconstructing sea level.

Tide-gauge data from Diego Garcia (1988 â 2000, and 2003 â 2011) show no statistically significant long-term rise, whilst the rates of rise obtained from the satellite <b>altimeter</b> <b>record</b> for 1993 â 2011 span the range of 0. 16 â 4. 56 mm yrâ 1 in the surrounding sea areas (70 â 74 Â°E and 4 â 9 Â°S) and are also consistent with a zero rate except in the far south of the region. The dominant feature is one of considerable inter-annual variability in {{mean sea level}} of up to ~ 10 cm, such that the very weak seasonal pattern of highest and lowest sea level in February and May respectively, is absent or reversed in some years. The Indian Ocean Dipole appears to exert an important influence on mean sea level in the area, with positive and negative dipole mode indices preceding periods of elevated or lowered sea levels respectively. The Chagos also lie outside the Indian Ocean cyclone belt and experience relatively low wind speeds, {{and there is no}} evidence of changes in the wind or wave environment in the past 20 years. Although in an area of seismic activity, there is no record of island subsidence, indeed on Diego Garcia minor crustal uplift of 0. 63 Â± 0. 28 SE mm yrâ 1 has occurred between 1996 and 2009. Collectively, these results suggest that this has been a relatively stable physical environment, and that these low-lying coral islands should continue to be able to support human habitation, as they have done for much of the last 200 years. Nonetheless, future sea-level rise and its effect on the Chagos remains an important issue for further studies such as those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change...|$|R
40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{formation of}} a large (500 - 800 km diameter) anticyclonic eddy in the upper 300 - 400 m of the eastern Arabian Sea during the northest monsoon period (December-April) is indicated fom hydrographic and satellite altimetry sea level observations, {{as well as from}} numerical model experiments. The center of the eddy circulation is approximately 10 deg N, 70 deg E, just {{to the west of the}} north-south Laccadive Island chain. In this paper the eddy is called the Laccadive High (LH). In some ways it is like a mirrorlike counterpart to the Great Whirl that develops during the southwest monsoon of the Somali coast (western Arabian Sea). The LH occurs at the same latitude but on the opposite side of the basin during the reversed monsoon. It is different from the Great Whirl, however, in its formation process, its intensity, and its decay. The hydrographic data obtained from surveys all during a single season give sufficiently close station spacing to allow reasonable contouring of the geopotential surfaces and of the properties within and around the LH region with minimum time aliasing. The Geostat <b>altimeter</b> <b>record</b> extends over 4 years, during which the seasonal variability of the LH indicates a dynamic relief of approximately 15 - 20 cm, which is in good agreement with the hydrographics observations. The altimetry time series also suggests a westward translation of the LH by January with a subsequent dissipation in midbasin. The model used is a wind-forced three-layer primitive equation model which depicts a LH agreement with the timing, position, and amplitude of both the hydrographic and altimetric measurements. The numerical simulation includes a passive tracer located in the Western Bay of Bengal; the western advection of the tracer around the south coasts of Sri Lanka and India in December and January is consistent with the appearance of low-salinity water observed to extend into the Arabian Sea during this period. The modeling studies suggest that both local and remote forcing are important in formation of the LH...|$|R
40|$|Satellites {{are used}} to study various oceanic phenomena, {{including}} sea surface temperature, color, and sea height variability (which is related to oceanic currents). In observing sea height variability from radar altimeters, three methods of analysis can be applied. They are the collinear or repeat track method, the cross-over difference method, and the mean sea surface method. All three are designed to remove the effects of geoid undulations from the <b>altimeter</b> <b>records.</b> This paper compares the collinear method with the mean sea surface method in a small geographic area. Both methods analyze the tracks of collinear altimeter data by subtracting a mean pass and a best fit quadratic curve. Geoid variability is effectively removed by subtracting the mean pass, while the quadratic curve removal eliminates remaining long wavelength orbit error and tidal signals. The {{difference between the two}} methods is in the mean pass that is subtracted. The collinear mean is computed from a point by point average of the collinear data taken from one month of the SEASAT mission. The mean sea surface method subtracts a mean pass derived from a global mean sea surface developed from cross-over data from the 3. 5 year GEOS- 3 and the full 3. 5 month SEASAT missions. After this processing, the residual data from these methods are compared in the spatial and spectral (wavenumber) domains. In the region of 1 0 ~ 2 cycles per kilometer, a spectral analysis will yield energy primarily from oceanic variability and eddy currents. Over all wavenumbers, the two methods compared qualitatively. Quantitatively the mean sea surface residuals had an order of magnitude higher variance than the collinear mean residuals. This was true at all wavenumbers except in the region of 10 - 2 cycles per kilometer, where the mean sea surface residuals still had more power, but only by a factor of two or three. This is significant because this region is thought to contain the peak amount of power from oceanic signals. With more data {{it may be possible to}} completely and accurately define a mean sea surface suitable for the detection of various oceanic phenomena with a single pass of a satellite altimeter. It is concluded from this study that this cannot be done with the presently available mean sea surface...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in understanding the present and future regional and global sea level in the 2 years since the publication of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR 5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Here, we evaluate how the new results affect the AR 5 âs assessment of (i) historical sea level rise, including attribution of that rise and implications for the sea level budget, (ii) projections of the components and of total global mean sea level (GMSL), and (iii) projections of regional variability and emergence of the anthropogenic signal. In each of these cases, new work largely provides additional evidence in support of the AR 5 assessment, providing greater confidence in those findings. Recent analyses confirm the twentieth century sea level rise, with some analyses showing a slightly smaller rate before 1990 and some a slightly larger value than reported in the AR 5. There is now more evidence of an acceleration in the rate of rise. Ongoing ocean heat uptake and associated thermal expansion have continued since 2000, and are consistent with ocean thermal expansion reported in the AR 5. A significant amount of heat is being stored deeper in the water column, with a larger rate of heat uptake since 2000 compared to the previous decades and with the largest storage in the Southern Ocean. The first formal detection studies for ocean thermal expansion and glacier mass loss since the AR 5 have confirmed the AR 5 finding of a significant anthropogenic contribution to sea level rise over the last 50 years. New projections of glacier loss from two regions suggest smaller contributions to GMSL rise from these regions than in studies assessed by the AR 5; additional regional studies are required to further assess whether there are broader implications of these results. Mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet, primarily as a result of increased surface melting, and from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, primarily as a result of increased ice discharge, has accelerated. The largest estimates of acceleration in mass loss from the two ice sheets for 2003 â 2013 equal or exceed the acceleration of GMSL rise calculated from the satellite <b>altimeter</b> sea level <b>record</b> over the longer period of 1993 â 2014. However, when increased mass gain in land water storage and parts of East Antarctica, and decreased mass loss from glaciers in Alaska and some other regions are taken into account, the net acceleration in the ocean mass gain is consistent with the satellite <b>altimeter</b> <b>record.</b> New studies suggest that a marine ice sheet instability (MISI) may have been initiated in parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), but that it will affect only a limited number of ice streams in the twenty-first century. New projections of mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets by 2100, including a contribution from parts of WAIS undergoing unstable retreat, suggest a contribution that falls largely within the likely range (i. e., two thirds probability) of the AR 5. These new results increase confidence in the AR 5 likely range, indicating that there is a greater probability that sea level rise by 2100 will lie in this range with a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of an additional contribution of several tens of centimeters above the likely range. In view of the comparatively limited state of knowledge and understanding of rapid ice sheet dynamics, we continue to think that it is not yet possible to make reliable quantitative estimates of future GMSL rise outside the likely range. Projections of twenty-first century GMSL rise published since the AR 5 depend on results from expert elicitation, but we have low confidence in conclusions based on these approaches. New work on regional projections and emergence of the anthropogenic signal suggests that the two commonly predicted features of future regional sea level change (the increasing tilt across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the dipole in the North Atlantic) are related to regional changes in wind stress and surface heat flux. Moreover, it is expected that sea level change in response to anthropogenic forcing, particularly in regions of relatively low unforced variability such as the low-latitude Atlantic, will be detectable over most of the ocean by 2040. The east-west contrast of sea level trends in the Pacific observed since the early 1990 s cannot be satisfactorily accounted for by climate models, nor yet definitively attributed either to unforced variability or forced climate change...|$|R
