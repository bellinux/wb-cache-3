[...] It was {{important}} to Werfel {{to show that the}} Young Turks and the Three Pashas, did not represent Turkish society. It was also important to show that Enver was right on certain points in regard to the Western powers, which had exploited Turkey and treated it throughout the nineteenth century as a virtual colony. Most of the first chapter of Book Three is written as a dramatic dialogue, during which Lepsius witnesses the Sufi whirling devotions and learns first-hand about the deep resentment against the West—- especially Western [...] "progress" [...] as instituted by the Young Turks—- and the atrocities in concentration camps set up in the Mesopotamian desert for deported Armenians. He also encounters Bagradian's friend, Agha Rifaat Bereket. The latter agrees to bring supplies to Musa Dagh, purchased with funds collected by Lepsius in Germany. The episode ends with Lepsius witnessing Enver and Talaat being driven past in a limousine. When the car suffers two loud tire punctures, Lepsius at first thinks they have been assassinated (which foreshadows the <b>real</b> <b>deaths</b> of Talaat and Djemal Pasha by Armenian assassins).|$|E
6000|$|But {{most people}} could not {{comprehend}} these sorrows. There was a frivolous exultation in death for its own sake, which was at bottom an inability {{to realize that the}} deaths were <b>real</b> <b>deaths</b> and not stage ones.

At such moments {{it became clear that the}} deaths they had not seen meant no more to them than the mimic death of the cinema screen. Sometimes it was not necessary that death should be actually witnessed: it had only to take place under circumstances of sufficient novelty and proximity to bring it home almost as sensationally and effectively as if it had been actually visible.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing {{interest}} in studying the socio-economic inequalities in health and the economic benefits of reducing these inequalities. In this paper we use longitudinal data from SHARE survey to estimate the age and sex specific mortality rates by socioeconomic status (SES) for 11 European countries with the aim of studying the benefits of reducing mortality in the most disadvantaged classes. We start with the accurate description of existing inequalities by estimating the influence of the household total net worth (used as a proxy of SES) on mortality between waves using Cox survival regression models. In a second step, we construct life tables for each combination of country, sex and SES, and we estimated the number of <b>real</b> <b>deaths</b> in the population. Then, some "inequality reduction" scenarios are depicted by reducing the SES gradient for each country and providing an estimate of the hypothetical saved life-years. The same has been done using education as a proxy of SES...|$|E
