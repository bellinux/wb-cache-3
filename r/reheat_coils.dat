40|$|Since {{terminal}} boxes {{do not have}} a modulation damper in constant volume (CV) air handling unit (AHU) systems, zone <b>reheat</b> <b>coils</b> have to be modulated to maintain the space temperature with constant supply airflow. This conventional control sequence causes a significant amount of reheat and constant fan power under partial load conditions. Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) can be installed on these constant air volume systems. The fan speed can be modulated based on the maximum zone load. This paper present the procedure to control the supply fan speed and analyzes the thermal performance and major fan energy and thermal energy savings without expensive VAV retrofit through the actual system operation...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} whether the Level 2 of Balai Ungku Aziz, a faculty building of the Oral Biology Department in the Dental Faculty of University of Malaya, exhibits the Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) and meet the standards for Indoor Air Quality as specified by ASHRAE. It is significant to conduct this research because no similar investigation has been carried out for a tropical building in Malaysia. The study covers only level 2 of the building, where the computer lab, dean’s office and the library are located. Among the topics studied are the overview of the air conditioning system used in the building, load calculations, capacity measurements and other analyses that will provide Mechanical and Electrical (M&E) designers {{a better understanding of the}} air conditioning systems used in a typical tropical building. From the research conducted, it was shown, preliminary, that the Balai Ungku Aziz did not exhibit SBS as the ventilation was sufficiently high and thus, CO 2 concentration was low. But further investigation for CO, Formaldehyde and TVOC studies needed to confirm SBS effect on occupants as we had limited number of IAQ and IEQ equipment in hand during studies. The calculations have brought the measured specifications of the air conditioning system closer to the design specifications. Based on the result obtained, the room temperature is slightly cooler than the thermal comfort zone recommended by ASHRAE. Therefore, it is suggested that some adjustments on the HVAC design, including the use of <b>reheat</b> <b>coils,</b> should be done on the system to meet the standard. This can lead to better energy efficiency and cost effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|In the U. S. A Variable Air Volume (VAV) {{system is}} one of most {{commonly}} used air system for multiple-zone commercial buildings due to its capability to meet the varying heating and cooling loads of different building thermal zones. One of key component of VAV system is the terminal VAV box. There are an air damper and a <b>reheat</b> <b>coil</b> in the box. How to effectively and efficiently control the VAV box {{plays a significant role}} to reduce energy consumption and maintain acceptable indoor environment in buildings. Currently, there are two control logics used for controlling VAV box, namely, single maximum and dual maximum control logics. The single maximum logic is the most common, where the room temperature setpoint is maintained by only adjusting the <b>reheat</b> <b>coil</b> valve position in the heating model. The damper position is kept as the minimal to satisfy the ventilation requirement only. On the other hand, the more advanced dual maximum control logic realizes the room air temperature control by adjusting both damper position and <b>reheat</b> <b>coil</b> valve position in the heating model. For the cooling model, both control logics have the same action to maintain room air temperature setpoint through adjusting the damper position. Â In this study, a model-based optimal control is explored to minimize the energy consumption of the VAV box with a hot water <b>reheat</b> <b>coil.</b> Data driven approach based on an Autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model is investigated to represent dynamics of the room thermal response. The similar data-driven approach is used to develop an energy consumption model of the VAV box. Measured data for the VAV box from a real building is used to train and test data-driven model. Such data includes room air temperature, outdoor air temperature, supply air temperature, supply air flow rate, damper position, <b>reheat</b> <b>coil</b> valve position and VAV box energy consumption. A platform of AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming) is used to for mathematical modeling and links to different optimization solvers. Â In addition, uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis are conducted to help understand the model behaviors and performance. In this study, the Monte Carlo sampling method is applied to generate samples for model inputs including supply air temperature, outdoor conditions, etc. A quantified sensitivity index of Sobol is calculated to indicate the impact level from different inputs or disturbances...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to test a method of {{integrating}} solar heating with a small commercial air handling unit (AHU). In order to accomplish this a heat exchanger {{was placed in the}} reheat position of the AHU and piped to the solar heating system. This heat exchanger is used to supplement or replace the existing electric reheat. This method was chosen for its ability to utilize solar energy on a more year round basis when compared to a traditional heating system. It allows solar heating to be used for direct heating during winter and for reheating in hot humid summer weather. Data was taken for seven days without the solar <b>reheat</b> <b>coil</b> (SRC) in place and for eleven days with the SRC in place. For this project two similar days (one with the SRC and one without) were compared and contrasted to determine the feasibility of a solar reheat system. The results have shown that the SRC reduced the electric consumption in the electric <b>reheat</b> <b>coil.</b> There were two main indicators of the energy reduction. First, energy consumption of the electric heater relative to the total energy consumed fell from 33 % to 16 % {{with the use of the}} SRC over a 12 -hour period. Secondly, on September 5, 2009 the solar <b>reheat</b> <b>coil</b> saved almost 10 kWh, over 25 % of the heater energy required for 24 hour operation. This project has resulted in a working prototype for solar powered reheat. With a few modifications this system will prove useful in future research. With solar assisted reheat being one of only a few acceptable forms of reheat for ASHRAE 90. 1 (2007), interest in this topic will continue to grow and further research will be necessary. Therefore, this project has put Purdue University and the Applied Energy Laboratory (AEL) in a position to be a frontrunner in the up and coming field of solar assisted reheat research...|$|R

40|$|The {{lecture hall}} of the Richardson Petroleum Building at Texas A&M University is a large lecture hall, with a total floor area of {{approximately}} 2500 ft^ 2. The lecture hall was served by a constant air volume (CAV) air handling unit (AHU) which had no <b>reheat</b> <b>coil.</b> This resulted in high room humidity levels although the room temperature was satisfied for part load conditions, especially when {{there was very little}} sensible load from the room. This paper presents Continuous Commissioning efforts (CC), which turned this inefficient, humid lecture hall into a comfortable learning environment.

40|$|Hysteresis and {{nonlinearity}} {{exist in}} most valves that are utilized in building HVAC systems, {{such as in}} cooling or heating coil valves. The hysteresis mainly comes from the manufacturing clearance in an actuator gearbox and nonlinearity in the variation of the regulated flow with respect to control signal originates from valve design. The combination of valve hysteresis and nonlinearity poses significant difficulties in obtaining a satisfactory control performance when utilizing a conventional PI controller. This paper presents experimental testing results {{of a set of}} valves in an operating HVAC system serving an office building. The test valves include VAV <b>reheat</b> <b>coil</b> and AHU cooling coil valves provided by two main-stream manufacturers. Open-loop experiments were carried out {{that can be used to}} analyze the valve performance in terms of hysteresis and nonlinearity. Valve closed-loop performance was also investigated and the results showed that valves with significant hysteresis and nonlinear characteristics could lead to unsatisfactory supply air or zone air temperature controls with severe temperature oscillation and control chattering. ...|$|R

40|$|The VAV {{terminal}} unit with variable-speed (VS) fan and <b>reheat</b> <b>coil</b> is an air system {{terminal unit}} {{consisting of a}} variable speed fan in series with a heating coil. These units are usually employed in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems where the air is supplied at low static pressure through an underfloor plenum. The fan is used to control the flow of conditioned air that enters the space. When the fan is off the plenum pressure drives the minimum air flow through the terminal unit. At maximum cooling the fan runs at its maximum speed. At full heating the fan runs at its heating maximum – usually less than the cooling maximum flow rate. Thus this unit has two separate maximum flow rates – one for heating and one for cooling. For cooling, control is maintained simply by varying the fan speed. For heating, the unit first tries to meet the heating load by varying the heating coil output while keeping the air flow at minimum (fan off). If this is not adequate the fan turns on and operates in variable flow mode up to the heating maximum flow rate. This unit is modeled in EnergyPlus as a compound component – a variable speed fan and a heating coil in series in the air stream. The unit is blow through – the fan is upstream of the heating coil. ...|$|R
40|$|Choosing {{the right}} control {{strategies}} {{is an important}} task for effective operation of variable air volume reheat (VAVR) system in commercial buildings. In this design, dampers’ position inside air terminal units (ATUs) are modulated to adjust the amount of air supply volume based on thermal zones’ cooling or heating demand. A minimum air flow fraction (MAFF) is set for damper settings of ATUs to avoid under-ventilation problem in thermal zones. This study investigated the impact of MAFF value on various performance aspects of multiple-zone VAVR design in different building applications and climate types. A five-storey commercial building for three applications of school, office and retail in four climate types of tropical monsoon, hot desert, Mediterranean and humid continental have been simulated in EnergyPlus building simulation software. The results of simulations have shown that lowering MAFF value in ATUs would reduce the required <b>reheat</b> <b>coil</b> energy to maintain precise air supply temperature at part load cooling scenarios. Nonetheless, this reduction could have some implications on thermal comfort and indoor air quality level of thermal zones in a multiple-zone arrangement. It was concluded that in general it is an energy efficient control strategy to keep MAFF value to as low as 0. 1 for high ventilation rate spaces like classrooms in school buildings (except for hot desert climate). On the other hand, it is advisable to not reduce MAFF value below 0. 3 for low ventilation rate spaces like office areas to avoid any air quality issues in thermal zones...|$|R
40|$|The Need and the Opportunity Codes such as ASHRAE 90. 2 and IECC, and {{programs}} such as Energy Star and Builders Challenge, are causing new homes to be built to higher performance standards. As a result sensible cooling loads in new homes are going down, but indoor air quality prerogatives are causing ventilation rates and moisture loads to increase in humid climates. Conventional air conditioners are unable to provide the low sensible heat ratios that are needed to efficiently cool and dehumidify homes since dehumidification potential is strongly correlated with cooling system operating hours. The project team saw an opportunity to develop {{a system that is}} at least as effective as a conventional air conditioner plus dehumidifier, removes moisture without increasing the sensible load, reduces equipment cost by integrating components, and simplifies installation. Project Overview Prime contractor Davis Energy Group led a team in developing an Integrated Heating, Ventilation, Cooling, and Dehumidification (I-HVCD) system under the DOE SBIR program. Phase I and II SBIR project activities ran from July 2003 through December 2007. Tasks included: (1) Mechanical Design and Prototyping; (2) Controls Development; (3) Laboratory and Field Testing; and (4) Commercialization Activities Technology Description. Key components of the prototype I-HVCD system include an evaporator coil assembly, return and outdoor air damper, and controls. These are used in conjunction with conventional components that include a variable speed air handler or furnace, and a two-stage condensing unit. I-HVCD controls enable the system to operate in three distinct cooling modes to respond to indoor temperature and relative humidity (RH) levels. When sensible cooling loads are high, the system operates similar to a conventional system but varies supply airflow in response to indoor RH. In the second mode airflow is further reduced, and the <b>reheat</b> <b>coil</b> adds heat to the supply air. In the third mode, the <b>reheat</b> <b>coil</b> adds additional heat to maintain the supply air temperature close to the return air temperature (100 % latent cooling). Project Outcomes Key Phase II objectives were to develop a pre-production version of the system and to demonstrate its performance in an actual house. The system was first tested in the laboratory and subsequently underwent field-testing at a new house in Gainesville, Florida. Field testing began in 2006 with monitoring of a 'conventional best practices' system that included a two stage air conditioner and Energy Star dehumidifier. In September 2007, the I-HVCD components were installed for testing. Both systems maintained uniform indoor temperatures, but indoor RH control was considerably better with the I-HVCD system. The daily variation from average indoor humidity conditions was less than 2 % for the I-HVCD vs. 5 - 7 % for the base case system. Data showed that the energy use of the two systems was comparable. Preliminary installed cost estimates suggest that production costs for the current I-HVCD integrated design would likely be lower than for competing systems that include a high efficiency air conditioner, dehumidifier, and fresh air ventilation system. Project Benefits This project verified that the I-HVCD refrigeration compacts are compact (for easy installation and retrofit) and can be installed with air conditioning equipment from a variety of manufacturers. Project results confirmed that the system can provide precise indoor temperature and RH control under a variety of climate conditions. The I-HVCD integrated approach offers numerous benefits including integrated control, easier installation, and reduced equipment maintenance needs. Work completed under this project represents a significant step towards product commercialization. Improved indoor RH control and fresh air ventilation are system attributes that will become increasingly important in the years ahead as building envelopes improve and sensible cooling loads continue to fall. Technologies like I-HVCD will be instrumental in meeting goals set by Building America and other programs to reduce energy use while improving the indoor environment. Next Steps The following steps are needed to bring the product to commercialization: (1) Value engineering to reduce costs; (2) Addition of zoning capability to improve marketability; (3) Fabrication and testing of additional prototypes; and (4) Identification of a manufacturer. Initial efforts to interest large air conditioner manufacturers has shown some interest, but the preferred path to market may be to employ a boutique manufacturer that markets to HVAC contractors. Distribution of the results of this work will improve opportunities for attracting manufacturers. Additional funding is needed to prepare the product for this final step...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide is {{a natural}} {{refrigerant}} that has been considered for certain refrigeration and air conditioning applications. The coefficient of performance (COP) of carbon dioxide cycles is low compared to classical vapor compression cycles. The aim of {{this portion of the}} thesis is to present a thermodynamic analysis of carbon dioxide cycles in order to evaluate the potential performance of a refrigeration cycle using carbon dioxide. A thermodynamic model for the cycle is proposed which can simulate the operation of a carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle. This model takes into account the practical effects of the thermo-physical properties of carbon dioxide as a refrigerant in a trans-critical cycle. One and two-stage compression processes were considered for comparison purposes. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted so that cycle performance can be estimated. The effect of cycle components on system capacity and cycle performance was investigated. The second portion of the thesis deals with the concept of reheat air conditioning, and looks at the performance of different reheat cycles. The thesis looks at reheat systems that utilize different placements of the <b>reheat</b> <b>coil.</b> The overall performance of these reheat systems is then calculated. These systems require no additional electric power to reheat the air after it is cooled and dehumidified in the evaporator. Instead, they use heat from the condenser heat exchanger to reheat the air during partial load conditions. Four different reheat configurations are discussed and analyzed to determine performance levels. Visual Basic programs were written {{for each of the four}} cycles to simulate the different configurations and to evaluate key performance parameters. Graphs were developed based on these programs, where critical variables were changed to monitor trends in coefficient of performance. The thermodynamic cycle of each reheat configuration is developed, with equations presented with figures depicting the cycles. Refrigerant 134 a was used in the programs throughout the reheat section of the thesis. The reheat coefficient of performance is used as the basis for cycle comparison. The relative performance of the four cycles is illustrated in the figures and explained in the Results and Discussion section at the end of chapter 3...|$|R
