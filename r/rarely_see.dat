25|$|Derrick Cave {{is home to}} a {{population}} of Townsend's big-eared bats. The bats are very shy so visitors <b>rarely</b> <b>see</b> them. In fact, the bats usually remain in hibernation until July, and when active they are nocturnal so they are asleep during the day when the cave is open to the public. If a bat is sighted, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife recommends that it be left undisturbed. This is particularly important when the bats are hibernating. Waking a bat from hibernation is extremely stressful, and can cause the bat to die from the sudden expenditure of energy.|$|E
25|$|Believed to be a {{stowaway}} on a U.S. military transport {{near the}} end of World War II, the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) was accidentally introduced to Guam, which previously had no native species of snake. It nearly eliminated the native bird population. The problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island. The brown tree snake, known locally as the kulebla, is native to northern and eastern coasts of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. It is slightly venomous, but relatively harmless to human beings; it is nocturnal. Although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on Guam, residents <b>rarely</b> <b>see</b> them. The United States Department of Agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island's cargo flow. The United States Geological Survey also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region's islands.|$|E

500|$|The novel Drive by James Sallis was {{published}} in 2005. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was [...] "the kind of character you <b>rarely</b> <b>see</b> anymore [...] {{he was a man}} with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Sava awarded the episode a [...] "B+", and wrote that Ricardio is [...] "always welcome on this series, {{largely due to}} Takei’s delightful voice work." [...] Furthermore, he praised the way that Takei delivered his lines, noting that [...] "there’s a theatrical smarminess to his vocals that is {{a stark contrast to}} the Ice King’s nasality", and that [...] "Takei always sounds like he’s having a great time reading the ridiculous lines that are written for him." [...] Sava also wrote positively of Bubblegum's character, noting that she [...] "dominates this episode" [...] and that the [...] "episode reveals a side of her that we <b>rarely</b> <b>see,</b> and hopefully we’ll get more of badass PB in the future." ...|$|E

Mercado later compared Diana and Paul to Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her predecessor Kevin Rudd. He said [...] "Arrogant men <b>rarely</b> <b>see</b> wily women sneaking up from behind to stab them in the back. Kevin Rudd has just been forced to stand aside as Australian Prime Minister to avoid an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Deputy Leader Julia Gillard and now Neighbours Paul Robinson could be the next to go with a celebrated 80's superbitch infiltrating Ramsay Street". Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture said Diana was a [...] "fabulous plot device".|$|E

[...] "Maybe I can help break the stereotype," [...] said Lin. [...] "I feel like Asians in general don't get the respect that we may deserve whether it comes to sports, basketball, or whatever it might be," [...] Lin said. Prior to the 2010–11 NBA season, Americans of Asian descent who played in the NBA included Wataru Misaka, Raymond Townsend, Corey Gaines, Rex Walters, and Robert Swift. [...] " [...] carrying the hopes of an entire continent. I only had to carry the hopes of Little Rock, Arkansas. He's accomplished a lot more than I have already," [...] said Derek Fisher, who had won five NBA championships with the Lakers, after his first game against Lin. Lin is setting an example for prospective Asian athletes in America who <b>rarely</b> <b>see</b> Asian-Americans playing on their favorite teams. [...] "I don't look Japanese," [...] Walters said, referring to his mother's ethnicity. [...] "When they see , it's an Asian-American." ...|$|E
500|$|Other critics labeled Juno as feminist {{because of}} its {{portrayal}} of Juno as a confident and intelligent teenage girl. Antifeminist Phyllis Schlafly wrote that Junos theme [...] "isn't love, romance, or respect for life, but the triumph of feminist ideology, i.e., the irrelevancy of men, especially fathers." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe concluded [...] "Juno serves cool, intelligent girls something they <b>rarely</b> <b>see</b> in a movie: themselves." [...] Cody said about writing the film, [...] "Women are clever, women are funny, women are sharp, and I wanted to show that these girls were human and not the stereotypical teenage girls that we often see in the media" [...] and [...] "There {{was a lack of}} authentic teen girl characters ... I saw writing this screenplay as an opportunity to create an iconic female." [...] Page praised the film for its positive depiction of teenage girls, describing Juno's character as [...] "really refreshing and allow for new possibilities in what young women can be" [...] and [...] "honest but original, completely devoid of stereotype", while also highlighting that [...] "Girls haven't had that sort of character before. We don't have our Catcher in the Rye." [...] She criticized the media perception of her character as a [...] "strong woman", arguing that if Juno were a male character, the [...] "strength" [...] of the character would not be considered remarkable. Reitman was interested in the personal/political conflict for Vanessa's character: [...] "Feminism has paved the way for Vanessa’s career, but ultimately Vanessa wants to be a full time mother." ...|$|E
500|$|Jessica Sinclair of Long Island Press {{noted that}} [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] is {{different}} from [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] and that it shows a side of Beyoncé that listeners <b>rarely</b> <b>see.</b> Similarly, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK wrote that the song reveals [...] "a more ferocious side to Beyoncé with it's [...] faster pace and aggressive piano backing". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy commented that the [...] " [...] is a classic Beyoncé track waiting to happen". Chad Grischow of IGN wrote that [...] "the lush backing music and [...] soaring vocals" [...] on the song sound suitable for an updated take on the [...] soundtrack album as Beyoncé is ecstatic that she ended a poor relationship {{before it was too}} late. Jon Caramainca of The New York Times commented that the [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] has [...] "optimistic, coffee-commercial" [...] pianos, which place Beyoncé directly in Lilith Fair territory. James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that {{it is one of the}} best ballads on the album 4. James Dinh of the same publication added that the song has a radio-friendly appeal and a catchy chorus. Similarly, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly and Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle praised the song's radio nature, with the latter calling it [...] "a return to form" [...] with a [...] "regal sound of a radio smash". Jim Farber of Daily News wrote that the melodies and the clever lyrics of [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] are likely to inspire significant airplay. Ricky Schweitzer of One Thirty BPM commented that even though the ballad sounds like a place-filler on 4, it remains largely superior [...] "to the majority of the trash being churned out by Beyoncé’s peers".|$|E

2500|$|Family {{physicians}} and orthopedists <b>rarely</b> <b>see</b> a malignant bone tumor (most bone tumors are benign). The route to osteosarcoma diagnosis usually {{begins with an}} X-ray, continues {{with a combination of}} scans (CT scan, PET scan, bone scan, MRI) and ends with a surgical biopsy. A characteristic often seen in an X-ray is [...] Codman's triangle, which is basically a subperiosteal lesion formed when the periosteum is raised due to the tumor. Films are suggestive, but bone biopsy is the only definitive method to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign.|$|E

2500|$|At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper gave Gracie [...] "Two Thumbs up," [...] stating, [...] "You've seen it before, but you'll <b>rarely</b> <b>see</b> it better." [...] Gracie is a New York Times Critics' Pick. Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis {{described}} Gracie as [...] "a familiar underdog {{story told}} with unusual sensitivity [...] “Gracie” connects the adversity-drama dots — the beat-down, the bounce-back, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter — with a subtle {{awareness of the}} shock waves of bereavement. Balancing the emotional complexity is Chris Manley’s refreshingly unaffected cinematography; the drama of a free kick, {{like that of a}} good movie, is best viewed through a steady lens." [...] Bill Zwecker, of the Chicago Sun-Times, stated, [...] "It's a sweet and uplifting film, and though quite predictable, gives us a family drama that showcases simple truths about overcoming seemingly impossible odds and leaves you with a warm and very satisfying feeling deep down. It's a solid, hopeful and inspiring story that reminds us of what we might call 'old-fashioned' values about perseverance and making your dreams come true. Old-fashioned? Not at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, James Fallows {{argued in}} The Washington Post that The Economist used {{editorial}} lines that contradicted the news stories they purported to highlight. In 1999, Andrew Sullivan complained in The New Republic that it uses [...] "marketing genius" [...] {{to make up}} for deficiencies in analysis and original reporting, resulting in [...] "a kind of Reader's Digest" [...] for America's corporate elite. Although he acknowledged that the magazine's claim about the dotcom bubble bursting would probably be accurate in the long run (the bubble burst in the US market two years later), Sullivan pointed out that the magazine greatly exaggerated the danger the US economy was in after the Dow Jones fell to 7,400 during the 1998 Labor Day weekend. He also said that The Economist is editorially constrained because so many scribes graduated from the same college at Oxford University, Magdalen College. The Guardian wrote that [...] "its writers <b>rarely</b> <b>see</b> a political or economic problem that cannot be solved by the trusted three-card trick of privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation".|$|E

2500|$|In 1876 {{the family}} moved {{into one of the}} {{neighbouring}} houses, Ingle Lodge, and it was here that the couple's third son, Gerald Brosseau Gardner, was born on Friday 13 June 1884. [...] A fourth child, Francis Douglas Gardner, was then born in 1886. [...] Gerald would <b>rarely</b> <b>see</b> Harold, who went on to study Law at the University of Oxford, but saw more of Bob, who drew pictures for him, and Douglas, with whom he shared his nursery. The Gardners employed an Irish nursemaid named Josephine [...] "Com" [...] McCombie, who was entrusted with taking care of the young Gerald; she would subsequently become the dominant figure of his childhood, spending far more time with him than his parents. Gardner suffered with asthma from a young age, having particular difficulty in the cold Lancashire winters. His nursemaid offered to take him to warmer climates abroad at his father's expense in the hope that this condition would not be so badly affected. Subsequently, in summer 1888, Gerald and Com travelled via London to Nice in the south of France. After several more years spent in the Mediterranean, in 1891 they went to the Canary Islands, and it was here that Gardner first developed his lifelong interest in weaponry. From there, they then went on to Accra in the Gold Coast (modern Ghana). Accra was followed by a visit to Funchal on the Portuguese colony of Madeira; they would spend most of the next nine years on the island, only returning to England for three or four months in the summer.|$|E
