It {{is based on the}} concept that two atomically clean solid surfaces can develop a strong adhesive force between them when they are brought into contact at high vacuum condition without high deformation at a 40 ~ 90 %. With this SAB process, the effects of heat treatment on the bonding strength of surface-activated bonding (SAB) -treated copper-nickel fine clad metals were investigated. An increase in the SAB <b>rolling</b> <b>load</b> of the copper-nickel fine clad metals increased the peel strength after heat treatment, indicating that increases in the SAB <b>rolling</b> <b>load</b> decreased the interface voids formed by initial micro-range surface roughness between the clad materials in the SAB cladding process.

This work is thus directed at obtaining a good estimate for the mean rolling temperature which can effectively be used for load and torque estimates. Hot flat rolling stimulation by use of the Bland and Ford's cold rolling (HRBF) theory confirmed the reverse sandwich effect in selected carbon steels at low strain rates.

40|$|The {{endurance}} life of {{an engine}} crankshaft {{is closely related to}} its fatigue strength, in addition to other material properties and shape parameters. Deep rolling, moreover, enhances the fatigue limit by applying compressive residual stress within the fillet radius area as a major surface hardening technique.

The strain value and peak frequency around the notch increased; the maximum equivalent strain value could be observed at both bottom corners of the notch; the equivalent strain value first increased and then decreased at the points in the superficial and middle layers with the increase of rolling velocity; the points in the deep layer were less affected by rolling velocity; the equivalent strain value of the points in the superficial layer declined after rising with the increase of defect depth, while a decreased trend could be found for the points in the middle and deep layers. Conclusions. The shear strain, which rose with the increase in defect depth, was the main factor in cartilage destruction. The cartilage tended to be destructed firstly at the bottom corner of the defect. Rolling velocity showed significant effects on superficial and middle layers.

In general, the regeneration capacity of articular cartilage injury difficult to selfrepair {{is considered to be}} limited. At present, many new technologies and methods have been used for clinical treatment, but it only can relieve the pain of the patients. Human knee joint has two main movement patterns: rolling and sliding. Rolling, as a typical representative of the articular cartilage, is very similar to the mechanical environment in vivo. Accordingly, we first proposed and developed this <b>rolling</b> depression <b>loading</b> device with perfusion system for the mechanobiology researching on in vitro articular cartilage, which includes rolling control system, compression adjusting system and circulating perfusion system. The innovation of the biological reactor is the combination of the <b>rolling</b> <b>loading</b> system and circulation of grouting system. The roll controlling system is achieved by roller rolling back and forth through stepper motor driving screw rod. The compressive system could produce uniform, controlled compressions by relatively sliding of two wedge blocks. The circulating perfusion system is mainly finished by controlling the peristaltic pump. It can provide an environment which is closer to the normal physiological condition of articular cartilage. Rolling depression loading is useful to clarify the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and apply biomechanical factors to prevent and treat osteoarthritis and repair cartilage.

The <b>rolling</b> <b>loads</b> (mean flow stresses or MFS’s) did not increase as the temperature decreased during the simulation. This is ascribed to the occurrence of dynamic transformation.

The induced residual stresses were experimentally characterized by X-ray diffraction and hole drilling. A realistic {{finite element model}} is proposed to overcome some of the existing shortcomings in simulation of deep rolling. Deep rolling coverage is defined, formulated and incorporated into the simulation. The model is validated by the experimental measurements.

A fatigue crack propagation algorithm is used to analyze the influence of technological parameters on the lifetime of railway axles. Lower feeds, higher loads and thicker rolls, all resulting in higher deep coverage, can result in higher improvement against fatigue crack propagation. However, extremely high coverage can deteriorate the performance of deep rolled components.

Following the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879 the viaduct was inspected and found to have a distinct curve, although the plans showed a straight bridge, and many of the piers were out of perpendicular.

Such designs were widely used by Victorian engineers until rendered obsolete by the introduction of other American truss designs in the 1880s.

40|$|Constitutive {{behavior}} {{models for}} steels are typically semi-empirical, however recently neural network {{is also being}} used. Existing neural network models are highly complex with a large network structure i. e. the number of neurons and layers. Furthermore, the network structure is different for different grades of steel. In the present study a simple neural network structure, 3 : 4 : 1, is developed which models flow behavior better than other models available in literature. Using this neural network structure constitutive behavior of 8 steels: 4 carbon steels, V and V-Ti microalloyed steels, an austenitic stainless steel and a high speed steel could be modeled with reasonable accuracy. The stress-strain behavior for the vanadium microalloyed steel was obtained from hot compression tests carried out at 850 - 1150 ï°C and 0. 1 - 60 s- 1. It is found that a better estimate of the constants in the semi-empirical model developed for this steel could be obtained by simultaneous nonlinear regression. A model that can predict the effect of chemical composition on the constitutive behavior would be industrially useful for e. g., in optimizing rolling schedules for new grades of steel. In the present study, a neural network model, 5 : 6 : 1, is developed which predicts the flow behavior {{for a range of}} carbon steels. It is found that the effect of manganese is best accounted for by taking Ceq=C+Mn/ 6 as one of the inputs of the network. Predictions from this model show that the effect of carbon on flow stress is nonlinear.
