500|$|African-American {{literature}} scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls Angelou's {{depiction of}} the rape [...] "a burden" [...] of Caged Bird: a demonstration of [...] "the {{manner in which the}} Black female is violated in her tender years and... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence". Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender. When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma, Angelou explained it by stating, [...] "I can't <b>remember</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> I wasn't loved by somebody." [...] When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience, she indicated that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape. [...] She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else, so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} favorable response from critics, who praised its simplicity. According to Crystal Bell of The Huffington Post, Madonna {{was able to}} portray a rich life {{like that in the}} 1960 film, La Dolce Vita. Amanda Dobbins of New York gave props to Madonna for looking good in a leotard and for giving break to the young actors accompanying her in the video. Brett Warner of the website Ology appreciated the vintage feel of the video writing: [...] "Heavy sigh. <b>Remember</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> pop videos didn't have to shimmer and sparkle, when you didn't need choreographed dance routines or outlandish costumes? Remember when cars and cleavage was enough? Madonna clearly does." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator agreed, writing that the video is [...] "the most fun visual [...] offered up in years... All in all, a fantastic video for one of the more mediocre tracks off MDNA." [...] Mark Hogan from Spin noted that the video appeared a literal take on the song's lyrics but the change of scenery to the Italian countryside and the party scenes made it endearing. Melinda Newman from HitFix said that although the video did not live up to Madonna's other endeavors, it fit the [...] "carefree" [...] theme of the song. She found influences of Italian film director Federico Fellini's works, especially his 1957 release Nights of Cabiria, in the scene showing Madonna picking up prostitutes in her car.|$|E

6000|$|The little log house, {{with its}} chimney of sticks, its roof of warping clapboards {{weighted}} with traversing poles and its [...] "chinking" [...] of clay, {{had a single}} door and, directly opposite, a window. The latter, however, was boarded up--nobody could <b>remember</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> it was not. And none knew {{why it was so}} closed; certainly not because of the occupant's dislike of light and air, for on those rare occasions when a hunter had passed that lonely spot the recluse had commonly been seen sunning himself on his doorstep if heaven had provided sunshine for his need. I fancy there are few persons living to-day who ever knew the secret of that window, but I am one, as you shall see.|$|E

I reseated myself on the sofa, and without delay or preface I laid before her my plan of collaboration with the sisters of the House of Martha; explaining how much better a man could attend to certain outside business than the sisters could do it, and showing how, in a manner, I proposed to become a brother of the House of Martha. Thus only could I defend myself against her irrational and agitating suppositions.|$|E

60|$|Margaret found a {{place as}} nursery governess and felt rich with her small salary. As she said, she was 'fond of luxury', and her chief trouble was poverty. She found it harder to bear than the others because she could <b>remember</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, {{but it was very}} natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings' she daily saw all she wanted, for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg caught {{frequent}} glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymakings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy.|$|E
6000|$|MACROBIAN, n. One {{forgotten}} of {{the gods}} and living to a great age. History is abundantly supplied with examples, from Methuselah to Old Parr, but some notable instances of longevity are less well known. A Calabrian peasant named Coloni, born in 1753, lived so long that he had what he considered {{a glimpse of the}} dawn of universal peace. Scanavius relates that he knew an archbishop who was so old that he could <b>remember</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> he did not deserve hanging. In 1566 a linen draper of Bristol, England, declared that he had lived five hundred years, and that in all that time he had never told a lie. There are instances of longevity (macrobiosis) in our own country. Senator Chauncey Depew is old enough to know better. The editor of The American, a newspaper in New York City, has a memory that goes back to the time when he was a rascal, but not to the fact. The President of the United States was born so long ago that many of the friends of his youth have risen to high political and military preferment without the assistance of personal merit. The verses following were written by a macrobian: ...|$|E

It was a long while ago, {{and it took me}} a weary time to do it--but I did learn at last to play a tune on the fiddle. The old man and his wife took it in turns to teach me. Somebody gave me to the old man and his wife; I don't know who it was, and I don't remember their names. They were musicians. In the fine streets they sang hymns, and in the poor streets they sang comic songs. It was cold, to be sure, standing barefoot on the pavement--but I got plenty of halfpence. The people said I was so little it was a shame to send me out, and so I got halfpence. I had bread and apples for supper, and a nice little corner under the staircase, to sleep in. Do you know, I do think I did enjoy myself at that time," [...] she concluded, still a little doubtful whether those faint and far-off remembrances were really to be relied on.|$|E

In the bridge, the singer <b>remembers</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> he and his lover were happier.
