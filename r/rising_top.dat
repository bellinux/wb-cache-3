50|$|It is {{impossible}} to find two identical locomotives of this class, as the design changed after each machine was completed. The First EP09 locomotive was presented in 1986, the next one in 1987. On May 29, 1988, {{according to the new}} timetable, those two locomotives started regular service. In 2005 EP09's livery was revised and unveiled. The locomotives are being repainted in during scheduled servicing.All the locomotives produced, except for EP09-035(which was involved in the Szczekociny rail crash) are still fully operational, and are deployed in the locomotive depots in Kraków and Warsaw. 12 units work in Kraków Prokocim depot, the rest are assigned to Warsaw. Besides running on the CMK line, those locomotives can be spotted on Warsaw-Poznań-Szczecin, Warsaw-Poznań-Wrocław, Warsaw-Lublin and Warsaw-Kielce lines.EP09 series proved itself to be highly defective, e.g. in 1996 PKP was forced to replace 10 traction motors and 24 bogies. In the same time serious breakdowns of compressors were noted. In the end of 2000 EP09 were temporally sent to Gdańsk.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Rising</b> <b>top</b> income {{shares in}} {{developed}} countries have recently generated {{a great deal of}} political and economic discussion. While many theories have been proposed to explain this increase, there has been little robust econometric testing of those explanations. This paper seeks to understand top income shares using econometric modelling. Findings: Our analysis finds that economic openness, the size and ideology of Government, the development of financial markets, top marginal tax rates, and the strength of unions are all important determinants of top income shares. By contrast, {{there is no evidence to}} support the notion that skill-biased technological progress has led to <b>rising</b> <b>top</b> income shares. Practical and Social implications: These results offer a comprehensive explanation of why top income shares have been rising in a number of developed economies in the last three decades. The implications on economic and social policy extend towards potential avenues for reform in addressing/counteracting the rise, depending on the degree to which policymakers and voters believe that this rise has adverse effects on the economy and wellbeing. 2 page(s...|$|E

In this article, I survey current research on the one percent in the United States. I distinguish income from wealth and show that both are very concentrated but that the concentration of wealth, particularly financial wealth, is extremely high. I describe the demographic traits and finances of households who are in the one percent and discuss how these have changed in the past decade. I review literature that explains <b>rising</b> <b>top</b> incomes, and I propose that future research will usefully concentrate more on top wealth owners and on the demographic and life course processes that underlie income and wealth concentration. I conclude by speculating about why Americans are so tolerant of resource concentration. © Copyright © 2014 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved...|$|E

Liberalization and financialization worsen economic inequality by raising top incomes, unless institutions are strongly redistributive. The labor share has also fallen for structural reasons and reasons related to economic policy. Such explanations are left to part III and IV of our study, respectively.

40|$|The {{share of}} income {{held by the}} top 1 percent in many {{countries}} around the world has been rising persistently over the last 30 years. But we continue to know little about the relationship between the <b>rising</b> <b>top</b> income shares and human wellbeing. Using data from 24 countries and years ranging from 2005 to 2013 in the Gallup World Poll and the World Income Database, this study examines the relationship between top income share and different dimensions of subjective wellbeing. The results are mixed, with the negative relationship between top income shares and average life ladder being driven largely by the European sub-sample. For the European countries, we also document evidence that top income is statistically significantly associated with lower average enjoyment and being well-rested yesterday, and higher average stress and sadness yesterday. Overall, our findings suggest that, at least for individuals in Europe, an economic policy that increases national incomes may have significant crowding-out effect on aggregate evaluative wellbeing if it only increases the share of income {{at the very top of}} income distribution. More generally, our results highlight the complex relationships between income inequality and subjective wellbeing across different countries. </p...|$|E

Due to high average income growth and sharply <b>rising</b> <b>top</b> income shares during the 1990 s and early 2000 s, progressive income taxation is about to raise non-trivial tax revenues in China and India and to become an important political object.

The fact that progressive income taxation is becoming an important policy tool has important consequences for China’s ability to finance social spending and to keep under control the rise in income inequality associated to globalization and growth. Due to faster income growth and to a higher fraction of wage earners in the labor force, {{the prospects for}} income tax development look better in China than in India. This potential is however limited by the fact that Chinese top wage-earners are under-taxed relatively to top non-wage income earners. income distribution; income taxation...|$|E
