50|$|KURDUWADI (KWV)Kurduwadi is a {{small town}} in Solapur {{district}} in Maharashtra state of India. It is known mainly for the railway junction connecting two different <b>rail</b> <b>tracks.</b> Prior to <b>gauge</b> conversion {{it used to be a}} junction with different size <b>gauge</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
25|$|The tram {{network is}} built almost {{exclusively}} {{on the streets of}} Helsinki, making it a traditional tram system rather than a light <b>rail</b> one. The <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> is one metre. The network consists almost entirely of double <b>track</b> <b>rail.</b> In some parts the tracks are separated from other road traffic; elsewhere they share road space with cars and buses.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of the station lies the Australian <b>Rail</b> <b>Track</b> Corporation {{standard}} <b>gauge</b> line to Crystal Brook. Dry Creek is also where the Dry Creek to Port Adelaide railway line branches off via a triangle junction allowing trains from the north and south to head towards the branch line.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{the rest}} of the Adelaide {{suburban}} passenger rail network, the line is [...] broad gauge for its entire length. The Australian <b>Rail</b> <b>Track</b> Corporation's standard <b>gauge</b> Adelaide to Port Augusta line runs parallel to the route from the Adelaide Gaol triangle to Salisbury, then turns north west towards Virginia.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Track</b> <b>gauge</b> {{refers to}} the {{distance}} between the <b>rails.</b> The ridable <b>track</b> <b>gauges</b> range from [...] to , the most popular being [...] ", [...] ", 5", [...] " [...] and [...] " [...] (see Rail transport modelling scales). Gauges from [...] and up are called [...] "Miniature Railways" [...] (in the US these are known as [...] "Grand Scale Railroads"), and are used mostly in amusement park rides and commercial settings.|$|R
50|$|In Italian Libya {{the first}} {{railways}} {{were created by}} the Italians after their conquest of Tripoli in 1911. The first section was done in 1912 from the port of Tripoli to Ain Zara, with 11 km of <b>rails</b> using a <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> of 950 mm. By {{the end of the}} same year were done another 39 km until Tagiura and Zanzur.|$|R
50|$|Freight {{is still}} a major factor along this {{transport}} corridor, with the Australian <b>Rail</b> <b>Track</b> Corporation's standard <b>gauge</b> Adelaide to Port Augusta line running parallel to the broad <b>gauge</b> <b>track</b> between Adelaide and Salisbury. Since 1984, this line has been standard gauge and had no interface with the suburban lines. Aurizon, Genesee & Wyoming Australia, Pacific National, SCT Logistics, and Great Southern Rail operate services via the line, with the latter operating The Ghan and Indian Pacific passenger trains along this section.|$|R
50|$|Note: GWA also {{operates}} {{on the interstate}} Australian <b>Rail</b> <b>Track</b> Corporation standard <b>gauge</b> lines and provides train control functions for the northern Australia railway from Northgate Block Point (near Tarcoola in SA) to Berrimah freight terminal (near Darwin) {{which is owned by}} the Asia-Pacific Transport Consortium. Northgate Block Point is 510 km from Coonamia (Port Pirie) in SA and Berrimah freight terminal is 2754 km from Coonamia. Add approximately 220 km for distances from Adelaide. The 50-year lease on the Adelaide-Darwin railway was transferred to GWA with the purchase of FreightLink in 2011.|$|R

5000|$|The {{renovation}} project {{involved the}} laying of new ballast, sleepers (ties), and <b>rail.</b> The <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> was changed from [...] to , the same [...] "standard gauge" [...] {{used on the}} North American rail network. The rails were replaced with [...] continuously welded rail, purchased from Sydney Steel Corporation in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada. Similarly, the crushed rock used for ballast was purchased from Martin Marietta Materials in Auld's Cove, Nova Scotia, Canada. Concrete sleepers (ties) were used to avoid termite and other insect damage. The route was also realigned slightly with a shortcut added around the Gatún locks. The line is now single track, with some strategically placed sections of double track (near Gamboa and Monte Lirio). The floor of the old Miraflores Tunnel had to be lowered to accommodate the extra height of double-stacked containers. A maintenance shop was built near Colón that can also receive the container-loading portal cranes (which are also {{owned and operated by}} PCRC).|$|R
50|$|The {{inclines}} all {{consist of}} two parallel <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> with a <b>gauge</b> of 3.27m. Boats are carried on carriages which run on these rails. The inclines {{rise from the}} lower level of the canal to a summit and then down a second shorter incline to the upper canal level. The {{first part of the}} main incline and the short upper incline were both built at a gradient of 1:24. A carriage is lowered down the incline to counterbalance an upward moving carriage. Once the downward moving carriage has reached the summit and started down the main incline its weight helps pull up the upward moving carriage. This allowed the slope of the incline for this section to be built at a higher gradient of 1:12.|$|R
50|$|Gressholmen {{airport was}} for the years 1927 through 1939 the {{location}} of the main airport for Oslo, until the construction of Fornebu airport. The airport was only for seaplanes. The ramp with <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> and the hangar are reused for boat storage and maintenance. There is railway point with the big <b>track</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in recent years of many African countries to revamp their neglected railways {{in order to promote}} regional trade and transportation integration. Investors are faced with problems of railway <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> conversions to promote railway inter operability. The objective of the work documented here was to numerically evaluate the impact of <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> conversions on traffic load induced permanent deformation (PD) of low embankment on soft sub-grade. A method to predict the traffic load induced settlement of low embankment on soft sub-grade is proposed. Using the user-defined material subroutines (UMAT) in ABAQUS, a 2 -D finite element (FE) model was formulated. These models are converted into a numerical formulation for implementation in FE analysis and the traffic load induced dynamic stress in the sub grade are calculated by using the multi-layer elastic theory. Then the plastic vertical strain in the sub-grade is calculated by an empirical equation, whose constants are related to the physical and mechanical properties of the sub-grade soil. The method was applied to analyze a 700 m long section of a low embankment on the soft black cotton soil of Nakuru plains in Kenya. Corresponding results showed that the application of traffic loads on alternate <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> due to <b>gauge</b> conversions {{have a significant effect on}} the permanent deformation of the sub grade soil. The depth significantly influenced by traffic loading was found to be close to 6 m below the base of the embankment. The analysis also shows that increasing the thickness and stiffness of the sub grade is a very effective way of reducing the traffic load induced permanent deformation of soft sub grade soil. The proposed method can be used for settlement analysis on low embankments as well as a useful tool for making decisions on railway <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> conversions...|$|R
50|$|Between Melbourne and Seymour {{the route}} {{consists}} of two broad <b>gauge</b> <b>tracks</b> with a single standard <b>gauge</b> <b>track</b> alongside. North of Seymour, the broad gauge line branches to Shepparton and two standard <b>gauge</b> <b>tracks</b> continue to Albury. All lines are owned by VicTrack, the broad gauge line managed by V/Line, the standard gauge line by the Australian <b>Rail</b> <b>Track</b> Corporation.|$|R
50|$|The Englishman William Wilson {{drove the}} {{locomotive}} on this first journey {{and became the}} first engine driver in Germany. In contemporary publications, this first journey by a steam locomotive was seen as {{the beginning of a new}} era. The decision of the Ludwig Railway Company to opt for the English system, including its <b>rail</b> profile and <b>track</b> <b>gauge,</b> flanges, wagons and so on, also had a normative effect because subsequently, the German railways adopted the same standards based on what was clearly a mature system. The development of the German railway network bypassed this line and it was never connected to other railways. Finally, it had to compete with electric trams running between Nuremberg and Fürth. On 31 October 1922, it was closed and used for a tramway.This was followed by the first railway in Prussia, the Berlin-Potsdam Railway: the 11-kilometre-long stretch from Zehlendorf to Potsdam which opened on 22 September 1838; its 12-kilometre extension from Zehlendorf to Berlin was opened on 29 October 1838.|$|R
50|$|Stellwerk Fichtengrund is a {{decommissioned}} railway {{signal box}} {{on the outskirts of}} Berlin in Oranienburg, Germany, formerly in the GDR. It was built in 1964 by the GDR railway Deutsche Reichsbahn to operate the connection to, what was at the time, a secret <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> connecting the Prussian Northern Railway with the Heidekrautbahn. The track, which was omitted from maps during the GDR period, was used to test a new Telescopic Axle to allow train coaches to easily change from European to Russian <b>track</b> <b>gauge.</b> The prototype worked but was never put into mass production.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{scale and}} gauge are often confused, scale means the ratio between {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} on a model compared with a unit of measurement in corresponding full size prototype, while gauge is {{the distance between the}} two running <b>rails</b> of the <b>track.</b> About 60% of the world's railways have a <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> of [...] known as [...] "standard gauge", but there are also narrow-gauge railways where the <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> is less than standard and broad-gauge railways where the gauge is wider. In a similar manner, a scale model railway may have several <b>track</b> <b>gauges</b> in one scale.|$|R
2500|$|Approximately 60% of the world's {{existing}} railway {{lines are}} built {{to the standard}} <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> where {{the distance between the}} inside edges of the <b>rails</b> of the <b>track</b> is [...] (see the list of countries that use the standard gauge).|$|R
2500|$|The 2008 report {{recommended}} {{for the construction}} of the light rail network to take place in two phases: phase 1 would be completed by 2020 and would include the lines Runosmäki–Majakkaranta (in Korppolaismäki) and Varissuo–Turku Central railway station. [...] The total length of these lines would be [...] Phase 2 would be completed after 2020, coinciding with new residential development in Raisio and Kaarina, and would include a third line Kaarina–central Turku–Raisio and an extension of the Varissuo–Central railway station to the Port of Turku. Total length of the system following phase 2 would be [...] As the new proposal does not feature any running on train <b>tracks,</b> <b>rail</b> <b>gauges</b> of , [...] and [...] were presented as alternatives. No preference was given to any of the listed gauges, although the benefits of the [...] standard gauge were stated to be the highest of the 3 alternatives.|$|R
5000|$|Haparanda is {{connected}} to the Swedish national network by the Haparandabanan (Haparanda railway). The bridge between Haparanda and Tornio is the only direct connection between the Swedish and Finnish rail systems. The two networks use different <b>track</b> <b>gauges,</b> requiring all freight wagons crossing the border to have their cargo reloaded or their bogies exchanged. There is a dual <b>gauge</b> <b>track,</b> in a [...] and [...] four <b>rail</b> gauntlet <b>track</b> formation, between Haparanda and Tornio.|$|R
2500|$|Sometimes <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> are {{designed}} to be portable and moved {{from one place to another}} as required. During construction of the Panama Canal, tracks were moved around excavation works. These <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> were [...] and the rolling stock full size. [...] Portable tracks have often been used in open pit mines. In 1880 in New York City, sections of heavy portable track (along with much other improvised technology) helped in the epic move of the ancient obelisk in Central Park to its final location from the dock where it was unloaded from the cargo ship SS Dessoug.|$|R
50|$|Overnight Australian National Railways {{went from}} an {{organisation}} controlling just over 2,000 kilometres of track {{with a total}} staff of 4,000 employees to the operator of 20% of Australia's rail network. It now controlled 7,890 kilometres of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> being 2,395 km of broad gauge, 2,812 km of standard gauge and 2,683 km of narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>track.</b> The narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>track</b> included 851 km in Tasmania and 748 km on South Australia's isolated Eyre Peninsula Railway. The remainder of the narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>tracks</b> were two short lines in the Mid North of South Australia radiating from Peterborough and Gladstone and the famous Ghan line from Marree to Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. The total number of employees numbered just over 12,000.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{necessity}} among rail transportation authorities for a superior understanding of the <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> degradation overtime and the factors influencing rail degradation. They need an accurate technique to identify the time when <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> fail or need maintenance. In turn, this will help to increase the level of safety and comfort of the passengers and the vehicles as well as improve the cost effectiveness of maintenance activities. An accurate model can {{play a key role}} in prediction of the long-term behaviour of railroad tracks. An accurate model can decrease the cost of maintenance. In this research, the <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> degradation is predicted using an autoregressive moving average with exogenous input (ARMAX). An ARMAX has been implemented on Melbourne tram data to estimate the values for the tram <b>track</b> degradation. <b>Gauge</b> values and rail usage in Million Gross Tone (MGT) are the main parameters used in the model. The developed model can accurately predict the future status of the tram tracks...|$|R
