40|$|Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is {{characterized}} by abnormal autoantibody production and clearance. Infections {{are among the most}} important causes of morbidity and mortality in SLE patients; they have an increased frequency of severe bacterial and viral infections possibly due to inherited genetic and immunologic defects and to immunosuppressive therapies. In addition, infectious agents can switch on lupus disease expression and activity. Among the strategies {{to reduce the risk of}} infection, vaccination can be considered the most reliable option. Most vaccines are effective and safe in SLE patients, although in certain cases immunogenicity may be sub-optimal and vaccination can trigger a flare. Although these issues are currently unresolved, the <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>balance</b> is in favor for vaccination to reduce the risk of infection in SLE patients.

40|$|In summary, {{this thesis}} {{discussed}} {{different aspects of}} the study of prenatal exposures and atopic disease development. We demonstrated that a case-sibling design is a valid methodology to use in pregnancy studies. When well designed, results of this case-sibling design can be compared with those of a more traditional case-control or cohort study to quantify the influence of time-invariant confounding shared within families. We demonstrated that children diagnosed with asthma can be identified reliably with prescription data. Pharmacy databases with large numbers of prescriptions may therefore provide valuable information for observational studies. We found that prenatal exposure to antibiotics was associated with childhood asthma. Though these findings will not have direct clinical implications, it may provide valuable information for {{a better understanding of the}} biological mechanism behind atopic disease development. In addition, we found that prenatal exposure to acid suppressive drugs was associated with the development of atopic diseases in childhood. The <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>balance</b> of use of these drugs during pregnancy should be evaluated for the individual patient. Well-designed epidemiological studies may provide valid information regarding the safety of medication use during pregnancy. However this thesis demonstrated that health care providers should consider the perception of risks and benefits of medication use amongst pregnant women when providing safety information to the pregnant patient...|$|E
30|$|Some {{important}} points {{must be kept}} in mind at the bedside. First, there are some instances where the tests we described in detail above are pointless because fluid responsiveness is obvious. In cases of haemorrhagic shock, clear-cut hypovolemic shock and the early phase of septic shock when fluid has not been administered, cardiac output will undoubtedly increase with fluid infusion. In such circumstances, delaying fluid administration is likely harmful, and therefore, tests of fluid responsiveness should not be used. Second, testing fluid responsiveness makes sense only in cases of circulatory failure (Fig.  2). The question of administering fluid or not can be asked only if cardiac output is to increase, i.e. in case of obvious or suspected tissue hypoxia [87]. In this regard, it must {{be kept in mind}} that preload responsiveness is a normal condition. Third, even if cardiac output increases, a positive test for fluid responsiveness should not automatically lead to fluid administration. In many instances, the risk of infusing fluid exceeds the expected benefit, and in each instance when a fluid bolus is contemplated, the <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>balance</b> should be evaluated. For instance, in patients where acute circulatory failure and ARDS coexist, one should limit fluid administration even in cases of preload responsiveness because of the severity of lung injury [21], as assessed by increased lung water and by alteration of pulmonary vascular permeability [88]. The results of any of these tests should not be examined in isolation, but taking into account the entire picture of the patients. Moreover, one must keep in mind that none of these tests are 100 % sensitive or specific. Every decision made from these tests must take this into account.|$|E

40|$|Herb {{induced liver injury}} (HILI) {{and drug}} induced liver injury (DILI) share the common {{characteristic}} of chemical compounds as their causative agents, which were either produced by the plant or synthetic processes. Both, natural and synthetic chemicals are foreign products to the body and need metabolic degradation to be eliminated. During this process, hepatotoxic metabolites may be generated causing liver injury in susceptible patients. There is uncertainty, whether risk factors such as high lipophilicity or high daily and cumulative doses play a pathogenetic role for HILI, as these are under discussion for DILI. It is also often unclear, whether a HILI case has an idiosyncratic or an intrinsic background. Treatment with herbs of Western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) rarely causes elevated liver tests (LT). However, HILI can develop to acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation in single cases. HILI is a diagnosis of exclusion, because clinical features of HILI are not specific as they are also found in many other liver diseases unrelated to herbal use. In strikingly increased liver tests signifying severe liver injury, herbal use has to be stopped. To establish HILI {{as the cause of}} liver damage, RUCAM (Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method) is a useful tool. Diagnostic problems may emerge when alternative causes were not carefully excluded and the correct therapy is withheld. Future strategies should focus on RUCAM based causality assessment in suspected HILI cases and more regulatory efforts to provide all herbal medicines and herbal dietary supplements used as medicine with strict regulatory surveillance, considering them as herbal drugs and ascertaining an appropriate <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>balance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Concerns {{have emerged}} that {{initiation}} of an antidepressant {{can lead to}} or exacerbate suicidality. If those more at risk could be identified prior to treatment, treatment risk benefit analysis and patient risk management could be assisted. Aims: This study investigated the role {{of child abuse and}} ongoing emotional impact from abuse on the risk of suicidality {{during the first week of}} treatment with an antidepressant. The patient sample for this study was drawn from one site of a larger pharmacogenetic study. The hypothesis was that subjects with high impact child abuse would have greater elevation of suicidality during the first week of antidepressant treatment. Methods: Fifty-one subjects were initiated on either venlafaxine (VEN) or escitalopram (ESC) for major depressive disorder (MDD) and had pre-treatment suicidality assayed with the reasons for living scale (RFLS), which was repeated after one week of treatment. Several clinical, demographic and genotype variables were controlled for. The 15 -item Impact of Event Scale (IES- 15) was administered to subjects reporting abuse to dichotomise the abuse group into low and high (IES- 15 &# 8805; 26) impact groups for sub-analysis as per the scales validated rating guidelines. Results: Subjects reporting no child abuse exposure were less likely to have increased suicidality during the first week of antidepressant treatment (7. 6 %) compared to subjects with low impact abuse (38. 5 %, p = 0. 041) and high impact abuse (58. 3 %, p = 0. 009). Only high impact abuse predicted increased suicidality after adjustment for potential confounders such as depression severity (OR = 31. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 3 to 748. 7, p = 0. 03). Conclusions: If these findings are replicated in larger samples, child abuse history could become an important element of assessing <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>balance</b> when initiating antidepressants and may help guide the level of patient review needed during antidepressant initiation...|$|E

40|$|Different from frequentist {{analysis}} used {{in traditional}} clinical studies which draw confirmed conclusions {{on a single}} trial, the Bayesian approach incorporates the results from earlier, related trials as well as taking results from the current trial to update the prior information. Since both prior information and conducted data {{play a role in}} the final decision making process, the Bayesian approach delivers the more accurate results conditionally on the observed data, instead of imagined random data and fixed parameters. In this thesis we assessed the role of prior distribution and loss function choice on the Bayes estimate of effect size of data from a randomized controlled clinical trial, Timing in Myocardial Infarction Evaluation (TIME), and make inferences about the effect of bone marrow mononuclear cell delivery on left ventricular function after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). (Traverse et al., 2012) We composed an informative prior based on the information from formerly conducted clinical trials BOOST and REPAIR-AMI, as well as a non-informative prior and a counterintuitive prior. Three different prior distributions were composed by assigning different weights on these prior components. Updated with the results from the clinical study TIME, the approximate posterior distribution were derived using Bayesian theorem. Moreover, we used a weighted loss function to interpret the derived posterior distribution under more realistic public health scenarios. Specifically, in order to incorporate the prices and penalties into the inference and decision-making process, we built a continuous loss function to evaluate the action of 2 ̆ 2 estimate 2 ̆ 6 thetas; by posterior function 2 ̆ 2. Implementing <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>balances</b> that are useful in phase II clinical trials, we weighted findings reflecting the importance of minimizing errors due to overestimations than underestimations. Our results showed that Bayesian estimate is sensitive to the weights allocated on different priors, since the result from BOOST study has bigger mean and smaller variance than REPAIR-AMI. But it was mainly determined by the choice of loss function. Because in linear weight loss function, Bayesian estimate is defined as the percentile of posterior distribution. Thus defining an appropriate loss function for the posterior distribution is dominant in finding Bayesian estimates. ...|$|R
40|$|Although medical {{ultrasound}} offers compelling {{opportunities to}} improve therapy in principle, {{progress in the}} field has been limited because of an insufficient understanding of the potential genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of ultrasound on biological systems. This paper is mainly focused on an in vitro study of effects with respect to genotoxicity and viability induced by 1 - and 3 -MHz medical ultrasound in murine fibroblasts (NIH- 3 T 3) at low-intensity exposure (spatial peak temporal average intensity Ita< 0. 1 W/cm 2). The NIH- 3 T 3 cells constitute a well-characterized in vitro cell model in which a genotoxic effect can be predicted {{by means of a}} reliable and precise murine cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of micronuclei was observed in sonicated 3 T 3 cells. In particular, the effects were more evident at 1 MHz. Moreover, for each frequency investigated, the occurrence of micronuclei was comparatively more frequent with increasing time of exposure. The possible toxicological implications of the medical ultrasound employed herein deal with the existence of a window of exposure parameters (set well below the intensity of ultrasound cavitation) in which some genotoxic effects may occur without significant cytotoxicity. In this respect, they provide new insight toward the correct <b>risk</b> to <b>benefit</b> <b>balancing</b> of ultrasound-based treatments and for designing innovative therapeutic strategies. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Background: The {{onset of}} {{psychosis}} is mostly {{preceded by a}} prodromal phase in which occur a series of various attenuated positive symptoms, negative symptoms and functional impairment. Recently, several longitudinal studies have evaluated the validity and prediction power of the "prodromal risk syndrome for psychosis", {{which could lead to}} a better focused management of the patients at real risk of developing schizophrenia. At the same time, several authors have studied the pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for people at ultrahigh risk. Methods and aims: The objective of this review is to establish the status of our current knowledge about what is the most sensitive and specific tool to predict high risk of psychosis in the young population and which treatments have currently proved to be the most effective in the <b>risk</b> versus <b>benefits</b> <b>balance.</b> We will try to answer to these questions by reviewing the international literature from 2005 until today. Results: Recent studies show significant improvement in the identification of individuals at high risk of developing psychosis, using validated detection scales such as SIPS and CAARMS, multivariate neuroanatomical pattern classification and specific genetic factors. Cognitive Behavioral therapy, approach improving social functioning, and Long-Chain Ω- 3 Fatty Acids appears to be promising alternatives to antipsychotics, for which the balance between benefice and adverse side effects seems questionable. Conclusions: Detection of young people at ultrahigh risk of psychosis has significantly improved during the last 6 years. The challenge for the next decade will be to define a nosologic entity specific and sensitive enough to become a diagnostic category by itself, which could lead to specific guidelines for the preventive management of psychosis. © Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia...|$|R
40|$|The {{current debate}} {{about the value of}} early {{intervention}} (EI) in psychosis {{has become something of a}} 'culture war', and as we know all too well, in war, truth is the first casualty. Such {{debate about the}} value of early intervention is a curiosity in medicine. In every other area of health care where potentially serious illnesses are concerned, the value of early diagnosis is now well-accepted. Just as in psychiatry, treatments are not perfect but they are effective enough to justify early diagnosis, e. g., in cancer, arthritis and cardiovascular disease, provided the <b>risks</b> and <b>benefits</b> are <b>balanced</b> at each stage of the disease in question. The question of <b>risk</b> versus <b>benefit</b> is a perfectly valid focus for debate, and it needs data to inform it. Indeed one could argue that the only time that EI is not justified is if there are no effective treatments and that more harm than good results from initiating treatment. This also can happen if people are over-treated, such as with excessive doses of antipsychotic medications in first episode psychosis, or if the latter are used inappropriately in the pre-psychotic or sub-threshold stage of illness. Yet even in Alzheimer's disease, where treatment options are very limited, early diagnosis and intervention does not attract the controversy that it does in psychosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Arctic {{residents}} can {{be exposed to}} a wide range of contaminants through consumption of traditional (country) foods (i. e. food from wild animals and plants that are hunted, caught or collected locally in the Arctic). Yet these foods provide excellent nutrition, promote social cohesion, meet some spiritual needs for connectedness to the land and water, reinforce cultural ties, are economically important and promote overall good health for many. The <b>risk</b> and <b>benefit</b> <b>balance</b> associated with the consumption of traditional Arctic foods is complicated to communicate and has been referred to as the “Arctic Dilemma”. This article gives an update on health risk communication in the Arctic region. It briefly summarizes some research on risk communication methodologies as well as approaches to an evaluation of the outcomes of risk communication initiatives. It provides information on specific initiatives in several Arctic countries, and particularly those that were directed at Indigenous populations. This article also summarizes some international versus local risk communication activities and the complexity of developing and delivering messages designed for different audiences. Finally, the potential application of social media for risk communication and a summary of “best practices” based on published literature and a survey of Inuit in a few Arctic countries are described. Conclusion: Several of the risk communication initiatives portrayed in this article indicate that there is only limited awareness of the outcome of risk communication messages. In some cases, risk communication efforts appear to have been successful, at least when effectiveness is measured in an indirect way, for example, by lower contaminant levels. However, due to missing effectiveness evaluation studies, uncertainty remains as to whether a specific risk communication method was successful and could be clearly linked to behavioural changes that resulted in decreased contaminant exposure...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{objective in}} the development of targeted therapies is to identify the populations where the treatment under consideration has positive <b>benefit</b> <b>risk</b> <b>balance.</b> We consider pivotal clinical trials, where the efficacy of a treatment is tested in an overall population and/or in a pre-specified subpopulation. Based on a decision theoretic framework we derive optimized trial designs by maximizing utility functions. Features to be optimized include the sample size and the population in which the trial is performed (the full population or the targeted subgroup only) as well as the underlying multiple test procedure. The approach accounts for prior knowledge of the efficacy of the drug in the considered populations using a two dimensional prior distribution. The considered utility functions account for the costs of the clinical trial as well as the expected benefit when demonstrating efficacy in the different subpopulations. We model utility functions from a sponsor’s as well as from a public health perspective, reflecting actual civil interests.

40|$|Recurrence of deep endometriosis {{remains a}} major issue in the {{management}} of endometriosis. The main cause for recurrence appears to be an incomplete excisional surgery. Therefore, the goal of the primary surgery should be the complete resection of all endometriotic lesions. If surgical skills cannot meet this objective it seems preferable to refer the patient to a center with a recognized expertise in this field rather than performing an incomplete surgery. It seems also possible to tailor the indications according to the symptoms, especially when endometriosis affects the bladder in association with an asymptomatic vaginal and/or rectal involvement. This strategy does not increase the rate of recurrence. Postoperative medical treatment based on ovarian function suppression is attractive as it diminishes the recurrence rate. Facing the recurrence, appropriate assessment of the <b>benefit</b> <b>risk</b> <b>balance</b> must be performed. Medical treatment is an option.

30|$|If risk {{problems}} {{are associated with}} high ambiguity, {{it is not enough}} to demonstrate that risk regulation addresses the issues of public concerns. In these cases, the process of evaluation needs to be open to public input and new forms of deliberation. This starts with revisiting the question of proper framing. Is the issue really a risk problem or is it an issue of lifestyle or future vision? Often the benefits are contested as well as the risks. The debate about smart cities may illustrate the point that observers may be concerned not only about technical risks of network failures or privacy issues being violated by information transfer but also about the acceptability of a desired goal that reduces choices for individuals by means of a paternalistic design of choice situations (Thaler and Sunstein 2009; Kahneman 2011). The controversy is often much broader than dealing with risks only. The aim here is to find an overlapping consensus on the dimensions of ambiguity that need to be addressed in comparing <b>risks</b> and <b>benefits,</b> and <b>balancing</b> pros and cons. High ambiguity would require the most inclusive strategy for involvement because not only directly affected groups but also those indirectly affected should have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. Resolving ambiguities in risk debates necessitates a participatory involvement of the public to openly discuss competing arguments, beliefs, and values. The set of possible forms to involve the public includes citizen panels or juries, citizen forums, consensus conferences, public advisory committees, and similar approaches (Rowe and Frewer 2000; Beierle and Cayford 2002; Hagendijk and Irwin 2006; Abels 2007).|$|R

Certain food issues were of greater interest to researchers than others, perhaps reflecting the occurrence of a crisis, or policy concern. Three broad themes relevant to the development of best practice in <b>risk</b> (<b>benefit)</b> communication were identified: the characteristics of the target population; the contents of the information; and the characteristics of the information sources.
