40|$|The {{majority}} {{of studies of}} the pathogenesis of fever have been concerned with the elucidation of the febrile reaction after administration of bac-terial endotoxins to animals and man (1). Re-cently, evidence has been cited to support the theory that endotoxin-induced fever itself {{may be related to}} immune mechanisms (2). Fever is, moreover, a frequent manifestation of certain clini-cal illnesses in which antigen-antibody interactions are considered to play a role. It is of interest, therefore, that the production of fever in rabbits immunized with a nonbacterial protein antigen, bovine serum albumin, has been related to anti-body production and is similar in many respects to that seen after endotoxin administration (3, 4). The present studies were designed to investi-gate the relationship of fever to antibody response in rabbits immunized with human serum albumin and to compare fever in this model system to that induced by bacterial endotoxins. Methods Rabbits. More than 400 New Zealand albino rabbits of either sex, from the same colony (National Institutes of Health), weighing approximately 2 kg each, were used throughout. Animals were housed in air-conditioned quarters and tested in the same room. Recording of temperature. Temperatures (degrees Centigrade) were monitored with thermistors connected to a <b>recording</b> <b>telethermometer</b> 1 and inserted 4 to 6 inches into the rectum. Rabbits were trained for 5 to 8 hours in wooden stocks with loosely fitting collars on the day before testing.

40|$|A {{girl was}} first seen in May 1959 {{at the age}} of two n-months because of an extra lower {{extremity}}. The parents were very anxious to have the third extremity removed. It was only after much persuasion that they would permit photographs and roentgenograms to be obtained. Examination at that time revealed no other defects, and vital organs and functions were intact throughout. There was clinical evidence of innervation to the third limb and novernent of the toes was extremely active. Stimulation of the foot caused movement of ti-me toes, but no active motion of the remainder of the extremity resulted from stimulation. A cyst in the buttock of time third extrenmity was infected at-md required treatment before definitive surgery could be accom-pushed. At the age of eleven weeks, anputation of ti-me extremity was performed. Thernmal control of the patient was carried out by placing the child on a water n-mattress with regulation by a continuous <b>recording</b> rectal <b>telethermometer.</b> Using a posterior elliptical incision, time extra hemipelvis and extremity were carefully resected through their fibrous attachment to the left ilium. The origin of the gluteus maximus of the normal left limb was dissected from the pelvis of the third extremity and reflected posteriorly. The vessels were ligated and the nerves to the extr...|$|R
