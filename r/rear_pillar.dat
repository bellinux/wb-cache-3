25|$|For 1964 Chevrolet {{made only}} {{evolutionary}} {{changes to the}} Corvette. Besides the coupe's backbone window, the two simulated air intakes were eliminated from the hood, though their indentations remained. Also, the decorative air-exhaust vent on the coupe's <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> was made functional, but only on the left side. The car's rocker-panel trim {{lost some of its}} ribs and gained black paint between those ribs that remained; wheel covers were simplified; and the fuel filler/deck emblem gained concentric circles around its crossed-flags insignia. Inside, the original color-keyed steering wheel rim was now done in simulated walnut.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 the car gained {{rear light}} units from the Citroën Ami 6, and also {{standardised}} a third side {{window in the}} <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> on 2CV6 (602cc) models. From 1970, only two series were produced: the 2CV 4 (AZKB) with 435 cc and the 2CV 6 (Azka) with 602 cc displacement. All 2CVs from this date can run on unleaded fuel. 1970s cars featured rectangular headlights, except the Spécial model. In 1971 the front bench seat was replaced with two individual seats. In 1972 2CVs were fitted with standard three-point seat belts. In 1973 new seat covers, a padded single-spoke steering wheel and ashtrays were introduced.|$|E

50|$|The Sigma XL was the {{entry-level}} {{model of the}} range and came with either the 1.6 or 2.0-litre engines. In the SE, velour seats with lumbar control, adjustable headrests and a fold-down rear seat armrest with boot access were fitted. Reading lights incorporated into the roof-mounted dome light and built into the <b>rear</b> <b>pillars</b> were now a stock feature on the SE model Sigma. Power assisted steering was also an option along with electric windows. The SE model Sigma had stock dual line striping around the car, with chrome bonnet indicators.|$|R
5000|$|The windshield, very convex, is more {{inclined}} {{than the previous}} [...] "sitting room" [...] and slightly more content, {{in order to improve}} its aerodynamic penetration. On the <b>rear</b> <b>pillars</b> of considerable size, are integrated two long trapezoidal fins with the task of harmonising heights between roof and rear part is played by eight openings gill shark size and inclination that gradually diminish. The back window is flat and vertical while a [...] "duck tail" [...] rear spoiler adds character to the back, with its very wide wheels. Lots of louvers and vents aid in cooling the heart of the car, the Bandini 1000 Turbo engine.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the vehicle}} never {{underwent}} a generational facelift {{on the scale}} of the GAZ-21 (if one does not count its derivative successors), nonetheless the car was modernised during production. The early stage included removal of bonnet-mounted rear-view mirrors, new ignition and boot locks. The novel belt-speedometer proved too complicated and was replaced by a standard arrow-driven one, as was the fate of the engine cooling coupling that controlled the ventilator fan (proved unreliable, the ventilator would be permanently on, whilst warm air for cold starts would be manually controlled with venetian-type shutter). Additions included external comfort lights were on the <b>rear</b> <b>pillar's</b> chrome element, that turned on upon opening of rear doors.|$|R
5000|$|The landau {{term was}} revived during the 1960s. There was a trend for making [...] "fake convertibles" [...] by {{applying}} vinyl roofs on regular cars. Some of these vehicles were called [...] "landaus" [...] by their manufacturers, {{and many were}} fitted with landau bars on the rear quarters (faux cabriolet). Some used the term [...] "Town Landau" [...] such as {{for one of the}} 1967 models in the Ford Thunderbird line. This generally meant a wider <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> with no rear quarter windows, or a partial vinyl roof that was applied only over the rear seat area (and is thus reminiscent of a town car).|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, {{many changes}} {{were made to the}} Discovery. It reached some markets as the [...] "Discovery 2"; the 200Tdi and 3.5 L V8 engines were {{replaced}} with the 2.5 L 300Tdi 4-cylinder and 3.9-litre Rover V8 engines. The 300Tdi introduced a Bosch electronic emissions control for certain models and markets. At around this time a stronger R380 gearbox was fitted to all manual models. The newer models featured larger headlamps and a second set of rear lights in the bumper. The new rear lights had their wiring configuration changed several times to meet real or expected European safety legislation. Some vehicles were left with an arrangement where the vulnerable bumper contains the only working direction-indicator lights; other examples have these lights duplicated in the traditional <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> location.|$|E
5000|$|The {{removable}} roof {{consists of two}} carbon fiber panels, weighing 6 kg each, which required the reinforcement of the <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> {{to compensate for the}} loss of structural integrity as well as to accommodate the rollover protection and ventilation systems for the engine. The panels are easily removable and are stored in the front luggage compartment. The Aventador Roadster has a unique engine cover design and an attachable wind deflector to improve cabin airflow at high speed as well as a gloss black finish in the A-pillars, windshield header, roof panels, and rear window area. The car has a [...] base price. With a total weight of 1625 kg it's only 50 kg heavier than the coupé (the weight of the roof, plus additional stiffening in the sills and A-pillars).|$|E
5000|$|There {{were other}} {{changes for the}} Mk II; the front bumper was raised (in common with the Spitfire Mk.3) to conform to new crash regulations, necessitating a revised front end, and side vents {{were added to the}} front wings and <b>rear</b> <b>pillars.</b> Under the bonnet, the engine was uprated to develop [...] with a new {{cylinder}} head, camshaft, and manifolds. Performance improved to 107 mph, but perhaps more noteworthy the 0-60 mph time dropped to 10 seconds. The fuel economy was also improved to 25 mpgimp average. The interior was updated with a new dashboard and better ventilation, a two-speed heater fan and a black headlining. Overdrive remained a popular option for the manual transmission.|$|R

50|$|The 2003 Mitsubishi Endeavor is {{also built}} upon Mitsubishi’s PS platform. It uses RISE unibody {{structure}} that employs extensive reinforcement for additional passenger {{protection in the}} event of a collision. Robust front subframe members are connected with a dash panel crossmember and a strong, front steel crossmember to help create a rigid, boxed front subframe area. Reinforced side sill members also help disperse energy {{in the event of}} a collision. High-strength steel crossmembers across the floor also help absorb side impact energy and help protect occupants. Extensive use of energy absorbing materials appear on the interior and headliner and are used to cover the inside of the front center and <b>rear</b> <b>pillars</b> and help reduce the possibility of injury during a collision.|$|R
5000|$|Marked cruisers are white, with hood, trunk lid, {{front and}} rear quarter panels and bumpers painted navy blue. The words Waterloo Regional Police appear in white {{retroreflective}} text with a navy blue outline. A distinct solid red line curves from the front, through {{to the rear of}} the vehicle, with the motto [...] "People Helping People" [...] and [...] "911" [...] on the rear quarter panel. A series of white horizontal stripes appear above and below the curved red stripe. The crest of the police service appears on the <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> as well. A Canadian flag in addition to any special designations for the vehicle, such as [...] "Supervisor", [...] "Traffic", [...] "Duty Officer" [...] are displayed on the front fender. On the rear of the cruiser, the text [...] "Waterloo Regional Police" [...] is displayed on the left side of the trunk lid, and the vehicle number and divisional designation (where applicable) on the right side. On the bumper appears the police service website (wrps.on.ca), along with the Crime Stoppers tip-line number encompassed by retroreflective chevrons. Affixed to the roof is a red and blue LED light bar, as well as several antennas for communication and GPS.|$|E
50|$|Yadagiri {{is named}} after a sage named Yadava who {{performed}} heavy austerities to Lord Vishnu as Narasimha. Being please with him the lord gave him darshan in three forms: Jwala Narasimha, Gandabheranda Narasimha and Yogananda Narasimha. Sage Yadava begged for the lord {{to remain on the}} hill in these forms. Thus, you have the Lakshmi-Narasimhadeva temple on the hilltop with deities of Lord in all three forms embedded in stone in the main cave. Actually, it is a cave about 12 feet high by 30 feet long, located in back of the temple hall, by the <b>rear</b> <b>pillar.</b> You take a stairway down into the chamber and then toward the back. Jwala Narasimha is in the shape of serpent, while Yogananda Narasimha appears sitting in meditation in yoga pose. You will also see silver deities of Lakshmi-Narasimha, which are quite striking in appearance and lends presence of seeing them. To the right of the temple main door is a Hanuman temple. You'll see a long horizontal gap in the rock just below Hanuman. This is said to be where Gandabheranda Narasimha manifested. This is a very popular temple. It is said that any wish of sincere devotee visiting this temple will be fulfilled. The sanctum sanctorum or Garbhagriha is located in a cave, under a huge slating rock, which covers half the abode.|$|E
5000|$|For 1955, {{the entire}} senior line of Packards {{received}} an extensive design update that freshened the last restyling {{that was done}} in 1951. Under designer Richard A. Teague, the Senior Packards received a more modern grille design, [...] "Cathedral"-styled rear tail lights, hooded headlight housings and a new exterior trim layout that afforded Packard the ability to offer two- and three-tone paint combinations with the simplest of masking patterns. While Packard could not afford a whole new greenhouse for the passenger compartment, new trim {{at the base of}} the <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> made it look like it had a redesigned roofline. The cars were also outfitted with a wrap-around windshield, thus bringing it in line with American automobiles of the era. Inside, upholstery and bright work was also freshened and the cars received a new dashboard layout faced with a machined-look stainless steel facing.For 1955, the Patrician was offered as a four-door sedan only and Packard produced 9,127 of the cars. Changes for 1956 included a revised headlight housing that exaggerated the front peak further forward. The area around the headlight was painted black to give the effect of greater depth. The car also received a different grille texture. During the 1956 model year, 3375 Patricians rolled off Packard's production line before the model was dropped by the ailing carmaker.|$|E
50|$|Full-length chrome rocker panels {{set off the}} 1951 model, and the Coupe de Ville was now {{marked with}} noticeably-improved trim, {{including}} Coupe de Ville script on the <b>rear</b> roof <b>pillar.</b> Sales were 81,844, or a record of over 74% of all Cadillacs sold. Popular Mechanics reported about 12-MPG at 45 mph.|$|R
50|$|A few Fiat 147s were {{exported}} to Europe, either with the diesel engine {{or with the}} Panorama bodywork.

5000|$|... 2013 {{marked the}} Avalanche's {{last year of}} production. For 2013, all Avalanches, {{regardless}} of trim level, featured the Black Diamond Edition Package, which added Black Diamond Edition emblems to the <b>rear</b> <b>pillars,</b> replacing the previous trim level designation emblems, and also adding unique emblems inside the Avalanche commemorating its production from 2002 to 2013. The 2013 Avalanche was produced in limited numbers. Each 2013 Avalanche buyer received a limited-edition coffee table book with photographs of the owner's 2013 Avalanche, {{a copy of the}} window sticker from their vehicle, and a complete history of the Avalanche from 2002 to 2013. The book was shipped to either the dealership or owner's home after the owner took delivery of their new 2013 Avalanche. In addition, a newly available color, named Fairway Green Metallic, commemorated the last year of production for the Avalanche (2013).|$|R
5000|$|Released on 26 July 1970, the HG Monaro was {{the last}} of the {{original}} coupé design concept. HG had cleaner lines with brightwork reduced and some re-designed. The HG sported different striping (delete options) which were known as [...] "sidewinder" [...] stripes which ran along the top edge of the fenders, under the windows and finishing just before the <b>rear</b> <b>pillar.</b> The [...] "Monaro" [...] badge on both rear pillars was introduced to all models. For the HG GTS, the [...] "GTS" [...] badges now featured black paint fill, received new black-out paint on rocker panels, with the GTS 350 getting bold treatment with new [...] "sidewinder" [...] stripes and bonnet scoop black-outs. [...] "GTS 350" [...] designations now featured gutsier decals on the fenders and boot lid. Wheel arch moldings were deleted on all models. The [...] "GTS 350" [...] models no longer had the 350 Chevrolet badge on the fender, but rather a bold decal stating [...] "350" [...] as well as blackouts that covered the air-vents on the bonnet. The GTS badge originally above the gills in the fenders would be removed and would now be black instead of red (with the badges being placed on the passenger side of the grille and boot). The taillights had a cleaner look and the grille was redesigned.|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} the Hotspur Land Rover, named after the brand of armour plate made in Wales used in its construction. The chassis of a {{civilian}} Land Rover 109 station wagon was used. Underneath the standard aluminium roof a second roof, fabricated from armoured steel, was installed. This provided overhead protection from gunfire, petrol bombs and IEDs. Large plates of ballistic steel were bolted {{to the sides of}} the vehicle, which wrapped around the <b>rear</b> <b>pillar</b> and met with an armoured double door. Both of these doors and the side plates were fitted with sliding pistol ports, allowing the officers inside to return fire {{in the event of an}} ambush. The rear doors, sides and roof constituted an armoured box providing all round protection to the crew in the rear of the vehicle. For the protection of the driver and the front seat passenger, the windscreen and side windows were replaced with thick sheets of bulletproof glass, along with armour-plated doors. Finally, a fabricated (not expanded) metal grille could be pulled up over the windscreen to prevent the windscreen being broken by thrown objects during civil disorder, and the side windows covered with a sheet of transparent polycarbonate for the same purpose.The Hotspur was immediately put into action and worked admirably. Myriad modifications were carried out over the years, including lining the vehicles' lower panels with sheets of polycarbonate to prevent the body panels from being dented during civil disorder. Metal grilles and rubber skirts were fitted around the lower perimeter of the vehicle to prevent projectiles being thrown under the body at officers who were sheltering behind, and also to prevent beer kegs being rolled under the vehicle in an attempt to immobilise it.|$|E
40|$|The {{myocardium}} receives its {{arterial blood}} through two arteries, {{right and left}} coronary artery. Atherosclerosis is a chronic condition characterized by endothelial damage, followed by accumulation of lymphocytes, macrophages and lipoproteins, among others, between the intima and media layer. One of the secondary complications of myocardial infarction is valvular insufficiency as result of necrosis of the pillars. Our goal is to color the heart vessels, dissect the pillars of the first order and analyze blood supply from its base. It has been worked with 25 human hearts which were infiltrated with differential colors the right coronary artery, anterior descending and circumflex. Then were separated both right and left valvular apparatus. After removing the pillars were severed at its base to analyze {{the way they were}} coloring and observe the mode of vascularization.

40|$|International audienceControl of {{longitudinal}} vortices in {{the wake}} of a simplified car geometry: experimental approach. The control by blowing techniques of longitudinal vortices originating at the <b>rear</b> <b>pillars</b> of a simplified automobile vehicle are analyzed by an experimental approach on the Ahmed body having a rear window angle of 25 ◦. The experimental measurements are conducted according to stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (Stereo-PIV). The results show that the blowing technique is associated to an increase of vorticity inside the vortex core on the upper part of the rear window and a decrease of vorticity on the lower part of the window. This vorticity drop is related to the onset of a recirculation zone (negative longitudinal velocities) in the vortex core which characterizes the vortex breakdown. The analysis of the azimuthal and longitudinal velocities allows to identify the increase of the Swirl number up to the critical point of vortex breakdown noted for high blowing velocities...|$|R
