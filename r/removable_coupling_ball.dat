Bracken {{appeared to}} take Sehwag plumbed LBW on the replays, but it was given not out. A <b>couple</b> of <b>balls</b> later Bracken took Sehwag LBW again and was given out, despite replays showing it would have bounced well over the stumps. The bad umpiring continued when Tendulkar edged through to Gilchrist, but was given not out. Yet another umpiring mistake was made just a <b>couple</b> of <b>balls</b> later when Pathan was given out LBW, replays showing he inside edged, leaving India at 2-54 after 11.2 overs. Next Gambhir, Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh were all caught, India looking shaky at 5-102 are 28.3 overs. Australia's bowling was tight (Clark 1/26 from 10, Johnson 2/24 from 10), but the job of defending such a meager target proved too much. Rohit Sharma (39 from 61) and Dhoni (17 from 54) combined well for a great winning partnership {{under a lot of}} pressure. India reached home with 5 wickets and 25 balls to spare.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the development of}} task-specific couplings among functional subsystems (i. e., ball circulation, respiration, and body sway) when learning to juggle a three-ball cascade, {{with a focus on}} learning-induced changes in the <b>coupling</b> between <b>ball</b> movements and respiration and the <b>coupling</b> between <b>ball</b> movements and body sway. Six novices practiced to juggle three balls in cascade fashion for one hour per day for twenty days. On specific days (7 in total), ball movements, center-of-pressure (CoP) trajectories and respiration traces were measured simultaneously. Discrete, time-continuous and spectral analyses revealed that the spatio-temporal variability of the juggling patterns decreased with practice and that {{the degree to which the}} task constraints were satisfied increased gradually. No conclusive evidence was found for <b>ball</b> movement-respiration <b>coupling.</b> In contrast, clear-cut evidence was found for the presence of 1 : 3 and 2 : 3 frequency locking between the vertical component of the ball trajectories and both the anterior-posterior and the medio-lateral components of the CoP. Incidence and expression of these mode locks varied across individuals and altered in the course of learning. Gradual changes in locking strength, appearances and disappearances of mode locks, as well as abrupt transitions between coupled states were observed. These results indicate that dissimilar learning dynamics may arise in the functional embedding of subsystems into a task-specific organization and that motor equivalence is an inherent property of such emerging task-specific organizations...|$|R

40|$|NiCr alloy-coated BaF 2 center dot CaF 2 {{eutectic}} and Cr 3 C 2 powders were respectively {{prepared by}} both pressurized hydrogen reduction and solid state alloying technology. Using this NiCr/Cr 3 C 2 -BaF 2 center dot CaF 2 composite powder, a derived coating {{was produced by}} atmospheric plasma spray (APS) technology. Microstructures and phase compositions of the powders, {{as well as the}} deposited coating, were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The friction and wear behavior of the coatings from ambient temperature to 800 degrees C was evaluated using a ball-on-disk tribometer. The results show that the NiCr/Cr 3 C 2 -BaF 2 center dot CaF 2 composite coating exhibited low porosity, high microhardness and high cohesive strength, which result in good friction reduction and excellent anti-wear ability at elevated temperatures up to 800 degrees C. The friction coefficient of NiCr/Cr 3 C 2 -BaF 2 center dot CaF 2 coating decreases with increasing temperature. The wear rates of both coating and <b>couple</b> <b>balls</b> are significantly lower at temperatures above 500 degrees C than those tested at room temperature. From the investigation of worn surfaces, it was concluded that brittle fracture and delamination were the dominant wear mechanisms of the coatings at low temperature. A transition stage from brittle to plastic state with decreased shear strength was observed for BaF 2 center dot CaF 2 eutectic at high temperatures, which resulted in the formation of a continuous lubricating layer in the wear track above 500 degrees C The excellent mechanical properties of the coating were partially attributed to the protection of NiCr layer of the composite powders which decreased the oxidation. decarburization and ablation of Cr 3 C 2 -BaF 2 center dot CaF 2 during spraying.

40|$|Annual {{energy use}} for {{heating and cooling}} of a single-occupant office room located in Lund (Sweden) was {{analysed}} for eight solar-protective glazing options and one shading system. Various glazing-to-wall area ratios (GWAR) and orientations were studied. The energy performance was assessed through computer simulations with the program DEROB-LTH recently supplemented with improved algorithms for windows and exterior shading systems. The study showed that the most energy-efficient glazing option was orientation-dependent: south and north orientations required higher solar transmittance or GWAR than east and west, assuming similar coefficients of performance (COP) for heating and cooling systems and equivalent thermal losses among all cases. The study also demonstrated that a <b>removable</b> awning <b>coupled</b> with clear glazing performed better in terms of annual energy use than all solar-protective glazing options tested. However, it was also demonstrated that the fixed awning resulted in higher annual energy use compared with solar-protective glazing for all orientations. This study generally shows that glazing and shading strategies should be flexible in cold climates and allow the use of solar gains during the heating season while limiting those gains during the cooling season. Removable or dynamic shading systems offer larger potential energy savings than fixed systems or solar-protective glazing. ...|$|R
