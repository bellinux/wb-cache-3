5|$|As {{the urban}} area {{continued}} to expand, much of rural Scarborough was converted to suburban housing {{developments in the}} last third of the 20th century. At the start of the 21st century, growth occurred along the Highway 401 corridor at the northern end of the Scarborough RT; highrise condominium projects have increased the <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> around Scarborough City Centre.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{the city}} has {{experienced}} steady population growth, and has been faced {{with the issue of}} accommodating more residents. In 2006, after growing by 4,000citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200,000people by2040. However, former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60%, or 350,000people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle's single-family housing zoning laws. The Seattle City Council later voted to relax height limits on buildings in the greater part of Downtown, partly with the aim to increase <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> in the city center. As a sign of increasing inner-city growth, the downtown population crested to over 60,000 in 2009, up 77% since 1990.|$|E
25|$|The Beltline is a {{neighbourhood}} in transition. The district, {{along with}} the Rivers District and the Downtown East Village, are presently {{in the midst of}} an ambitious urban planning and rejuvenation venture planned by the city's municipal government to increase the <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> of central Calgary. On May 15, 2006 the Calgary City Council approved the Beltline Area Redevelopment Plan. The plan details land use policies and implementation recommendations which are designed to be implemented concurrently with the broader Land Use Bylaw redesign, to take effect in 2008. It aims to accommodate up to 40,000 residents in the neighbourhood by 2035.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} suggests that mixed land-uses encourage non-auto commuting; however, the evidence remains sketchy. This paper explores this question by investigating how the presence of retail activities in neighborhoods influences the commuting choices of residents {{using data from the}} 1985 American Housing Survey. Having grocery stores and other consumer services within 300 feet of one's residence is found to encourage commuting by mass transit, walking and bicycling, controlling for such factors as <b>residential</b> <b>densities</b> and vehicle ownership levels. When retail shops are beyond 300 feet yet within 1 mile of residences, however, they tend to encourage auto-commuting, ostensibly because of the ability to efficiently link work and shop trips by car. The presence of nearby commercial land-uses is also associated with relatively low vehicle ownership rates and short commuting distances among residents of a mixed-use neighborhood. Overall, <b>residential</b> <b>densities</b> exerted a stronger influence on commuting mode choices than levels of land-use mixture, except for walking and bicycle commutes. For non-motorized commuting, {{the presence or absence of}} neighborhood shops is a better predictor of mode choice than <b>residential</b> <b>densities.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Among {{the bigger}} {{challenges}} facing the town (and other small towns) with respect to mass transit is the low overall population density and dispersed development that results in a pattern of travel that is less focused on the downtown and hence more difficult to serve by transit. Studies show that for every 1% increase in <b>residential</b> <b>density,</b> there is a 0.22% rise in transit ridership. However, destination density, such as clustered employment locations, {{tend to have a}} larger impact on transit ridership than <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> alone.|$|E

40|$|Large-scale private landlordism dominates {{low-income housing}} {{provision}} in Nairobi, with extreme <b>residential</b> <b>densities</b> in districts where rooming tenements reach seven floors above ground. This trend {{differs from the}} small-scale private landlordism, predominantly with owner occupation, which has been documented for the developing world. Nairobi's large-scale multi-storey private rental has remained unmentioned in housing and tenure literature on the developing world. The terms 'tenement' and 'tenement city' are largely associated with {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} century rental investment in Europe and the US when cities were shaped by the profit-making interests of landlords. In this article, two case studies of tenement areas in Nairobi, low-income Huruma and middle-income Umoja Inner Core, are analysed in terms of the evolution of the tenement investment and current <b>residential</b> <b>densities.</b> The ongoing, mostly unauthorized construction of tenements suggests that Nairobi could be termed a tenement city, a reality that is not currently addressed by the urban discourse.

5000|$|A second {{extensive}} comparative {{traffic study}} [...] of a subdivision about 830 acres (3.4 km2) tested three network models.

At a 90 ppha, the conventional pattern showed marginally higher delay per trip than the grid.
