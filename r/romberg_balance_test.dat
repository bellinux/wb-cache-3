40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find what effects Tai Chi Chuan (a form of exercise) had on balance, {{flexibility}} and psychosocial aspects in the elderly. A convenience sample was taken of people 55 and over (ages ranged from 58 to 92) from Dave Barrett 2 ̆ 7 s Tai Chi classes. The subjects were measured for spinal and shoulder flexibility, tested with eight different balance test batteries, and give an affect balance scale questionnaire to rate the psychosocial aspects. Pre- and post- treatment measures were recorded over an eight week period of Tai Chi classes and home practice. The actual number of practices averaged three to five sessions a week. Analysis of variance revealed significant improvement on the Sharpened <b>Romberg</b> <b>balance</b> <b>test.</b> Other data revealed that Tai Chi does in fact have promising effects on the positive affect of the elderly group and a trend towards improved flexibility was obvious. However, due to the limitations of this study, an adequate conclusion cannot be stated about the effects of Tai Chi on other balance tests. Further controlled research solely in the area of balance is highly recommended...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose. The {{trend in}} {{physical}} fitness assessment {{during the past}} 35 years instead of stress motor performance and athletic fitness evaluation (i. e. speed, agility, power, and balance) focuses on assessment of functional capacities related to overall good health and disease prevention. Thus, a term of health-related physical fitness became topical with four its components: aerobic and/or cardiovascular fitness, body composition, abdominal muscle strength and endurance, and lower back and hamstring flexibility. This study was undertaken to evaluate physical activity relation to health-related physical fitness in students. Methods. All participants filled in physical activity questionnaire about duration of their daily activities of slow walking, fast walking, sport exercises at university and additional sport exercises. Health-related physical testing included several core components: 1) body composition evaluation (body weight, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, body fat, muscle mass), 2) abdominal muscles and hamstring muscles manual tests, 3) dynamometry, 4) hamstring muscles and m. quadratus lumborum elasticity evaluation tests, 5) <b>Romberg</b> <b>balance</b> <b>test,</b> 6) bicycle ergometer test. Results. There were significant differences between physical activity level of Physical Education students and Physiotherapy students, and between men and women. Physical activity positively correlates with waist-to hip-ratio, muscle mass, grip strength and cardiorespiratory fitness parameters, and negatively with body fat. Conclusions. Physical activity significantly affects body composition, grip strength and aerobic capacity...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D {{supplements}} {{have been}} used to prevent fractures. The effect may be mediated through increased bone mass, but also through reduced falling propensity. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association between 25 -hydroxy vitamin D levels (25 OHD), fall-associated variables (including tests of functional performance), and fracture in ambulatory women. At baseline 25 OHD was measured in 986 women. Fall-associated variables were investigated at baseline. Fractures were recorded during a 3 -year follow-up. Four percent of the women had 25 OHD levels below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/l), and 26 % had 25 OHD levels below 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l). 25 OHD correlated with gait speed (r = 0. 17, P < 0. 001), the <b>Romberg</b> <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> (r = 0. 14, P < 0. 001), self-estimated activity level (r = 0. 15, P < 0. 001), and thigh muscle strength (r = 0. 08, P = 0. 02). During the 3 -year follow-up, 119 out of the 986 women sustained at least one fracture. The Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) (95 % confidence interval) for sustaining a fracture during the follow-up was 2. 04 (1. 04 - 4. 04) for the group of women with 25 OHD below 20 ng/ml, in which 9 out of 43 women sustained a fracture. Thirty-two of the 256 women with 25 OHD levels below 30 ng/ml sustained a fracture during the follow-up, with a non-significant HR of 1. 07 (1. 07 - 1. 61). This cohort of elderly, ambulatory women had a high mean 25 OHD. A low 25 OHD was associated with inferior physical activity level, gait speed and balance. A 25 OHD level below 30 ng/ml was not associated with an increased risk of fractures in this study. However, a subgroup of women with 25 OHD levels below 20 ng/ml had a tendency to an increased risk of fractures, which may be associated with an inferior physical activity and postural stability...|$|E

40|$|Background: Most HIV-seropositive {{subjects}} {{in western countries}} receive {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART). Although many aspects of their health have been studied, little is known about their vestibular and balance function. The goals of this study were to determine the prevalences of vestibular and balance impairments among HIV-seropositive and comparable seronegative men and women and to determine if those groups differed. Methods: Standard screening tests of vestibular and balance function, including head thrusts, Dix-Hallpike maneuvers, and <b>Romberg</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> on compliant foam were performed during semiannual study visits of participants who were enrolled in the Baltimore and Washington, D. C. sites of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and the Women’s Interagency HIV Study. Results: No significant differences by HIV status were found on most tests, but HIV-seropositive subjects who were using HAART had a lower frequency of abnormal Dix-Hallpike nystagmus than HIV-seronegative subjects. A significant number of nonclassical Dix-Hallpike responses were found. Age was associated with Romberg scores on foam with eyes closed. Sex was not associated with any of the test scores.

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the capacity of}} a single triaxial accelerometer sensor in detecting gait and balance impairments in pre-manifest and manifest Huntington's disease (HD) subjects. Methods Fourteen manifest HD (MHD) (age: 51. 83 ± 14. 8), ten pre-manifest HD (PHD) (age: 44. 8 ± 11. 7) and ten healthy subjects (HLY) (age: 56. 4 ± 10. 9) were recruited. The sensor {{was attached to the}} upper sternum as subjects completed gait and <b>Romberg</b> <b>balance</b> <b>tests.</b> An inverted pendulum model of the body's centre of mass and an unbiased autocorrelation procedure were employed to derive gait parameters from the triaxial accelerometer signal. The accuracy of the gait measurements was compared to those recorded by a computerized walkway. Results Strong agreement was seen between the sensor and the walkway; cadence (ICC = 0. 95, CI = [0. 75, 0. 97]), velocity (ICC = 0. 94, CI = [0. 75, 0. 97]) and step length (ICC = 0. 89, CI = [0. 77, 0. 95]). Sensor derived velocity was significantly higher in HLY (p < 0. 001) and PHD (p < 0. 005) when compared to MHD. Step and stride length was significantly longer in HLY (p < 0. 05) and PHD (p < 0. 001) when compared to MHD. Significant differences between subject groups across all four balance tasks (p < 0. 001) were found.

40|$|Road {{fatalities}} {{related to}} marijuana intoxication have steadily {{increased over the}} last 10 years (Drummer, 1994; Drummer, 1998; Drummer & Gerostamoulos, 1999). This {{has led to the}} introduction of sobriety testing in Victoria, Australia to test for driving impairment caused by marijuana and other psychotropic drugs. Surveys have reported an increase in community concern in Australia over the use of marijuana and an increase in the prevalence and use of marijuana (National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Survey; 1985, 1988, 1991, 1993; National Drug Household Survey; 1995, 1998). Commensurate with the increase in the use of marijuana in society, road statistics indicated that the number of road accidents and deaths involving the presence of THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) in driver specimens has also increased (Drummer & Gerostamoulos, 1999). Consistent with these mortality statistics, past research examining the effects of THC on driving ability indicate that THC impairs both car control (Moskowitz, 1985), and the maintenance of the lateral position of a vehicle (Ramaekers et al., 2000). Intoxication by THC is more likely to result in the crashing into obstacles on a driving course than when not intoxicated (Hansteen et al., 1976). These findings indicate that marijuana impairs driving ability and since the prevalence of marijuana use is increasing this poses a significant risk on our roads. It is essential therefore, that a tool that detects levels of THC in drivers, similar to breath analysis instruments used for the detection of alcohol in drivers, is introduced. To date, there is no such reliable instrument, that could be used on the roadside, and that accurately measures the level of THC in humans. For this reason, some government departments have considered the use of sobriety tests to detect impaired driving. In particular, the Standardised Field Sobriety test (SFSTs) that comprises the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test (HGN), Walk and Turn test (WAT) and the One Leg Stand test (OLS) were implemented in Victoria, Australia from December 1 st 2000. The validity of these tests have been previously examined by other researchers and their conclusions suggest that sobriety tests have a varied accuracy in detecting impairment caused by drugs, ranging from 44 % to 94 % (Heishman et al., 1996; Compton, 1986). The present study examines the efficiency of sobriety tests to detect impairment in driving caused by marijuana. The SFSTs were examined, as well as the <b>Romberg</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>test</b> (RB) and the Finger to Nose test (FTN) taken from the Drug Evaluation and Classification Program (DECP) (Los Angeles Police Department, USA). The present study was conducted by Swinburne University, Victoria, Australia. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in the USA (NIDA) provided the marijuana cigarettes. The major objectives of the study were to examine the influence of cannabis on driving performance and on performance on the sobriety tests. The relationship between simulated driving performance and sobriety test performance was then examined to establish the accuracy of sobriety tests to predict driving ability. The present study also examined whether any differences in performance either on the driving tests or on the sobriety tests exist between regular cannabis users and non-regular cannabis users. Driving stress was an additional variable assessed to establish whether individuals with low, normal or high driver stress perform differently on the driving task after the consumption of a low and high dose of cannabis. We tested 40 participants comprising 14 females and 26 males. All participants completed a medical examination questionnaire, demographics questionnaire, Frequency of Cannabis Use Questionnaire and Intoxication Rating Questionnaire. All participants completed 3 marijuana sessions involving the administration of a placebo cigarette (0 % THC, weight 702 mg,. 000 gm &#x 2206;- 9 -THC; 0. 0 mg/kg THC), the administration of a low THC cigarette (1. 74 % THC, weight 779 mg,. 813 gm &#x 2206;- 9 -THC; 0. 2 mg/kg THC) and the administration of a high THC marijuana cigarette (2. 93 % THC, weight 790 mg, 1. 776 gm &#x 2206;- 9 -THC; 0. 73 mg/kg THC). All sessions were randomised (using Latin-square design), counter-balanced and double-blind. In each session, participants completed 3 sobriety tests and 2 driving simulator tests. Sobriety tests were scored by allocating a score of 1 for each sign (error, e. g., hopping during test performance to maintain balance) observed by the administrator. Generally, a score of 2 or more constituted impairment to a degree equivalent to a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) above 0. 10 %. The driving simulator test comprised 36 variables. Each time the participant performed an error, a loading factor was added to the corresponding variable (e. g., collision (variable) loading factor is 10, if a collision occurred twice a score of 20 was allocated to this variable). The sum of all 36 variables constituted the level of overall driving impairment. Blood samples were taken throughout each session approximately 20 minutes apart. Intoxication Rating Questionnaires revealed that participants reported that the subjective effect of placebo cigarettes was much weaker than the cigarettes that they usually smoke and that no psychological (such as time distortion) and physiological (such as increased heart rate) changes were experienced. For the low THC cigarettes most participants described the strength, and the effects, as similar to cannabis that they usually smoke. The high THC cigarette was described by most participants as being much stronger, and having some different symptoms, when compared to cannabis that they usually smoked. There were however, some differences in the description of the low THC and the high THC cannabis cigarettes between regular and non-regular cannabis users. Regular users reported that the high THC cigarette was more similar to the cannabis that they usually smoke, whereas non-regular users stated that this was more likely to be the case for the low THC cigarette. Results from the driving simulator task revealed that THC impaired the driving variables: 'traddling the solid line' and 'straddling the barrier line'. The results indicated that increasing levels of THC increasingly impaired the ability to maintain the steady position of a vehicle within the correct traffic lane. The consumption of low and high doses of THC resulted in two or more wheels of the vehicle moving over a solid line marked out for traffic moving in the opposite direction. Low and high doses of THC also resulted in two or more wheels of the vehicle moving over a broken/barrier line marked out for traffic moving in the same direction. Increasing levels of THC appear to impair both balance and attention required to control the position of a vehicle in traffic. These results are consistent with past research that indicates that THC impairs car control (Moskowitz, 1985) and increases the standard deviation of the lateral position of a vehicle (Smiley et al., 1981; Ramaekers et al., 2000). Research into the effects of THC on brain cannabinoid receptors indicate that THC interferes with normal functioning of the cerebellum, the brain region responsible for balance, posture, and the coordination of movement (Childers & Breivogel, 1998). When driving ability was impaired the level of THC in the blood was between 3 and 5 ng/ml. These findings are consistent with previous research that has reported that driving is maximally impaired by THC plasma levels of 13 ng/ml (approximately 8 ng/ml in blood, using a multiplication factor of 1. 6 (Giroud, et al., 2001) (Berghaus et al., 1995). The {{results of the present study}} also indicated that THC impairs performance on sobriety tests with more individuals impaired with increasing levels of THC (e. g., at Time 1; placebo: 2. 5 %, low THC: 23. 1 %, and high THC: 46. 2 %). Performances on the sobriety tests RB and FTN were unrelated to the level of THC. The test most related to the level of THC was the OLS test, where almost all signs of this test were observed, after the consumption of both low and high THC cigarettes. The accuracy of a 'new' sign in the scoring procedure of the HGN test: head moves/jerks (HMJ) was also identified. Including HMJ increased the percentage of individuals scored as impaired after the consumption of low and high THC cigarettes (e. g., at Time 1; placebo: 2. 5 %, low THC: 38. 5 % and high THC: 56. 4 %). Including HMJ as a sign significantly improved the accuracy of the SFSTs to detect impairment associated with the level of THC. The mean level of THC in the blood, when the highest number of participants were classified as impaired, was 70 ng/ml. Differences in performance were observed between regular cannabis users and nonregular cannabis users. Non-regular cannabis users were more impaired on the driving simulator task after the consumption of low and high levels of THC when compared to regular users. Non-regular users recorded significantly longer RTs to emergency situations, more collisions, and shorter distances between the vehicle and an object (after an emergency stop) when compared to regular cannabis users. Signs exhibited during sobriety test performance were related to the level of THC more often for nonregular users compared to regular users. The level of THC in the blood was higher in regular users, compared to non-regular users, at all times in both THC conditions. When driving ability was impaired and significantly related to the level of THC, the SFSTs were also related to level of THC. Sobriety test performance was related to driving impairment, because, as driving impairment increased with the level of THC, so did the number of signs present during the performance of the sobriety tests. Since nonregular users performed more poorly on the driving task compared to regular users, it is no surprise that they exhibited a larger number of signs during the sobriety testing. Although there was a positive linear relationship between driving ability and sobriety tests, such as the relationship between straddling barrier lines and the OLS test, the validity of sobriety tests to predict driving impairment in part depends upon the size of this relationship. Using performance on the SFSTs to assess 'impairment', 46. 7 % of individuals in the high THC condition were impaired. A discriminant analysis was performed to determine whether the remaining 53. 3 % of participants were also impaired but not classified as impaired, or whether the SFSTs correctly classified them as not impaired. The results indicated that the sobriety tests (SFSTs; HGN, WAT and OLS) correctly assessed 76. 3 % of participants in the high THC condition as either impaired on driving or not impaired on driving. Specifically, this percentage included the correct identification of 84 % of impaired drivers as impaired, but only 61. 5 % of unimpaired drivers as unimpaired. The best predictor of driving impairment was the OLS test. In the low THC condition the sobriety tests correctly classified 100 % of impaired drivers as impaired, but this occurred at the expense of falsely classifying most unimpaired drivers as also impaired. This finding suggests that sobriety tests detect the presence of THC even when driving is not impaired. Examining the utility of including the 'new' sign HMJ in the SFSTs indicated that when identifying impairment on the driving task performed at Time 2, in both the low and high THC condition, the SFSTs were a better predictor of driving impairment when HMJ was included than when the sign was not included. This finding suggests that the inclusion of HMJ in SFSTs scoring procedure increases the likelihood of detecting drivers who are impaired by THC. In conclusion, the results suggest that THC impairs driving ability by reducing one's ability to maintain a safe position in traffic. At this time THC blood levels are between 3 and 5 ng/ml. THC also impairs driving ability differently for non-regular and regular users of cannabis, where non-regular users are more impaired by THC than regular users. When this occurs, THC blood levels in non-regular users are between 2 and 12 ng/ml, and in regular users between 5 and 16 ng/ml. Performance on the sobriety tests is also impaired by increasing levels of THC. The OLS test is the most sensitive test in detecting the presence of THC. In the present study the SFST battery and each individual test that it comprises are moderate predictors of driving impairment but do misclassify 16 % of impaired individuals and 38. 5 % of not impaired individuals. In addition, the results suggest that sobriety tests are more sensitive to the presence of THC than actual driving impairment. This was revealed by the large number of individuals judged as impaired on driving in the low and high THC conditions even when driving was unaffected. It is important to note that when this occurred, the sobriety tests were accurate in detecting 100 % of impaired individuals. Finally, the introduction of the 'new' sign HMJ is likely to increase the accuracy of the SFSTs to detect individuals impaired by THC and this sign should be considered for inclusion by policing agencies...|$|E

Both textured insoles and athletic tape are deemed to be beneficial for enhancing proprioception because of the capacity for exploiting availability of “sensorimotor system noise”, which enhances movement control and individuals’ joint position perception. It was hypothesized that the compression feature in knee length socks would provide greater stimulation to lower leg mechanoreceptors, and help participants achieve better balance control. Participants (N= 8) performed a 30 -s <b>Romberg</b> static <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> protocol under three conditions (barefoot; wearing commercial socks; wearing textured compression socks), in a counterbalanced order, with four levels of performance difficulty: (1) standing on a stable surface with open eyes (SO); (2) a stable surface with closed eyes (SC); (3) a foam surface with open eyes (FO); and (4) a foam surface with closed eyes (FC). Two commonly investigated recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) measures (% Det and entropy) were extracted from the recurrence plot for multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). There were no significant interactions between the levels of performance difficulty and the sock treatments, p> 0. 05 for both % Det and entropy in both Anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions. There was no significant main effect of sock treatments, P> 0. 05). However, a main effect for performance difficulty on % Det and entropy was observed in both AP and ML directions.

Results The recovery times (defined as the time until the significant difference between the value at each time point and the baseline value disappeared) in the dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> (CDP), USW test, MSW test, and TUG test, were 80, 40, 80, 80 [*]min, respectively. There was a significant, strong positive correlation between the result of the dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> (CDP) and the TUG test (P < 0. 01; r = 0. 70). Conclusion The TUG test is a useful simple dynamic balance/motor test {{that can be used in}} daily clinical practice in the elderly...|$|R

40|$|Background: For allied health {{professionals}} wishing {{to assess the}} functional balance of older adults living in the community, the vast number of functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> available {{makes it difficult to}} decide which assessment is most appropriate. Objective: To identify the reliability, concurrent validity and clinical practicality of functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> with community dwelling older adults. Methods: A systematic review of published literature relevant to 17 functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> was undertaken. The 17 functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> were identified by a preliminary literature search and through consultation with an expert in the field of functional balance assessment. Studies published in English before January 2007, assessing the use of these functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> with community dwelling adults aged 65 years or above were included. The CINAHL, MEDLINE, Ageline, Amed, PubMed, Cochrane library, PEDro and Joanna Briggs Institute databases were searched. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using a checklist criteria adapted from the Cochrane Working Group for Screening and Diagnostic Tests. Results: Eight databases were searched and 21 studies were included. The majority of studies demonstrated low to moderate methodological quality scores. Despite limitations reported for clinical application with community dwelling older adults, the Berg Balance Scale and the Timed Up and Go Test have been most rigorously tested. Reliability and concurrent validity of the Balance Screening Tool and the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale had also been established in this population, however only one study was retrieved for each. Conclusion: The Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go Test have published reliability, validity with community dwelling older adults. Further testing of other functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> is required to establish their reliability and validity in this target population...|$|R

40|$|The Nintendo Wii™ is {{becoming}} an increasingly popular technology for the training and assessment of balance in older adults. Recent studies have shown promising results for its use in fall prevention. However, {{it is not clear}} how scores on the WiiFit™ balance games relate to current standardized <b>tests</b> of <b>balance</b> and mobility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between WiiFit™ Plus <b>balance</b> <b>tests,</b> and standardized tests of older adult fitness, balance, mobility, self-reported balance confidence, and visual attention and processing. Results from 34 older adult participants indicate that WiiFit™ <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> do not correlate well with standardized functional balance, mobility and fitness tests. However, the Wii balance score, as measured by the Basic Balance Test of the WiiFit™, does correlate with visual processing speed as measured by the Useful Field of View (UFOV(®)) test. These results indicate that WiiFit™ <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> may provide advantageous information supplementary to information obtained through standard functional mobility and balance tests; however, caution should be used when using the WiiFit™ <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> in isolation.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of {{physical}} movement to cause joint and bone loads that stimulate bone growth {{in order to reduce}} the adverse effects of osteoporosis. It has been established that stresses in bones in excess of the osteogenic threshold will stimulate bone growth; however, protocols for the generation of these stresses had not been established. Two trial movements were examined in the study: the plié and a movement requiring the subject to move a leg sequentially to 45 ° displaced positions - the star excursion <b>balance</b> <b>test.</b> Using inverse dynamics and an optimisation approach, the loads in the muscles crossing the hip and knee joints and the corresponding joint contact forces were calculated. It was found that the osteogenic threshold was exceeded in both these trials identifying them as suitable exercises in the maintenance of bone health. In the order of increasing bone load at the hip, and hence increasing bone growth stimulation, are the following demi plié, star excursion <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> with maximum reach criterion, grande plié and star excursion <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> with maximum speed criterion. In the order of increasing bone load at the knee are demi plié, grande plié, star excursion <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> with maximum reach criterion and star excursion <b>balance</b> <b>test</b> with maximum speed criterion. However, due to the high loads encountered, these exercises are not recommended for subjects with advanced osteoporosis although the boundary between therapeutic bone loading leading to increase in bone mineral density and loads capable of causing fracture is unclear...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{low-cost}} method for testing logic circuits, termed <b>balance</b> <b>testing,</b> which is particularly suited to built-in self testing.

A key advantage of <b>balance</b> <b>testing</b> is that the testability of various fault types can be easily analyzed. We present a novel analysis technique which leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for the balance testability of the standard single stuck-line (SSL) faults.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} normal {{values for}} four commonly used clinical functional <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> from community-dwelling women aged 20 to 80 {{and to identify}} any significant decline due to aging. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was undertaken to provide normative values for four clinical <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> across 6 decade cohorts. SETTING: The Betty Byrne-Henderson Center for Women and Aging, Royal Womens 2 ̆ 7 Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred fifty-six community-dwelling, independently ambulant women with no obvious neurological or musculoskeletal-related disability, aged 20 to 80, were randomly recruited from a large metropolitan region. MEASUREMENTS: The clinical balance measures/tests were the Timed Up and Go test, step test, Functional Reach test, and lateral reach test. Multivariate {{analysis was used to}} test the effect for age, height, and activity level. RESULTS: Normal data were produced for each test across each decade cohort. Gradual decline in balance performance was confirmed, with significant effect for age demonstrated. CONCLUSION: New normative data across the adult age decades are available for these clinical tests. Use of clinical <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> could complement other <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> and be used to screen women aged 40 to 60 whose performance is outside the normal values for age and to decrease later falls risk...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{evaluation}} of the lower extremity efficiency and balance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The authors’ own test (LLFT-lower extremities functional <b>test)</b> and <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> during normal standing and tandem positions with eyes opened or closed were used. Twelve patients with RA and fifteen controls for comparison were examined. Center feet of pressure dislocation on platform in normal standing with eyes open, normal standing with eyes closed, tandem left foot in front and tandem right foot in front positions and further dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> on three different boards were analyzed. Visual Analogue Scale monitored the level of pain after each LLFT task. There was found a relation between the intensity of pain and overloading of joints in particular tasks, resulting in lower extremities dysfunction. A significant disbalance in medio-lateral direction during normal standing with eyes closed and tandem right foot in front positions and also in anterior-posterior direction in tandem right foot in front position during static <b>balance</b> <b>tests</b> was found. Correlations showed that patient’s age, disease duration and Steinbrocker Functional Classes have an influence on parameters of <b>balance</b> <b>tests.</b> Results indicate that complex dysfunction of lower extremities causes disbalance of posture in static conditions.
