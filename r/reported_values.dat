5|$|Boletus edulis {{constitutes}} a food source which, although not rich in easily absorbed carbohydrates or fat, contains vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Fresh mushrooms consist of over 80% moisture, although <b>reported</b> <b>values</b> tend to differ somewhat as moisture content {{can be affected}} by environmental temperature and relative humidity during growth and storage, {{as well as the}} relative amount of water that may be produced as a result of normal metabolic processes during storage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reported</b> <b>values</b> of the {{composition}} and concentrations of trace metals and minerals in Boletus edulis tend to differ considerably, as the mushroom bioaccumulates different elements to varying degrees, and the element concentration in the fruit bodies is often {{a reflection of the}} element concentration of the soils from which they were picked. In general, B.edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium (1317 ppm), a trace mineral essential for good health, though the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low. Whole fruit bodies also contain 4.7μg of vitamin D2 per 100g dry weight. The relatively high ergosterol content (see next section) of the fruit bodies can make the mushroom nutritionally pragmatic for vegetarians and vegans, who would otherwise have a limited intake of vitamin D.|$|E

30|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses an {{algorithm}} called Empirical Bayes Gamma-Poisson Shrinker (EBGPS) {{to detect}} those ADRs {{that have the}} frequency of reporting higher than the expected value (Dumouchel 1999). This algorithm also uses a Bayesian statistical formula to calculate the observed <b>reporting</b> <b>value</b> and the expected <b>reporting</b> <b>value</b> for each drug-ADR pair. The observed ratio of <b>reporting</b> <b>value</b> to expected <b>reporting</b> <b>value</b> represents {{the strength of the}} signal of the drug-ADR pair. A drug-ADR pair with an observed ratio higher than the threshold is more significant and worthy of further investigation.|$|R

25|$|BPA affects growth, reproduction, and {{development}} in aquatic organisms. Among freshwater organisms, fish {{appear to be the}} most sensitive species. Evidence of endocrine-related effects in fish, aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, and reptiles has been reported at environmentally relevant exposure levels lower than those required for acute toxicity. There is a widespread variation in <b>reported</b> <b>values</b> for endocrine-related effects, but many fall in the range of 1μg/L to 1mg/L.|$|E
25|$|Experimental errors can be high in {{measuring}} equilibrium stability {{as well the}} folding/unfolding rates in water for the wild-type protein and mutants. The necessity of extrapolating phi values in pure water from measurements made in solutions containing denaturants adds uncertainty to the <b>reported</b> <b>values.</b> When the stability difference between the native and mutant protein are low (< 7 kJ/mol), experimental error can be very large; unusual phi-values outside the 0-1 range may arise from these errors rather than illustrating deviations from the conditions assumed by the method. In addition, calculated phi values {{have been shown to}} depend strongly on the number of data points collected and the laboratory in which the experiment was performed.|$|E
25|$|The gross {{capacity}} of older HDDs is calculated {{as the product}} of the number of cylinders per recording zone, the number of bytes per sector (most commonly 512), and the count of zones of the drive. Some modern SATA drives also report cylinder-head-sector (CHS) capacities, but these are not physical parameters because the <b>reported</b> <b>values</b> are constrained by historic operating system interfaces. The C/H/S scheme has been replaced by logical block addressing (LBA), a simple linear addressing scheme that locates blocks by an integer index, which starts at LBA 0 for the first block and increments thereafter. When using the C/H/S method to describe modern large drives, the number of heads is often set to 64, although a typical hard disk drive, , has between one and four platters.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a limited}} number of {{published}} studies to address the environmental impacts of perovskite solar cells. The major environmental concern is the lead used in the absorber layer. Due to the instability of perovskite cells lead may eventually be exposed to fresh water during the use phase. These LCA [...] studies looked at human and ecotoxicity of perovskite solar cells and found they were [...] surprisingly low and may not be an environmental issue. [...] Global warming potential of perovskite PVs were found to be in the range of 24–1500 grams CO2-eq/kWh electricity production. Similarly, reported EPBT of the published paper range from 0.2 to 15 years. The large range of <b>reported</b> <b>values</b> highlight the uncertainties associated with these studies. Celik et al.
