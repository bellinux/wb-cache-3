60|$|In {{the year}} 1722, a Sheriff-depute of Sutherland, Captain David Ross of Littledean, {{took it upon}} him, in {{flagrant}} violation of the then established <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> to pronounce the last sentence of death for witchcraft which was ever passed in Scotland. The victim was an insane old woman belonging to the parish of Loth, who had so little idea of her situation as to rejoice {{at the sight of}} the fire which was destined to consume her. She had a daughter lame both of hands and feet, a circumstance attributed to the witch's having been used to transform her into a pony, and get her shod by the devil. It does not appear that any punishment was inflicted for this cruel abuse of the law on the person of a creature so helpless; but the son of the lame daughter, he himself distinguished by the same misfortune, was living so lately as to receive the charity of the present Marchioness of Stafford, Countess of Sutherland in her own right, to whom the poor of her extensive country are as well known as those of the higher order.|$|E

50|$|Article 24 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 26(1)) defines another {{ground for}} a {{national}} court to stay or decline proceedings by setting forth that a court of a Member State before which a defendant enters an appearance shall have jurisdiction. This deals with the hypothesis of a plaintiff suing the defendant in a Member State that inititally does not have jurisdiction; if the defendant shows up and does not plead that the court has no jurisdiction, the court will have jurisdiction from then on. The main rationality behind this provision is legal certainty, for it acts as an implicit choice of forum clause: the plaintiff gives his consent to the choice of new forum by initiating the procedure, while the defendant consents by appearing and not pleading lack <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Apart from {{the situation in which}} the defendant explicitly contests jurisdiction, Article 24 furthermore states that the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> by appearance is not applicable whenever the exclusivity of the above-mentioned Article 22 comes into picture.|$|R
50|$|Finally, Article 31 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 35) {{states that}} courts of one Member State may give provisional, {{including}} protective, measures although courts in another Member State have jurisdiction {{as to the}} substance of the matter. This is an expression {{of the fact that the}} jurisdictional rules of the Brussels I Regulation do not regulate provisional measures; consequently, the competent court of any Member State may give such measures “without regard to the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> laid down in the Convention”. However, importantly, the measures given must be provisional only: they must be “intended to preserve a factual or legal situation so as to safeguard rights the recognition of which is sought elsewhere from the court having jurisdiction as to {{the substance of the}} matter”.|$|E
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of FNC gained little footing {{in the civil}} law world, which prefers the approach of lis alibi pendens (see Articles 21-23 Brussels Convention). The civil law jurisdictions generally base jurisdiction on the residence of the defendant and on choice of law rules favouring the habitual residence of the parties, the lex situs, and the lex loci solutionis (applying actor sequitur forum rei). This reflects an expectation that a defendant should be sued at his [...] "own" [...] courts, modified to reflect different priorities in certain types of case. As {{an example of this}} expectation, Article 2 Brussels I Regulation (as well as the corresponding Lugano conventions) provides: Subject to the provisions of this Convention, persons domiciled in a Contracting State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that State.Persons who are not nationals of the State in which they are domiciled shall be governed by the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> applicable to nationals of that State.|$|E
50|$|The {{answer is}} given in the {{customary}} <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> The right to absolve belongs to him who can excommunicate and who has imposed the law, moreover to any person delegated by him to this effect, since this power, being jurisdictional, can be delegated. First, we must distinguish between excommunication ab homine, which is judicial, and excommunication a jure, i.e. latae sententiae. For the former, absolution is given by the judge who inflicted the penalty (or by his successor), in other words by the pope, or the bishop (ordinary), also by the superior of said judge when acting as judge of appeal. As to excommunication latae sententiae, the power to absolve is either ordinary or delegated. Ordinary power {{is determined by the}} law itself, which indicates to what authority the censure is reserved in each case. Delegated power is of two kinds: that granted in permanency and set down in the law and that granted or communicated by personal act, e.g. by authority (faculties) of the Roman Penitentiaria, by episcopal delegation for special cases, or bestowed upon certain priests.|$|E

Thus far, the majority of legal cases involving bitcoin have been criminal prosecutions or disputes between bitcoin companies. If bitcoin or some iteration continues to grow, courts will need to craft <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>jurisdiction.</b> This paper is the first attempt to apply existing <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> civil procedure to bitcoin. Bitcoins ought be treated as tangible property for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Although they have an incorporeal form, as a practical matter, courts are able to site bitcoins to a single location and thus should do so. This allows courts to apply existing due process and comity jurisprudence...|$|R
5000|$|The general {{principle}} reflects the maxim Actor sequitur forum rei, or, he who acts (the plaintiff) must follow the forum (or jurisdiction) {{of the thing}} involved (the subject of the lawsuit, meaning the defendant). This rule is presented in Article 2(1) (2012 recast: Article 4(1)) of the Regulation that ‘persons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that Member State’. The law leans in favour of the defendant, since it is “more difficult, generally speaking, to defend oneself in the courts of a foreign country than in those of another town {{in the country where}} one is domiciled”. Furthermore, Article 2(2) of the Regulation embodies the [...] "principle of equality of treatment" [...] by stating that 'persons who are not nationals of the Member State in which they are domiciled shall be governed by the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> applicable to nationals of that State'. Although this is the 'general' jurisdictional rule of the Regulation, it only comes after the other articles in hierarchy and allows for many exceptions, making its general character rather relative; however, the latter is still reflected throughout the Regulation in the way how all exceptions to this rule must be interpreted strictly.|$|E
40|$|The 1968 Judgments Convention is a {{significant}} element in achieving an internal market within Europe, promoting as it does the ‘free movement of judgments’. By harmonizing the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> it has been possible for the Convention to minimize the grounds for refusal to recognize a judgment. However {{the process by which}} the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and recognition were formulated has certain weaknesses. In particular, the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> are derived from national rules with a long history, dating back to times when patterns of commerce were entirely different. These rules have either been little used in international disputes (because more exorbitant rules exist as an alternative) or have been interpreted {{in such a way as}} to permit a wide exercise of jurisdiction. It is not self-evident that they will achieve an appropriate allocation of jurisdiction between Contracting States. Moreover the use of legal concepts as jurisdictional connecting factors gives rise to a lack of transparency which may cloak a ‘homeward trend’ in interpretation by national courts...|$|E
40|$|The Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the Brussels Convention) {{is to be}} {{replaced}} in 2002 by a Community Instrument: The Council Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the Regulation). 1 The Regulation is an important measure approved by the European Union to simplify <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and recognition of judgments {{for the benefit of}} the Internal Market. Amongst other matters, the Regulation updates existing jurisdiction rules for a consumer contracts. The rules for consumer contracts apply where a consumer and a business are domiciled in a Member State or the business has a:“branch, agency or other establishment” in a Member State. Importantly, the Regulation clarifies jurisdiction rules for consumer contracts conducted over the World Wide Web (WWW). These rules are to be welcomed, as they provide guidance on what <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> apply to consumer contracts over the Web, albeit that they are limited to where the parties are domiciled in Europe. This article outlines the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> for consumer contracts provided by the Regulation, and where appropriate, highlights some aspects of the new rules that will possibly require further discussion and clarification by the European Court of Justice once the new rules are in force...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the application}} of rules of immunity and universal jurisdiction in respect of international crimes by adopting a constructivist approach {{to the interests of}} the international community and formation of customary international law. Accordingly, the study proposes an alternative understanding of customary international law in order to analyse the rules of immunity, universal jurisdiction and international crimes and their interrelated operations. The operation of the rules of immunity and universal jurisdiction regarding international crimes is conducted {{on the basis of a}} constructivist understanding of the interests of the international community to determine whether legitimate rules can be institutionalised in customary international law as well as rules based on the self-interests of States. This thesis also considers whether rules, based on their legitimacy, can comprise different legal implications in international law. In this context, the study considers how international crimes, which give rise to the dual responsibility for States and their nationals, are created by adopting a constructivist approach to customary law formation. This study further considers whether international crimes in international law are based on legitimacy rather than the self-interests of States, and whether they can give rise to different legal implications, specifically with regard to rules of universal jurisdiction and the immunity of officials. The development and application of the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and immunity are considered separately in international law on the basis of their development in customary international law. This study seeks to determine the appropriate general approach to the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> by analysing both the permissive and prohibitive approaches to the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction...</b>|$|E

40|$|Trading nations {{exchange}} {{tariff concessions}} {{in the context}} of trade liberalizing rounds. Tariffs, nonetheless, are not the only instrument affecting the value of a concession. Domestic instruments affect it as well, but public order is not negotiable, and, consequently, is not scheduled. Public order is unilaterally defined, but must respect the default <b>rules</b> concerning allocation <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> which are common to all WTO Members and bind them by virtue of their appurtenance to the international community. In this paper, we focus on the interaction between trade and environment. The {{purpose of this study is}} to highlight how these rules and the GATT/WTO jointly determine the scope for unilateral environmental policies for WTO Members. In the study we examine the relevant multilateral framework dealing with this issue, as well as the relevant GATT and WTO case-law. We also briefly present the jurisdictional default rules in Public International Law. As a means of focusing the discussion, we consider a series of scenarios, partly building on factual aspects of cases that have already been brought before the WTO. These scenarios are intended to isolate issues of specific interest from a policy point of view. For each scenario we then seek to determine what would the outcome be, in case WTO adjudicating bodies were to explicitly take account <b>of</b> the default <b>rules</b> concerning allocation <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> something which has not been done to date. Our main conclusions are two-fold: on occasion, the outcome would be different, had WTO panels observed the default <b>rules</b> concerning allocation <b>of</b> jurisdiction; more generally, the default rules can help us understand the limits of some key obligations assumed under the WTO. Crucially, absent recourse to the default <b>rules</b> concerning allocation <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> one risks understanding non-discrimination (the key GATT-obligation) as an instrument aimed to harmonize conditions of competition across markets, and not within markets, as the intent of negotiators has always been.
