The early ideas of Grid computing have foreseen a global and scalable network that would provide users with resources on demand. In spite of the extensive literature on resource allocation and scheduling across organisational boundaries, these <b>resource</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>networks</b> mostly work in isolation, thus contrasting with the original idea of Grid computing. Several efforts have been made towards providing architectures, mechanisms, policies and standards that may enable resource allocation across Grids. A survey and classification of these systems are relevant for the understanding of different approaches utilised for connecting resources across organisations and virtualisation techniques. In addition, a classification also sets the ground for future work on inter-operation of Grids...|$|R

To date, cash-based systems have seemed too complex, while lighter-weight credit mechanisms have not provided strong incentives.

We generalize this approach to-way exchanges among rings of peers and present a search algorithm for locating such rings. We have used simulation to analyze the effect of exchanges on performance.

The aim {{of this research is}} to examine the current situation of university libraries in the GCC countries identifying the problems and difficulties being faced by them and suggest means and ways by which an effective library cooperation may solve these problems. A general description of library cooperation is given, including that in developing countries and in the Arab world. Apart from literature sources the material for this research was obtained by questionnaire, personal visits to university libraries and some related research institutions in the countries concerned and by some personal observations and experience. The development of library and information services in general in the CCC countries is examined, but particularly various features of university libraries, from administration to user services. University library resources, technical services, and existing cooperative activities are also discussed in detail. There are some major issues which are related to library cooperation such as financial resources, adequacy of library collections, collection development practices, uniform standards of technical processing of library materials, availability of bibliographical apparatus and experienced professional manpower. The analysis of these issues brought out factors which should motivate individual libraries to engage in a library cooperation and <b>resource</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>network.</b> There is no practical or well organised resource sharing programme among university libraries in the GCC countries, even the existing marginal activities are not satisfactory to all university libraries concerned. This is mainly due to the absence of a well organised central agency which should take the lead to implement a well developed cooperative model for library cooperation in the region. The various professional meetings which have been organised at a regional level emphasised the importance of establishing effective cooperative links among university libraries in the Gulf region, but little implementation of these proposals have resulted so far. With the current political situation in the Gulf region and with the limitation on financial resources, the need for effective library cooperation is emphasised now more than ever before. Therefore, this research makes some practical recommendations emphasising the need for a central agency responsible for library cooperation programmes and proposing a model for an effective <b>resource</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>network</b> among university libraries in the GCC countries in the hope of improving the existing situation...|$|E

The cooperation {{was based on}} inter-library loan and preparation and publication of union catalogue. But the ways of cooperation in building resources and access to information resources was not easy and effective. Library cooperation for access to information resources {{was limited to the}} formation of networking among the libraries having homogeneous interest. Like many other countries, Bangladesh also formed networks of libraries of different disciplines of knowledge, which could not sustain due to lack of appropriate communication system. To ascertain the status of collection of information resources, networking, resource sharing and automation of libraries of Bangladesh, a questionnaire based survey has been conducted. The library surveyed fall into the following categories (a) academic libraries (b) research / special libraries. It is found that in terms of collection of information resources, the efforts of most of the libraries are confined to acquiring books only. Majority of libraries are not subscribing to current titles of journal. Many libraries have not taken part in <b>resource</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>network</b> and library cooperation programme. However a large number of libraries surveyed subscribe to on-line journals through a library consortium and they already initiated library automation programme. But a great chunk of the libraries developed library software to provide database service to its institution members only.

Surprisingly no empirical research has been given to this phenomenon from macro and comparative perspectives. First contribution of the study to is the conceptual and methodological model to link organization and strategic management theory with network theory. The study calls this new framework as collaboration network. Second, this survey of 33 nonprofit organizations in the Allegheny County, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania uncovers the hidden patterns of collaboration between the sectors including empirical evidence of blurring boundaries. In order to reveal the hidden patterns of collaboration, the study adopts blockmodel from network analysis that is useful to reduce complex networks into concise and easily understandable forms. Major findings uncovered by network analysis are; 1) Network structures are different according to specific types of collaboration relationships. Network structures become less dense as the collaborative relationships intensify. While nonprofits do not have to spend much of their valuable resources such as time and money on maintaining informal or infrequent information sharing or work referral relations, nonprofits should commit themselves to maintaining intensive relations such as formal contract or joint program. In addition, the types of six network structures are different from each other. For example, while formal contract network is shaped as a cohesive subgroup structure, <b>resource</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>network</b> shows a central-periphery system. 2) When three sector organizations are participated in the work referral network, the social service system emerges. Three sectors play a unique role respectively - a sender for public agencies, a service provider for businesses. As a major actor in the social service field, nonprofits not only play these two roles, but also play a coordinating or broker role between three sectors. 3) When either of the business or public sector is introduced in the collaboration network, new network structures replace the network structure which is composed exclusively of nonprofits. For example, when the public sector is involved in the formal contract network, the network structure changes from a cohesive subgroup system to a hierarchy system...|$|E

40|$|Universities {{in the new}} {{millennium}} find themselves in a knowledge-driven economy that is challenging them to produce a qualified and adaptable work force if they are to contribute to societal development. Owing to the structural change in the economy, entrepreneurs require high level scientists, professionals and technicians who not only have the capability to create and support innovations by adapting knowledge to local use but also people with managerial and lifelong learning skills. Such are they who can accelerate changes and make organizations more productive and efficient in the services they render. Consequently, universities in Sub-Saharan Africa are challenged to transform learning so as to produce graduates who have both knowledge and competencies. Such a system will create a balance between university education and the changing labour market. Satisfying these new educational demands are only possible through research and unhindered access to global information resources. Paradoxically, some private university libraries, because of limited funding, find themselves fiscally constrained in the provision of unhindered access to global stores of information particularly at a time of exponential growth both in number and cost of information resources. This had led libraries to re-examine resource sharing as a viable option to meeting the new demands placed on universities. It is for the reasons above that this study examines the practice, problems and prospects of resource-sharing in selected Seventh-day Adventist university libraries in Sub-Saharan Africa. It examines scientifically the causes of poor sharing practices that are unique to each library, the situational and environmental factors that can enhance resource sharing. It provides also research-based information that will help to determine the best ways by which each library can have greater access to information resources. There are proposals for resolving the problems, and there are recommendations for dealing with the matter on a more permanent basis.
