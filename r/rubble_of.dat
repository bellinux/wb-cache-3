5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} {{the collapse of a}} concrete block wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in the <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> the hallway known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} Europe {{the tree}} of heaven was not considered naturalised in cities until after the Second World War. This {{has been attributed to}} the tree's ability to colonise areas of <b>rubble</b> <b>of</b> destroyed buildings where most other plants would not grow. In addition, the warmer microclimate in cities offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas (it is thought that the tree requires a mean annual temperature of 8 degrees Celsius to grow well, which limits its spread to more northern and higher altitude areas). For example, one study in Germany found {{the tree of}} heaven growing in 92% of densely populated areas of Berlin, 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the city altogether. In other areas of Europe {{this is not the case}} as climates are mild enough for the tree to flourish. It has colonised natural areas in Hungary, for example, and is considered a threat to biodiversity at that country's Aggtelek National Park.|$|E
