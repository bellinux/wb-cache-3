50|$|Along {{with that}} of tapes, fringes, and other smallwares, the {{manufacture}} of cloth ribbons forms a special department of the textile industries. The essential feature of a <b>ribbon</b> <b>loom</b> is the simultaneous weaving in one loom frame {{of two or more}} webs, going up to as many as forty narrow fabrics in modern looms. To affect the conjoined throwing of all the shuttles and the various other movements of the loom, the automatic action of the power-loom is necessary, and it is a remarkable fact that the self-acting <b>ribbon</b> <b>loom</b> was known and extensively used more than a century before the famous invention of Cartwright. A loom in which several narrow webs could be woven at one time is mentioned as having been working in Dantzig {{towards the end of the}} 16th century. Similar looms were at work in Leiden in 1620, where their use gave rise to so much discontent and rioting on the part of the weavers that the states-general had to prohibit their use. The prohibition was renewed at various intervals throughout the century, and in the same interval the use of the <b>ribbon</b> <b>loom</b> was interdicted in most of the principal industrial centres of Europe. In 1676, under the name of the Dutch loom or engine loom, it was brought to London, and although its introduction there caused some disturbance, it does not appear to have been prohibited. In 1745, John Kay, the inventor of the fly-shuttle, obtained, conjointly with Joseph Stell, a patent for improvements in the <b>ribbon</b> <b>loom.</b> Since that period, it has benefited by the inventions applied to weaving machinery generally.|$|E
