50|$|A study {{investigated}} the effects on self-concept of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy and auditory subliminal stimulation (separately and in combination) on 141 undergraduate students with self-concept problems.

Rational-Emotive Therapy significantly improved scores on all the dependent measures (cognition, self-concept, self-esteem, anxiety), except for behavior. Results for the subliminal stimulation group {{were similar to those}} of the placebo treatment except for a significant self-concept improvement and a decline in self-concept related irrational cognitions.

Population baselines were established {{the year before}} timbering began, by conducting night mark/recapture surveys of surface-active animals. Establishing a baseline is a vital step in studying timbering effects, as salamander distribution and dispersal patterns may be clumped, and without a preliminary reference point, {{it may not be}} possible to separate dispersal effects and individual site differences from timbering effects. Subsequent surveys were conducted in the next year, after timbering was complete and the year following.|$|E

40|$|We analyze a {{model of}} market {{competition}} in which two identical firms choose prices {{as well as how}} to present, or “frame”, their products. A consumer is <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> firm, and whether he makes a price comparison with the other firm is a probabilistic function of the firms’ framing strategies. We analyze Nash equilibria in this model. In particular, we show how the answers to the following questions are linked: (1) Are firms’ choices of prices and frames correlated? (2) Can firms earn payoffs in excess of the max-min level? (3) Does greater consumer rationality (in the sense of better ability to make price comparisons) imply lower equilibrium prices? We also argue that our model provides a novel account of the phenomenon of product differentiation...|$|R

50|$|A large map of {{the world}} is laid out. The game {{involves}} up to 70 participants or more (depending {{on the size of the}} venue).

North America, Europe and the Pacific Rim are well off, but India and Africa are in extreme poverty.

Methods This was a randomised, assessor-blinded, split-mouth trial, performed at a single critical care unit. Adult, orally intubated patients with > 20 teeth, where > 24  hours of mechanical ventilation was expected were included. Teeth were cleaned 12 -hourly using a foam swab or toothbrush (each <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side of the mouth).

The results showed an overall {{significant difference between the}} control and treatment groups. While the univariate analyses showed that there were significant group differences in 3/5 of the dependent measures.

50|$|The {{effects of}} dance {{intervention}} {{were also found}} to be therapeutic to psychiatric participants {{and those who are}} emotional disturbed. In one research study, psychiatric patients were <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> three conditions: a dance group in a traditional dance circle, a group that just listened to the music, and another group that rode stationary bikes without music but same time duration as the dance circle. While all three conditions lessened or stabilized the condition of the patients, the results found that the dance group benefitted the most from the dance intervention. The dance circle group reported less depression and more vitality than the other groups. This study shows that not just physical activity or listening to music is enough; the combining of the two into dance is the most beneficial for achieving a positive impact.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deficits of {{self-awareness}} (SA) {{are very}} common after severe acquired brain injury (sABI), especially in {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI), playing {{an important role in}} the efficacy of the rehabilitation process. This pilot study provides information regarding two structured group therapies for disorders of SA. METHODS: Nine patients with severe TBI were consecutively recruited and <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> SA group therapy programme, according either to the model proposed by Ben-Yishay & Lakin (1989) (B&L Group), or by Sohlberg & Mateer (1989) (S&M Group). Neuropsychological tests and self-awareness questionnaires were administered before and after a 10 weeks group therapy. RESULTS: Results showed that both SA and neuropsychological functioning significantly improved in both groups. CONCLUSION: It is important to investigate and treat self-awareness, also to improve the outcome of neuropsychological disorders. The two group therapies proposed seem to be specific for impulsivity and emotional dyscontrol and for cognitive disorders...|$|R
