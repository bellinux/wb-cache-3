50|$|Overhead Doors and Metal Buildings: MBMA {{has been}} working with the Door and Access System Manufacturers Association (DASMA) {{for the past several years}} to create better doors and {{openings}} for metal buildings. Five years of collaboration and research has focused on rolling steel overhead doors and the effects of wind on the doors and the building. As a result of this collective effort in the summer of 2010, DASMA released a technical guide to ensure that metal building framing can adequately support a <b>rolling</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Paul Reilly Jr. founded Rytec Corporation in Addison, Illinois. Under {{a license}} {{agreement}} with Labex GmbH (which {{later became a}} division of the Hörmann Group), Rytec manufactured and sold high-speed folding doors in the United States. Widespread adoption of this product in cold storage environments helped establish the viability of the high-speed door concept in North America. In 1987, Rytec moved to a larger facility on Eagle Drive in Jackson, Wisconsin. Several years later, in 1990, Rytec developed the first high-speed <b>rolling</b> <b>door</b> that could withstand accidental impacts and reset without tools.|$|E
50|$|Some of RFK's quirks endear {{the venue}} to fans and players. The large rolling {{bleacher}} section is less stable than other seating, allowing fans {{to jump in}} rhythm to cause the whole area to bounce. Also, despite its small size (it never seated more than 56,000 people), because of the stadium's design and {{the proximity of the}} fans to the field when configured for football, the stadium was extremely loud when the usual sell-out Redskins crowds became vocal. Legend has it that Redskins head coach George Allen would order a large <b>rolling</b> <b>door</b> opened {{in the side of the}} stadium when visiting teams were attempting field goals at critical moments in games so that a swirling wind from off the Potomac and Anacostia rivers might interfere with the flight of the kicked ball.|$|E

50|$|The first {{building}} on Culver-Stockton Campus was Old Main, {{known today as}} Henderson Hall. Construction began in 1853 and was completed in 1855. The building was destroyed by fire on March 23, 1903. In keeping with a tradition that carries on today, students didn’t miss one day of school. Officials organized classes in local churches. College President Carl Johann resolved to rebuild; and within 10 days of the fire, the citizens of Canton raised $15,000 for a new building. The college collected $8,000 from insurance and salvaged $4,000 worth of stone and brick from the old building. The new building was completed and occupied by May 15, 1904. Since funds were still short to complete payment, orator and three-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan spoke on campus on August 24, 1904, to help raise funds. Since the original building had a dome, a dome also {{was part of the}} new construction. The dome on Henderson Hall continues to be an important symbol of the College to this day. Henderson Hall originally housed science laboratories, men’s and women’s gymnasiums, a museum, a dining room, a “commercial” department, library, administrative offices, classrooms, an assembly hall that seated about 600 with a <b>rolling</b> <b>door</b> at the rear that could be opened to add 400 more spectators, and three meeting rooms for student groups. As educational activities were dispersed to other buildings, Henderson Hall continued to serve, as it does today, as a primarily administrative and classroom building. The new building was named for Dr. Pat Henderson, one of the founders and first president of the board of trustees. Henderson was a church leader, an editor and publisher of religious publications, and a tireless public servant. He was instrumental in the founding of Eureka College and Columbia College in addition to Culver-Stockton. He served in several governmental social service capacities during and after the Civil War. He was an outspoken advocate of education for women. Henderson Hall was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.|$|E

40|$|Great Emergencies {{was a new}} script {{written by}} Sean DeMers {{that focuses on the}} life and accomplishments of Julia Sand. During Julia’s life, she wrote many letters to then {{president}} Chester Arthur regarding her thoughts on the presidency and his decisions in running the country. The play largely focuses on the interaction between these two characters during which, Julia deals with family issues and Chester wrestles with the problems of the nation following Garfield’s assassination. While the play is based around real actions and real people in history, Great Emergencies examines the theoretical impact that Julia may have had not only on Chester but possibly {{the nation as a whole}} through her letter writing. The design behind Great Emergencies was largely born out of the need to show a variety of locations over the course of time as well as accommodate moments of the play where there were as many as 18 actors on stage at the same time. These necessities from the script coupled with the budget of a new play festival show focused the design in a large gestural manner while utilizing actors, smaller prop furniture and two <b>rolling</b> <b>door</b> units to establish the number of looks that were needed. The floor treatment was lifted directly off one of the letters that Julia Sand wrote, a large painted chandelier drop helped to cap the space as well as give a sense of time period in history and three steel columns created a frame that also had nods toward the industrial advances the country was undergoing at the time of this script.

40|$|The {{optimization}} {{of maintenance}} strategies {{has become a}} key issue in the railway industry but also in most industrial fields. To address this challenge, many studies dealt with the estimation of optimal maintenance parameters. But what commonly happens when the degradation process suddenly changes? The operator has to face an unexpected, increasing number of severe defects (and then a strong drop of its availability). These changes are generally due to either: a new component, introduced in the system for obsolescence reasons; or changing operating conditions. Based on the dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN), formalism that has been proved relevant to perform reliability analysis can easily represent complex system behaviors. This paper introduces a dynamic maintenance strategy, able to detect these drifts and to evaluate their impacts on the <b>rolling</b> stock <b>doors</b> system’s behavior...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, the {{potential}} risks of unexpected failures occurring in rolling stock are identified, analysed and evaluated using a FMECA-based approach. The criticality of a failure is measured {{as the product}} of the likelihood of occurrence of the failure mode (O) and the severity of damage caused by the failure (S), where O and S are allocated numbers from 1 to 10. According to criticality levels ranging from 1 (lowest) to 100 (highest), the most critical failure modes in the rolling stock with respect to both reliability and economic criteria are identified. Finally, several potential protective measures to eliminate the root causes of rolling stock failures are provided. The presented model is applied to a <b>rolling</b> stock passenger <b>door</b> system in a Scottish train operating company and the results are discussed.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn recent years, a {{great deal}} of {{attention}} has been paid to the analysis of failure modes occurring in railway infrastructure assets, e. g. bridges, rail tracks, sleepers, etc. However, there have been few attempts by researchers to develop failure criticality assessment models for railway rolling stock. A rolling stock failure may be very costly in terms of monetary loss and/or passenger inconvenience. It may also cause delays to train services or even result in catastrophic derailment accidents. In this paper, a failure mode, effects and criticality analysis approach is presented to identify, analyse and evaluate the causes and consequences of rolling stock failures. The most critical failure modes with respect to both reliability and economics are identified and potential protective measures are then proposed to prevent their recurrence. For the purpose of illustrating the proposed approach, the model is applied to a <b>rolling</b> stock passenger <b>door</b> system. The data required for the study are collected from both the literature and the maintenance information system available in a Scottish train operating company. The results of this study can be used to plan a cost-effective preventive maintenance programme for different components of rolling stock...|$|R
