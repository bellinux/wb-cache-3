Instead of using steel strip as a reinforcement, Anchored Earth System consist of <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> (tendon) with precast concrete block attached at the free end {{of each of the}} reinforcing steel bars, and it is backfilled with granular material or suitable earth fill. This research project can be considered a case study of anchored reinforced soil wall which investigates the performance of Anchored Earth System due to its pullout capacity. In this study, pullout resistance which contributed by friction between the backfill material and the shaft surface of reinforcing tendon, and the passive earth pressure against the concrete anchor block, can be evaluated through pullout tests. The main problems to be studied in this project are the results obtained from field pullout test are different from the calculated theoretical values and there is a non-zero intercept at relationship of pullout force against overburden pressure. The field pullout tests were carried out in three conditions: i) with reinforcing tendon only; ii) with anchor block only; and iii) with both reinforcing tendon and anchor block together {{in order to determine the}} sharing of resistance in the system. The pullout test was also done under soaked condition. The average interaction coefficient a’ = 1. 99 and bearing factor ß = 6. 32 were determined by back analysis. It was found that the sharing of load between the tendon and the anchor block in anchored earth system is not equal, but most of the resistance is contributed by the bearing passive of anchor block where approximately 30 % of resistance contributed by residual frictional resistance and 70 % contributed by peak bearing passive resistance. The pullout resistance in soaked condition observed to be lower than in unsoaked condition due to the increase in pore water pressure that reduced the shear resistance...|$|E

Six reinforced concrete beams with typical dimension of 120 mm x 240 mm x 1600 mm were made and divided into: (a) three beams were made of non fibrous concrete with vertical stirrups (code D 1, D 2, and D 3), (b) three beams were made of fibrous concrete with vertical stirrups (code D 1 F, D 2 F, and D 3 F). The local fiber weight added into the mixture were 46. 76 kg per cubic meter of concrete, Vf = 0. 7 %. Plain <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> with 16 mm diameters were used to provide the main tensile reinforcement. The yield stress of the steel was 446 MPa.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the effects of residual stresses on the ultimate strength of columns made from hot-rolled solid <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> The residual stresses were determined from both experimental study and finite element analysis. In the experimental investigation, classical boring-out method was applied on fourteen samples with different diameters. For three different diameters, finite element models were constructed for the determination of residual stresses. Based on the comparison between the results, the reliability of both experimental and numerical results was analyzed. The effect of residual stresses on the compressive resistance of solid <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> columns was also studied. From the work done, it was found that, (1) Based on the experimental results, the residual stresses appeared to be very small when the diameter of the specimens is larger than 100 mm. FEA simulation results also corroborated this experimental observation. (2) For solid round columns with diameters up to 25 mm, both residual stresses and initial out-of-straightness have remarkable influence on the ultimate strength, especially when the slenderness parameter of the column is larger than 0. 88.

This series of experiments, named Experiments 6, aimed to determine the threshold values of NaCl concentrations in concrete for <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> rusting. A method of electrical potential difference measurements of spots of concrete specimen surfaces over Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell, having been developed by California Division of Highways and having been widely used to detect the rusting spots of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete, are also performed in this series of experiments. We planned to examine the method, if it can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture to detect rusting spots. The following results about <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion are obtained by and at six months after embedding <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete. 1. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 033 % of NaCl have not corroded yet without adding any amount of corrosion inhibitors. 2. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 067 % of NaCl do not also corrode yet, if adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors are added to the concrete. 3. In case of the concrete contained 0. 100 % of NaCl by weight, there have been <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> corroded some, but their areas of corrosion were small. Some of the <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> have no corrosion spots where adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors had added to the concrete. 4. All <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 133 % of NaCl by weight except A_ 4 D_ 2 C_ 2 O_ 1 specimens have been observed some corrosion. And as the time has passed, the areas of corrosion on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> surfaces are becoming larger. 5. There have not been any significant differences in the effects of types of corrosion inhibitors on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion. 6. The effects of water-cement ratio on corrosion of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> are not obvious. 7. The beneficial effects of doubled dosage of corrosion inhibitors into concrete are observed on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion. The results of electrical potential measurments on the basis of Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell are as follows. 1. It has not been decided yet that the standards of California Division of Highways on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion in concrete can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture. 2. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete need not be connected by metalic means each other when half cell potential measurment method is applied. 3.

40|$|Due {{to violent}} {{fluctuation}} of raw material {{prices in the}} international market, the domestic <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> index reached its peak in June 2008. As <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> are massive materials required for constructional engineering, {{it has become an}} urgent potential issue in the research of construction management by considering how to minimize their consumption and waste. In engineering practice, the experienced <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> engineer of the subcontractor is usually assigned to prepare the construction drawing and the material selection list. Taking account of the easier cutting of <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> convenient workability and material management, it is frequently required that the length of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> should be processed into a number that is a multiple of 5 cm or 10 cm so as to minimize the diversity of sizes; sometimes, the required length of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> is also lengthened to match the size of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> with a larger quantity in the Material Selection List. Along with the expansion of construction scale, the type of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> size is also becoming more complicated. It is frequently seen that shorter bars are wrongly replaced by longer ones due to the confusion of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> sizes during <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> erection, overlapping and binding, this has lead to waste of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> material. Since relevant literature relating to <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> material expenditure and control only deal with the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> cutting issues at the initial construction stage, but lacks the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> arrangement required by practical construction, the aforesaid waste during field construction has not been effectively improved until now. For this reason, the floor deck <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> arrangement of the building construction will be selected as the example for this Research. By adjusting the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> splicing position, the size of originally required <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> will be changed. Further, the “K-means Clustering Algorithm” is also used to configure the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> clustering mode so as to reduce the diversified sizes of <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> As a further step, the Linear Programming Method will be employed to acquire the optimal clustering result without increasing the original cost. In this Research, a physical building case will be selected as the example. The said case belongs to an RC structure in which the foundation area size is 65. 4 m (L) x 59. 7 m (W) and is constructed into 4 underground levels and 7 above-ground floors, and each floor is provided with a maximum of 14 horizontal or longitudinal spans. The material selection result indicates that the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> samples having the same number and shape is 694 pieces and this has been divided into 41 groups by length. According to the program-based clustering computation written for this Research, the result indicates that the steel group count will be reduced to 16 groups and the workability will be significantly enhanced accordingly. With the above information, {{it can be seen that}} the statement of this Research is justified and can really be implemented in the practical construction field to achieve the purpose of reducing the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> length types,minimizing construction error and alleviating the work accessibility. 近年來由於國際間原物料價格波動劇烈，至 97 年 6 月份時，國內鋼筋指數達到高峰，而鋼筋對於營建工程來說屬於大宗材料，因此思考如何減低其耗損與浪費，已變成是營建管理研究上極具潛力的一個課題。 一般在工程實務上，鋼筋工程於發包後，有關繪製鋼筋施工圖以及揀料單之工作，多半交由鋼筋分包廠商中工程經驗較為豐富之鋼筋師傅處理，其往往為了鋼筋便於裁切、考慮施工性及材料管理方便，常強制需求鋼筋長度成為尾數為 5 或 10 cm的倍數，藉以降低尺寸之多樣性，甚至是為了配合揀料單中需求數量較多之鋼筋尺寸，將需求鋼筋長度加大。另外隨著工程規模增加，需求鋼筋尺寸種類也越加繁複，所以在鋼筋施工及搭接綁紮時，因鋼筋尺寸混淆，錯以長度較長之鋼筋，取代原有長度較短鋼筋之情形，屢見不鮮，也因此造成鋼筋材料無謂之浪費。然而回顧以往對於鋼筋材料支出控制的相關文獻，僅以工程初期的鋼筋裁切問題作為研究範疇，缺乏針對工程實際鋼筋配筋的需求問題作探討，故上述於實作時所產生材料浪費之情形，迄今仍未獲得有效之改善。 因此，本研究以建築工程樓版配筋為例，利用鋼筋搭接位置的調整，改變原有需求鋼筋尺寸，並採用k-means分群演算法，建構鋼筋分群模式，減少鋼筋繁雜眾多的尺寸，再運用線性規劃方式，求解在不增加原有成本目標下之最佳分群結果。 在本研究中，以一真實建築個案作為範例，該案例為一RC構造建築物，基地面積長約 65. 4 公尺，寬約 59. 7 公尺，建築規模為地下 4 層、地上 7 層，而每層樓版之橫向或縱向跨度最多均為 14 個，經揀料結果，原有相同號數、形狀之需求鋼筋樣本數為 694 個，以長度分類，可分為 41 個群組；經本研究所撰寫程式分群演算結果，鋼筋群組數降低為 16 組，大大增進其工作性，證明本研究之論述，確實可以運用於工程實務上，達到降低鋼筋長度樣態、減少施工錯誤、提昇施工便利性之目的。摘要	 i Abstract	 ii 目錄	 iv 表目錄	 v 圖目錄	 vi 第一章	緒論	 1 1. 1 研究動機及目的	 1 1. 2 研究方法	 4 第二章	問題描述與定義	 6 2. 1 鋼筋工程施工流程	 6 2. 2 營建工程費用結構	 9 2. 3 影響鋼筋工程成本因素	 10 2. 4 鋼筋配筋分群問題	 11 2. 4. 1 背景描述	 11 2. 4. 2 問題定義	 12 第三章	文獻回顧	 13 3. 1 鋼筋配筋問題	 13 3. 2 K-means分群演算法	 28 3. 3 線性規劃	 34 第四章	數學建模	 35 4. 1 符號定義	 35 4. 1. 1 決策變數	 35 4. 1. 2 邊界條件	 36 4. 2 模式建構與求解步驟	 36 第五章	範例實證	 40 5. 1 案例說明	 40 5. 2 求解分析	 47 第六章	結論與後續研究	 52 6. 1 結論	 52 6. 2 後續研究	 53 參考文獻	 54 附錄A 版配筋揀料明細	 A- 1 附錄B 程式資料編碼	 B- 1 附錄C 鋼筋分群求解輸出	 C-...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSteel {{has been}} used for many decades in {{structural}} applications because of its good combination of mechanical properties. As per recent concept to reduce steel consumption in reinforced cement concrete (RCC) structures, designers recommend high strength <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> There are various routes for their production such as microalloying, thermomechanical treatment, cold working, etc. For <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> of thermomechanical treatment (TMT) route, some designers believe these <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> to be more sensitive to corrosive environment. To verify this, corrosion behaviours of high strength <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> of 500 W (weldable <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> of yield strength 500 MPa) grade of two different local industries have been studied in fresh water and sea water, which were compared with weldable low strength (yield strength 300 MPa) bars of the same companies. Experimental results revealed that addition of small amount of alloying elements such as Cr, Ni and Cu improves the corrosion resistance of the <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in all test mediums; however, strength levels have no influence the corrosion rate. A relation has also been found between the severity of corrosion damage and the degree of tensile property degradation...|$|R

In this paper, dispersion equations of longitudinal wave propagation in reinforced concrete member are investigated {{for the purpose of}} monitoring steels embedded in concrete. For a <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> embedded in concrete, not the velocity but the attenuation dispersion curves will be affected by the concrete. The effects of steel-to-concrete shear modulus ratio, density ratio, and Poisson’s ratio on propagation characteristics of guided wave in <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> embedded in concrete were studied by the analysis of the real and imaginary parts of the wave number. The attenuation characteristics of guided waves of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> in different conditions including different bar concrete constraint and different diameter of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> are also analyzed. Studies of the influence of concrete on propagation characteristics of guided wave in <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> embedded in concrete will increase the accuracy in judging the structure integrity and promote the level of defect detection for the <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> embedded in concrete...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Full-recycled-aggregate {{concrete}} (aRAC) {{is a new}} concrete reusing 100 % {{fine and}} coarse recycled aggregates produced from waste concrete of demolished concrete structures. As {{there is a lack}} of studies on the bond behavior between <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> and aRAC, findings of this study are of significance for the structural application of aRAC. Method: This paper presents the pull-out test results of 24 groups aRAC specimens with deformed <b>steel</b> <b>bar,</b> and discusses the effects of aRAC strength, bond length and lateral constructional stirrups on the bond behavior between deformed <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> and aRAC. Results and Conclusion: The bond stress and slip at key points of bond-slip curve are analyzed in relation to the tensile strength of aRAC and the bond length of <b>steel</b> <b>bar.</b> The bond-slip relationship between deformed <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> and aRAC is proposed based on the test and analysis of this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of steel-reinforced concrete greatly {{depends on the}} adequacy of the bond between the concrete and the steel reinforcement. Bonding is enhanced by adhesion and frictional resistance between the steel/concrete interface and can adversely be affected by corrosion of the reinforcing steel. In Ghana, steel is the conventional material for the reinforcement of concrete, but there are instances where the <b>steel</b> reinforcement <b>bars</b> used on site have corroded to some extent. This study considers the effect of corrosion of mild <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> on the tensile strength, bond strength and bending {{strength of}} steel-reinforced concrete beam. Tests were conducted to determine the tensile and bonding strength of non-corroded and corroded mild <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> and the flexural strength of concrete beams reinforced with non-corroded and corroded mild <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> {{on the assumption that the}} flexural strength of the beam is derived primarily from the concrete/steel bonding action. The research revealed that the tensile and bond strengths of non-corroded <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> and the flexural strength of non-corroded steel-reinforced concrete beam are greater than that of corroded <b>steel</b> <b>bar.</b> The findings of the research demonstrates that corrosion of steel reinforcement adversely affects the strength of steel reinforcement and steel-reinforced concrete and it is thus recommended that non-corroded <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> should be used for reinforcement in reinforced concrete construction...|$|R

The analysis results are in good agreement with the experiment results. When the reinforcement ratio is low, the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> exerts less influence on creep and shrinkage, {{and the influence of}} <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> can be neglected in engineering application. However, the reinforcement can effectively reduce creep and shrinkage development when the reinforcement ratio is high...|$|R
