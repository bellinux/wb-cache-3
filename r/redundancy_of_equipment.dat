40|$|To {{assure the}} quality of potable water (PW) on the Space Station (SS) a number of {{chemical}} and physical tests must be conducted routinely. After reviewing the requirements for potable water, both direct and indirect analytical methods are evaluated that could make the required tests and improvements compatible with the Space Station operation. A variety of suggestions are made to improve the analytical techniques for SS operation. The most important recommendations are: (1) the silver/silver chloride electrode (SB) method of removing I sub 2 /I (-) biocide from the water, since it may interfere with analytical procedures for PW and also its end uses; (2) the orbital reactor (OR) method of carrying out chemistry and electrochemistry in microgravity by using a disk shaped reactor on an orbital table to impart artificial G force to the contents, allowing solution mixing and separation of gases and liquids; and (3) a simple ultra low volume highly sensitive electrochemical/conductivity detector for use with a capillary zone electrophoresis apparatus.

40|$|The {{wind energy}} sector uses a mature yet {{continuously}} improving technology. The reliability of wind turbines and {{the efficiency of}} energy capture are both high, yet continue to improve with new designs, new components and new materials. Even non-technological aspects such as project management, better forecasts of wind energy production and better risks assessment are contributing to increasing the competitiveness of wind power and reducing its overall cost. This is sometimes achieved even if some cost areas can occasionally increase, e. g. capital costs due to the better quality of components. To further increase reliability, scientists and designers require better knowledge of loads, load effects and electrical effects in the mechanical and electrical parts of the turbine. They also require materials and basic components (e. g. electronic components of the electricity subsystems) that can stand higher temperatures and perform better at normal operating temperatures. In some areas reliability is improved through more <b>redundancy</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> in particular in control and power electronics. The technological aspects of wind energy include: • Wind turbine components: blades, forgings (e. g. main shafts), castings (e. g. hubs, bearing housings and bed plates), pitch, control and yaw systems, generator, gearbox, bearings and shafts, and power electronics. • Design for manufacture, transport and installation; turbine assembly. • Offshore foundations design and manufacture; and foundations, cable and turbine installation. • Substations: switchgear, transformers, cables, circuit breakers, etc. The world wind market and the European offshore sectors are continuously growing although European onshore wind growth is less significant. Overall, the global annual market remains stable at around 40 GW of installed capacity, but this figure hides huge variations between individual markets. Cumulative installed capacity reached 240 GW {{at the end of}} 2011 and is expected to reach 285 GW {{at the end of the}} current year (2012). The 2011 manufacturers market continued to be dominated by Vestas and, as in 2010, it included four Chinese firms among the top-ten. However, the changes in the Chinese market are very significant as the 2010 market leader Sinovel (and 2 nd worldwide) is now 7 th worldwide. European firms, General Electric (US) and Suzlon (India) have a truly international reach whereas Chinese firms are still confined to the Chinese market. Capital expenditure (CapEx) or cost for wind installations vary greatly worldwide: unit costs in some countries can be triple those in other countries. Overall, 2011 CapEx for onshore wind averaged 1 580 €/kW, if Chinese and Indian installations are excluded (due to different cost methodologies), and the offshore figure reached 3 500 €/kW although from a low installed capacity basis. Operational costs (OpEx) are also very different onshore (21 €/MWh) and offshore (32 €/MWh, figures depend on assumptions such as capacity factors). There is a clear trend to lower prices in both CapEx and OpEx, possibly steeper in onshore than offshore OpEx and with very significant potential in offshore CapEx. This report presents a snapshot of the current situation of the wind sector from a technology and market perspective, and a detailed analysis of the economics of wind. It is the first of a series of annual reports which will not only include annual developments but also specific, one-off research into technology aspects of the wind sector. JRC.

This philosophy should also be followed by solo divers. A solo diver operating beyond the range for acceptable risk for a controlled emergency swimming ascent needs to carry a second, independent source of suitable breathing gas, which includes a regulator and preferably a submersible pressure gauge. This emergency gas supply typically {{takes the form of}} a pony bottle, or for more demanding diving, a twin tank set with the capability of independent operation of each tank. Additional equipment carried may include a backup dive computer, a backup dive light and a backup dive mask.

A solo diver needs to be particularly aware of overall personal fitness and health and the limitations it may impose on their ability to manage an emergency.

40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) Abstract: In industries, {{engineers}} and managers {{are faced with}} the conundrum of which method to use to improve the reliability and subsequent availability of their manufacturing processes. This research aimed to develop a tool to assist process plants with deciding on the best approach to use between increasing the <b>redundancy</b> <b>of</b> bottleneck <b>equipment</b> or to improve on the management of integrated logistic support principles like supply support, maintenance strategy and inventory management. It also made use of a case study process plant to analyse and improve the maintenance system around bottleneck centrifugal pumps. A decision making tool (framework) was developed and presented to assist with decision making around the stated problem. A survey conducted also affirmed the need for such a tool in industry. The decision of installing an extra pump per set to increase redundancy or to improve on the ILS of maintenance is split between 48 % against the installation and 43 % supporting the idea. This is an indication of how contentious this issue is without doing the proper analysis and using the right tools of decision making. Most decisions in industry are made on an emotional viewpoint based on the “head-aches” certain equipment gives. It was discovered that the case study plant utilises a run-to-failure philosophy on bottleneck pumps. This philosophy lead to production losses of 14 days over a 23 months span, equating to R 33, 2 million rand loss compared to R 2, 2 million sample period cycle cost <b>of</b> increasing <b>redundancy...</b>|$|R
40|$|Given the {{technological}} {{progress in the}} fields of digital components and Information Technology within substations, new generations of instrument transformers with digital output, known as Non Conventional Instrument Transformers (NCIT) and/or Electronic Instrument transformers (EIT) are now becoming attractive for large scale application. These devices (both primary sensors & digital interfaces), which are typically very compact, have already been analysed & described by a WG of SC A 3 (publication imminent). However, even though digital communication methods are being used more often for new substations and for the modernisation of existing installations, the interface between high voltage equipment and low voltage equipment (so called " 0 / 1 interface") remains predominantly classical (100 V/√ 3, 1 or 5 A). To promote digital communication for this " 0 / 1 interface " and to obtain all the advantages of Information Technology, the development of a "Stand Alone Merging Unit " (SAMU) is under widespread consideration. This new equipment is an essential tool to enable the use of classical magnetic ITs alongside NCITs in the same substation; an essential consideration for the refurbishment of existing substations. The ability to mix conventional & non-conventional devices will also tend to accelerate the development of EITs with digital interfaces.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the rationale and the fundamental elements and algorithms of a reliability engineering methodology, and discusses {{its application to}} the design of a large, multi-cell and heterogeneous production system with just-in-time (JIT) deliveries. The failure analysis and the non-reliability costs assessment of such systems is a complex task. In order to cope with such complexity, a two level hierarchical modelling and evaluation framework was developed. According to this framework, the internal behaviour of each manufacturing cell and the overall flow of materials are described, respectively, by local and global models. Local models are firstly obtained from the failure and repair processes <b>of</b> the manufacturing <b>equipment.</b> Then, these models are combined with the failure propagation delays introduced by the work-in-process buffers in order to obtain the system level model. The second part of the paper addresses several design issues of the production system that directly impact the reliability of the deliveries, such as the layout of the plant, the <b>redundancy</b> <b>of</b> the manufacturing <b>equipment</b> and the capacity of the work-in-process buffers. A distinctive feature of the reliability evaluation algorithm resides on the ability to deal with reliability models containing stochastic processes with generalized distributions. This fundamental requirement {{comes from the fact that}} repair and failure propagation processes typically present hyper-exponential distributions, e. g., lognormal distributions, that can’t be assessed using the conventional reliability techniques.

40|$|Typical {{engineering}} {{systems in}} applications with high failure consequences such as nuclear reactor plants often employ <b>redundancy</b> and diversity <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> {{in an effort}} to lower the probability of failure and therefore risk. However, it has long been recognized that dependencies exist in these redundant and diverse systems. Some dependencies, such as common sources of electrical power, are typically captured in the logic structure of the risk model. Others, usually referred to as intercomponent dependencies, are treated implicitly by introducing one or more statistical parameters into the model. Such common-cause failure models have limitations in a simulation environment. In addition, substantial subjectivity is associated with parameter estimation for these models. This paper describes an approach in which system performance is simulated by drawing samples from the joint distributions of dependent variables. The approach relies on the notion of a copula distribution, a notion which has been employed by the actuarial community for ten years or more, but which has seen only limited application in technological risk assessment. The paper also illustrates how equipment failure data {{can be used in a}} Bayesian framework to estimate the parameter values in the copula model. This approach avoids much of the subjectivity required to estimate parameters in traditional common-cause failure models. Simulation examples are presented for failures in time.
