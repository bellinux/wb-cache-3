25|$|Corydon {{says that}} a woman called Leuce has {{recently}} been rejecting his sexual advances, {{and that he is}} therefore permitted to enter the holy place. Corydon suggests that Oryntus should sing a song and play the pipes, and Corydon explains that has recently been given a <b>reed</b> <b>pipe</b> made by someone called Ladon.|$|E
25|$|Corydon {{also says}} that it is because of Meliboeus himself that Corydon is able to enjoy a life in the woods, carefree, {{composing}} poetry/music rather than being exiled far away into obscurity. Corydon requests Meliboeus to favour, and perhaps edit, his work. Corydon also explains that a certain Iollas recently gave him a <b>reed</b> <b>pipe,</b> which was once owned by Tityrus. Meliboeus and Corydon agree that Tityrus was a very talented singer.|$|E
25|$|Many {{instruments}} originated {{during the}} Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived {{to the present}} day; others have disappeared, only to be recreated in order to perform music of the period on authentic instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals {{who were members of}} Guilds and they included the slide trumpet, the wooden cornet, the valveless trumpet and the sackbut. Stringed instruments included the viol, the harp-like lyre, the hurdy-gurdy, the cittern and the lute. Keyboard instruments with strings included the harpsichord and the virginals. Percussion instruments include the triangle, the Jew's harp, the tambourine, the bells, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums. Woodwind instruments included the double reed shawm, the <b>reed</b> <b>pipe,</b> the bagpipe, the transverse flute and the recorder. Vocal music in the Renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate polyphonic style. The principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire Renaissance period were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms (such as the madrigal) for their own designs. Towards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the madrigal comedy, and the intermedio are seen.|$|E

500|$|He {{was buried}} in Copenhagen's Vestre Cemetery; all the music at his funeral, {{including}} the hymns, {{was the work of}} the composer. After his death, his wife was commissioned to sculpt a monument to him, to be erected in central Copenhagen. She wrote: [...] "I wanted to take the winged horse, eternal symbol of poetry, and place a musician on its back. He was to sit there between the rushing wings blowing a <b>reed</b> <b>pipe</b> out over Copenhagen." [...] Dispute about her design and a shortfall in funding meant that erection of the monument was delayed and that Anne Marie herself ended up subsidising it. It was finally unveiled in 1939.|$|E
60|$|Above him on {{the crest}} of the cliff ran the dark green line of the orange groves of Araish--the reputed Garden of the Hesperides of the ancients, where the golden apples grew. A mile or so to eastward were dotted the huts and tents of a Bedouin encampment on the fertile emerald pasture-land that spread away, as far as eye could range, towards Ceuta. Nearer, astride of a grey rock an almost naked goatherd, a lithe brown {{stripling}} with a cord of camel-hair about his shaven head, intermittently made melancholy and unmelodious sounds upon a <b>reed</b> <b>pipe.</b> From somewhere in the blue vault of heaven overhead came the joyous trilling of a lark, from below the silken rustling of the tideless sea.|$|E

6000|$|The {{professional}} {{dress of}} the Alme {{consists of a}} short embroidered jacket, fitting closely to the arms and back, but frankly unreserved in front, long loose trousers of silk sufficiently opaque somewhat to soften {{the severity of the}} lower limbs, a Cashmere shawl bound about the waist and a light turban of muslin embroidered with gold. The long black hair, starred with small coins, falls abundantly over the shoulders. The eyelids are sabled with kohl, and such other paints, oils, varnishes and dyestuffs are used as the fair one--who is a trifle dark, by the way--may have proved for herself, or accepted on the superior judgment of her European sisters. Altogether, the girl's outer and visible aspect is not unattractive to the eye of the traveler, however faulty to the eye of the traveler's wife. When about to dance, the Alme puts on a lighter and more diaphanous dress, eschews her slippers, and with a slow and measured step advances to the centre of the room--her lithe figure undulating with a grace peculiarly serpentile. The music is that of a <b>reed</b> <b>pipe</b> or a tambourine--a number of attendants assisting with castanets. Perhaps the [...] "argument" [...] of her dance will be a love-passage with an imaginary young Arab. The coyness of a first meeting by chance her gradual warming into passion their separation, followed by her tears and dejection the hope of meeting soon again and, finally, the intoxication of being held once more in his arms--all are delineated with a fidelity and detail surprising to whatever of judgment the masculine spectator may have the good fortune to retain.|$|E
60|$|The life led {{by these}} wild people is {{necessarily}} monotonous. They rest but little--from 11 P.M. till dawn--and never {{sleep in the}} bush, for fear of plundering parties, Few begin the day with prayer as Moslems should: {{for the most part}} they apply themselves to counting and milking their cattle. The animals, all of which have names [51], come when called to the pail, and supply the family with a morning meal. Then the warriors, grasping their spears, and sometimes the young women armed only with staves, drive their herds to pasture: the matrons and children, spinning or rope-making, tend the flocks, and the kraal is abandoned to the very young, the old, and the sick. The herdsmen wander about, watching the cattle and tasting nothing but the pure element or a pinch of coarse tobacco. Sometimes they play at Shahh, Shantarah, and other games, of which they are passionately fond: with a board formed of lines traced in the sand, and bits of dry wood or camel's earth acting pieces, they spend hour after hour, every looker-on vociferating his opinion, and catching at the men, till apparently the two players are those least interested in the game. Or, to drive off sleep, they sit whistling to their flocks, or they perform upon the Forimo, a <b>reed</b> <b>pipe</b> generally made at Harar, which has a plaintive sound uncommonly pleasing. [52] In the evening, the kraal again resounds with lowing and bleating: the camel's milk is all drunk, the cow's and goat's reserved for butter and ghee, which the women prepare; the numbers are once more counted, and the animals are carefully penned up for the night. This simple life is varied by an occasional birth and marriage, dance and foray, disease and murder. Their maladies are few and simple [53]; death generally comes by the spear, and the Bedouin is naturally long-lived. I have seen Macrobians hale and strong, preserving their powers and faculties in spite of eighty and ninety years.|$|E
60|$|An African juggler followed, {{who brought}} in a large flat basket covered with a red cloth, and having placed it in {{the centre of the}} arena, he took from his turban a curious <b>reed</b> <b>pipe,</b> and blew through it. In a few moments the cloth began to move, and as the pipe grew shriller and shriller two green and gold snakes put out their strange {{wedge-shaped}} heads and rose slowly up, swaying to and fro with the music as a plant sways in the water. The children, however, were rather frightened at their spotted hoods and quick darting tongues, and were much more pleased when the juggler made a tiny orange-tree grow out of the sand and bear pretty white blossoms and clusters of real fruit; and when he took the fan of the little daughter of the Marquess de Las-Torres, and changed it into a blue bird that flew all round the pavilion and sang, their delight and amazement knew no bounds. The solemn minuet, too, performed by the dancing boys from the church of Nuestra Senora Del Pilar, was charming. The Infanta had never before seen this wonderful ceremony which takes place every year at Maytime in front of the high altar of the Virgin, and in her honour; and indeed none of the royal family of Spain had entered the great cathedral of Saragossa since a mad priest, supposed by many to have been in the pay of Elizabeth of England, had tried to administer a poisoned wafer to the Prince of the Asturias. So she had known only by hearsay of 'Our Lady's Dance,' as it was called, and it certainly was a beautiful sight. The boys wore old-fashioned court dresses of white velvet, and their curious three-cornered hats were fringed with silver and surmounted with huge plumes of ostrich feathers, the dazzling whiteness of their costumes, as they moved about in the sunlight, being still more accentuated by their swarthy faces and long black hair. Everybody was fascinated by the grave dignity with which they moved through the intricate figures of the dance, and by the elaborate grace of their slow gestures, and stately bows, and when they had finished their performance and doffed their great plumed hats to the Infanta, she acknowledged their reverence with much courtesy, and made a vow that she would send a large wax candle to the shrine of Our Lady of Pilar in return for the pleasure that she had given her.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>pipes</b> may be {{tuned in}} any of several ways: (1) by {{lengthening}} or shortening the vibrating length of the reed tongue {{by means of a}} wire protruding from the boot of the pipe; (2) by adjusting the effective speaking length of the resonator; (3) by adjusting the metal flap {{in the side of the}} resonator or the cap on the top of the pipe (especially with fractional length pipes). All of these methods can also affect the tonal regulation of the <b>pipe,</b> so tuning <b>reed</b> <b>pipes</b> is trickier than tuning flue pipes.|$|R
