5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 different Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> S.pungens was genetically similar to S.collinitus, S.neoalbidipes, S.pseudobrevipes, S.luteus, S.brevipes, S.weaverae, and certain isolates of S.granulatus.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that wild Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China {{exhibited}} very high concentrations of copper within the plants, more so than the 48 species tested. Commelina communis had sequestered some 361mg/kg of copper, while the plant with the next highest concentration, Polygonum macrathum, had 286mg/kg. Five of the species examined, including the Asiatic dayflower, also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc, lead, and cadmium. The <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil revegetation and phytoremediation.|$|E
5|$|A Chinese study {{published}} in 2001 used the molecular biological technique {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} to analyze the differences in DNA sequence between 23 A.gallica specimens collected from the Northern Hemisphere. The <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns observed, there are four global A.gallica subpopulations: the Chinese, European, North American–Chinese, and North American–European geographical lineages. A 2007 study on the northeastern and southwestern Chinese distribution of Armillaria, using fruit body and pure culture morphology, concluded that there are several unnamed species (Chinese biological species C, F, H, J and L) that are similar to the common A.gallica.|$|E

25|$|Another isotopic {{method has}} been {{employed}} {{to investigate whether}} protein sources in human diets in the early Anglo-Saxon varied with geographic location, or with respect to age or sex.

25|$|Of the 1.5 million Laysan Albatrosses that inhabit Midway, {{nearly all}} {{are found to}} have plastic in their {{digestive}} system. Approximately one-third of the chicks die. These deaths are attributed to the albatrosses confusing brightly colored plastic with marine animals (such as squid and fish) for food. Recent <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> oceanic plastic develops a chemical signature that is normally used by seabirds to locate food items.|$|E

The importance of this direct link between the helicase and the leading-strand polymerase is underscored by results in cultured human cells, where Mrc1/Claspin is required for efficient replication fork progression.

Blocking stereotypic behavior (head and tooth capping) was associated with decreases in leisure-item interaction and increases in another stereotypic response (hand wringing). <b>Results</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the reduction in item interaction was due to adventitious punishment.

25|$|To {{examine the}} effects of {{progesterone}} on nicotine addiction, participants in one study were either treated orally with a progesterone treatment, or treated with a placebo. When treated with progesterone, participants exhibited enhanced suppression of smoking urges, reported higher ratings of “bad effects” from IV nicotine, and reported lower ratings of “drug liking”. These <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> progesterone not only alters the subjective effects of nicotine, but reduces the urge to smoke cigarettes.|$|E

However, the ejaculation frequency was not associated with risk of advanced prostate cancer. The results were broadly similar to the findings of a smaller Australian study and an American study.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} shown that downregulated miR-181a and miR-181b were also {{involved}} in the oncogenesis of gliomas. miR-181a and miR-181b function as tumor suppressors that cause inhibition of growth, induce apoptosis and inhibit invasion of glioma cells. In addition, the tumor suppressive effect of miR-181b in glioma cells was apparent that the effect of miR-181a. These aberrant <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> downregulated miR-181a and miR-181b may be key factors that contribute to the occurrence in malignant human gliomas.|$|E

25|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements.
