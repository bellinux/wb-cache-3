50|$|In January 2004 a 3.4 GHz {{version was}} <b>{{released}}</b> for <b>Socket</b> 478, and in Summer 2004 the CPU was released {{using the new}} Socket 775. A slight performance increase was achieved in late 2004 by increasing the bus speed from 800 MT/s to 1066 MT/s, resulting in a 3.46 GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition. By most metrics, this was on a per-clock basis the fastest single-core NetBurst processor that was ever produced, even outperforming many of its successor chips (not counting the dual-core Pentium D). Afterwards, the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was migrated to the Prescott core. The new 3.73 GHz Extreme Edition had the same features as a 6x0-sequence Prescott 2M, but with a 1066 MT/s bus. In practice however, the 3.73 GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition almost always proved to be slower than the 3.46 GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition, which is most likely {{due to the lack}} of an L3 cache and the longer instruction pipeline. The only advantage the 3.73 GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition had over the 3.46 GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was the ability to run 64-bit applications since all Gallatin-based Pentium 4 Extreme Edition processors lacked the Intel 64 instruction set.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{resources}} include {{file handles}} or network sockets - for example, copying one file to another is most simply done with two file handles: one for input, one for output, and thus has a [...] "file handle working set" [...] size of two.

Study purpose is to describe experiences of subjects with transhumeral amputation and brachial plexus injury, who were fit with, and trained to use, a DEKA Arm. This was a mixed-methods study utilizing qualitative (e. g. interview, survey) and quantitative data (e. g. self-report and performance measures). Subject 1, a current prosthesis user, had a shoulder arthrodesis. Subject 2, not a prosthesis user, had a subluxed shoulder. Both were trained in laboratory and participated in a trial of home use. Descriptive analyses of processes and outcomes were conducted. Subject 1 was fitted with the transhumeral configuration (HC) DEKA Arm using a compression <b>release</b> stabilized <b>socket.</b> He had 12 hours of prosthetic training and participated in all home study activities.

Both subjects reported functional benefits from use, and expressed a desire to receive a DEKA Arm in the future. This paper reported on two different strategies for prosthetic fitting and their outcomes. The advantages and limitations of each approach were discussed.

40|$|A {{prosthetist}} makes {{a conventional}} socket by wrapping plaster bandage around {{the residual limb}} and using the resulting shell to create a positive model. After he or she modifies the plaster, {{it is used to}} create a laminated socket. Such sockets are almost perfect cylinders that encapsulate the limb. The bone is centered in soft, compressible tissue that must move aside before the bone can push against the socket to transmit force or torque to the prosthesis. In a compression/release stabilized (CRS) socket, three or more longitudinal depressions compress and displace tissue between the socket wall and the bone to reduce lost motion when the bone is moved with respect to the <b>socket.</b> <b>Release</b> areas between depressions are opened to accommodate displaced tissue. Without these openings provided, the CRS socket will not function as intended. Often, the release areas of compression are the struts of a carbon-fiber frame, and the regions between struts are left open. A frame with openings may be modified by the prosthetist adding a thin membrane fully surrounding the limb but allowing the membrane and underlying tissue to enter the release openings. The membrane may contain electrodes, and it may constitute a roll-on liner that helps suspend the prosthesis. We introduce three socket designs: transradial, transfemoral, and transhumeral...|$|R
5000|$|On April 21, 2005, {{less than}} a week after the release of Venice and San Diego, AMD {{announced}} its next addition to the Athlon 64 line, the Athlon 64 X2.

Both were <b>released</b> only for <b>Socket</b> 939. The Athlon 64 X2 was received very well by reviewers and the general public, with a general consensus emerging that AMD's implementation of multi-core was superior to that of the competing Pentium D. Some felt initially that the X2 would cause market confusion with regard to price points since the new processor was targeted at the same [...] "enthusiast," [...] US$350 and above market already occupied by AMD's existing socket 939 Athlon 64s.

The Athlon 64 was targeted at the mainstream consumer, and the Athlon FX at gamers. The Sempron budget processor was targeted at value-conscious consumers. Following the launch of the Athlon 64 X2, AMD surpassed Intel in US retail sales for a period of time, although Intel retained overall market leadership because of its exclusive relationships with direct sellers such as Dell.|$|R
5000|$|Socket {{wrenches}} {{are most}} commonly hexagonal, or more {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "6-point" [...] in lay terms. Sockets are driven by being attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the square drive). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] square drive sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] square drive, and both #4 and #5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick <b>socket</b> <b>release</b> of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of computer-aided tools into the {{product development process}} allows {{improving the quality of}} the product, evaluating different variants of the same product in a faster way and reducing time and costs. They can play a meaningful role also in designing custom-fit products (especially, those characterized by a tight interaction with the human body), increasing the comfort and improving people’s quality of life. This thesis concerns a specific custom-fit product, the lower limb prosthesis. It is part of a research project that aims at developing a new design platform centred on the digital model of the patient and his/her characteristics. The platform, named Prosthesis Virtual Laboratory (PVL), is being developed by the V&K Research Group (University of Bergamo) and integrates ICT tools and product-process knowledge. It provides two environments: one for prosthesis design (named Prosthesis Modelling Lab), both transfemoral and transtibial, and one for the prosthesis testing (named Virtual Testing Lab). The main objective has been to embed within the Virtual Testing Environment numerical simulation tools to analyse the interaction between the socket and the residual limb under different loading conditions, allowing the prosthetist to automatically run the simulation and optimize socket shape. Simulation tools, such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA), permit to predict the pressures at the interface socket-residual limb, evaluate the comfort of socket and validate the socket design before manufacturing phase. However, the diffusion of simulation tools in orthopaedic laboratories is strongly limited by the high level of competence required to use them. Furthermore, the implementation of the simulation model is time consuming and requires expensive resources, both humans and technological, especially onerous for small orthopaedic labs. To effectively employ the numerical analysis in prosthesis design, the simulation process has been automated and embedded within the virtual design platform. Therefore, in such a context, the specific scientific objectives have been to: •	Critically analyse {{the state of the art}} with regard to methods and tools to evaluate socket-residual limb interaction. •	Identify the key issues to automate the simulation activities. •	Define a set of simulation rules and the Finite Element Analysis model. •	Implement and integrate within the new design platform the automatic simulation procedure. •	Test the integrated design platform with a case study. •	Identify future development trends. Research activities have been organized into four main activities as follows. The first activity consisted in an extensive analysis of the last two decades State of the Art on numerical models adopted to study residual lower-limb and prosthetic socket interaction. Starting from literature, the key issues of the simulation process (e. g., geometric models reconstruction, materials characterization, simulation steps, and boundary conditions), the methodologies and procedures have been identified. Particular attention has been also paid to the parameters commonly adopted to evaluate socket comfort. This phase played a fundamental role since it constituted the basis for the implementation of the embedded simulation procedure. It also permitted to highlight that current finite element models are stand-alone and not integrated with prosthetic CAD or Digital Human Modelling (DHM) systems. In the second activity the tools and methods necessary to develop the embedded simulation module have been selected. By using these tools, it was possible to identify the simulation rules and the best practice procedures, which are fundamental to implement an automatic simulation module. Initially, the modelling tools have been considered since they provide the geometric models for the numerical analysis of the socket-residuum interaction and for the virtual gait analysis of the patient’s avatar. Then, particular attention has been paid on the choice of the FE solver, that has been made according to the results of preliminary FE models. They were implemented using two different solvers: Abaqus (commercial) and CalculiX (open-source). The latter has been experimented to verify the possibility to develop a design platform totally independent from commercial tools. However, according to the results, Abaqus has been chosen because it allows managing adequately simulation problems characterized by large deformations and difficult contact conditions, its results are comparable with those found in literature, and its scripting code does not require specific customization. The last considered tool was the Digital Human Modelling system (LifeMOD) since it permits to enhance the accuracy of the numerical analysis. By performing the gait simulation of the patient’s avatar, it provides the directions and the magnitude of forces and moments that act on the socket. The third activity consisted in defining the architecture of the simulation module, implementing the module and the interfaces with the socket CAD tool (namely Socket Modelling Assistant-SMA) to get the geometric models of the involved parts (socket and residual limb) and with the DHM system to acquire forces acting on the socket during patient’s walking. The simulation module has been implemented using the Python language and the integrated environment works as follows. Once the prosthetist has created the 3 D socket model, SMA acquires the input for the analysis (e. g., residual limb length, patient’s weight, friction coefficient, material properties), and produces the files required to generate the FE model. Abaqus automatically generates the FE model without any human intervention, solves the analysis and generates the output file containing the pressure values. Results are imported in SMA and visualized with a colour map. SMA evaluates pressure distribution and highlights the areas that should be modified. Geometry modifications are needed in the areas where pressure exceeds the maximum value and are carried out automatically by the system or by the prosthetist using the virtual tools available in SMA. Then, the system re-executes the simulation. Through this iterative process of adjustments, the socket shape is modified and optimized in order to eliminate undercuts, minimize weight and, especially, distribute loads in the appropriate way so that they can be tolerated for the longest period of time. The fourth and last activity concerned the test and validation of the simulation module integrated within the new design platform, by considering a transfemoral patient. The new virtual process and the key issues of the simulation procedure have been tested starting from the patient’s data acquisition to the <b>release</b> of the <b>socket</b> using also data coming from the gait simulation with the DHM system. The geometric model of the residual limb has been reconstructed from MRI images and the socket has been modelled using SMA. Through an iterative process, the socket shape has been optimized until the pressure distribution on the residuum was consistent. Preliminary activity concerning the FE model validation has been performed comparing the pressure distribution experimentally acquired with pressure transducers over the residuum with the simulation results. To accomplish this task, the geometric model of the real socket has been acquired using reverse engineering techniques. Two numerical simulations have been implemented, they differ for the residuum geometric models adopted: from MRI and from 3 D scanning. Preliminary results have been considered positive but improvements are necessary. As an example, some geometric inconsistencies, occurred during the acquisition of the geometric model of the residual limb, have reduced the accuracy of the final results. To complete the evaluation of the simulation model, a new residuum geometric model is needed and a refinement of the material model characterization is desirable. To conclude, the simulation module embedded within Virtual Testing Laboratory has improved the prosthesis development process with the goal of assessing and validating the socket shape under different load conditions (static or dynamic) before the manufacturing phase. The testing phase of the new procedure has demonstrated the feasibility of the virtual approach for lower limb prosthesis design. The tests carried out permitted to highlight necessary improvements and future developments, such as the definition of a protocol to acquire the residual limb through MRI and 3 D scan, refinement of the FE model (e. g., non-linear viscoelastic behaviour for soft tissues, friction coefficients), parallel computing to improve simulation performances, open-source solvers to implement a design platform totally independent from commercial systems, and a massive test campaign involving transtibial and transfemoral patients to fully validate the FE model and the design platform...|$|R
