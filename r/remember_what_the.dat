5|$|Andrei is {{once again}} at the Andronikov Monastery as famine and war grip the country. He no longer paints and never speaks, and keeps Durochka with him as a fellow {{companion}} in silence. Several refugees discuss the problems in their respective home towns, and one man talks in a broken voice of his escape from Vladimir. He is recognised by a younger monk as the long absent Kirill. He has suffered during his {{time away from the}} monastery and begs the father superior to allow him to return. His wish is granted but he is instructed to copy out the holy scriptures fifteen times in penance. A group of Tatars stops at the monastery while travelling through the region, much to the concern of Andrei and Kirill who experienced their brutality first hand. Durochka is too simple minded to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Tatars did and is fascinated by one of the soldier's shining breastplate. The group taunt and play with her, but the soldier takes a liking to her, putting his horned helmet on her head and dressing her as a bride, finally deciding to take her away with him as his eighth, and only Russian, wife. Andrei attempts to stop her from leaving, but she is determined and rides away with the Tatars. Kirill talks to Andrei {{for the first time since}} they both left the monastery, and he assures him that Durochka won't be in any danger, as harming a holy fool is considered bad luck, and she will be let go. Andrei continues his menial work of carrying large hot stones from a fire with tongs to heat water for the monastery, but drops the stone in the snow.|$|E

Kirshen {{said in the}} same interview: [...] "There's a 'Bee Whisperer' in Episode 3 that came from clicking the [...] "Random article" [...] link on Wikipedia. I don't <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> page we got was, but about three logical leaps later we landed on that idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Stephen Whitty of the New York Daily News said, [...] "Although it's called Captain America: Civil War, {{the latest}} Marvel movie is {{actually}} a supersized Avengers picture—overstuffed to bursting. And sometimes during its {{two and a half}} hour running time, it just goes bust." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "As a work of thought, Civil War is compromised, but at least there are thoughts to compromise. As an action film, it has its moments, but aside from the big opening sequence—the action scenes are a bit flat." [...] Andrew O'Hehir writing for Salon said, [...] "Much of Captain America: Civil War is just the laborious working-out of leftover dangling plot elements from Captain America: The Winter Soldier two summers ago." [...] While Nicholas Barber of BBC gave the film a generally favorable review, praising both its visuals and action sequences, he criticized {{the fact that there was}} [...] "no cogent reason for any of [...] to be on one side or the other, which is why their inevitable dust-up feels like a game of dodgeball in a school playground." [...] Mark Millar, writer of the [...] "Civil War" [...] comic storyline on which the film was based, felt the film [...] "had a good opening twenty , but then I honestly can’t <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> movie was about." [...] He also felt the film lacked levity, especially considering the Russo brothers' background in comedy.|$|E

2500|$|In the maftir (...) {{reading of}} [...] that concludes the parashah, Moses enjoined the Israelites to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Amalekites did {{to them on}} their journey, after they left Egypt, {{surprising}} them and cutting down all the stragglers at their rear. The Israelites were enjoined never to forget to blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. The second open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here {{with the end of}} the parashah.|$|E
2500|$|During the Second World War, after Nazi Germany {{commenced}} {{its mass}} executions of Jews in occupied Soviet territory, Pius XII employed diplomacy to aid {{victims of the}} Holocaust and directed the Church to provide discreet aid to Jews. Upon his death in 1958, among many Jewish tributes, the Chief Rabbi of Rome Elio Toaff, said: [...] "Jews will always <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church did for them by order of the Pope during the Second World War. When the war was raging, Pius spoke out very often to condemn the false race theory." [...] This is disputed by commentator John Cornwell, who in his book, Hitler's Pope, argues that the pope was weak and vacillating in his approach to Nazism. Cornwell asserts that the pope did little to challenge the progressing holocaust of the Jews {{out of fear of}} provoking the Nazis into invading Vatican City.|$|E
60|$|Edward {{found it}} {{something}} {{of an effort to}} comply, for his mind kept wandering--trying to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> service was that he had done Goodson.|$|E

6000|$|... "Where do you room?" [...] asked Dick. He <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> house master {{had said}} about Stanley and felt that the youth would make a nice roommate for anybody.|$|R
6000|$|... "My husband!" [...] she answered, and {{she laid}} his hand upon her breast, and the breast {{that he knew}} so well was hard as stone. Leo groaned, <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Crab had said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so, too. I am sure I hope so. Because you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> ride to Long Valley did to Miss Spencer," [...] rejoined Glenn.|$|E
6000|$|Yes; {{there was}} Hildegarde Bentel, {{but she had}} married Anthony Mattison, {{who was not a}} soldier. Could the American mamselle <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> girl's first name was? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Serenity, that's the word! None of {{us could}} <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> word was. It's a ripping good thing to have. I should be awfully bucked {{if you would have}} it, too.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Albert <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fellow had said; he let {{the reins}} loose. The old sorrel's teeth came {{together}} with a snap; his head lowered and his tail rose; he shot abreast of the blacks. Brann yelled: ...|$|R
60|$|But, <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> oracle had said, he {{only half}} uttered the words, and then mumbled the rest indistinctly; {{and from his}} confusion, people must have {{imagined}} that this handsome young man had lost his wits.|$|R
60|$|Leader was {{the name}} of one of the missing horses, and Frank started as he <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{storekeeper}} had said, but feeling Miss Oliver's eyes upon him, turned his head and looked out into the clearing.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it were {{to clear}} up I wouldn't know how to behave, it would seem so unnatural," [...] said Kate. [...] "Do you, by any chance, <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> sun looks like, Phil?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What of that?" [...] said Mr. St. Barbe; [...] "and {{when you}} <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Whigs owe to {{literary}} men, {{they ought to}} have elected me into Brooks' without my asking for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then let the revels commence," [...] said Reggie. [...] "Ding dong! Ding Dong! Hurry along! For {{it is my}} wedding-morning! And the bride-- Dash it, I wish I could <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> bride was doing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never can}} get up there without wings," [...] said May, {{as she looked at}} the high rocks with a tangle of vines all over them. Then she <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> brook told her, and called out,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Dave <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{doctor had}} said about being a poor man and needing money. Perhaps the fellow thought to [...] "bleed him," [...] {{not only in the}} {{interest}} of Jasniff and Merwell, but also for himself.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked around}} {{in vain for}} the horse spoken of by Pawnee Brown. Not an animal was in sight. Then she <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> scout had said about riding down the ravine, and she set off on foot.|$|R
60|$|How well I can {{recollect}} {{the first}} time we met her! Often and often I have recalled the circumstances, and tried to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> exact impression was which she produced on my mind at the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go," [...] {{said the}} Huron, suppressing the {{alarming}} exhibition in an instant, in a death-like calmness of countenance; [...] "go to the dark-haired daughter, and say, Magua waits to speak. The father will <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> child promises." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'For your sake!' he cried, {{patting her}} hand. 'Well! It IS for your sake, mother. You <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> blind man said, about the gold. Here's a brave crowd! Come! Or wait till I come back--yes, yes, wait here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|And at that Nod <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{watchman}} had said, {{when they}} were talking together by the eagles' watch-fires. He touched Thumb, speaking softly in Mulgar-royal. [...] "Thumb, my brother, <b>what</b> of <b>the</b> Wonderstone? <b>what</b> of <b>the</b> Wonderstone? Shall we tell this Moona-mulgar of that?" ...|$|R
50|$|RFT can be {{a useful}} outline for a better {{understanding}} of the effects of nonverbal cues in persuasion and impression formation. Regulatory Fit Theory suggests that the effect of a cue cannot be understood without <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> cue means given a recipient's focus orientation.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh, that {{is quite}} well! I am rich--you are rich--we are all rich and happy because we are so few and we live so long.

6000|$|... "Do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} <b>the</b> {{last time}} you believed Cummings and Poyor were mistaken or ignorant?" [...] Neal asked meaningly.|$|R
6000|$|She turned pale, nevertheless, {{when she}} replied in those terms. I {{could see that}} I was {{disturbing}} her, when I asked if she <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Cur had written. But our position was far too serious to be trifled with. [...] "I suppose he threatened you?" [...] I said, trying to lead her on. [...] "What did he say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you must}} dance. I've heard how finely you do it; for some lords and ladies saw you {{dancing with the}} daisies, {{and said it was}} the prettiest ballet they ever looked at.
