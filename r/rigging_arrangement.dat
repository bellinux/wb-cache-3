5000|$|The {{frame of}} the ICF bogie is a {{fabricated}} structure made up of mild steel. Main sub-assemblies of bogie frame viz. side frames, transoms, headstocks, longitudinal forms the skeleton of the bogie frame. The sub assemblies are fabricated from flanges, webs, channels and Ribs by welding process. Various types of brackets are welded to the frame {{for the purpose of}} primary and secondary suspension arrangement, alternator suspension arrangement and brake <b>rigging</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Various brackets viz. brake hanger brackets, brake lever hanger brackets, brake cylinder fixing brackets, anchor link brackets, bolster spring suspension brackets, alternator suspension brackets, belt tensioning bracket/s, axle box guides, suspension straps are welded on the bogie frames. It involves 40 meters (app.) of welding in a single conventional bogie frame. Based on load carrying capacity per axle, the conventional bogie frames are grouped into two types. They are 13 ton bogie frame and 16 ton bogie frame. 13 ton bogie frames are being used in the bogies of all non-AC mainline coaches and 16 ton bogie frames are being used in bogies of all AC coaches, power cars and diesel multiple unit trailer coaches.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{examination of the}} performance of a typical upwind sail <b>rig</b> <b>arrangement</b> was carried out for different heel and yaw angles using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver. Experimental wind tunnel data provided by the Wolfson Unit for Marine Technology and Industrial Aerodynamics were used to validate the calculated CFD results. The computed results demonstrate good agreement and the effect of mesh density on the flow solution is presented. The purpose of this work is to identify the downwind position and track of the resultant sail vortex system. The ability to model correctly this behaviour within a yacht race simulation is critical to identifying the blanketing effect between two yachts...|$|R
40|$|A {{major concern}} in modern engine design {{is the issue}} of the {{lubrication}} regime at the piston-liner assembly. To fully understand the complex lubrication phenomena between the piston-rings and cylinder liner in reciprocating engines {{and at the same time}} achieve minimal energy losses with the oncoming emission regulations, it is important to characterize the developing oil film. This dynamic process involves many factors, such as piston-ring and piston dynamics, starved lubrication, liner geometry deformation, lubricant - additive degradation and blow-by, which, in turn, enhance the difficulty of interpreting engine experimental results. The simplified test rig is used as a platform to develop oil film measuring techniques and study experimental results from different sensors by means of a robust and solid technique without the engine testing ambiguities, at different lubrication regimes. This paper is focused on experimental findings from the simplified test rig and how these can be applied on specially modified engines, with the respective sensors fitted. A comparison between the single-ring test rig and the engine visualization results is attempted so that similar forms of cavitation identified, be further studied. Moreover, a calibration coefficient for LIF engine experiments can be derived via the simplified test <b>rig</b> <b>arrangement.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Even though {{years of}} {{experience}} accounts for a good gauge for the appropriate lifting anchor to be used, {{it should not be}} left to the reinforcement fabricators and precast factory personnel to select the lifting anchor. The design engineer should specifically account for the applied loads expected during the lifting, transport and placement (or re-usability requirements) of the element. Flexure, casting bed suction, load direction (axial ‘tensile’, angular ‘sling’, transverse ‘shear’) are also load considerations to be accounted for in the lifting design of the element.The anchor selection, together with additional reinforcement, and <b>rigging</b> <b>arrangements</b> is influenced by:- The dead weight of the element- The number of anchors in the element and the configuration of the anchor- Capacity of the anchor at the specific concrete compressive strengths at time of lift- The dynamic loads applied during lifting (suction to the casting bed, or crane dynamics)- The rigging configurationAll of the above factors must be taken into consideration during the lifting design phase of the element.The weight of the element can be determined by the calculated volume, and using the specific gravity (normal weight reinforced concrete is approximately 24 kN/m3).Establishing the lifting anchor positions will influence the <b>rigging</b> <b>arrangements</b> used and therefore the static analysis of the rigging should be determined. Particular rigging configurations may be more suitable for particular job sites or lifting in place considerations, and the lifting design should denote the assumptions accordingly. For example, the statically determined systems, shown in Figure 3, where the determination of the loads is not always possible.Dynamic loads considered in lifting design are accounted for in two stages; suction to the casting bed on the initial lift and then the dynamic loads induced from crane vibration. These crane impact loads must be accounted for during transportation in the yard and on-site, and the coefficient increases from an overhead gantry crane through to a crane moving over rough terrain. Consideration for the entire transportation loads {{must be taken into account}} during the lifting design.Anchor capacity, or load resistance, should be considered for tensile loads (axial), sling angle (angular) and shear loads (transverse). Consideration of different load combinations may result in wide variations required from the lifting insert. The load directions during production, transport and placement should be considered carefully. Depending on the planned load direction, either a different anchor may be included in the lifting design, alternatively, reinforcement may be included to reduce the possibility of element flexure crack damage. The configuration (size, position and quantity) of this reinforcement should be supplemented to the element reinforcement design to ensure for adequate capacity of the lifting design.Lifting design is influenced by the steel / concrete interaction of the specific anchor selected. Different load cases are considered by the lifting design engineer, such as anchor susceptibility to edge distance, placement sensitivity, and anchor capacity at the specific concrete strength at time of lift. For example, a footed pin head style anchor maybe more susceptible to edge distance than a hairpin style anchor. Or a splayed anchor does not have the same tensile/axial capacity with the equivalent anchor length (effective embedment is greater on a footed anchor than a splayed anchor of equivalent overall length, see figure 4).|$|R
50|$|Statements {{like those}} in AS3850, “Because of the mode in which failure can occur, it may be {{necessary}} to test complete systems and not calculate values obtained from a group of components that make up the system. The mode of failure of an individual component does not necessarily reflect the mode of failure of the system.” But the standard does not continue to further the understanding required regarding test methods, the components that should be deemed as part of the system, the various modes of failure, and the interpretation of test results for each failure mode.And further in AS3850, “The strength limit state capacity shall be determined by a statistical analysis from the test results in accordance with Paragraph A4.5.” and assuming the test data is taken from a statistically valid test method, the data is to be determined via statistical means to derive the Load resistance model, for the anchor.There are adequate load case coefficients available to estimate sling angle load amplification, suction from the casting bed, and various dynamic transportation load estimates.Load resistance factors of safety, FOS, set out in the Australian Code would typically denote a FOS of 5.0 for re-usable lifting equipment and an FOS of 2.5 for a lifting anchors.The <b>rigging</b> <b>arrangements</b> can influence the applied anchor load, where statically indeterminate systems are not necessarily a design consideration, but can be used in practice. The determination of the loads through the rigging system must be a consideration whilst calculating the load resistant model, refer to the examples shown in Figure 3.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, naval {{architecture}} {{has been}} more craft than science. The suitability of a vessel's shape was judged by looking at a half-model of a vessel or a prototype. Ungainly shapes or abrupt transitions were frowned on as being flawed. This included <b>rigging,</b> deck <b>arrangements,</b> and even fixtures. Subjective descriptors such as ungainly, full, and fine were used {{as a substitute for}} the more precise terms used today. A vessel was, and still is described as having a ‘fair’ shape. The term ‘fair’ is meant to denote not only a smooth transition from fore to aft but also a shape that was ‘right.’ Determining what is ‘right’ in a particular situation in the absence of definitive supporting analysis encompasses the art of naval architecture to this day.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, 20-year-old Newman Darby was {{the first}} to {{conceive}} the idea of using a handheld sail and rig mounted on a universal joint so that he could control his small catamaran—the first rudderless sailboard ever built that allowed a person to steer by shifting his or her weight in order to tilt the sail fore and aft. Darby did not file a patent for the sailboard. However, he is widely recognized as its inventor as well as the first to conceive, design, and build a sailboard with a universal joint. In his own words, Darby experimented throughout much of the 1950s and 1960s and it wasn't until 1963 that an improved sailboard with a conventional stayed sloop <b>rig</b> sail <b>arrangement</b> made it more stable than the one built in 1948. In 1964, Darby began selling his sailboards.|$|R
50|$|A <b>rig</b> is an <b>arrangement</b> {{of items}} used for fishing. It can be {{assembled}} {{of one or}} more lines, hooks, sinkers, bobbers, swivels, lures, beads, and other fishing tackle. A rig might be held by a rod, by hand, or attached to a boat or pier. Some rigs are designed to float near the surface of the water, others are designed to sink to the bottom. Some rigs are designed for trolling. Many rigs are designed especially for catching a single species of fish, but will work well for many different species.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis of the performance of bulk solid pneumatic transport systems. A bulk solid parameter, with the potential to characterise materials on the basis of suitability for this mode of transport, is proposed. Procedures for producing conveying characteristics are developed and linked to conveying models and design requirements. A new model based on the power requirements of the pneumatic conveying process is presented. The deaeration behaviour of bulk solids is analysed in some detail. Theoretical aspects, appropriate test <b>rig</b> <b>arrangements</b> and experimental arrangements are discussed. A characterising parameter, the normalised time constant, is proposed. Extensive experimental data are used to clarify the significance of this performance indicator and to assess its capacity to predict the pneumatic conveying potential of a given bulk solid. The process of generating conveying characteristics for the bulk solid/pipeline configuration from experimental data is discussed. The computerisation of this process and the application of numerical techniques are developed and demonstrated. The advantages and possibilities are explored, and limitations noted. The implementation of a solids friction factor (Barth type) model within the conveying characteristics procedures noted above, is developed and demonstrated. The application of scale up procedures within this model environment is discussed and tested against experimental data. Determination of conveying characteristics for stepped pipelines is demonstrated, as is a method for the optimised design of stepped pipeline configurations. A 2 ̆ 2 power 2 ̆ 2 based pneumatic conveying model is proposed. This model considers the power available from the isothermal expansion of the gas down the pipeline, and the power consumed by the various components of the system. Features of this model include a solids friction factor correlation, the treatment of bends, a new analysis of the air-only component and a method for the identification of invalid conveying regions. The generation of conveying characteristics curves for single and stepped pipeline systems within this model is demonstrated. The performance of the model is tested against a selection of experimental data. Trends inherent in the model, and its scaling behaviour, are examined. Potential areas for further development of the model are discussed...|$|R
50|$|This {{type of vessel}} has two masts, each made of two spars. The {{mainmast}} is rigged {{exactly like}} the mainmast of any other schooner (i.e., fore and aft mainsail and gaff rigged topsail) but the foremast, though having the typical schooner's fore and aft rigged mainsail, has above it one or more square <b>rigged</b> topsails. The <b>arrangement</b> requires the ship to have a foremast yard (the lowest) from which no sail hangs. The foremast {{and all of its}} sails are comparable to that of a brigantine (see below). If there are square rigged topsails on both masts, then it is called a two topsail schooner or double topsail schooner.|$|R
60|$|Dec. 26th.--Fine {{view of the}} {{mountains}} of Bouru, which we have now approached considerably. Our crew seem rather a clumsy lot. They do not walk the deck with the easy swing of English sailors, but hesitate and stagger like landsmen. In the night the lower boom of our mainsail broke, {{and they were all}} the morning repairing it. It consisted of two bamboos lashed together, thick end to thin, and was about seventy feet long. The <b>rigging</b> and <b>arrangement</b> of these praus contrasts strangely with that of European vessels, in which the various ropes and spars, though much more numerous, are placed so as not to interfere with each other's action. Here the case is quite different; for though there are no shrouds or stays to complicate the matter, yet scarcely anything can be done without first clearing something else out of the way. The large sails cannot be shifted round to go on the other tack without first hauling down the jibs, and the booms of the fore and aft sails have to be lowered and completely detached to perform the same operation. Then there are always a lot of ropes foul of each other, and all the sails can never be set (though they are so few) without a good part of their surface having the wind kept out of them by others. Yet praus are much liked even by those who have had European vessels, because of their cheapness both in first cost and in keeping up; almost all repairs can be done by the crew, and very few European stores are required.|$|R
50|$|In {{designing}} the Denis Sullivan, architects Timothy Graul Marine Services looked to several nineteenth century Great Lakes schooners for inspiration, including the Rouse Simmons, Clipper City, and Alvin Clark. Above the waterline, the Sullivan closely resembles these earlier vessels. Her shape {{is that of}} an efficient cargo carrier, and her <b>rigging</b> and deck <b>arrangement</b> are likewise authentic. She differs from her predecessors, however, below the waterline. Traditionally, Great Lakes cargo schooners were built with a fairly flat bottom to minimize draft and permit sailing in shallow waters. They carried a centerboard to compensate for this when sailing to windward. The Denis Sullivan strayed from this tradition to meet both modern Coast Guard safety requirements and the practical considerations of a passenger vessel. She has a relatively deep hull and weighted keel, which provide greater stability to the vessel and allow for 6 ft of head clearance in the below decks accommodations. An additional concession to safety regulations was {{the division of the}} traditional cargo hold into watertight bulkheads.|$|R
40|$|A notable {{characteristic}} of solid biomass fuels {{as compared to}} coal is their significantly higher potassium content. Potassium influences ash deposition and corrosion mechanisms in furnaces and boilers, the effects of which may differ depending on phase transformations of potassium species in the gas phase and condensed phase. An understanding of how potassium is released from biomass fuels during the combustion process is therefore useful for plant designers and operators assessing means of avoiding or mitigating these potential problems. An experimental method is used to measure release patterns from single particles of biomass fuels using flame emission spectroscopy and a single-particle combustion <b>rig.</b> The experimental <b>arrangement</b> also allowed simultaneous thermal imaging of the combusting particle {{in order to determine}} the surface temperature. A model of the single particle combustion is presented. Using experimental data on devolatilisation and burnout times for different sized particles and the measured surface temperature profiles, the thermal and kinetic sub-models are verified. A model for potassium release is described and this is integrated to the single particle combustion model to allow prediction of the temporal patterns of release of gas-phase potassium. The modelled release patterns were compared with those observed. Good agreement between modelled and measured potassium release patterns was attained confirming that the proposed mechanisms affecting potassium release are valid...|$|R

6000|$|Indeed, {{the burden}} of the work had fallen {{altogether}} on Findlayson and his assistant, the young man whom he had chosen because of his rawness to break to his own needs. There were labour-contractors by the half-hundred--fitters and riveters, European, borrowed from the railway workshops, with perhaps twenty white and half-caste subordinates to direct, under direction, the bevies of workmen--but none knew better than these two, who trusted each other, how the underlings were not to be trusted. They had been tried many times in sudden crises--by slipping of booms, by breaking of tackle, failure of cranes, and the wrath of the river--but no stress had brought to light any man among them whom Findlayson and Hitchcock would have honoured by working as remorselessly as they worked themselves. Findlayson thought it over from the beginning: the months of office work destroyed at a blow when the Government of India, at the last moment, added two feet to the width of the bridge, under the impression that bridges were cut out of paper, and so brought to ruin at least half an acre of calculations--and Hitchcock, new to disappointment, buried his head in his arms and wept; the heart-breaking delays over the filling of the contracts in England; the futile correspondences hinting at great wealth of commission if one, only one, rather doubtful consignment were passed; the war that followed the refusal; the careful, polite obstruction at the other end that followed the war, till young Hitchcock, putting one month's leave to another month, and borrowing ten days from Findlayson, spent his poor little savings of a year in a wild dash to London, and there, as his own tongue asserted, and the later consignments proved, put the Fear of God into a man so great that he feared only Parliament, and said so till Hitchcock wrought with him across his own dinner-table, and--he feared the Kashi Bridge and all who spoke in its name. Then there was the cholera that came in the night to the village by the bridge-works; and after the cholera smote the small-pox. The fever they had always with them. Hitchcock had been appointed a magistrate of the third class with whipping powers, for the better government of the community, and Findlayson watched him wield his powers temperately, learning what to overlook and what to look after. It was a long, long reverie, and it covered storm, sudden freshets, death in every manner and shape, violent and awful rage against red tape half frenzying a mind that knows it should be busy on other things; drought, sanitation, finance; birth, wedding, burial, and riot in the village of twenty warring castes; argument, expostulation, persuasion, and the blank despair that a man goes to bed upon, thankful that his rifle is all in pieces in the gun-case. Behind everything rose the black frame of the Kashi Bridge--plate by plate, girder by girder, span by span--and each pier of it recalled Hitchcock, the all-round man, who had stood by his chief without failing from the very first to this last. So the bridge was two men's work--unless one counted Peroo, as Peroo certainly counted himself.
