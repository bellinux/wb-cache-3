40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} that employs passive radio wake-up of the sensor nodes can reduce the energy cost for unnecessary idle listening and communication overhead, extending the network lifetime. A passive wake-up radio is powered by the electromagnetic waves transmitted by a wake-up transmitter rather than a battery on the sensor node. However, this method of powering the wake-up radio results in a short wake-up range, which limits {{the performance of a}} passive wake-up radio sensor network. In this article, we describe our design of a passive wake-up radio sensor node-REACH 2 -Mote-using a high-efficiency, energy-harvesting module and a very low power wake-up circuit to achieve an extended wake-up range. We implemented REACH 2 -Mote in hardware and performed field tests to characterize its performance. The experimental results show that REACH 2 -Mote can achieve a wake-up range of 44 feet. We also modeled REACH 2 -Mote and evaluated its performance through simulations, comparing its performance to that of another passive wake-up <b>radio</b> <b>approach,</b> an active wake-up <b>radio</b> <b>approach,</b> and a conventional duty cycling approach. The simulation results show that REACH 2 -Mote can significantly extend the network lifetime while achieving high packet delivery rate and low latency.
