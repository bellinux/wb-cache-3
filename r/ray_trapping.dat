40|$|In the {{geometrical}} optics approximation, stable and unstable manifolds of periodic orbits, invariant tori, and hyperbolic invariant manifolds are shown to exist and produce trapping of bundles of light rays near {{the axis of}} a translation-invariant, axisymmetric optical fiber whose squared refractive index is a parabolic function of squared radius. Periodic symmetry-breaking perturbations in the refractive index are shown to destroy this <b>ray</b> <b>trapping</b> and to produce homoclinic tangles, through which nearby trapped rays may escape, and untrapped rays may become at least temporarily trapped. Melnikov's technique is used {{to prove that the}} perturbations cause the stable and unstable manifolds of the unperturbed periodic orbits, invariant ori, and hyperbolic invariant manifolds to develop transverse intersections and therefore, to form homoclinic tangles. These tangles imply either homoclinic haos by the Smale horseshoe mechanism and the Poincar 6 -Birkhoff-Smale theorem, or Arnol'd diffusion. In both situations, lobe dynamics will dominate phase space transport, seen here as a flux of (initially) untrapped rays passing through the trapping region. 1...|$|E

The experiment {{was carried out}} in the evening hours when the electron density in the F-region dropped, and the HF pump frequency fH was near and then above the critical frequency of the F 2 layer. The distinctive feature of this experiment is that the pump frequency was just below the third electron gyro harmonic frequency, while both the HF pump beam and UHF radar beam were directed towards the magnetic zenith (MZ). The HF pump-induced phenomena were diagnosed with several instruments: the bi-static HF radio scatter on the London-Tromsø-St. Petersburg path, the CUTLASS radar in Hankasalmi (Finland), the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar at Tromsø and the Tromsø ionosonde (dynasonde). The results show thermal electron excitation of the HF-induced striations seen simultaneously from HF bi-static scatter and CUTLASS radar observations, accompanied by increases of electron temperature when the heater frequency was near and then above the critical frequency of the F 2 layer by up to 0. 4 MHz. An increase of the electron density up to 25 % accompanied by strong HF-induced electron heating was observed, only when the heater frequency was near the critical frequency and just below the third electron gyro harmonic frequency.

40|$|During October 1989, {{three very}} {{energetic}} flares were ejected {{by the same}} active region at longitudes 9 deg E, 32 deg W, and 57 deg W, respectively. The shape of the galactic cosmic ray variations suggests the presence of large magnetic cloud structures (Nagashima et al., 1990) following the shock-associated perturbations. In spite of long data gaps the interplanetary observations at Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) 8 (near the Earth) and International Cometary Explorer (ICE) (approximately 1 AU, approximately 65 deg W) confirm this possibility for the event related to the 9 deg E flare; the principal axes analysis shows that the interplanetary magnetic field variations at both spacecraft locations are mainly confined on a meridian plane. This result suggests that the western longitudinal extension of this cloud is indeed very large (greater {{than or equal to}} 5 deg). The nonnegligible depression in the cosmic ray intensity observed inside the possible cloud related to the 57 deg W flare indicates that also the eastern extension could be very wide. The analysis of neutron monitor data shows clearly the cosmic <b>ray</b> <b>trapping</b> effect of magnetic clouds; this mechanism seems to be responsible for the enhanced diurnal effect often observed during the recovery phase of Forbush decreases. We give an interpretation for the anisotropic cosmic ray peak occurring in the third event, and, related to that, we suggest that the Forbush decrease modulated region at the Earth's orbit could be somewhat wider than the magnetic cloud, as already anticipated by Nagashima et al. (1990).

40|$|We express {{classical}} Hamiltonian ray optics {{for light}} rays in axisymmetric f bers as a Lie-Poisson dynamical system defined in R 3, {{regarded as the}} dual of the Lie algebra sp(2, •). The ray-tracing dynamics i interpreted geometrically as motion in ~ 3 along the intersections of two-dimensional level surfaces of the conserved optical Hamiltonian and the skewness invariant (the analog of angular momentum, conserved because of the axisymmetry of the medium). In this geometrical picture, a Hamiltonian level surface is a vertically oriented cylinder whose cross section describes the radial profile of the refractive index, and a level surface of the skewness function is a hyperboloid ofrevolution around a horizontal axis. Points of tangency of these surfaces are equilibria, which are stable when the Gaussian curvature of the Hamiltonian level surface (constrained by the skewness function) is negative definite at the equilibrium point. Examples are discussed for various radial profiles of the refractive index. This discussion places optical ray tracing in fibers into the geometrical setting of Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian dynamics and {{provides an example of}} optical <b>ray</b> <b>trapping</b> within separatrices (homoclinic orbits). 1. Optical phase space The phase space of geometrical optics is four-dimensional. Referred to a standard planar screen, a ray is determined by two position coor-dinates q = (qx, qy) defining its intersection with the screen, and two momentum coordinates p = (Px, Py) that cue the projection onto the screen of a three-vector ff tangent o the ray, whose length n(q) is the refractive index of the medium at that point. See fig. 1. Only rays perpendicular to the optical axis cannot be parametrized in this man-ner. The coordinate normal to the screen, z, ex-tends along the optical axis.

LDEF completed 32, 422 orbits and carried 57 major experiments representing more than 200 investigators from 33 private companies, 21 universities and nine countries. The experiments covered a wide range of disciplines including basic science, electronics, optics, materials, structures and power and propulsion. A number of the experiments were specifically designed to measure the radiation environment. These experiments are of specific interest, since the LDEF orbit is essentially {{the same as that of}} the Space Station Freedom. Consequently, the radiation measurements on LDEF will play a significant role in the design of radiation shielding of the space station. The contributions of the various authors presented here attempt to predict the major aspects of the radiation exposure received by the various LDEF experiments and therefore should be helpful to investigators who are in the process of analyzing experiments which may have been affected by exposure to ionizing radiation.
