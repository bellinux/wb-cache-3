40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{a dynamic}} {{model of the}} PEMFC(polyelectrolyte {{membrane}} fuel cell) based on physical principles is built, {{in the form of}} a nonlinear statespace model. The Fuel Cell System (FCS) is a nonlinear system which is characterized by multiple variables and a strong coupling with profound dynamics. Therefore, it is difficult to apply control theory methods. For this reason, we have approximated the model of FCS by a Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy model with fuzzy defined regions where the nonlinear system is locally linearized. The dynamics considered are: air compressor, supply and <b>return</b> <b>manifold,</b> anode and cathode flow, humidifier, cooler and stack voltage. Simulation results show that nonlinear system of PEM fuel cell can be approximated by a TS fuzzy model based on nonlinear sectors. The simulations show also that the supply and <b>return</b> <b>manifold</b> pressures and temperatures have significant effects on the dynamics of the PEMFC...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} a {{high-order}} sliding-mode approach to the observer-based output feedback control of a PEM fuel cell system comprising a compressor, a supply manifold, the fuel-cell stack and the <b>return</b> <b>manifold.</b> The treatment {{is based on a}} lumped parameter nonlinear modeling of the PEM fuel cell system under study. The suggested scheme assumes the availability for measurements of readily accessible quantities such as the compressor angular velocity, the load current, and the supply and <b>return</b> <b>manifold</b> pressures. The control task is formulated in terms of regulating the oxygen excess ratio (which is estimated by a nonlinear, finite-time converging, high order sliding mode observer) to a suitable set-point value by using, as adjustable input variable, the compressor supply voltage. The proposed observer embeds an original synergic combination between second and third order sliding mode algorithms. The controller also uses a second order sliding mode algorithm complemented by a novel tuning procedure, supported by local linearization and frequency-domain arguments, which allows the designer to enforce a practical sliding mode regime with some pre-specified and user-defined characteristics. Thoroughly discussed simulations results certify the satisfactory performance of the proposed approach.

30|$|The {{dimensions}} of the horizon fuel cell stack are relatively small and the distances between the supply-return manifolds and anodes–cathodes of the fuel cells are small as well. Hence, {{it is assumed that}} the multiple cathodes in the stack are all lumped as one stack cathode volume, which represents the sum of volumes of each individual cathode’s volume in the stack. And the supply manifold of cathode s m lumps all the volumes of passages and connections between the inlet of air and the cathodes, while <b>return</b> <b>manifold</b> r m lumps all the volumes of passages and connections between the cathodes of the fuel cells and the exit of air of the fuel cell stack.|$|E

40|$|Achieving nearly {{uniform flow}} {{distributions}} in the accelerator production of tritium (APT) target structures {{is an important}} design objective. Manifold effects tend to cause a nonuniform distribution in flow systems of this type, although nearly even distribution can be achieved. A program of hydraulic experiments is underway to provide a database for validation of calculational methodologies {{that may be used}} for analyzing this problem and to evaluate the approach with the most promise for achieving a nearly even flow distribution. Data from the initial three tests are compared to predictions made using four calculational methods. The data show that optimizing the ratio of the supply-to-return-manifold areas can produce an almost even flow distribution in the APT ladder assemblies. The calculations compare well with the data for ratios of the supply-to-return-manifold areas spanning the optimum value. Thus, the results to date show that a nearly uniform flow distribution can be achieved by carefully sizing the supply and <b>return</b> <b>manifolds</b> and that the calculational methods available are adequate for predicting the distributions through a range of conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a scheme of designing finite-time high-order sliding mode (HOSM) observer which provides some essential requirements {{to be used}} in a sensorless control. The observer design technique is proposed to estimate some key states in a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) in a finite-time. Since variation of the load current deeply affects the life time of the cell, estimation and control of oxygen excess ratio (λO 2) is suggested to detect and prevent the damage. As a practical application, the observer reconstructs oxygen excess ratio using measurable variables, such as the compressor angular speed, the supply, the <b>return</b> <b>manifold</b> pressures and the load current. The estimation is performed to keep stability without need of any transformation to a canonical form in a finite time. The designed finite-time observer is shown with some increases in the response time indices, improves the accuracy whilst guarantees a fast convergence with respect to using flow sensors. Simulation results verify the achievements whilst signify the fast response as well as robust against uncertainties and disturbances...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{observed}} that in many optimization problems, nonsmooth objective functions often appear smooth on naturally arising manifolds. This {{has led to the}} development of optimization algorithms which attempt to exploit this smoothness. Many of these algorithms follow the same two-step pattern: first to predict a direction of decrease, and second to make a correction step to <b>return</b> to the <b>manifold.</b> In this article, we examine some of the theoretical components used in such predictor-corrector methods. We begin our examination under the minimal assumption that the restriction of the function to the manifold is smooth. At the second stage, we add the condition of 'partial smoothness' relative to the manifold. Finally, we examine the case when the function is both 'prox-regular' and partly smooth. In this final setting, we show that the proximal point mapping can be used to <b>return</b> to the <b>manifold,</b> and argue that returning in this manner is preferable to returning via the projection mapping. We finish by developing sufficient conditions for quadratic convergence of predictor-corrector methods using a proximal point correction step...|$|R

40|$|Bank {{leverage}} ratios {{have made}} an impressive and largely unopposed return; they are mostly used alongside risk-weighted capital requirements. The reasons for this <b>return</b> are <b>manifold,</b> {{and they are not}} limited to the fact that bank equity levels {{in the wake of the}} global financial crisis (GFC) were exceptionally thin, necessitating a string of costly bailouts. A number of other factors have been equally important; these include, among others, the world's revulsion with debt following the GFC and the eurozone crisis, and the universal acceptance of Hyman Minsky's insights into the nature of the financial system and its role in the real economy. The best examples of the causal link between excessive debt, asset bubbles, and financial instability are the Spanish and Irish banking crises, which resulted from nothing more sophisticated than straightforward real estate loans. Bank leverage ratios are primarily seen as a microprudential measure that intends to increase bank resilience. Yet in today's environment of excessive liquidity due to very low interest rates and quantitative easing, bank leverage ratios should also be viewed as a key part of the macroprudential framework. In this context, this paper discusses the role of leverage ratios as both microprudential and macroprudential measures. As such, it explains the role of the leverage cycle in causing financial instability and sheds light on the impact of leverage restraints on good bank governance and allocative efficiency...|$|R

From here to the DL (degenerate loop) point, in fact, the limit cycle disappears through a ‘big saddle-homoclinic’ bifurcation SHb (a saddle-homoclinic bifurcation is said ‘big’ if the saddle’s unstable <b>manifold</b> <b>returns</b> to the saddle along the other direction of the saddle’s stable manifold [17, 33], this implies here that the limit cycle encompasses the stable fixed point). After DL, the limit cycle is not able to reach the saddle anymore and coalesces with an unstable limit cycle on the fold limit cycles curve FLC. This unstable limit cycle, which is always enclosed by the stable one, can originate in two ways: from the subcritical branch of the Hopf curve or from the subcritical branch of SHb. The unstable limit cycle can also disappear before reaching the FLC curve, via a SNIC bifurcation, from SNLs [...]...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of the ITER fusion reactor is to effectively remove large amount of heat deposited {{to the surface of}} the plasma facing components. The tokamak cooling water system (TCWS) will accomplish the objective of removing about 1 GW of peak heat load from in-vessel components while maintaining pressures and temperatures of the coolant within acceptable and safe limits during different operational scenarios. A study of feasibility has been launched for the IBED PHTS (Integrated Blanket, Edge localized mode coils (ELMs) and Divertor Primary Heat Transfer System; it consists of five independent cooling trains (four operational and one in stand-by), one steam pressurizer, supply and <b>return</b> headers, ring <b>manifolds</b> and connections to the all in-vessel components (i. e. First Wall Blanket, Divertor, ELM, Diagnostics and other Ports clients). The dynamic behaviour of the IBED PHTS has been investigated by means of RELAP 5 ® code to simulate the response of the system during plasma pulse and baking operations. Due to the plasma heat deposition on the surfaces of the in-vessel components and subsequent increase in hot leg temperature, a large amount of water volume is transferred from the hot legs of the circuit to the surge-line of the pressurizer during each burn cycle. This causes rapid increase of pressure and temperature of the system and the following actions are proposed to counteract these variations: spray injection in the upper dome of the pressurizer from the Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS) to reduce the pressure and active control of flow rates through heat exchangers and their bypass loops to regulate the heat transfer from the primary system to the environment via secondary and tertiary loops. This paper focuses on the prediction of the thermal hydraulic behaviour of the IBED PHTS during plasma pulses and baking scenarios, describing the various activity of the analysis, the geometrical assessment of the circuit and the modelling with RELAP 5 ® code. The results have been compared with design and operational requirement. Possible strategies to enhance the system performances have been formulate...|$|R
