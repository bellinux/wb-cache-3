50|$|Dynamic braking {{is the use}} of the {{electric}} traction motors of a <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle</b> as generators when slowing the locomotive.

Dynamic braking lowers the wear of friction-based braking components, and additionally regeneration can also lower energy consumption. Dynamic braking can also be used on railcars with multiple units, light rail vehicles, trams and PCC streetcars.|$|E

40|$|A {{collision}} avoidance system for railroad vehicles needs to determine their location in the railroad network precisely and reliably. For a vehicle-based system, that is independent from the infrastructure, {{it is vital to}} determine the direction a <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle</b> turns at switches. In this paper a vision based approach is presented that allows to achieve this reliably, even under difficult conditions. In the images of a camera that observes the area in front of a <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle</b> the rail tracks are detected in real-time. From the perspective of the moving <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle</b> rail tracks branch and join from/to the currently travelled rail track. By tracking these rail tracks in the images, switches are detected as they are passed. It is shown that the followed track can be determined at branching switches. The approach is tested with real data from test rides in different locations and under a variety of weather conditions and environments. It proved to be very robust and of high practical use for track-selective self-localization of railroad vehicles, mandatory for {{collision avoidance}}. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of this investigation {{is to examine the}} results and demonstrate the valid-ity of a proposed multi-body <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle</b> system formulation that accounts for the dynamic coupling between three-dimensional (3 D) contact parameters and the rail structural flexibility. This formulation allows building complex trackmodels that include significant details at a finite-element preprocessing stage. The data of the detailed track model can be used as an input to a general purpose flexible multi-body computer program for a non-linear analysis that accounts for the dynamic coupling between the track flexibility, 3 D wheel–rail contact, and the vehicle dynamics. The simulations are performed using the methods of multi-body system dynam-ics that employ 3 D wheel–rail contact methodology capable of finding the wheel–rail contact points online. The effect of the structural flexibility of the rails is included in the equations of motion using the finite-element floating frame of reference formulation. While this formula-tion allows for an arbitrary reference displacement for the track, this reference displacement is constrained {{in order to be able}} to compare the results with those results obtained using simplified approaches.

40|$|Detection {{of vehicle}} {{position}} {{is critical for}} successful operation of intelligent transportation system. In case of railroad transportation systems, position information of railroad vehicles can be detected by GPS, track circuits, and so on. In this paper, position detection based on tags onto sleepers of the track is investigated. Position information stored in the tags is read by a reader placed {{at the bottom of}} running <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Due to limited capacity of battery or its alternative in the tags, power required for transmission of position information to the reader is harvested by the tags from the power wirelessly transferred from the reader. Basic mechanism in wireless power transfer is magnetic induction and power transfer efficiency according to the relative location of the reader to a tag is discussed with simulation results. Since power transfer efficiency is significantly affected by the ferromagnetic material (steel) {{at the bottom of the}} <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the track, magnetic beam shaping by ferrite material is carried out. With the ferrite material for magnetic beam shaping, degradation of power transfer efficiency due to the steel is substantially reduced. Based on the experimental results, successful wireless power transfer to the tag coil is possible when transmitted power from the reader coil is close to a few watts.

40|$|Artículos en revistasThe {{objective}} of this investigation {{is to develop a}} low order continuum-based liquid sloshing model that can be successfully integrated with multibody system (MBS) algorithms. The liquid sloshing model proposed in this investigation allows for capturing the effect of the distributed inertia and viscosity of the fluid. The fluid viscous forces are defined using the Navier-Stokes equations. In order to demonstrate the use of the approach presented in this study, the assumption of an incompressible Newtonian fluid is considered with a total Lagrangian approach. Fluid properties such as the incompressibility condition are formulated using a penalty method. The low order model that captures the effect of the distributed fluid inertia on the vehicle dynamics is developed in this investigation using the floating frame reference (FFR) formulation. The use of this approach allows for developing an inertia-variant fluid model that accounts for the dynamic coupling between different modes of the fluid displacements. The matrix of position vector gradients and its derivative are formulated using the FFR kinematic description. The position and velocity gradient tensors are used to define the Navier-Stokes stress forces. The proposed liquid sloshing model is integrated with a MBS <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle</b> model in which the rail/wheel interaction is formulated using a 3 D elastic contact formulation that allows for the wheel/rail separation. Several simulation scenarios are used to examine the effect of the distributed liquid inertia on the motion of the <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The results, obtained using the sloshing model, are compared with the results obtained using a rigid body vehicle model. The comparative numerical study presented in this investigation shows that the effect of the sloshing tends to increase the possibility of wheel/rail separation as the forward velocity increases, thereby increasing the possibility of derailments at these relatively high speeds. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} issues {{associated with the use}} of trajectory coordinates in <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle</b> dynamic algorithms is the ability of such coordinates to deal with braking and traction scenarios. In these algorithms, track coordinate systems that travel with constant speeds are introduced. As a result of using a prescribed motion for these track coordinate systems, the simulation of braking and/or traction scenarios becomes difficult or even impossible. The assumption of the prescribed motion of the track coordinate systems can be relaxed, thereby allowing the trajectory coordinates to be effectively used in modelling braking and traction dynamics. One of the objectives of this investigation is to demonstrate that by using track coordinate systems that can have an arbitrary motion, the trajectory coordinates can be used as the basis for developing computer algorithms for modelling braking and traction conditions. To this end, a set of six generalized trajectory coordinates is used to define the configuration of each rigid body in the <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle</b> system. This set of coordinates consists of an arc length that represents the distance travelled by the body, and five relative coordinates that define the configuration of the body with respect to its track coordinate system. The independent non-linear state equations of motion associated with the trajectory coordinates are identified and integrated forward in time in order to determine the trajectory coordinates and velocities. The results obtained in this study show that when the track coordinate systems are allowed to have an arbitrary motion, the resulting set of trajectory coordinates can be used effectively in the study of braking and traction conditions. The results obtained using the trajectory coordinates are compared with the results obtained using the absolute Cartesian-coordinate-based formulations, which allow modelling braking and traction dynamics. In addition to this numerical validation of the trajectory coordinate formulation in braking scenarios, an experimental validation is also conducted using a roller test rig. The comparison presented in this study shows a good agreement between the obtained experimental and numerical results...|$|E

40|$|Today, {{the term}} cyber-physical {{modelling}} systems refers to models which combine control and controlled systems. These models are very useful, since they closely reproduce {{the architecture of}} the systems to be modelled: the “cyber” part is the control system; the “physical” part is the controlled system. Modelica is a standard language for modelling systems in a cyber-physical way. Its usage brings the additional bonus of being a standard, and therefore models can in principle be run by any Modelica-capable tool. Modelica is conceived from the ground-up to allow hierarchical description of systems, and hybrid continuous-time or discrete time simulations.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the state of}} the current activities to develop a high-speed inspection system for evaluating rail defects. Since conventional contact ultrasonic techniques are speed limited, the aim was to build an automatic inspection system, which applies non-contact ultrasonic methods. An automatic Laser Ultrasonic system for Rail Inspection (LURI) has been developed and tested on a railroad line containing man-made structural defects. LURI is mounted on a specially designed <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle</b> and allows detection of defects on the running surface of the rail, as well as, horizontal and vertical flaws in the railhead. LURI is tested in the field up to 40 km/h (25 mph). In order to support LURI, a battery-operated ultrasonic rail flaw detector based on the P-scan Lite system was developed and tested. Introduction: Efforts to improve the safety and efficiency of railways have generated new NDT techniques to verify defects in rails. Especially ultrasonic methods have been developed for many years. In these methods ultrasonic beams are sent into the rail and scattered from defects and the rail itself. These measurements can detect the presence of a variety of defects but as the inspection speed increases there are practical problems wit...|$|E
40|$|Contact {{between the}} wheel and rail can have a {{significant}} effect on the dynamics of vehicle/track interaction models. Many existing rail surface models rely on curve based geometry which may lead to some geometric inaccuracy in the case of variable cross-section rails. This investigation will focus on the development of a new spatial geometry based rail surface description which reduces this geometric inaccuracy. It has been shown in literature that certain CAD geometry types, such as B-Spline curves and surfaces, may be converted to equivalent absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) finite elements without a loss of geometric accuracy. To this end, a new ANCF surface description of variable cross-section rails is developed. This investigation also demonstrates the feasibility of using, in the future, 3 D surface scanning techniques as well as profile curve measurements to develop a rail surface geometry model using the new ANCF surface which can be systematically integrated with complex multibody system (MBS) models. A realistic <b>railroad</b> <b>vehicle</b> example of a turnout, which includes variable cross-section rails, is tested for the case of the new ANCF surface.
