500|$|... "Porcelain" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Moby for his fifth studio album Play (1999) and recorded in his Little Italy, Manhattan apartment. He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, <b>really</b> <b>wonderful</b> woman, and I loved her very much. But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} but knowing you shouldn't be with them." [...] Moby initially disliked the track, criticizing his production as [...] "mushy" [...] and his vocals as [...] "really weak". He had dismissed [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "average" [...] and later recalled that he [...] "couldn't imagine anyone else wanting to listen to it" [...] – however, he was eventually talked into including it on Play.|$|E

[...] She described the relationship as [...] "a <b>really</b> <b>wonderful</b> friendship" [...] where they would dance and [...] "talk on the phone all the time." [...] She recalled that he found it funny that she could drive at 12 and he couldn't. And that one time they had a [...] "jam session" [...] at her house where he played the drums and her brother played guitar. She said the relationship ended when she was 12, after {{he asked her to}} go to the premiere of The Wiz with him, but her agent disapproved, [...] "maybe because they thought he wasn't a big enough star yet", and she did what she was told because she was a child. [...] While she claimed they never spoke after that, they were actually shown to be together a number of times after this would have happened.|$|E
500|$|Following the government's refusal, {{a private}} trust {{was formed to}} {{campaign}} for the ship's preservation. The HMS Belfast Trust was established; its chairman was Rear-Admiral Sir Morgan Morgan-Giles, captain of Belfast from January 1961 to July 1962. As Member of Parliament (MP) for Winchester, Morgan-Giles addressed the House of Commons on 8 March 1971. He described Belfast as being in [...] "a <b>really</b> <b>wonderful</b> state of preservation" [...] and that saving her for the nation represented a [...] "case of grasping the last opportunity". Among the MPs who spoke in support of Morgan-Giles was Gordon Bagier, MP for Sunderland South, {{who served as a}} Royal Marine gunner aboard Belfast and was present at both the sinking of Scharnhorst and the Normandy landings. Speaking for the government, the Under-secretary for the Navy, Peter Michael Kirk, said that Belfast was [...] "one of the most historic ships which the Navy has had in the last 20 years", but that he could not prevent the stripping of the ship's removable equipment, as this was already too far advanced to be halted. He did, however, agree to postpone any decision on the scrapping of Belfast to allow the Trust to put together a formal proposal.|$|E

Citygarden competed for the $10,000 prize against Portland, Oregon's Director Park and Jamison Square, as well as Discovery Green and the Raymond and Susan Brochstein Pavilion of Houston, Texas. The institute said that Citygarden [...] "draws on St. Louis' chief natural feature—its rivers... has attracted diverse users, catalyzed nearby development, and changed perceptions of downtown. Situated on two blocks of the underutilized Gateway Mall, the active sculpture garden has drawn an estimated one million visitors since its opening."

500|$|The {{formulation}} of Russell as an Asian American character, {{along with the}} casting of an Asian American in the role was met positively as well. Both Nagai and the film were awarded by the East West Players for the depiction of Russell. EWP lauded Pixar {{for the creation of}} the character, stating, [...] "We are proud to honor a very progressive film company like Pixar who cast an Asian American character alongside an elderly one to play the leads in a feature film." [...] The character is noted as Pixar's first lead Asian character, and was further positively received within the added context of historical non-Asian castings for Asian roles in entertainment. Asian American organizations and entertainment websites, such as media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA), Racebending.com, and Angry Asian Man praised the character and Pixar for its diverse character depictions, noting the general lack of Asian American lead characters and Asian actors cast in entertainment. In an interview with NPR in 2013, Angry Asian Mans Phil Yu reflected on the character's lack of typical Asian stereotyping, stating, [...] "You know, he just happens to be Asian and he's, you know, really adorable character. But that kid could've been of any ethnicity but they made the effort to make him Asian - just a little color, you know, and it's <b>really</b> <b>wonderful</b> when that kind of thing happens where they don't have to play that up and make it like a thing or a joke, which happens a lot." ...|$|E

I understand Miller's need to re-invent, but this is just badly done and in poor taste." [...] Robinson commented that [...] "the art by Jim Lee is first rate [...] <b>really</b> <b>wonderful</b> to look at, [...] Frank Miller has stripped Batman of all of his dignity, class, and honor. This isn't the Dark Knight; this is Dirty Harry in a cowl. The worst part is that this is exactly what Batman isn't about."

Amos herself has described the album as a novel, as a [...] "story of the descent of a woman to gain her passion and gain her compassion," [...] chronicling a woman's self-discovery in a male-dominated world, looking for fragments of herself and being suppressed. Songs such as [...] "Blood Roses," [...] "Caught a Lite Sneeze", [...] "Hey Jupiter," [...] "Doughnut Song" [...] and [...] "Putting the Damage On" [...] deal directly with the aftermath of a break-up and a woman's reflection on the failed relationship.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2003 American {{music critic}} Jim DeRogatis {{solidified}} the band’s credibility by inviting Titanic to be {{a guest on}} the radio show Sound Opinions.

Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouettés, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of {{whatever}} dance shots they needed." [...] In addition, Portman {{said in an interview with}} MSN: [...] "I did everything, and the dance double — Sarah Lane, who's a <b>really</b> <b>wonderful</b> dancer — they shot us both doing everything, but because most of the film is in close-up, they're able to use me. The parts I couldn't do were because it's doing very complicated turns en pointe. They would shoot me doing it in flat shoes and Sarah doing it in pointe shoes and find a way to make that work." [...] She also stated in a November 2010 interview with WBUR that [...] "there's a wonderful dancer, Sarah Lane, who did the more complicated pointe work. But I did the stuff that was possible to learn in a year." ...|$|E

[...] She became Lady Annabel as a young girl in February 1949 when her father became Marquess on the death of his father, the famous Ulster Unionist politician the 7th Marquess of Londonderry. Her mother died of cancer in 1951, but the illness was kept a secret by her parents. [...] She later said, [...] "Cancer was such a taboo then – Mummy didn't even tell her sisters."

[...] "My father was a <b>really</b> <b>wonderful</b> man but after my mother died, we couldn't talk to him as we had done before.

2500|$|The British Army drew {{many of its}} raw {{recruits}} {{from the}} lowest classes of Britain. Since army life {{was known to be}} harsh, and the remuneration low, it attracted mainly those for whom civilian life was worse. The Duke of Wellington himself said that many of the men [...] "enlist from having got bastard children – some for minor offences – some for drink". They were, he once said, [...] "the scum of the earth; it is <b>really</b> <b>wonderful</b> that we should have made them to the fine fellows they are." [...] In Scotland however, a number of men enlisted due to the collapse of the weaving trade and came from skilled artisan or even middle-class households. Most soldiers at the time signed on for life in exchange for a [...] "bounty" [...] of £2317s6d, a lot of which was absorbed by the cost of outfitting [...] "necessities", but a system of 'limited service' (seven years for infantry, ten for cavalry and artillery) was introduced in 1806 to attract recruits. Soldiers began, from 1800 onward, to receive a daily Beer money allowance in addition to their regular wages; the practice was started on the orders of the Duke of York. Additionally, corporal punishment was removed for a large number of petty offences (while it was still retained for serious derelictions of duty) and the Shorncliffe System for light infantry was established in 1803, teaching skirmishing, self-reliance and initiative. Unlike other armies of the time, the British did not use conscription to bolster army numbers, with enlistment remaining voluntary.|$|E
