25|$|To {{find the}} wire's torsion coefficient, the torque exerted by the wire {{for a given}} angle of twist, Cavendish timed the natural {{oscillation}} period of the balance <b>rod</b> <b>as</b> it rotated slowly clockwise and counterclockwise against the twisting of the wire. The period was about 20 minutes. The torsion coefficient could be calculated from this and the mass and dimensions of the balance. Actually, the rod was never at rest; Cavendish had to measure the deflection angle of the rod while it was oscillating.|$|E
25|$|This {{arrangement}} {{allows the}} field to effectively be turned on and off above or below {{the plane of the}} rods, depending on the rotation of the rods. Such a device makes an efficient mechanical magnetic latch requiring no power. A detailed study of this arrangement has shown that each rod is subject to a strong torque from its neighboring rods, and therefore requires mechanical stabilization. However, a simple and efficient solution, providing both stabilization and the ability to rotate each rod alternately, is simply to provide an equal gearing arrangement on each <b>rod,</b> <b>as</b> shown in the figure.|$|E

25|$|Fig. 2-9 {{illustrates}} {{the motions of}} a 1nbsp&m rod that is traveling at 0.5nbsp&c along the x axis. The edges of the blue band represent the world lines of the rod's two endpoints. The invariant hyperbola illustrates events separated from the origin by a spacelike interval of 1nbsp&m. The endpoints O and B measured when nbsp&=nbsp&0 are simultaneous events in the S′ frame. But to an observer in frame S, events O and B are not simultaneous. To measure length, the observer in frame S measures the endpoints of the <b>rod</b> <b>as</b> projected onto the x-axis along their world lines. The projection of the rod's world sheet onto the x axis yields the foreshortened length OC.|$|E
25|$|On modern yachts, {{standing}} rigging is often {{stainless steel wire}}, stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber. Semi-rigid stainless steel wire {{is by far the}} most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when swaging fittings onto stainless steel <b>rod</b> <b>as</b> this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|E
2500|$|Action, however, is {{also often}} a {{subjective}} {{description of a}} manufacturer. Very often action is misused to note the bending curve instead of the speed. Some manufacturers list the power value of the <b>rod</b> <b>as</b> its action. A [...] "medium" [...] action bamboo rod may have a faster action than a [...] "fast" [...] fibreglass rod. Action is also subjectively used by anglers, as an angler might compare a given <b>rod</b> <b>as</b> [...] "faster" [...] or [...] "slower" [...] than a different rod.|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{the public}} {{ceremonial}} mirrored that of the British Houses of Parliament. Sessions were formally opened by a Speech from the Throne by the Lord Lieutenant, who [...] "used to sit, surrounded by more splendour than His Majesty on the throne of England". The Sovereign's official representative, when {{he sat on the}} Throne, sat beneath a canopy of crimson velvet. As in the English and British parliaments, the House of Lords was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sat on the Woolsack, a large seat stuffed with wool from each of the three kingdoms, England, Ireland and Scotland. Wool was seen as a symbol of economic success and wealth. At the State Opening of Parliament, Members of Parliament were summoned from the nearby House of Commons chamber by White <b>Rod,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to Black Rod in Westminster, both of Gaelic Origin), a royal official who would [...] "command the members on behalf of His Excellency to attend him in the chamber of peers".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the initial}} {{installation}} {{would remain in}} operation, the additional antenna spokes and alternator installations would not be completed, due to a major discovery about radio signal propagation. While investigating transmitter [...] "harmonics" [...] – unwanted additional radio signals produced at higher frequencies than a station's normal transmission frequency – Westinghouse's Frank Conrad unexpectedly found {{that in some cases}} the harmonics could be heard farther than the primary signal, something previously thought impossible, as high-frequency shortwave signals, which had poor groundwave coverage, were thought to have a very limited transmission range. In 1924, Conrad demonstrated to Sarnoff that a low-powered shortwave station in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania could be readily received in London by a simple receiver using a curtain <b>rod</b> <b>as</b> an antenna, matching, at {{a small fraction of the}} cost, the performance of the massive alternator transmitters. In 1926 Dr. Harold H. Beverage further reported that a shortwave signal, transmitted on a 15-meter wavelength (approximately 20MHz), was received in South America more readily during the daytime than the 200 kilowatt alternator transmissions.|$|E

2500|$|The type of cast {{used when}} fishing varies {{according}} to the conditions. The most common cast is the forward cast, where the angler whisks the fly into the air, back over the shoulder until the line is nearly straight, then forward, using primarily the forearm. The objective of this motion is to [...] "load" [...] (bend) the rod tip with stored energy, then transmit that energy to the line, resulting in the fly line (and the attached fly) being cast for an appreciable distance. However, just bending the rod and releasing it to jerk the fly line forward (like a bowstring or a catapult) will not propel the fly line and fly very far. More important is {{the movement of the}} rod through an arc acting as a lever, magnifying the hand movement of the caster (of about a foot) to an arc at the rod tip of several feet. Here the rod acts as a lever. In fact, one of the Class 3 types of lever, where The force is applied between the fulcrum and the load (like tweezers). The fulcrum in the fly cast is below the caster's hand gripping the rod; the load is at the rod tip; between the hand exerts the force. The caster's [...] "stroke" [...] backwards and forwards, for the backcast and the forward cast, operates the <b>rod</b> <b>as</b> a (slightly flexible) lever. Casting without landing the fly on the water is known as 'false casting', and may be used to pay out line, to dry a soaked fly, or to reposition a cast. Other casts are the roll cast, the single- or double-haul, the tuck cast, and the side- or curve-cast.|$|E

60|$|A Priori it {{is quite}} clear that we {{must be able to}} learn {{something}} about the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the equations of transformation, for the magnitudes z, y, x, t, are nothing more nor less than the results of measurements obtainable by means of measuring-rods and clocks.
