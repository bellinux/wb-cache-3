5|$|Folding@home is {{also used}} to study protein chaperones, heat shock {{proteins}} which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the crowded and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in chemotherapy resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of cancer. Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells. Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme Src kinase, and some forms of the engrailed homeodomain: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small knottin protein EETI, which can identify carcinomas in imaging scans by binding to surface receptors of cancer cells.|$|E

2500|$|Restoration {{is used as}} a {{tool for}} <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of {{invasive}} plant species in a number of ways. The first method views restoration primarily as a means to reduce the presence of invasive species and limit their spread. [...] As this approach emphasizes control of invaders, the restoration techniques can differ from typical restoration projects. The goal of such projects is not necessarily to restore an entire ecosystem or habitat. These projects frequently use lower diversity mixes of aggressive native species seeded at high density. These projects frequently use lower diversity mixes of aggressive native species seeded at high density. They are not always actively managed following seeding. The target areas for this type of restoration are those which are heavily dominated by invasive species. The goals are to first remove the species and then in so doing, reduce the number of invasive seeds being spread to surrounding areas. This approach {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing weeds, although it is not always a sustainable solution long term without additional weed control, such as mowing, or re-seeding.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{advantage}} of heavy water moderator over light {{water is the}} reduced absorption of the neutrons that sustain the chain reaction, allowing a lower concentration of active atoms (to the point of using unenriched natural uranium fuel). Deuterium ("heavy hydrogen") already has the extra neutron that light hydrogen would absorb, reducing the tendency to capture neutrons. Deuterium is twice the mass of a single neutron (vs light hydrogen {{which is about the}} same mass); the mismatch means more collisions are needed to moderate the neutrons, requiring a larger thickness of moderator between the fuel rods. This increases the size of the reactor core and the leakage of neutrons. It is also the practical reason for the calandria design, otherwise, a very large pressure vessel would be needed. The low 235U density in natural uranium also implies that less of the fuel will be consumed before the fission rate drops too low to sustain criticality, because the ratio of 235U to fission products+238U is lower. In CANDU most of the moderator is at lower temperatures than in other designs, <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of speeds and the overall speed of the moderator particles. This means most of the neutrons will end up at a lower energy and be more likely to cause fission, so CANDU not only [...] "burns" [...] natural uranium, but it does so more effectively as well. Overall, CANDU reactors use 30â€“40% less mined uranium than light-water reactors per unit of electricity produced. This is a major advantage to the heavy water design; it not only requires less fuel, but as the fuel {{does not have to be}} enriched, it is much less expensive as well.|$|E
