5|$|Although {{she was a}} {{previously}} published novelist and had a successful Broadway play, Rand had difficulty finding a publisher for The Fountainhead. Macmillan Publishing, which had published We the Living, <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> book after Rand insisted they provide more publicity for her new novel than they had done for the first one. Rand's agent began submitting the book to other publishers; in 1938, Knopf signed a contract to publish the book. When Rand was only a quarter done with the manuscript by October 1940, Knopf canceled her contract. Several other publishers <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> book. When Rand's agent began to criticize the novel, Rand fired the agent and decided to handle submissions herself. Twelve publishers (including Macmillan and Knopf) <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> book.|$|E

50|$|Whereas {{transplant}} rejection {{occurs when}} <b>the</b> host <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> graft, GvHD occurs when <b>the</b> graft <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> host. The underlying principle (alloimmunity) is the same, but {{the details and}} course may differ.|$|R
5000|$|A {{consular}} officer may <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> beneficiary's visa application without returning the petition to the USCIS. This {{is because the}} {{consular officer}} has many potential grounds for <b>rejecting</b> <b>the</b> application without calling {{the legitimacy of the}} petition in question. For instance, the consular officer may <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> application using Section 214(b), failure to establish non-immigrant intent.|$|R
5|$|A United Nations {{report in}} April 1998 raised {{concerns}} about the violation of individual rights posed by sect filters. However, it <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> comparison of the treatment of Scientologists with that of Jews during the Nazi era.|$|E
5|$|According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad was {{attacked}} {{by the people of}} Ta'if and was badly injured.

It is said that Muhammad <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> offer and prayed for the guidance of the people of Ta'if.|$|E
5|$|An-112KC: A {{proposed}} {{aerial refueling}} {{version of the}} An-70, except with two jet engines from the team of U.S. Aerospace and Antonov for the U.S. Air Force's KC-X program. The USAF <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> proposal, and the appeal was later dismissed.|$|E

Din (2015), <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> beneficiary's visa application on claims of connections to terrorism, without the legitimacy of the Form I-130 approval being called in question.|$|R
5000|$|Dissenting opinion: {{the opinion}} of a single judge or judges that <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> {{conclusions}} of the majority decision {{in whole or in}} part, and explains <b>the</b> reasons for <b>rejecting</b> <b>the</b> majority decision.|$|R

5|$|Councils {{from across}} the West Midlands in the United Kingdom, {{including}} Birmingham and Coventry, <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> idea of imposing congestion pricing schemes on the area in 2008, despite promises from central government of transport project funding {{in exchange for the}} implementation of a road pricing pilot scheme.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1836, Congress {{proposed}} a compromise whereby Michigan gave up its claim to the strip in exchange for its statehood and approximately three-quarters of the Upper Peninsula. The compromise was considered a poor outcome for Michigan. Voters in a state convention in September soundly <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> proposal.|$|E
40|$|Retribution enjoys an unwarranted appeal {{from the}} public and its politicians. This is because it is {{impractical}} and perhaps even incoherent. This {{does not mean that}} we should <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> importance of morality for criminal justice nor should we <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> link between desert and proportionality. Nevertheless, we can <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> way retribution has understood these ideas in defense of a more plausible and compelling alternative...|$|R
25|$|Such {{bands are}} {{sometimes}} <b>rejected</b> by <b>the</b> CCM rock scene and may specifically <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> CCM label.|$|R
50|$|In {{the picture}} above we can <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> null {{hypothesis}} {{that there is}} no autocorrelation between time-points which are adjacent (lag = 1). For the other periods one cannot <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.|$|R
5|$|George {{inherited}} the throne at a politically turbulent time. Lloyd George's People's Budget had been <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> previous {{year by the}} Conservative and Unionist-dominated House of Lords, contrary to the normal convention that the Lords did not veto money bills. Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith had asked the previous king to give an undertaking that he would create sufficient Liberal peers to force the budget through the House. Edward had reluctantly agreed, provided the Lords <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> budget after two successive general elections. After a general election in January 1910, the Conservative peers allowed the budget, for which the government now had an electoral mandate, to pass without a vote.|$|E
5|$|Having earlier <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> Western-led {{environmentalist}} movement, China {{changed its}} stance in the 1980s {{and became a}} party to the CITES treaty. By 1993 it had banned the trade in tiger parts, and this diminished the use of tiger bones in traditional Chinese medicine.|$|E
5|$|His new {{alphabet}} closely resembled an 1853 {{publication of}} Isaac Pitman, containing only 33 letters. However, at this point, Young was still enamored {{with the original}} Deseret alphabet, and so he <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> proposal and Watt continued to publicly promote the alphabet {{as part of his}} job despite his reservations.|$|E
5000|$|In 1562 Stanisław Paklepka and Gregory Paul of Brzeziny <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> {{doctrine}} of the Trinity as a [...] "papal" [...] concept, without Biblical support. On 2 April, a majority approve of a synodal creed <b>rejecting</b> <b>the</b> Trinity.|$|R
3000|$|... 7 We can <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> {{hypothesis}} that {{the means of the}} two distributions are the same (t= 23.54). Given the sample sizes, we cannot <b>reject</b> <b>the</b> {{hypothesis that}} the variance of the distribution was unchanged over this period.|$|R
50|$|The {{classical}} realism {{theory of}} international relations only considers the high politics as relevant and completely <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> low politics.

5|$|In 2010, {{writer and}} {{researcher}} Bea Uusma at Karolinska institutet, Sweden, <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> theory that larvae of Trichinella spiralis killed the expedition members. After examining the men's clothes, she concluded {{that at least}} Strindberg was killed by polar bears.|$|E
5|$|In June 2005, {{former manager}} Gérard Houllier, then with French club Lyon, made an {{approach}} to sign Baroš.

He left Liverpool with league figures of 19 goals in 68 appearances.|$|E
5|$|In October 2005, Kaczynski {{offered to}} donate two rare books to the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies at Northwestern University's campus in Evanston, Illinois, the {{location}} of his first two attacks. Northwestern <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> offer.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary liberal Christians {{may prefer}} to read Jesus' miracles as metaphorical {{narratives}} {{for understanding the}} power of God.

5|$|In early May, {{the mine}} owners met {{with representatives of}} the WFM in Colorado Springs in an attempt to end the strike. The owners offered to return to the eight-hour day, but at a daily wage of only $2.75. The union <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> offer and talks broke down.|$|E
5|$|Le Règne Animal was {{influential}} in being widely read, and in presenting accurate descriptions of groups of related animals, {{such as the}} living elephants and the extinct mammoths, providing convincing evidence for evolutionary change to readers including Charles Darwin, although Cuvier himself <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> possibility of evolution.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2008, the Sonics' {{ownership}} group {{gave the}} city of Seattle a one-day deadline to accept a $26.5million offer that would buy out the Sonics' lease in KeyArena and pay off what the ownership group claimed was the value of debts on the arena.
