It can recover and <b>store</b> <b>regenerative</b> energy produced by braking a motion generator with intermittent rotary velocity such as the rotor of a wind turbogenerator subject to intermittent intake wind and the axels of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles during frequent coasting and braking.

50|$|In Formula One, the Kinetic energy {{recovery}} system (KERS) functions {{in a similar}} manner; however, it relies on <b>regenerative</b> braking to <b>store</b> energy for later use, rather than simply increasing the engine's power, {{as is the case}} in some other systems. The Drag reduction system or DRS, by contrast, increases acceleration and top speed by moving an element of the rear wing to reduce drag rather than by boosting power; its usage in races is more restricted.|$|R
50|$|Series-hybrids can {{be fitted}} with a {{supercapacitor}} or a flywheel to <b>store</b> <b>regenerative</b> braking energy, which can improve efficiency by recovering energy otherwise lost as heat through the braking system. Because a series-hybrid has no mechanical link between the ICE and the wheels, the engine can run at a constant and efficient rate regardless of vehicle speed, achieving higher efficiency (37%, rather than the ICE average of 20%) and at low or mixed speeds this could result in ~50% increase in overall efficiency (19% vs 29%).|$|R

The proposed system must work accurately based on flowchart shown in Fig.  3 and track the reference values of state variables, [...] I_L_ 1 ^* = 1 A (buck), [...] I_L_ 1 ^* = 20 A (boost), [...] I_L_ 2 ^* = 2 A, [...] V_dc^* = 500 V and [...] V_uc^* = 30 V.|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{signaling}} {{results from}} a complex interplay between activation and inactivation of intracellular and extracellular calcium permeable channels. This complexity is obvious from the pattern of calcium signals observed with modest, physiological concentrations of calcium-mobilizing agonists, which typically present as sequential <b>regenerative</b> discharges of <b>stored</b> calcium, a process referred to as calcium oscillations. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the underlying mechanism of calcium oscillations {{through the power of}} mathematical modeling. We also summarize recent findings on the role of calcium entry through store-operated channels in sustaining calcium oscillations and in the mechanism by which calcium oscillations couple to downstream effectors. © 2011 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

40|$|SummaryWhen {{cells are}} {{activated}} by calcium-mobilizing agonists at low, physiological concentrations, the resulting calcium signals generally {{take the form}} of repetitive <b>regenerative</b> discharges of <b>stored</b> calcium, termed calcium oscillations [1]. These intracellular calcium oscillations have long fascinated biologists as a mode of digitized intracellular signaling. Recent work has highlighted the role of calcium influx as an essential component of calcium oscillations [2]. This influx occurs through a process known as store-operated calcium entry, which is initiated by calcium sensor proteins, STIM 1 and STIM 2, in the endoplasmic reticulum [3]. STIM 2 is activated by changes in endoplasmic reticulum calcium near the resting level, whereas a threshold of calcium depletion is required for STIM 1 activation [4]. Here we show that, surprisingly, it is STIM 1 and not STIM 2 that is exclusively involved in calcium entry during calcium oscillations. The implication is that each oscillation produces a transient drop in endoplasmic reticulum calcium and that this drop is sufficient to transiently activate STIM 1. This transient activation of STIM 1 can be observed in some cells by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This arrangement nicely provides a clearly defined and unambiguous signaling system, translating a digital calcium release signal into calcium influx that can signal to downstream effectors...|$|R

40|$|Environmental factors {{influencing}} {{the cultivation of}} many economically important marine algae are not well understood. Cultivation problems are being encountered in the growing of various algae in artificial algal beds or on man-made farming structures. It is necessary to study these cultivation problems under controlled conditions {{in order to understand}} and solve them. Aspects of Eucheuma uncinatum as a model organism for cultivation were studied in the laboratory and in a greenhouse. Gradients of different environmental factors, such as light, temperature, salinity, and nutrients, were created in the laboratory and in outdoor water tanks. Plants were exposed both to single gradients and cross qradients and their qrowth and morphology were monitored. Plants with different morpholoqies developed under different experimental conditions. High light levels (1500 uEm- 2 sec - 1) caused large light yellow-brown plants to develop, which became dark red when light levels were reduced. Younq germlings reacted in a similar manner at light levels an order of magnitude lower. Temperatures of 29 - 31 °C caused growth of small, fuzzy plants which were dark red and brittle. The best growth (80. 5 % increase in wet weight per week) occur at 17 - 23 °C, with light levels of 1000 - 1500 uEm- sec- 1, and nitrogen above 30 uqat/ 1 and 30 - 35 ppt salinity, all accompanied by	active water motion. Transport of substances was 	demonstrated, with translocation occurinq throughout the organism at speeds of up to 65 cm/hr. Score release was induced by 17 - 28 °C,	 17 - 50 uEm- 2 sec- 1, and 31 ppt salinity. The biology of spore germination and development was studied. The number of erect plants developing from germinated spores was inversely proportional to he density of spores on the substrate. Methods for <b>storing</b> <b>regenerative</b> stock were studied. Large branches were stored for months, and germlings for as long as 3. 5 years. It is hoped that the information collected during this study will both enlarge our knowledge of Eucheuma uncinatum as a future marine crop plant, and provide a basis for further studies of algal domestication and cultivation...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis presents a justification for the study of regenerative damping, a general statement of the regenerative damping problem, and a detailed analysis of a specific proposed solution to the regenerative damping problem. Improvement in the efficiency of many physical systems is realized by the incorporation of regenerative devices, and all devices which dissipate power are candidates for investigation as regenerative systems. The viscous damper is a dissipative device which may be suitable for energy regeneration and is therefore investigated as such. <b>Regenerative</b> damping involves <b>storing</b> the power normally dissipated by a passive viscous damper. This task is accomplished by constructing a system which connects an energy storing device to the device being damped. The connecting system must efficiently transfer power from the device being damped to the storage device while simultaneously meeting the operating impedance of the storage device and producing a desired damping impedance. Many physical systems can accomplish this task, and the variable linear transmission is proposed for further investigation. Mathematical, graphical, and computer models are constructed to study the variable linear transmission. These models directly indicate the control strategies necessary to operate the device as a regenerative damper. Studies of kinematic performance and efficiency of the proposed damper indicate that a strong connection exists between the goodness of the performance of the proposed device as a damper and its efficiency. Both of these issues are directly related to the strategy used in the active control of the device. Results indicate that in its ideal state, the proposed damper exactly solves the problem of regenerative damping. For the non-ideal operation of the device, which includes the effects of system actuation dynamics, the performance looks promising but will require more investigation into optimal control strategies. Overall, the prospects for realizing regenerative damping are shown to be positive, and further investigation of this subject is encouraged...|$|R
