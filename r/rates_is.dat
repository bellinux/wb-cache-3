5|$|Abdul Taib Mahmud, the BN chief {{minister}} of Sarawak, revised new land renewal rates which took effect on June 1. He {{said that the}} Sarawak new land <b>rates</b> <b>is</b> the cheapest in Malaysia as compared to other states. In accordance with opposition proposal for the unconditioned, automatic renewal of land leases, he also challenged the opposition-led state governments to announce new land rates lower than the current one announced by himself, without risking the income of the state governments.|$|E

Causes of failure included nest collapse by gale-force winds and rain, and harassment and nest raiding by pied currawongs. The incidence of brood parasitism is uncertain. A pair of grey currawongs have been observed feeding a channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) chick on one occasion.|$|E
5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes are expressed {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression <b>rates</b> <b>is</b> defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E

5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange <b>rates)</b> <b>is</b> uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between the Lancet and U.N. pre-invasion mortality <b>rates</b> <b>is</b> 3.5 deaths/1,000/year. The Lancet study used the number of 26,112,353 (from Lancet supplement) as the population of Iraq. 3.5 times 26,112 equals 91,392. So 3.5 deaths/1,000/year means around 91,400 deaths in one year in a population of 26.1 million.|$|E

25|$|In {{a forward}} though, the spread in {{exchange}} <b>rates</b> <b>is</b> not trued up regularly but, rather, it builds up as unrealized gain (loss) {{depending on which}} side of the trade being discussed.

25|$|Slovenia {{is located}} in {{temperate}} latitudes. The climate is also influenced by the variety of relief, {{and the influence of}} the Alps and the Adriatic Sea. In the northeast, the continental climate type with greatest difference between winter and summer temperatures prevails. In the coastal region, there is sub-Mediterranean climate.

25|$|Activation {{energies}} for fusion {{reactions are}} generally high because the protons in each nucleus {{will tend to}} strongly repel one another, as they each have the same positive charge. A heuristic for estimating reaction <b>rates</b> <b>is</b> that nuclei {{must be able to}} get within 100 femtometers (1 × 10−13 meter) of each other, where the nuclei are increasingly likely to undergo quantum tunneling past the electrostatic barrier and the turning point where the strong nuclear force and the electrostatic force are equally balanced, allowing them to fuse. In ITER, this distance of approach is made possible by high temperatures and magnetic confinement.|$|E

25|$|Lott {{finds that}} when hiring {{standards}} are lowered {{in the process}} of recruiting more minority officers, the overall quality of all officers is reduced and crime rates are increased. The most adverse effects of these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black populated cities.

The paper examines how the changing composition of police departments affects such measures as the murder of and assaults against police officers.|$|E

25|$|According to the FBI, a {{city to city}} {{comparison}} of crime <b>rates</b> <b>is</b> not meaningful, because recording practices vary from city to city, citizens report different percentages of crimes from one city to the next, and {{the actual number of}} people physically present in a city is unknown.

25|$|Animal {{husbandry}} and Integrated Crop Management (ICM) {{often are}} just two branches of one agricultural enterprise. In modern agriculture, animal husbandry and crop production must be understood as interlinked sectors which cannot be looked at in isolation, as the context of agricultural systems leads to tight interdependencies. Uncoupling animal husbandry from arable production (too high stocking <b>rates)</b> <b>is</b> therefore not considered {{in accordance with the}} principles and objectives of Integrated Farming (Lütke Entrup et al., 1998 1). Accordingly, holistic concepts for Integrated Farming or Integrated Farm Management such as the EISA Integrated Farming Framework, and the concept of sustainable agriculture are increasingly developed, promoted and implemented at the global level.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{the theory}} of {{programmed}} death by ageing, individuals from a single species usually live much longer in a protected (laboratory, domestic, civilized) environment than in their wild (natural) environment, reaching ages that would be otherwise practically impossible. Also, in majority of species, there doesn't exist any critical age after which death rates change dramatically, as intended by the programmed death by ageing, but the age-dependence of death <b>rates</b> <b>is</b> very smooth and monotonic. However, as mentioned above, V.P. Skulachev explained that a process of gradual ageing has the advantage of facilitating selection for useful traits by allowing old individuals with a useful trait to live longer. It is also easy to imagine that animals with gradual ageing will live longer in a protected environment.|$|E
