40|$|Fouling of fin-and-tube heat {{exchangers}} by particle deposition leads to diminished effectiveness in supplying ventilation and air conditioning. This paper explores mechanisms that cause particle deposition on heat exchanger surfaces. We present {{a model that}} accounts for impaction, diffusion, gravitational settling, and turbulence. Simulation results suggest that some submicron particles deposit in the heat exchanger core, but do not cause significant performance impacts. Particles between 1 and 10 {micro}m deposit with probabilities ranging from 1 - 20 % with fin edge impaction representing the dominant mechanism. Particles larger than 10 {micro}m deposit by impaction on <b>refrigerant</b> <b>tubes,</b> gravitational settling on fin corrugations, and mechanisms associated with turbulent airflow. The model results agree reasonably well with experimental data, but the deposition of larger particles at high velocities is underpredicted.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. Compact flat tube heat exchangers with inclined <b>refrigerant</b> <b>tubes</b> and plane fins are studied at Reynolds numbers based on the hydraulic diameter of Redh= 3900 and Redh= 2500. The fluid field is measured parallel to the fins and the wall distance is varied. The fluid movement and particularly the change of fluid movement close to the fin are examined. A steady two dimensional CFD simulation is developed to provide {{an efficient model for}} geometric optimization. The model is validated by experimental flow measurements. This paper also compares the local heat transfer distribu-tion on the fin with near wall PIV measurements and seeks relations between certain flow structures and enhanced heat transfer. Shadowing effects prevent the examination of instan-taneous velocity fields in the named geometries.

40|$|Particles in indoor environments may deposit on the {{surfaces}} of heat exchangers {{that are used in}} heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Such deposits can lead to performance degradation and indoor air quality problems. We present a model of fin-and-tube heat-exchanger fouling that deterministically simulates particle impaction, gravitational settling, and Brownian diffusion and uses a Monte Carlo simulation to account for impaction due to air turbulence. The model predicts that < 2 % of submicron particles will deposit on heat exchangers with air flows and fin spacings that are typical of HVAC systems. For supermicron particles, deposition increases with particle size. The dominant deposition mechanism for 1 - 10 mum particles is impaction on fin edges. Gravitational settling, impaction, and air turbulence contribute to deposition for particles larger than 10 mum. Gravitational settling is the dominant deposition mechanism for lower air velocities, and impaction on <b>refrigerant</b> <b>tubes</b> is dominant for higher velocities. We measured deposition fractions for 1 - 16 mum particles at three characteristic air velocities. On average, the measured results show more deposition than the model predicts for an air speed of 1. 5 m s(- 1). The amount that the model underpredicts the measured data increases at higher velocities and especially for larger particles, although the model shows good qualitative agreement with the measured deposition fractions. Discontinuities in the heat-exchanger fins are hypothesized to be responsible for the increase in measured deposition. The model and experiments reported here are for isothermal conditions and do not address the potentially important effects of heat transfer and water phase change on deposition.

40|$|For {{the pure}} or {{azeotropic}} refrigerants typically used in present {{air conditioning and}} refrigeration applications, the refrigerant changes phase at a constant temperature. Thus, the refrigerant circuiting arrangement such as crossfiow, counterfiow, or cross-counterflow, {{has no effect on}} the thermal performance. For zeotropic refrigerant mixtures, however, the phase-change occurs over a temperature range, or "glide", and the refrigerant circuiting arrangement, or flow path through the heat exchanger, can affect the thermal performance of both the heat exchangers as well as the overall efficiency of the vapor compression cooling cycle. The effects of tsvo diflerent circuiting arrangements on the thermal performance of a zeotropic retligerant mixture and an almost azeotropic refrigerant mixture in a four-row cross-countertlow heat exchanger arrangement are reported here. The two condensers differ only in the manner of circuiting the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>tubes,</b> where one has refrigerant always flowing downward in the active heat transfer region ("identical order") and the other has refrigerant alternating flow direction in the active heat transfer region ("inverted order").

Also, based on the results of the study of the flow patterns of both working fluids, the density of pressure contours in the conventional refrigerants was far larger than that of the nanorefrigerant implying that more compressor work and ultimately greater power will be required. The findings from this study were validated with experimental results showing that a CFD analysis tool/method can be employed to understudy the phenomenal changes that take place in nano-refrigerant movement through capillary tubes without recourse to experimentation...|$|R
40|$|Freeze {{pre-concentration}} system, FPCS, {{with low}} lift reversible heat pump {{is designed for}} selective freezing of water from sugarcane juice. Â Two identical vented double wall tube-and-tube heat exchangers are used, to freeze water in the evaporator and melt ice in the condenser, alternately. Â They are sized based on cooling capacity offered by compressor, ice growth rate and velocity of juice inside the tube to reduce inclusion. Â Low lift heat pump is designed to operate at - 8 oC evaporator and 3 oC condenser saturation temperatures. Â Since, the condenser duty is higher than evaporator duty excess heat duty, {{in the form of}} superheat is utilized to heat pre-concentrated juice. Â Raw juice is precooled in a three stream Tube-and-Tube Heat Exchanger, TT_HE. Â Raw juice is precooled using cool concentrated juice and separated water. Â Freeze pre-concentration of sugarcane juice from 20 Â°Brix to 40 Â°Brix using a low lift reversible heat pump saves bagasse during initial 63 % water removal. Â Water is removed through the freezing process requires 335 kJ/kg heat removal, which is equivalent to 15 % of heat addition during evaporation at atmospheric pressure in open pan in jaggery making. Â Investigations on selection of refrigerant R 744, R 290 and R 22 for FPCS are presented. Â R 290 is identified as preferred refrigerant. Â It is natural refrigerant, no ODP and significantly lower operating pressures compared to R 744. Â R 290 charge of 360 g for 1. 5 TR compressor based system is managed by using small diameter <b>refrigerant</b> side <b>tubes.</b> Â It address safety related issues for modular small capacity systems. Â Superheat temperature of compressed refrigerant is 9 oC for R 290. Â It allows to size the identical LHEs with R 290 as a refrigerant. Â Flashing of refrigerant in evaporator is 7 % for R 290 and 10 % R 744. Â Generally, R 744 is preferred when high temperature heating is required. Â But, high superheat at compressor outlet and increased flashing at evaporator inlet reduces the performance of R 744 system making it less preferred as compared to R 290 and R 22. Â Theoretical cycle COPc calculated for R 290 based reversible heat pump works out to be 20, with compressor isentropic efficiency of 70 %. Â Overall system COPc is in the range of 10 to 13 after accounting for losses like cycling of thermal mass, heat gain from ambient, variation in freezing point depression and ice layer thickness. Â System Carnot efficiency is in the range of 41 to 54 %. Â Power required for 1. 5 TR FPCS is 0. 4 to 0. 6 kWe. Â Different juice side tube diameters are considered to find the optimal size, after accounting for effect of thermal mass of heat exchanger, heat pump switching time and inclusion on the energy consumption per unit water separated. Â Achievable energy consumption is in the range of 9 to 12 kWhe/m 3 of water separated...|$|R

The {{dissertation}} {{is devoted}} to the experimental researches which are aimed at increasing the efficiency of horizontal tube condensers by strictly accurate evaluation of heat transfer and regime parameters in condensing various <b>refrigerants</b> in horizontal <b>tubes</b> of such devices. The unique measurements of heat fluxes and heat transfer coefficients local by circumference have been carried out during condensation of Freon R- 22 and steam which varies over a wide range of the main regime parameters (G, ?, q, Rel). The improved model of film condensation inside horizontal tubes for prediction of heat transfer with application of the results of numerical solutions of Bae et al. is proposed. In this model more precise definition of friction coefficient on interphase as the main parameter crucial for condensation is given. This more precise definition contains experimental substantiation of ?q ? prediction for calculation of pressure losses by friction and correction ?q that takes into account surface suction at the interphase. Heat exchange predicted by the proposed method was compared with the experimental data of various authors for 13 substances (steam, Freon?s R- 22, R- 123, R- 134 a, R- 245 fa, carbon dioxide, propylene, propane, ether, isobutene, refrigerants FC- 72, Novec? 649, HFE- 7000) in annular and intermediate modes. Good agreement of the experiments with calculations (divergence within 25 %) proves correctness of the proposed method both for laminar flow of condensate film and turbulent flow (models by Bae and others). ?????? ????????? ????????????????? ?????????????, ??????? ?????????? ?? ????????? ????????????? ?????? ?????????????-??????? ????????????? ????? ????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ??? ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ?????? ????? ?????????. ???????? ??????? ?????????????? ???????????? ????????????? ? ???????????? ???????????? ??? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????????? ??????? ???? ??? ????? ?????, ??? ? ? ?????????????????? ???????, ??????????? ? ????????????? ? ?????????? ????????????. ????????, ??? ??????????? ????? ?????????? ????????????? ? ???????? ??????? ????????? 30 ? 70 % ? ????. ????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ?? ????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ????????? ??????????? ??????

40|$|Capillary {{tubes are}} {{components}} in refrigerating systems which act as expansion and flow-rate controlling devices. The proper design of capillary tubes {{is an important}} factor in performance efficiency of these systems. An experimental test loop was designed and built for testing the capillary tube. This test loop simulated the actual refrigeration system that normally supplied refrigerant with or without oil to the capillary tube, while providing easily controlled boundary conditions. Pressures and temperatures along the capillary tube and suction line were also instrumented. The capillary tube was tested for a wide range of conditions including: subcooled inlet, diabatic and adiabatic capillary <b>tube,</b> <b>refrigerant</b> HFC- 134 a flow with and without oil. The process of refrigerant flow through a capillary tube is a flashing process, in which the state of the refrigerant changes from subcooled liquid to a vapor-liquid mixture. Metastable phenomena in the flow, i. e. a thermal nonequilibrium phenomena, may exist within a flashing process. Whereas a literature survey showed that the metastable flow of refrigerant was only observed in adiabatic capillary tubes, the experiment demonstrated metastable flow through the diabatic capillary tube for the first time. It is found from the experiment that the metastable flow will vanish when Gc/Gs< 77. 8. A correlation of the underpressure of vaporization (a characteristic quantity for metastable flow) for a diabatic capillary tube, based on homogeneous nucleation theory, was developed to consolidate this new result. The flow in the capillary tube was numerically modeled by dividing the flow into two regions: single-phase and two-phase. The liquid single-phase flow region was described by four governing differential equations and boundary conditions. The numerical model for the two-phase flow region used one-dimensional nonequilibrium two-fluid equations which accounted for the relative velocity and the temperature difference between the vapor and liquid phases. Results of the numerical models compared satisfactorily with measured experimental data. The results indicated that the vaporization occurred near the capillary tube exit with a strong heat transfer between the capillary tube and suction line; the mass flux of refrigerant in the capillary tube without oil was about 2. 2...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of heat transfer and flow regimes during condensation of <b>refrigerants</b> in horizontal <b>tubes</b> was conducted Measurements were made in smooth, round tubes with diameters ranging from 3. 14 mm to 7. 04 mm. Four refrigerants were tested: R- 12, R- 22, R- 134 a, and azeotropic blends of R- 32 /R- 125 in 50 %/ 50 % and 60 %/ 40 % compositions. Flow regimes were observed visually at the inlet and outlet of the test-condenser as the heat transfer data were collected. Stratified, wavy, wavy-annular, annular, annularmist, and slug flows were observed. True mist flow without a stable wall film was not observed during condensation tests. For the purpose of condensing heat transfer behavior, the various flow regimes {{were divided into two}} broad categories of gravity-dominated and shear-dominated flow. The heat transfer behavior was strongly related to the flow regime. In the gravity-dominated flow regime, the dominant heat transfer mode was laminar film condensation. This regime was characterized by heat transfer coefficients that depended on the wall to refrigerant temperature difference but were nearly independent of mass flux. In the shear-dominated flow regime, forced convective condensation was the dominant heat transfer mechanism. This regime was characterized by heat transfer coefficients that were independent of temperature difference but very dependent on mass flux and quality. Separate heat transfer correlations that were developed for each of these flow regimes successfully predicted data from the present study and several external sources. The heat transfer correlations were combined with existing pressure drop correlations to develop a simple condenser model. This model was used to explore the existence of an optimum diameter. Simulations showed that the required condensing length increased slowly as the diameter was decreased over a wide range. As the diameter became sufficiently small, the condensing length began to increase dramatically because much of the driving temperature difference was destroyed by pressure drop. An optimum diameter existed where the condensing surface area was a minimum. An analytical solution showed that this optimum diameter corresponded to a decrease in the inlet temperature difference of between 23 % and 37 %. The predictions of this analytical solution agreed very well with the simulation model. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Center Project 3...|$|R
