It {{is a well-known}} result in the literature that the horizontal merger of Cournot players may be unprofitable because of the response of nonmerging agents (a negative strategic effect). We show that the strategic effect of a merger among competitive agents substantially differs from the strategic effect of a merger among Cournot players. Furthermore, we show how the profitability of a merger depends on whether the merged agents {{are on the same}} side of the market as the preexisting dominant agent(s).

Further, Edgeworth's proposed recontracting process is highly stylised, involving traders obtaining information by costlessly making, breaking and re-making contracts with each other.

40|$|The authors study {{behavior}} of a large trader with private information about the mean of an asset with a risky return. They argue that if the variability of the return is not too great, typically the trader will find it desirable {{to ensure that the}} market price does not reveal his information, that is, that a "pooling" equilibrium arises. Such an equilibrium has the advantage of avoiding the incentive constraints that arise in "separating" equilibria, where information can be inferred from prices. Thus, the efficient market hypothesis may well fail if there is imperfect competition. Despite the uninformativeness of prices, the other (<b>competitive)</b> <b>traders</b> are also better off in the pooling equilibrium than in any separating equilibrium, again if one assumes variability.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the time series {{properties of the}} price of a risky asset implied by a model in which <b>competitive</b> <b>traders</b> are heterogeneously informed about the underlying sources of uncertainty in the economy. Traders do not observe the shocks in the period they occur. However, traders are imperfectly and heterogeneously informed about these shocks for three reasons:(1) the shocks are serially correlated arid hence partially forecast able from their past history, (2) each trader receives private signals about the current values of a subset of the shocks, and (3) the equilibrium price conveys information about the private signals and beliefs of other traders. Since prices convey information in this economy, traders will face an infinite regress problem in expectations associated with their desire to forecast the beliefs of others, the beliefs of others about average beliefs, etc. The equilibrium time series representation for the price of the risky security is deduced in various imperfect information environments. Then the volatility and autocorrelations of prices in this model are compared to the corresponding statistics for a model in which agents are homogeneously informed. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays that study three interdependent topics: microstructure foundation of volatility clustering, inefficiency of information diffusion and jump detection in high frequency financial time series data. Volatility clustering, with autocorrelations of the hyperbolic decay rate, is unquestionably {{one of the most}} important stylized facts of financial time series. The first essay forms Chapter 1 which presents a market microstructure model that is able to generate volatility clustering with hyperbolic autocorrelations through traders with multiple trading frequencies using Bayesian information updating in an incomplete market. The model illustrates that signal extraction, which is induced by multiple trading frequency, can increase the persistence of the volatility of returns. Furthermore, it is shown that the local temporal memory of the underlying time series of returns and their volatility varies greatly with the number of traders in the market. The second essay, Chapter 2, presents a market microstructure model showing that an increasing number of information hierarchies among informed <b>competitive</b> <b>traders</b> leads to a slower information diffusion rate and informational inefficiency. The model illustrates that informed traders may prefer trading with each other rather than with noise traders in the presence of the information hierarchies. Furthermore, it is shown that momentum can be generated from the trend following behavior pattern of noise traders. I propose a new nonparametric test based on wavelets to detect jump arrivals in high frequency financial time series data, in the third essay, Chapter 3. It is demonstrated that the test is robust for different specifications of price processes and the presence of market microstructure noise and it has good size and power. Further, I examine the multi-scale jump dynamics in U. S. equity markets and the findings are as follows. First, the jump dynamics of equities are entirely different across different time scales. Second, although arrival densities of positive jumps and negative jumps are symmetric across different time scales, the magnitude of jumps is distributed asymmetrically at high frequencies. Third, only twenty percent of jumps occur in the trading session from 9 : 30 AM to 4 : 00 PM, suggesting that jumps are largely determined by news rather than liquidity shocks...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to aim in general to {{understand}} the perception of industries in India – a fast growing economy, towards green philosophy and to investigate further what initiatives those industries have taken for becoming green. Design/methodology/approach – The study is exploratory in nature and attempts to understand the behaviour of three types of industries, namely, durable, non-durable and services towards green philosophy. Findings – Results of the study reflect that industries in India, in general have a positive view for practicing green philosophy. They feel becoming green will help them in gaining the competitive advantage and will support them in sustainable growth. Also the industries that have a positive attitude towards greening have taken some measures and initiatives in this direction to establish a sustainable competitive advantage for succeeding in today’s highly challenging and dynamic global markets. Research limitations/implications – The present exploratory study provides a starting-point for further research. Researchers can further explore whether industries using green philosophy were able to <b>register</b> a <b>competitive</b> advantage and could gain added market share and profits by becoming green. They can investigate the reason behind this green attitude, whether industries are using green practices for cutting costs in turn to increase their profits or whether they have a genuine concern for environmental protection and society’s welfare and therefore adopting green practices in their industry. Originality/value – Most of such studies in thefield of green marketing and social economics are done in developed countries and remain conspicuously missing in the context of fast developing Asian countries.
