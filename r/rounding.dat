5|$|The {{aging of}} adult skeletons {{is not as}} {{straightforward}} as aging a child's skeleton as the skeleton changes little once adulthood is reached.

Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have smaller and more osteon fragments. Another potential method for determining the age of an adult skeleton is to look for arthritis indicators on the bones. Arthritis will cause noticeable <b>rounding</b> of the bones. The degree of <b>rounding</b> from arthritis coupled with the size and number of osteons can help an anthropologist narrow down a potential age range for the individual.|$|E
