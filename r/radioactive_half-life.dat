These had the added advantage of not degrading the phosphor over time, unlike radium. Tritium emits very low-energy beta radiation (even lower-energy than the beta radiation emitted by promethium) which cannot penetrate the skin, rather than the penetrating gamma radiation of radium and is regarded as safer.|$|R

The chemical nature of Mg2+ is such that it is closely approximated by few other cations.

40|$|Abstract—H 2 15 O as a PET-tracer {{offers the}} {{opportunity}} to examine perfusion of blood into tissue non-invasively (cf. [1]). It features a short <b>radioactive</b> <b>half-life</b> (≈ 2 min.) and therefore adds a smaller radiation exposure to the patient in comparison to other tracers. The disadvantages arising from the short <b>radioactive</b> <b>half-life</b> are noisy, low-resolution reconstructions. Previous algorithms first reconstruct images from each dynamic H 2 15 O dataset independently, e. g. via the standard EM-algorithm (cf. [2]) or FBP. Hence, temporal correlation is neglected. The myocardial blood flow (MBF) and other important parameters, like tissue fraction, arterial and venous spillover effects are computed subsequently from these reconstructed images. Our new method interprets the direct computation of parameters as a nonlinear inverse problem. This implies the need for inversion of a nonlinear operator G(p) (with p denoting the parameters to compute), but allows to skip the process of generating noisy images. The process is schematically described in Figure 1. Therefore, our method {{takes into account the}} temporal correlation between the datasets, and not the correlation between noisy, low resolution images. The problem is transferred to a nonlinear parameter identification problem. Furthermore, regularization can be added to each parameter independently, assuring meaningful results. I...|$|E
