50|$|A {{process for}} {{separating}} magnesite from talc in talc ore {{was developed in}} Finland in the 1960s; the company Soumen Talkki Oy was founded in 1967 to commercialise this invention. Following several production expansions and developments such as <b>rotogravure</b> <b>paper</b> coating talc, Mondo Minerals was established as {{a joint venture between}} Omya AG and Western Mining Ltd in 1998. This joint venture included the former Finnminerals Oy, Westmin BV Amsterdam and the talc business of Norwegian Talc AS. Ownership of Mondo Minerals was transferred to Omya AG in 2001. In 2007, Mondo Minerals was acquired by Hg Capital. The company received patents for highly delaminated talc and for talc use in beverage filtration the following year. Recent developments include the first commercial paint talc slurry production, the launch of highly sterile talc for pharmaceuticals and the introduction of compacted talc for the plastics industry. In July 2011, Mondo Minerals has been acquired by Advent International.|$|E
40|$|Plant {{proteins}} from leguminous {{seeds are}} a highly interesting {{raw material for}} paper coating processes. Due to their high molecular weight and their amphotheric character they can act as binder and co-binder in paper coating formulations for offset or <b>rotogravure</b> <b>papers.</b> At present, plant proteins are used only in small amounts as the runnability on industrially used high-speed coating machines is limited. To overcome this situation, both protein isolates and protein based binders have to be evaluated regarding rheological characteristics under high-shear conditions. Solubility behaviour nd rheological characteristics will be presented. Relults are pointing out, that the solubility can be enhanced when dissociating the globulin protein fraction into sub-units with reduced molecular weight. The rheological behaviour will be discussed using standard binder formulations with varying binder content at different temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Type of Technology: Capture device- {{collects}} and vents pollutants to an abatement device {{such as an}} incinerator. Applicable Pollutants: Organic hazardous {{air pollutants}} (HAP) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Achievable Emission Limits/Reductions: PTEs have a capture efficiency of 100 % (EPA, 2002). Emissions reductions are dependant on the downstream pollution control device. Applicable Source Type: Point or fugitive Typical Industrial Applications: Any process or operation where total emissions capture is required. They are commonly used in flexographic printing, <b>rotogravure</b> printing, coating (<b>paper,</b> film, fabric, and metal), laminating, screen printing, can coating, and plastic card coating. Emission Stream Characteristics: a. Air Flow: PTEs draw clean air into the enclosure for venting of waste gas. The air flow through a PTE must provide adequate capture and transport of the waste gas. The direction of air flow through all natural draft openings (NDOs) must be into the enclosure. The average facial velocity of air though all NDOs shall be at least 3, 600 m/hr (200 ft/min) (EPA, 1997). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires a minimum of 4 room {{air changes per hour}} (RAC/hr) for industria...|$|R
