50|$|Consistency is {{the ability}} of soil to stick to itself or to other objects (cohesion and {{adhesion}} respectively) and its ability to resist deformation and rupture. It is of approximate use in predicting cultivation problems and the engineering of foundations. Consistency is measured at three moisture conditions: air-dry, moist, and wet. In those conditions the consistency quality depends upon the clay content. In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Duck gizzards {{were used}} {{as the source of}} smooth muscle in these studies. There is almost nothing in the {{literature}} relative to the processing characteristics of this type of meat. Based on prior experience it was assumed that tenderness would be a problem if intact muscles, such as gizzards, were to be eaten. Tenderness was determined by measuring <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> with a Warner-Bratzler shear cell. It was found that cooking by simmering in water or pressure cooking in 15 p. s. i. g. steam did not alter the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shearing.</b> Tenderness of gizzards decreased during the first hour post-slaughter then improved to 24 hours. After 48 hours aging the shear values were about the same as after 4 hours aging. Papain, when used as a tenderizer for the gizzards prior to cooking, resulted in a significant improvement in tenderness. Further, it was observed that piercing the gizzards with a fork several times prior to cooking resulted in an improvement in tenderness. A combination of the piercing and papain treatment yielded a tender product...|$|E

40|$|Background: Skin {{compromised}} by traumatic scars and contractures can manifest decreased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> and other forces, while increased tension and skin fragility contribute to chronic erosions and ulcerations. Chronic wounds possess inflammatory mediator profiles and other characteristics, {{such as the}} presence of biofilms, that can inhibit healing. Observations: Three patients with multiple traumatic scars related to blast injuries initiated a course of ablative fractional laser therapy for potential mitigation of contractures, poor pliability, and textural irregularity. Patients also had chronic focal erosions or ulcerations despite professional wound care. All patients experienced incidental rapid healing of their chronic wounds within 2 weeks of their initial ablative fractional laser treatment. Healing was sustained throughout the treatment course and beyond and was associated with gradual enhancements in scar pliability, texture, durability, and range of motion. Conclusions: The unique pattern of injury associated with ablative fractional laser treatment may have various potential wound-healing advantages. These advantages include the novel concept of photomicrodebridement, including biofilm disruption and the stimulation of de novo growth factor secretion and collagen remodeling. If confirmed, ablative fractional resurfacing could be a potent new addition to traditional wound and scar treatment paradigms...|$|E

40|$|Among several {{techniques}} to improve beef tenderness, vitamin D 3, important for calcium mobilization, {{has recently been}} developed as an alternative. It acts on the intracellular calcium-dependent proteases (mu- and m-calpain). Ten days prior to slaughter, 36 Nelore steers were fed 0, 3, 6 and 9 million IU of supplemental vitamin D 3 (D 3) per animal per day (an- 1 d- 1). Animals were slaughtered and tenderness (shear force), cooking losses (1, 8 and 15 days of aging), sensory evaluation, and minerals in blood plasma and muscle (Longissimus dorsi) were measured. There were no differences (P > 0. 05) among treatments for blood plasma and muscle mineral concentration, evaporation losses, and sensory juiciness. For drip and total loss, the smallest losses were for the 6 × 10 (6) IU an- 1 d- 1 treatment.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to suggest a model for {{predicting}} wall slip based on the characterization of both the fluid and the surfaces. The different behaviours can in fact be explained {{as the result of}} the competition between the lubricant <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> and the capability of the surface to transfer a tangential momentum to the fluid molecules at the interface. In order to characterize the solid surfaces a corrugation parameter is proposed for both canonical and complex crystal lattices: it takes into account the surface-fluid interaction stemming from the Lennard-Jones interatomic potential [1], as well as the commensurability between lubricant molecules and the crystal lattice [2]. Lowly corrugated surfaces lead to high wall slip compared to highly corrugated ones, which on the other hand cause locking of the lubricant molecules at the surface. The corrugation parameter is then used in order to create master curves for alkanes, which quantitatively describe the tangential momentum transfer at the interface. Finally, a simple model for wall slip prediction including both the fluid effective viscosity and the surface corrugation parameter is proposed. This is can be regarded as a preliminary step for linking the molecular scale with larger ones...|$|E
40|$|The minicircle (MC), {{composed}} of eukaryotic sequences only, {{is an interesting}} approach to increase the safety and efficiency of plasmid-based vectors for gene therapy. In this paper, we investigate micro-MC (miMC) vectors encoding small regulatory RNA. We use a construct encoding a splice-correcting U 7 small nuclear RNA, which results in a vector of 650 base pairs (bp), as compared to a conventional 3600 [*]bp plasmid carrying the same expression cassette. Furthermore, we construct miMCs of varying sizes carrying different number of these cassettes. This allows us to evaluate how size influences production, super-coiling, stability and efficiency of the vector. We characterize coiling morphology by atomic force microscopy and measure the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> forces caused by an injector device, the Biojector. We compare the behavior of miMCs and plasmids in vitro using lipofection and electroporation, {{as well as in}} vivo in mice.

Some conclusions were the followings: (1) The three-stage permanent deformation behavior of asphalt mixtures on loads could be got by SPSFT.
