5|$|In October 2005, a 15th Anniversary edition was released. The new reprint {{contained}} Morrison and Karen Berger's annotated {{script that}} breaks down and explains {{much of the}} symbolic <b>references</b> <b>in</b> the series, as well as principal art and step-by-step samples of the story.|$|E
5|$|Iravan is also mentioned, {{as the son}} of Arjuna and Ulupi, {{in passing}} <b>references</b> <b>in</b> two Puranas ("sacred texts") known as the Vishnu Purana (4:20:12)—also with a text history from the late Vedic through the Gupta periods—and the Bhagavata Purana (9:22:32)—traditionally dated to the Vedic period but dated by modern {{scholars}} to the 9th or 10thcentury CE.|$|E
5|$|No {{version of}} the game has been {{released}} outside Japan. This {{has been attributed to}} Nintendo's policy of censoring religious <b>references</b> <b>in</b> games, which rendered the early Megami Tensei titles unsuitable for localization due to their central religious elements. A fan translation of Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei was released on August 28, 2014.|$|E
50|$|The {{album is}} {{prominently}} <b>referenced</b> <b>in</b> Israfel Sivad's novel Crossroads Blues {{and is more}} subtly <b>referenced</b> <b>in</b> many of Sivad's poems.|$|R

5|$|Python's name {{is derived}} from the {{television}} series Monty Python's Flying Circus, and it is common to use Monty Python <b>references</b> <b>in</b> example code. For example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs, instead of the traditional foo and bar. Also, the official Python documentation and many code examples often contain various obscure Monty Python references.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{sources for}} Medieval Scotland {{are much more}} limited than for {{contemporaneous}} England. The only burgh for which there are sources pre-dating 1400 is Aberdeen. The only large body of sources to survive from before 1400 are the cartularies of monasteries. For education, outside of occasional <b>references</b> <b>in</b> documents concerned with other matters, they amount {{to a handful of}} burgh records and monastic and episcopal registers.|$|E
5|$|The {{event has}} also been commemorated through <b>references</b> <b>in</b> television, theatre, and popular music. A play about the shootings by Adam Kelly called The Anorak was named {{as one of the}} best plays of 2004 by the Montreal Gazette. A movie {{entitled}} Polytechnique, directed by Denis Villeneuve was released in 2009, and sparked controversy over the desirability of reliving the tragedy in a commercial film.|$|E
50|$|Haapi is <b>referenced</b> <b>in</b> 3 {{letters from}} the Byblos-(Gubla) corpus of the {{prolific}} writer Rib-Hadda, of 68 letters. Haapi is also <b>referenced</b> <b>in</b> letter EA 149 of Abimilku of Tyre-(Surru), (EA for 'el Amarna').|$|R

5|$|This {{version was}} re-{{released}} on the Virtual Console for Wii on July 3, 2012. No {{version of the}} game has been released outside Japan. This {{has been attributed to}} Nintendo's policy of censoring religious <b>references</b> <b>in</b> games, which rendered the early Megami Tensei titles unsuitable for localization due to their central religious elements. A fan translation of Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei was released on August 28, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{production}} was in Belgrade, {{in the former}} Yugoslavia, in 1969. It was the first Hair to be produced in a communist country. The show, translated into Serbian, was directed by female producer-director Mira Trailović at the Atelje 212 theatre. It featured Dragan Nikolić, Branko Milićević, Seka Sablić and Dušan Prelević. Over four years, the production received 250 performances and was attended by president Tito. Local <b>references</b> <b>in</b> the script included barbs aimed at Mao Zedong as well as Albania, Yugoslavia's traditional rival.|$|E
5|$|As he {{developed}} the series, Kishimoto created the three primary characters {{as a basis for}} the designs of the other three-person teams. He also used characters in other shōnen manga as <b>references</b> <b>in</b> his design of the characters, a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications. The characters that Kishimoto developed, however, were praised for incorporating many of the better aspects of previous shōnen characters, although many publications lamented the perceived lack of growth beyond such stereotypes. The visual presentation of the characters was commented on by reviewers, with both praise and criticism given to Kishimoto's work in the manga and anime adaptations.|$|E

50|$|Youvan's work on {{proteins}} that interact with light is <b>referenced</b> <b>in</b> two Nobel Prize Lectures: by Roger Y. Tsien on GFP and by Diesenhofer and Michel for photosynthetic reaction centers. According to Google Scholar, , Youvan is <b>referenced</b> <b>in</b> 4600 other publications.|$|R
5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of <b>references</b> <b>in</b> the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale used Mitică as a stock {{character}} to feature in satirical contexts; the biographical insights he provided are short and often contradict each other. Among Mitică's traits are his tendency to generate sarcastic comebacks and sententious catchphrases, a Francized speech, {{as well as}} inclinations to waste time and easily find {{his way out of}} problematic situations. His existence is connected to events in the history of Bucharest which he occasionally <b>references</b> <b>in</b> his jokes. Like Lache and Mache, who are present in Caragiale's fiction, the character is usually portrayed as a civil servant who has a hard time making ends meet, but who is well liked by his peers.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{held the}} {{opposite}} position; he maintained that Linnaeus's works should be translated as literally {{as possible and}} that the sexual <b>references</b> <b>in</b> the nomenclature should be retained. In 1783 and 1787, the Botanical Society of Lichfield, founded by Darwin {{and several of his}} friends specifically to translate Linnaeus's works, issued their own English translation, A System of Vegetables, that categorized over 1400 plants. Assisted by Samuel Johnson, they coined over fifty new botanical words; it is this work, along with the group's The Families of Plants that introduced the words stamen and pistil into the English language, for example. By 1796 their translation had prevailed and Withering was forced to adopt their vocabulary in later editions of his work.|$|E

30|$|The authors {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} review of the previous publications in the “Discussion,” but some of the reference citations are erroneous. The second paragraph of the “Discussion” starts by focusing on Georgopoulos et al.’s article [2], which is the ninth <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the <b>reference</b> list {{at the end of the}} paper, whereas it is cited in the text as the eighth <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the list. Also, Georgopoulos et al. found 74 cases, not 71, corresponding to an incidence of 0.0515  %, not 0.015  % as Murphy et al. mention in their article. The first sentence on page 383 starts with a discussion of Greenwald et al.’s article [3], which is the sixth <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the <b>reference</b> list but is cited in the text as the fourth <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the list. The third paragraph of the “Discussion” also contains mismatched reference citations. An article by Sabharwal and coauthors [4] surveying members of the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America is the seventh <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the <b>reference</b> list at the end of the paper but is cited in the text as the fifth <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the list. The follow-up survey by Sabharwal et al. [5] is given as the eighth <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the list, but is cited as the sixth. Finally, the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the “Discussion” reports a survey by Sabharwal et al. [4] on using low-molecular-weight heparin to treat VTE; this is the seventh <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the list but is cited as the ninth. It would be better if these citation errors had been corrected and brought to the reader’s attention through a clarification.|$|R

5|$|During the 18th century, {{appreciation}} of Bashō's poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru {{went to great}} length to find <b>references</b> <b>in</b> his hokku to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure references, {{some of which were}} probably literary false cognates. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.|$|E
5|$|Five <b>references</b> <b>in</b> Eusebius' Historia Ecclesiastica {{speak to}} Philip's Christianity; three directly, two by implication. At 6.34, he {{describes}} Philip visiting a church on Easter Eve and being denied entry by the presiding bishop {{because he had}} not yet confessed his sins. The bishop goes unnamed. At 6.36.3, he writes of letters from the Christian theologian Origen to Philip and to Philip's wife, Marcia Otacilia Severa. At 6.39, Eusebius writes that Decius persecuted Christians because he hated Philip. The remaining two references are quotations or paraphrases of Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, a contemporary of Philip (he held the patriarchate from 247 to 265). At 6.41.9, Dionysius contrasts the tolerant Philip's rule with the intolerant Decius'. At 7.10.3, Dionysius implies that Alexander Severus (emperor from 222 to 235) and Philip were both openly Christian.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Robinson {{argues that}} the {{popularity}} of Musidora reflects a change in art buyers. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the primary market for art {{was no longer a}} privately educated landed aristocracy who had been taught the Classics and were familiar with ancient mythology, but the emerging middle class. These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand the <b>references</b> <b>in</b> history paintings, but could appreciate Musidora as a skilful execution and as a work of beauty in its own right.|$|E

50|$|A phantom {{reference}} {{is a kind}} of <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> Java, where the memory can be reclaimed. The phantom {{reference is}} one of the strengths or levels of 'non strong' <b>reference</b> defined <b>in</b> the Java programming language; the others being weak and soft. Phantom reference are the weakest level of <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> Java; in order from strongest to weakest, they are: strong, soft, weak, phantom.|$|R
5|$|Mary Shelley {{continued}} to treat potential romantic partners with caution. In 1828, she met and flirted with the French writer Prosper Mérimée, but her one surviving letter to him {{appears to be}} a deflection of his declaration of love. She was delighted when her old friend from Italy, Edward Trelawny, returned to England, and they joked about marriage in their letters. Their friendship had altered, however, following her refusal to cooperate with his proposed biography of Percy Shelley; and he later reacted angrily to her omission of the atheistic section of Queen Mab from Percy Shelley's poems. Oblique <b>references</b> <b>in</b> her journals, from the early 1830s until the early 1840s, suggest that Mary Shelley had feelings for the radical politician Aubrey Beauclerk, who may have disappointed her by twice marrying others.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, 1996, a {{well-known}} gaming clan, the Rangers, surprised the Quake community with Diary of a Camper, the first widely known machinima film. This short, 100-second demo file contained {{the action and}} gore of many others, but {{in the context of}} a brief story, rather than the usual deathmatch. An example of transformative or emergent gameplay, this shift from competition to theater required both expertise in and subversion of the game's mechanics. The Ranger demo emphasized this transformation by retaining specific gameplay <b>references</b> <b>in</b> its story.|$|E
5|$|Poland, {{home of the}} world's largest Jewish {{community}} {{before the}} war, lost 3,300,000 (90percent) of its Jewish population. Although the Germans rigorously imposed {{the death penalty for}} hiding Jews, some Poles hid Jews (saving their lives) despite the risk to themselves and their families. Although reports of the Holocaust had reached Western leaders, public awareness in the United States and other democracies of the mass murder of Jews in Poland was low at the time; the first <b>references</b> <b>in</b> The New York Times, in 1942, were unconfirmed reports rather than front-page news.|$|E
5000|$|Raven {{has been}} used as a <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> other books {{discussing}} the events surrounding Jonestown and Peoples Temple. Henry Warner Bowden used the book as a <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the entry on Jim Jones in Dictionary of American Religious Biography. Harold Barrett utilized Raven as a <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> his book Rhetoric and Civility, and described it as [...] "a thorough, highly detailed and documented account". Eugene V.
