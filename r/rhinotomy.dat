5000|$|A {{rhinolith}} is a calculus {{present in}} the nasal cavity. The word {{is derived from the}} roots [...] and , literally meaning [...] "nose stone". It is an uncommon medical phenomenon, {{not to be confused with}} dried nasal mucus. A rhinolith usually forms around the nucleus of a small exogenous foreign body, blood clot or secretion by slow deposition of calcium and magnesium salts. Over a period of time, they grow into large irregular masses that fill the nasal cavity. They may cause pressure necrosis of the nasal septum or lateral wall of nose. Rhinoliths can cause nasal obstruction, epistaxis, headache, sinusitis and epiphora. They can be diagnosed from the history with unilateral foul smelling blood stained nasal discharge or by anterior rhinoscopy. On probing probe can be passed around all its corners. In both CT and MRI rhinolith will appear like a radiopaque irregular material. Small rhinoliths can be removed by foreign body hook. Whereas large rhinoliths can be removed either by crushing with luc's forceps or by Moore's lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> approach.|$|E
40|$|SummaryCommon {{surgical}} {{approaches for}} medial maxillectomy include lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> and midfacial degloving. Lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> provides excellent surgical exposure but leaves a bulging scar on the face. Despite its own limitations, midfacial degloving has been preferred to lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> {{because it does}} not leave any external scar on the face 1. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the cosmetic results and surgical exposure access of midfacial degloving. Treatment morbidity was evaluated through: post operative hospital stay length, blood transfusion needs, complications, pre and post operative hemoglobin levels, disease recurrence, nasal packing, type of suture and antibiotics. Retrospective study was carried out with sixteen patients treated at the Hospital Geral de Fortaleza SESA/SUS from December 1999 through November 2003. Based on the results, we may conclude that midfacial degloving is effective to treat extensive nasal cavity lesions and paranasal sinuses with reduced post operative morbidity...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 80 {{patients}} with histopathologically confirmed juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma were treated surgically {{over a period}} of ten years (1995 - 2004). The lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> approach was used to expose the tumor and its extensions. Lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> with its extensions provides wide exposure of and access to the nose, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, pterygopalatine fossa, infratemporal fossa and temporal fossa. Most intracranial, extradural extensions can also be approached. There were no major operative or post-operative complications. Longterm follow up from one to ten years showed only 8 recurrences. The added advantage of this approach is that it can be combined with all the other anterior and lateral skull base approaches. The cosmetic outcome is satisfactory if nasal aesthetic subunits are taken into considerations while making the incision. The lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> approach is the most direct route to the body of the tumor and can be used to approach all the possible extensions of the tumor...|$|E
40|$|The study {{includes}} {{a total of}} 61 dogs affected with chronic nasal disease. Various treatment procedures were employed depending on the aetiology and extent of the process. The aim was to check and evaluate different forms of therapy of chronic nasal disease in the dog. Bacterial rhinitis cases were treated in a conservative way using antibiotics (amoxycillin, ceftazidime) and chemotherapeutics (enrofloxacin) for 4 to 5 weeks; mycotic rhinitis cases required treatment by antimycotics (ketoconazole) for 6 to 7 weeks. It was necessary to change the antibiotic drug during the bacterial rhinitis therapy in 5 patients. Surgical treatment of the chronic nasal disease was selected in 47 dogs. A total of 5 dorsal <b>rhinotomy</b> cases resulted in a neoplasm finding and extirpation. Periapical granulomas communicating with the nasal cavity caused chronic rhinitis in 21 dogs. A total of 28 and 11 dogs were treated because of the periapical granuloma of the maxillary fourth premolar (P 4) and the maxillary canine tooth (C), respectively. In all, 16 extractions of affected teeth and 5 ventral rhinotomies were performed. Oronasal fistulas on the C position were in 4 cases treated using the double flap technique and in 6 cases closed by buccal mucosa. Foreign bodies {{were removed from the}} nasal cavity with respect to the size and localisation using a rigid endoscope in 4 cases or <b>rhinotomy</b> (4 dorsal and 2 ventral <b>rhinotomy</b> cases).

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of <b>rhinotomy</b> and surgical debridement associated with topical administration of 2 per cent enilconazole and oral itraconazole in dogs with severe or recurrent sinonasal aspergillosis. METHODS A standard <b>rhinotomy</b> was performed on seven dogs. In the initial study, the bone flap was left attached cranially and replaced {{at the end of the}} procedure. In the main study group, the bone flap was discarded. Nasal passages were debrided and irrigated with enilconazole solution for one hour. Oral itraconazole was administered to four dogs for one month postoperatively. Follow-up rhinoscopy was performed in all dogs. RESULTS All three dogs in the initial study had recurrence of the disease and two dogs had a second surgery to remove the flap. The main study group included four dogs in which the flap was initially removed, and the two dogs from the initial study that required a second surgery. At follow-up rhinoscopy, five dogs were free of aspergillus but had bacterial or inflammatory rhinitis and one dog had a small aspergilloma but was subsequently asymptomatic. Telephone follow-up revealed that four dogs were asymptomatic, one dog had intermittent sneezing and serous nasal discharge, and one dog had intermittent epistaxis.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} common presenting symptoms, age, disease extent; and {{the efficacy}} of different surgical approaches in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} Angiofibroma of nasopharynx. Design: All prepubertal and adolescent patients presenting with nasal obstruction, recurrent epistaxis, denasal speech, conductive deafness and anaemic look, reporting to our dept for consultancy were evaluated. Setting: Patients were diagnosed on the basis of history, clinical examination, and CT scan with contrast. Tumour excision was performed through lateral rhinotomy; lateral <b>Rhinotomy</b> plus Weber, Weber Fergusson and U-shaped trans palatal approaches.

40|$|Craniofacial {{resection}} {{is commonly}} {{performed in the}} surgical resection of sinonasal tumours involving anterior skull base. It entails a bicoronal scalp flap with lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> or an extended lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> to expose the anterior skull base. Transfacial approach is necessary in the resection of the nasal part of the tumour. The choice of surgical approach is based heavily on the surgeon's experience and training. The results of endoscopic-assisted craniofacial resection for sinonasal tumours performed in our center in eight patients from 1998 to 2005 were reviewed. There were seven males and one female with age ranging from 18 to 62 years (mean 42. 4 years). There was each a case of mature teratoma, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, fibrous dysplasia, inverted papilloma and two cases of sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma. The mean follow up duration for these eight patients post surgery was 21. 4 months. Out of eight patients, five underwent surgery with no adverse complications. The complications encountered were a cerebrospinal leak and a postoperative transient V and VI cranial nerve palsy. One patient with sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma died of lung metastasis at 11 months post-surgery. The endoscopic-assisted craniofacial resection is a highly useful surgical technique to avoid the unsightly facial scar of the lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> or the Weber-Ferguson incision, postoperative paranasal sinuses infection and avoidance of tracheostomy in selected cases.

40|$|Inverted {{papilloma}} (IP) is {{a benign}} sinonasal lesion {{that has a}} known propensity for recurrence, local aggressiveness and an association with transformation to squamous cell carcinoma. Due to {{the high rate of}} recurrence, association with malignancy and a tendency of multicentricity, the surgical approaches to treatment are controversial. Over the years there has been a slow evolution from aggressive (en bloc) resection by lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> to endoscopic techniques. This progress corresponds to the advances that have been made in endoscopic sinus surgery over the past 15 years. Technological advances have allowed the detection of sinonasal IP before its extension beyond the sinonasal region, thus enabling minimally invasive techniques {{to be used in the}} treatment of selected cases of IP. Differences in recurrence rates were not observed for endoscopic management as compared with lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> or sublabial degloving approaches. In terms of aetiology there is certain evidence that the presence of HPV in IP could be predictive of malignant transformation. Although IPs are monoclonal proliferations, they do not fit the profile of a prototypic precursor lesion. In contrast, an increased EGFR and TGF-alpha expression is associated with early events in IP carcinogenesis. Parameters such as hyperkeratosis, squamous epithelial hyperplasia and a high mitotic index are negative prognostic indicators, which could be useful in the future follow-up of patients with IP. Present literature should encourage us to recommend the use of a uniformly accepted staging system. The propensity for delayed recurrences and the maximal 13...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Hemangiopericytoma {{is a rare}} tumor entity {{deriving}} from pericytes. Less than 5 % of hemangiopericytoma occur in the nasal cavity and are characterised by a rather benign nature with low tendency of metastasis. However, as the recurrence rate in the literature ranges from 9. 5 % to 50 %—depending {{on the length of}} followup—a radical surgical resection is considered as the gold-standard treatment. Only a few years ago, a wide external approach, usually via lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> or Caldwell-Luc, was performed. Endoscopic techniques were regarded as appropriate for small low-vascularised tumors only. Methods. We present the case of a 64 -year-old patient with an extended sinonasal hemangiopericytoma, who was successfully treated by an endoscopic controlled endonasal tumor resection after embolisation with Onyx. Further, to support the new treatment option, we review the literature concerning all features of sinonasal hemangiopericytomas and their therapeutical management. Results/Conclusion.

Angiofibromas arising outside nasopharynx are termed as Extra-Nasopharyngeal Angiofibromas (ENA) which often gets misdiagnosed because of its rarity and atypical clinical and biological behaviour. We present a case of angiofibroma of nasal septum in a seven-year-old boy presenting with two months history of left nasal obstruction and occasional nasal bleeding. CECT revealed a contrast enhanced soft tissue mass in left nasal cavity with no extension into the sinuses and nasopharynx. The mass was completely removed by lateral <b>rhinotomy</b> approach and a follow up of ten months showed no recurrence. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of angiofibroma. The age of {{the patient and the}} location of the tumour make the case exceptionally rare.

40|$|Introduction: Solitary fibrous tumours (SFTs) of {{the nose}} and {{paranasal}} sinuses are extremely rare. These were originally described as neoplasms of the pleura originating from spindle cells. It is further sub-classified as a benign type of mesothelial tumour. Its occurrence in many extra pleural sites have been reported earlier, mainly in the liver, parapharyngeal space, sublingual glands, tongue, parotid gland, thyroid, periorbital region, and very occasionally in the nose and  paranasal sinus area.   Case Report: A 28 -year-old man with a 6 month history of persistent progressive left nasal obstruction and watering of the left eye is reported. Further imaging by CT and MRI revealed a large, left-sided, highly vascular, nasal cavity mass (Fig 1, 2, 3, 4) pushing laterally on the medial wall of the maxilla. The patient underwent a lateral <b>rhinotomy,</b> which proceeded with the excision of the mass. Histopathological analysis of the specimen was consistent with SFT.   Conclusion:  This case is reported to develop insights regarding diagnosis and management of such rare tumours...|$|E
