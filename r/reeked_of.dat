5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1898, Dawson's {{population}} rose further to 30,000 as stampeders arrived over the passes. The centre of the town, Front Street, was lined with hastily built buildings and warehouses, together with log cabins and tents spreading out across {{the rest of the}} settlement. There was no running water or sewerage, and only two springs for drinking water to supplement the increasingly polluted river. In spring, the unpaved streets were churned into thick mud and in summer the settlement <b>reeked</b> <b>of</b> human effluent and was plagued by flies and mosquitoes. Land in Dawson was now scarce, and plots sold for up to $10,000 ($8 million) each; prime locations on Front Street could reach $20,000 ($16 million) while a small log cabin might rent for $100 ($2,700) a month. As a result, Dawson's population spread south into the empty Hän village, renaming it Klondike City. Other communities emerged closer to the mines, such as Granville on Dominion Creek and Grand Forks on Bonanza Creek.|$|E
25|$|Although Adams' father {{approved}} of the match, her mother was appalled that her daughter would marry a country lawyer whose manner still <b>reeked</b> <b>of</b> the farm, but eventually she gave in.The couple married on October 25, 1764, in the Smiths' home in Weymouth. Smith, Abigail's father, presided over the marriage of John Adams and his daughter. After the reception, the couple mounted a single horse and rode off to their new home, the small cottage and farm John had inherited from his father in Braintree, Massachusetts. Later they moved to Boston, where his law practice expanded. The couple welcomed their first child nine months into their marriage.|$|E
500|$|Unusually for the time, the {{newspaper}} covered its staff's transportation. Reporters {{were expected to}} carry rolls of nickels, so they could board streetcars and reach their assignments. However, if they had sufficient money with them, a taxicab was permitted, and Vanderbilt—"Neil" [...] to the staff—let the staff use his two Packards to reach stories. Too often, however, the least experienced newsman on staff, Vanderbilt himself, would cover major stories. According to Rob Wagner in his history of Los Angeles newspapers of the time, Vanderbilt's [...] "news stories <b>reeked</b> <b>of</b> naiveté and his editorials were sophomoric." ...|$|E

500|$|While Ramón was in France, {{his father}} sought {{to move the}} family's {{registration}} from the [...] "mixed race" [...] to the [...] "white" [...] (Caucasian) classification of families in Cabo Rojo. The process, when successful, entitled the requester to further legal and property rights {{for him and his}} family, and was necessary to allow his daughter, Ana María, to marry José Tió, who was a Caucasian. In the case of Betances' father, the process lasted two years, and was formalized in 1840, but not before having to have the family's lineage and religious affiliations exposed to the general public, something that embarrassed them all. Betances was considerably annoyed by the entire ordeal, since {{he was the first to}} acknowledge that he and his entire family were not [...] "blancuzcos" [...] ("whitish", a legal term) but [...] "prietuzcos" [...] ("blackish", as Betances mocked it in his letters) instead. To him the procedure <b>reeked</b> <b>of</b> hypocrisy.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{called this}} episode [...] "clumsy and tired", {{explaining}} it was [...] "misfiring on all cylinders. The satire was toothless, the playing strained {{and the whole}} enterprise <b>reeked</b> <b>of</b> mild desperation." [...] He continued in his recap that [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] had a [...] "golden opportunity to comment insightfully and hilariously about the tricky intersection of politics, power, race and privilege", however [...] "it recycled jokes that were unfunny and overly familiar the first time around". In conclusion, Rabin gave it a C grade rating. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student opined that the show's writing [...] "is still sharp– not 'as sharp as ever,' but sharp– {{but a lot of}} the most interesting plots have already played out, and a lot of the new plots aren't interesting." [...] Sanders said that the stories featured here had [...] "a few big laughs... but they're assembled so haphazardly and put into such a bulky framework that the train just never gets enough steam to salvage the episode." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a revolutionary}} peasant leader Makhno {{has been called}} a [...] "colourful personality" [...] and his career [...] "legendary". [...] However, the German and Mennonite {{communities}} in Ukraine considered him to be an instigator of paramilitary banditry against innocent farmers, and an [...] "inhuman monster whose path is literally drenched with blood." [...] He is consistently referred to as a terrorist or bandit in Mennonite literature. At the age of 11 Makhno began working as an ox driver on the Janzen estate in Silberfeld. Here he began to develop a hatred for the ruling classes. In his memoirs he writes: [...] "At this time I began to experience anger, envy and even hatred towards the landowner [...] and especially towards his children – those young slackers who often strolled past me sleek and healthy, well-dressed, well-groomed and scented; while I was filthy, dressed in rags, barefoot, and <b>reeked</b> <b>of</b> manure from cleaning the calves' barn." [...] Makhno also worked at the Mennonite owned Kroeger plant in Gulyai-Polye.|$|E

2500|$|On September 26, 2014, Smith stated on the Hollywood Babble-On No. 183 episode, why he’s {{glad that}} he made Tusk, Smith added, [...] "Everything in my life would suck right now if I hadn't made that movie. I'm back in movies now. I've got three lined up, {{and this is the}} fucking grand news. Tusk was the {{absolute}} bridge to Clerks III. Because of Tusk, I got my financing for Clerks III." [...] Smith continued, [...] "A year and change ago, I was trying to fucking desperately get Clerks III made for the 20th anniversary. And that desperation, I must have <b>reeked</b> <b>of</b> it, because I couldn't fucking find money and shit. But it was Tusk, it was people going 'Holy fuck! What else do you have?' And I was like, Clerks III, done. So everybody that's like, 'He failed, he failed,' thank you I failed into Clerks III. So, never trust anybody when they tell you how your story goes, man.
