5|$|In 1814, the seventeen-year-old Mary Shelley (Mary Godwin, at the time) <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> Percy Bysshe Shelley to {{continental}} Europe, {{accompanied by}} Claire Clairmont, Mary's stepsister. After {{six weeks of}} travelling, they returned to England but continued to live together. Mary returned pregnant with Percy's child, but their infant daughter died soon after her premature birth. Percy was alienated from his family and received little financial support from them; he was therefore harassed by creditors. In 1816, Mary and Percy had a second child, William. The same year, Claire Clairmont began an affair with the poet Lord Byron, and in January 1817 she had a daughter by him, Allegra. The group spent the summer of 1817 with Byron at Lake Geneva, where Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein. That fall, Percy's wife, Harriet, committed suicide, and in December Percy and Mary were married. In September 1817, Mary and Percy had another child, Clara.|$|E
5|$|She {{suffered}} another serious financial setback in 1835 {{when she}} {{lost most of}} her life savings, about £300, in a bad investment. Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. Deborah Cadbury says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money, but Shelley Emling writes that {{it is not clear whether}} the man <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> the money or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment. Concerned about her financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the British government to award her an annuity, known as a civil list pension, in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The £25 annual pension gave her a certain amount of financial security.|$|E

25|$|All new Houses {{apart from}} Bodeites are {{named after the}}ir founders (although Robinites was {{originally}} Robinsonites). Bodeites was originally Buissonites, named after the Head of Languages at the time. He <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> the matron, and so the house was renamed Bodeites after the replacement, Mr Bode. This did lead to some confusion {{at the time of}} naming the houses because some housemasters moved to houses named after their colleagues.|$|E
25|$|He {{was to be}} {{somewhat}} embarrassed {{when one of his}} staff <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> the quite new wife of the then rising young writer Evelyn Waugh. Reith also had to deal with Eckersley after the BBC Chief Engineer had a rather public affair with a married woman on the staff. Up to World War II any member of BBC staff involved in a divorce could lose their job, although in his biography of Reith Ian McIntyre records that after his BBC days Reith himself may have had an affair with a male colleague.|$|E

25|$|He {{continued}} to play for Somerset in 1887, generally batting {{as part of the}} lower order. He collected ten wickets against the Marylebone Cricket Club during this time. His work experience at the bank ended when an inspector noticed that the books were not balancing; which Woods was happy to explain was due to him taking a sovereign {{from time to time to}} buy stamps. After losing this job, he paid a surveyor to teach him the trade, but after an afternoon of the training, his teacher <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> the money and soon committed suicide, bringing that to a halt.|$|E
25|$|The fictional {{version of}} Platinum Weird is a {{partnership}} between Stewart and a mythical singer/songwriter from New York City named Erin Grace. Erin made a strong impression on numerous artists in the UK, including Stevie Nicks, who emulated her style. After a handful of performances and with an album partially completed, Erin suddenly disappeared. Apparently distraught {{over the death of}} Nick Drake, she abruptly <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> Elton John's boyfriend in late 1974. Soon afterward, she turned up in Los Angeles, where Don Henley introduced her to Lindsey Buckingham, setting into motion a relationship that would be the inspiration for the Fleetwood Mac Rumours album.|$|E

Upon hearing {{of her husband and}} son's death, Queen Margaret, already ill, died on 16 November. Edith was now an orphan.

25|$|Lord Grantley also predeceased his mother, {{dying in}} 1877. His son, John, {{inherited}} {{the title and}} estates. The 5th Lord Grantley was a numismatist, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, the Royal Numismatic Society and the British Numismatic Society. He assembled a large collection of coins and also grew orchids. He caused a scandal in 1879, when he <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> another man's wife, the former Katharine McVickar, daughter of a wealthy American stockbroker. The jilted husband was the 5th Lord Grantley's older cousin, Major Charles Grantley Campbell Norton. Katharine's marriage to Charles was annulled, and they were married that November, five days before {{the birth of their}} first child. Despite her scandalous introduction to British society, Katharine {{went on to become a}} successful London hostess.|$|E
25|$|At Pisa Thomas {{worked very}} hard on his commission, {{sometimes}} 14 hours per day. The strain {{was too much for}} his wife, perhaps depressed also by her loss. She <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> an Englishman, but later returned. The issue of adultery came up again. Violent accusations followed, indignantly repudiated; a diplomatic correspondence ensued, and a demand was made, and supported by the grand duke, for an apology, which the professor refused to make, preferring to lose his chair. He set out once more for Scotland, but was intercepted by the Florentine cardinal Luigi Capponi, who persuaded him to remain at Bologna as professor of Humanity. This was the most distinguished post in the most famous of continental universities, and Dempster was {{at the height of his}} fame. Though his Roman Antiquities and Scotia ilustrior had been placed on the Index pending correction, Pope Urban VIII made him a knight and gave him a pension.|$|E
25|$|Sophie Parker (Natalie Brown) is a businesswoman {{and single}} mother who runs her own talent agency. Just hours after {{being told by}} a psychic that {{she was about to}} have the worst year of her life, her boyfriend Rick <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> her best friend Melissa while Sophie was still {{pregnant}} with what she and Rick thought was Rick's baby. Soon afterward, she gave birth and discovered that the baby (named Robert) couldn't be Rick's child after all: he's half black. It turns out Robbie was conceived in a one-night stand Sophie had with André (played by Lyriq Bent in flashbacks), whom she met in a cab in New York City. At first, she did not have any contact with him and went as far as shredding his business card. But in the first season finale, he would later show up to see her, and upon learning that he was a father, he walked out on Sophie and left her devastated, only to return hours later to see Sophie with her ex-boyfriend Rick at her apartment.|$|E

As Strauss said, [...] "When we were breaking him, he <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> me before we ever wanted him to run. I mean, just flat <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> me." [...] Robert's brother Eldridge, who was the trainer, once worked the colt minus half a shoe and Go Man Go still managed a time of 18.9seconds for a [...] distance.|$|E

[...] The divorce took place in 1928, five years before her husband's death. At {{the time of the}} divorce she was living on a smallholding near Headley, but returned to Sulhamstead in 1932 after inheriting land and money from Sir William. Ten years later, in 1942, she purchased Westerlands, a farm in Petworth, so she could personally oversee the stables.|$|E
