40|$|Scope of Study: This study uses a FORTRAN {{computer}} code which simulates room air flow using a laminar model, a turbulent k-ε model with wall functions and a turbulent low-Reynolds k-ε model. The room dimensions are 4. 6 x 2. 75 x 2. 75 m. A variable grid spacing option has been implemented into the code. Output data has been coded such {{that a number}} of post-processing software packages can be utilized for two and three-dimensional visualization. The prediction of convection coefficients and outlet temperatures were investigated and results were compared to experimental data. Global <b>error</b> <b>numbers</b> were obtained and comparisons were made to experimental results and to previous computational results. A two-dimensional <b>error</b> <b>number</b> was created to compare two-dimensional computational results to experimental sections. Findings and Conclusions: Global <b>error</b> <b>numbers</b> were reduced over prior results using constant and variable grids in some cases. Two-dimensional <b>error</b> <b>numbers</b> were calculated at the z= 0. 127 m. section which demonstrated that the variable grid implementation helped the computational results match the experimental result...|$|R

The WCST is a problem-solving, neuropsychological test, which requires the respondent to understand the logical principles of the proposed problem. The test proceeds {{through a number of}} shifts in set (sorting principles) that varies along three dimensions (color, form, and number). Successful performance on the WCST requires the participant first to determine the correct sorting principle and to maintain this sorting principle or set. Scores were based on number of trials administered, total number of correct responses, <b>number</b> of <b>errors,</b> <b>number</b> of perseverative responses, <b>number</b> of perseverative <b>errors,</b> <b>number</b> of non-perseverative <b>errors,</b> <b>number</b> of categories completed, number of trials to complete the first category, conceptual level responses, failure to maintain set, and learning to learn.|$|R
