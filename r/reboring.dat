50|$|During the {{earliest}} stage of an engine's life, its initial breaking-in or running-in period, small irregularities in the metals {{are encouraged to}} gradually form congruent grooves by avoiding extreme operating conditions. Later in its life, after mechanical wear has increased the spacing between the piston and the cylinder (with a consequent decrease in power output) the cylinders may be machined to a slightly larger diameter to receive new sleeves (where applicable) and piston rings, a process sometimes known as <b>reboring.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before their {{exploratory}} trip, the Lewis and Clark Expedition obtained rifles {{from the}} Harper's Ferry Arsenal. The US Army's website mentions the procurement of the rifles, {{saying that there}} were 300 of the 1792 or 1794 contract rifles at the arsenal at that time. The Army site also refers to modern speculation that the changes Lewis had made to the contract rifles (adding sling swivels, shortening the barrel further to 33-36 inches and <b>reboring</b> them to a larger caliber), led {{to the design of}} the US Model 1803, created six months later.|$|E

5000|$|Work on 25kV OHLE {{electrification}} of {{the line}} began in May 2015 and has included numerous bridgeworks plus the major undertaking of the re-boring of Farnworth Tunnel. [...] Its high profile resulted in a visit from Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, shortly after work started, and from Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin in August 2015 during the <b>reboring</b> of the Farnworth tunnel. Breakthrough was achieved in late, rather than early October, due to loose sand delaying the work in August; the first trains running through the new twin track bore on Monday December 14, 2015.

5000|$|Some historians {{believe that}} {{a small number of}} early 1803 type rifles were {{produced}} for the Lewis and Clark expedition. It is also possible that contract rifles of 1794 were modified at the arsenal at Harper's Ferry, by shortening the barrels and <b>reboring</b> and rerifling them to [...]54 caliber. The records at the arsenal are not exact on the matter, as it appears the first 1803 prototype was produced six months after Lewis departed Maryland. The later 1803 rifles had a slightly lighter barrel than the first production run version, and had other slight differences such as a thinner lock plate and a narrower trigger guard. The barrel was 36 inches in length on the second version.|$|E

These AK-pattern weapons are usually considered inferior due to inconsistent gunsmithing of weapons chambered or converted for this cartridge and lack of quality control of the ammunition. It is sometimes used by private security companies. The usage of 7.92 mm bullets in 7.62 mm barrels without <b>reboring</b> is not considered to be a safe practice.|$|E

5000|$|When fitting new rings to a used engine, special [...] "ridge dodger" [...] {{rings are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} top compression ring, to improve compression and oil consumption without <b>reboring</b> the cylinder.

These are not widely recommended, however, as they are usually not required and may give inferior oil consumption. A more acceptable method is to remove the wear ridge with a [...] "ridge reamer" [...] tool before lightly honing the bore to accept new rings.

40|$|Nowadays, {{aluminum}} and its alloys found their application in any type design structures, many’s {{the time being}} an alternative for a ferrous alloys due to their technological properties like low density, ductility, high strength and good corrosion resistance.

Therefore, optimization of the process parameters that affect machining stages such as, tool wear, alloy machinability, machining effort and cutting speed becomes an area of constant development and study. To {{the most important factors}} having impact on machining properties belong: initial condition of machined material, which depends on a method and conditions of material preparation.

Three different kinds of synthetic engine oil (MOTUL) were tested, namely unused oil, run-in oil (650 [*]km after engine <b>reboring)</b> and regular engine oil (6200 [*]km of motorcycle operation). The samples were frozen to below zero temperatures and kinematic viscosity was continuously monitored {{in the range of}} − 5 [*]°C and + 115 [*]°C.
