40|$|To {{carry out}} the {{epidemiological}} study of patients suffering from a given cancer, the Department of Medical Informatics (DIM) has to link information coming from different hospitals and medical laboratories in the Burgundy region. Demands from the French department for computerized information security (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des LibertÃ©s: CNIL), in regard to abiding by the law of January 6, 1978, completed by the law of July 1 st, 1994 on nominal data processing {{in the framework of}} medical research have to be taken into account. Notably, the CNIL advised to <b>render</b> <b>anonymous</b> patient identities before the extraction of each establishment file. This paper describes a recently implemented protocol, registered with the French department for computerized information security (Service Central de la SÃ©curitÃ© des SystÃ¨mes d'information : SCSSI) whose purpose is to <b>render</b> <b>anonymous</b> medical files in view of their extraction. Once rendered anonymous, these files will be exportable so as to be merged with other files and used in a framework of epidemiological studies. Therefore, this protocol uses the Standard Hash Algorithm (SHA) which allows the replacement of identities by their imprints while ensuring a minimal collision rate in order to allow a correct linkage of the different information concerning the same patient. A first evaluation of the extraction and anonymity software with regard to the purpose of an epidemiological survey is described here. In this paper, we also show how {{it would be possible to}} implement this system by means of the Internet communication network...|$|E

40|$|Decentralisation of {{government}} {{has been a major}} policy direction of the World Bank and-International Monetary Fund (IMF) as an adjunct to the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) imposed on low income countries. The emphasis in SAPs on the reduction of public spending has increased poverty in many cases. This has led to the growth of a new emphasis on decentralisation and participatory development in an attempt to reduce poverty. The link between participation and local governance has become seen as an important means of improving the effectiveness of services and of empowering the poor to participate in the development processes that affect their lives. Based on empirical study of a district in Ghana, this paper argues that there are perception gaps between the elites and rural poor with respect to poverty and poverty alleviation strategies.

40|$|Human beings' {{fascination for}} their own {{mortality}} and their everlasting desire for perenniality are not new ideas. For thousands of years man has {{been aware of the}} ephemeral aspect of its existence and has struggled to leave traces of its earthly passage in an effort to pass on knowledge to future generations, or simply to ensure that it is remembered for a few more years. This thesis identifies and studies the persistence of this issue in the work of two artists of different generations and nationalities: the Canadian-born Betty Goodwin and the French-born Christian Boltanski. Employing distinct mediums and strategies, Goodwin and Boltanski create re-imagined memento moris that are truly adapted to the present era. Working in the aesthetic of the trace and memory, they share a profound interest for the anonymous object and figure, which they address both directly and indirectly. Our thesis therefore studies two complementary aspects of their production: first the creation of an ersatz anonymous relic [...] which references the human body ubiquitously [...] , and secondly the direct motif of the human body and face, subtracted from its context and more-or-less <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous</b> following a series of strategic iconoclast actions...|$|R

40|$|The International Biathlon Union, {{through its}} own Medical Commission, has {{undertaken}} a three-year {{program aimed at}} identifying the hematocrit levels of athletes who participate in biathlons. The purpose was to check for hematocrit levels exceeding normal physiological values {{as well as for}} any significant modifications within individuals {{during the course of the}} competitive season. All of the athletes registered in international biathlon races were, therefore, subjected to venous blood sampling (1 cc) three times a year prior to competition, in the days preceding two World Cup races (December and January) and the World Championships (February). The blood was centrifuged, the micro-hematocrit determined, and the value (<b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous)</b> recorded. This procedure was repeated for three consecutive competitive seasons (Dec. 1994 -Feb. 1995, Dec. 1995 -Feb. 1996, Dec. 1996 -Feb. 1997). During this three-year period, the collected data showed a significant lowering of the average hematocrit level. In fact, from the first February sampling to the third February sampling, the average hematocrit value for the male population dropped from 48. 04 +/- 2. 36 to 46. 33 +/- 1. 91, and for the female population from 44. 05 +/- 2. 44 to 42. 52 +/- 1. 92.

40|$|PURPOSE: This study aims {{to explore}} the {{differences}} in reported information between adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports of patient and healthcare professionals (HCPs), and, in addition, to explore possible correlation between the reported elements of information. METHODS: This retrospective study compared the reported information between 200 ADR reports of patients and HCPs. Reports were <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous</b> and scored for {{the presence or absence}} of predefined elements of information. These elements can be objective (e. g. start date of the ADR) or subjective (e. g. the impact or severity of the ADR). A two-sided Pearson's Chi-square test was used to detect statistically significant differences in the reported information. A Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Correlation between the elements of information was explored using categorical principal components analysis (CATPCA). RESULTS: Overall, HCPs had a higher score for the presence of objective and patients for subjective elements of information. Elements that were statistically significant more often reported by patients are the impact of the ADR and the patient's weight and height. HCPs statistically significant more often reported the medical history and the route of administration of the drug. CATPCA showed four clusters of elements of information that have fair correlation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the differences in reported information between ADR reports of patients and HCPs. Patient reports are more focused on patient-related information and the impact of the reported ADRs, whereas reports from HCPs provide more clinically related information.

40|$|Abstract. To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of vital status determination by record linkage between a hospital database and the French national mortality database with anonymised data in order to adhere to French legislation. Hospital database of the Institut Gustave Roussy (IGR), the largest cancer centre in France, and the French mortality databases from 1998 – 2004 were used for this record linkage. A phonetic code adapted to French language was first applied to identifiers. The last name, maiden name, all first names and the date of birth were then each <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous</b> using irreversible hash coding. Record linkage, using the probabilistic method developed by Jaro, was based on four fields: the last name, first given name, date of birth and code of birth place. Other variables were used for further automatic and manual validation. Linkage results were very satisfactory for the 10, 089 patients included: sensitivity was 94. 8 % and specificity 99. 5 %. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were respectively 190 and 0. 05. The main causes of discordances were erroneous or incomplete information such as unrecorded maiden name in the hospital database. Results were improved by adding manual validation to electronic matching: sensitivity rose to 97. 2 % and specificity to 99. 4 %. Record linkage using anonymised data applied to large scale hospital data is possible and has good validity. This method offers new prospects for large prognostic studies based on hospital data provided that the diagnosis date is systematically recorded in the hospital database...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: The use of {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) for supporting interprofessional communication is becoming increasingly common in health care. However, little research has explored how ICTs affect interprofessional communication, or how novices are trained to be effective interprofessional ICT users. This study explores the interprofessional communication strategies of nurses and doctors (trainees and experts) when their communications were mediated by a specific ICT: an electronic patient record (EPR). METHODS: A total of 72 doctors and nurses participated in this 8 -month study on a paediatric in-patient ward. Eighty hours of non-participant observations and 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted. All data were <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous</b> prior to analysis. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, one researcher read and analysed all data recursively. As emergent themes were identified, exemplary portions of the data were discussed with three additional researchers to resolve discrepancies and confirm the coding structure. Expertise literatures informed the final analyses. RESULTS: Three interprofessional communication strategies were identified: (i) all participants routinely formulated 2 ̆ 7 workarounds 2 ̆ 7 to circumvent problematic EPR-mediated communications; (ii) workarounds were classifiable as instances of Abandoning, Forcing or Submitting to the EPR, and (iii) novices learned workaround strategies through an informal curriculum, but they did not learn to manage the interprofessional effects of these workarounds. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees relied on workarounds as simplified routines, demonstrating routine expertise. Staff members, demonstrating adaptive expertise, used workarounds {{as part of a broader}} network of people and communication tools. Explicit training regarding this network and the ways in which workarounds conceal this network may help trainees develop adaptive expertise...|$|R

Methods and Materials: Our study population included 25 pregnant women (mean age 35. 16) investigated by prenatal MRI. In twelve {{out of them}} placental invasion was histopathologically proven, the 13 other women (52 %) without placental invasion served as control group. Multiplanar T 1 - and T 2 -weighted sequences had been performed mostly without IV contrast injection (1. 5 T). MR examinations {{of the two groups}} were <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous,</b> mixed, then independently and retrospectively reviewed by two senior and two junior radiologists in view of 8 MR features indicating placentar invasion including the degree. Results were compared with surgical diagnosis (placenta normal/increta/accreta/percreta). Interobserver agrement between senior and junior readers were calculated. Stepwise logistic regression and receiver operating (ROC) curvers were performed. Results: Demographics between the two groups were not statistically different. Overall sensitivity and specificity for detecting placentar invasion was 90. 9 % and 75. 0 % for senior readers, and 81. 8 % and 61. 8 % for junior readers respectively. The most significant MR features indicating placentar invasion were T 2 hypointense placental bands, followed by placenta praevia, focally interrupted myometrial border, posterior placental insertion, and heterogeneous placental signal. For each of the evaluated MR features the interobserver agreement kappa between the two senior readers was superior than that between the junior readers, ranging from bad (< 0. 4) to good (0. 4 - 0. 75). Conclusions: MRI can be a reliable and reproducible tool for detection of suspected placentar invasion, however very variable according to the observers' experience...|$|R

40|$|Background: Changes in the European {{pharmacovigilance}} legislation make {{it possible}} for patients of all European member states to report concerns regarding drugs directly to the national reporting centre for adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Despite a number of studies that have been conducted on patients as reporters in pharmacovigilance, typical characteristics of patients’ ADR reports compared to those of healthcare professionals (HCPs) are unclear. Objectives: To explore the differences in reported information between patients’ and HCPs’ ADR reports. Methods: A retrospective study among 200 anonymised patients’ and HCPs’ ADR reports. Reports were <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous</b> and rated using a list of objective (for example start date of the ADR) and subjective (for example the impact of the ADR) elements of information that could be important considering ADR reporting. A two-side Pearson’s Chi-square test (p < 0. 05) was used to detect statistically significant differences in the number of reported elements of information. Results: The reported information between patients’ and HCPs’ reports is broadly consistent. However, differences were found in both objective and subjective elements of information; HCPs had a higher score for objective and patients for subjective elements. Elements of information that were more often reported by patients: outcome ADR, detailed description, course of ADR, impact the ADR on the patient’s daily of life, severity, patient’s weight and height, patient’s thoughts about causality, and contact with or between HCPs. Elements of information that were more often reported by HCPs: seriousness, registration number for drugs, dosage, route of administration, pharmaceutical form, other suspect drugs, medical history, and diagnosis confirmed with test results. Conclusions: Although the reported information is generally comparable, patients’ reports are more focused on the impact of the reported ADRs, whereas reports from HCPs provide more diagnosis related information...|$|R
40|$|Identity, {{understood}} {{from many}} vantage points, is continually evolving based on relationship experiences, including those relationships established {{in social and}} behavioral research. Whether <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous</b> in large quantitatively-studied samples, or intimately known in qualitative studies, those contributing to science in a role termed “subject” receive, through the research, definitions of their identities. Because those identities are part of published social research, identities created in the research process {{become part of the}} public discourse about persons in the “subjects’” situations, and also influence policies that in turn influence persons’ lives. For their part, the identities of social and behavioral researchers also are influenced by research roles. Social work researchers may struggle with being elites as their research process unveils great suffering, which they may be unable to remedy. Data about the discomfort of those participating in research indicate that that the search for alternative ways of structuring research relationships is important. The participatory action tradition, grounded in Freire’s formulation that social transformation occurs as all people recognize their value and power and claim their full freedom, offers alternative ways of structuring relationships between those who participate in research. Data from participatory action research projects demonstrate those who participate in research can discover strengths and realize capabilities for constructively responding to serious social problems. Partners formerly regarded as “subjects” describe empowerment, acquiring education, reflectiveness about their strengths, and the conviction they can constructively respond to community problems. Researchers can find they are inspired by the heroism of their partners, and are more able to bring about policy change as they include processes of advocacy and public education in the research process. Both partners in research can more readily bring about social transformation as they work authentically together...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of the Apies River Corridor, and the identified site s relegation to the engineering demands of modernisation, has resulted in layers of water, built fabric, transport and energy infrastructure that presently dissect the site into rigidly controlled, isolated functions. This has consequently led {{to the loss of}} the Apies River s recreational and natural presence within the city. Its ecological potential as resource, as well as its enigmatic and symbolic existence, has been straightjacketed into a linear concrete entity. Its historical significance in the establishment and development of the city, as well as its significance as recreational identity, has been <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous.</b> Fragmented enclaves (deadlock urban situations) have restricted the {{potential of}} underutilised, surplus public spaces. The theoretical premise of this dissertation asserts that the great divide between nature and culture of the modern paradigm, and the consequential development of industrialisation and urbanisation, controlled our cities' natural resources in independent networks of infrastructural systems, to the control, convenience and exploitation of our cultural practices. Implemented as vehicles for political, social and economic agendas, the current isolated implementation of our urban infrastructure are spatially fragmenting the public realm. The site chosen for the project has been identified as a collection of fragmented surplus sites adrift between the infrastructural edges of the historic Ceremonial Boulevard know as Stanza Bopape Street (formerly Church Street), and the Apies River Corridor; two significant infrastructural entities in the city of Pretoria. A reinterpretation of our development processes is required, that acknowledges non-human natural systems as agents and acknowledges the constraints of our cultural practices. 1 By reimagining existing infrastructure as part of the production of form and space, marginalised urban voids can be regained for innovative design interventions, alternative occupation, and public appropriation. The potential of such a reinvention lies in public space that capitalises on the spatial, material and socio-economic possibilities of infrastructure to increase the area's ecological contribution, and amplify its historical significance through establishing a relationship between Stan Street, the Apies River, the proposed interventions and historical remnants, towards reinstating an enigmatic and recreational experience as well as ecological awareness beyond its infrastructural use.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a measurement system with performance indicators to improve organizational learning about crisis communication by public organizations. The tool can be used to conduct a preparedness audit or to evaluate communication performance in a real situation or in an emergency exercise. Evaluation is part of the strategic planning and development of crisis communication. The construction of the instrument and its theoretical underpinnings are first explained, after which the series of empirical tests that were implemented to scrutinize the clarity and appropriateness of the indicators as well as the usability of the instrument are presented. Design/methodology/approach – The process approach to crisis management, in which the various phases of a crisis are seen as a continuum, and the stakeholder perspective, in which both the diversity of public groups and the network of response organizations are taken into account, are applied in the paper. Findings – The tests of the instrument revealed much interest in its use, and it was seen as a potential tool for the improvement by public organizations of their crisis communication. The tests led to improvements in the structure as well as in the phrasing of the individual performance indicators and their explanation. The indicators were considered relevant and important but too many in number. Therefore, a possibility to use the instrument in three separate parts, relating respectively to the period before, during and after a crisis, should be offered. Research limitations/implications – This study addresses the main factors relevant for crisis communication with respect to the approach chosen, but does not report all the literature and empirical findings that validate the individual indicators as this has been done in other publications. It also presents a series of first test findings but not as yet the results of improvements initiated by using the instrument. Practical implications – The instrument developed shows weak and strong points in crisis communication on the level of single indicators, but also allows comparison of performance in different phases and for the various stakeholder groups, showing where more attention is needed. The instrument developed will be available on an open website and users will be asked to make the measurement results, <b>rendered</b> <b>anonymous,</b> available for its further improvement. Social implications - The paper contributes to effectiveness of emergency management by testing an instrument to facilitate learning about crisis communication. Originality/value – Much of the crisis communication literature focuses on reputation crises. This paper discusses crisis communication supporting crisis management in the case of disasters and other emergencies that are handled by a response network instead a single organization. It provides a clear framework for analysing and assessing the quality of crisis communication and stimulates and thus enables learning and further improvement...|$|R

Supposedly a {{deterrent}} to unwanted male attention and a device to protect men from lascivious thoughts, the abaya has <b>rendered</b> women <b>anonymous</b> when in public, silently moving through society as unidentified and all but invisible beings. Increased Western employment, tourism, and media in the forms of magazines, radio, television and the Internet have brought images of Euro-American lifestyles into Arab homes. Higher education for women has resulted in increased female opportunity and independence. Many women travel abroad and every year more complete advanced education in foreign countries, interacting with cultures other than their own. These influences are the seeds of a quiet, but colorful rebellion. Abayas that were once plain black and interchangeable now feature a variety of embellishment, from discrete black braid to huge and wildly colorful appliqués, embroideries, cutwork and beading. Embellishment styles change quickly and outmoded abayas are discarded. Using texts by Ahmed and Shirazi and building on extensive research in Qatar, this paper aims to examine the many cultural, political and religious stories told by the new abaya. Abayas express the wealth of Qatar while adhering to religious dictates and respecting traditional dress. More importantly, they give Arab women a platform upon which to express their individuality, their interest in modernity and mark their emerging role as equal partners in their country...|$|R

40|$|Mixed {{migration}} in the Mediterranean has since 2013 increased significantly {{leading to an}} unprecedented amount of deaths at sea. For {{the first time in}} 2014, over half of the people crossing the sea were refugees. The Mediterranean has not only come to be referred to as a graveyard, but it also represents a border zone dividing people and worlds, one in which the inherent conflict between national security and human rights is sadly depicted. The present thesis sets out to analyse how migrants and refugees, and migration and asylum, are portrayed in news articles and photographs published in the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat during 2013 and 2014. The focus is on the Central Mediterranean, covering mixed migration movements from Northern Africa to Southern Europe. By utilising ideas put forth by the Copenhagen School's securitisation theory, Jef Huysmans' security framing approach and the linkage between security and visual communication, the research seeks to understand how refugees and migrants are portrayed, and more specifically, whether refugees and migrants are portrayed as primarily a security concern or a humanitarian concern. A content analysis of the articles was conducted, and the quantitative data together with more qualitative analysis indicated that while both security and humanitarian perspectives are recurrent, the security perspective has more emphasis. This is done by portraying migrants and refugees negatively and linking them to illegality, and portraying them predominantly as numbers and passive agents. Together with the former, the lack of individual accounts from migrants and refugees <b>renders</b> them an <b>anonymous</b> mass, which portrays them as security concerns instead of highlighting their individuality, rights and distress. The results support the general tendency to invest in security responses over humanitarian ones when reacting to mixed migration...|$|R
40|$|Die Diskussion um Datenschutz findet hauptsächlich statt, wenn grössere Datenmengen gesammelt und archiviert werden (siehe Corti et al., 2000; ESDS, 2004 a; ESDS, 2004 b; BstatG, 1992). In einer globalisierten und zunehmend vernetzten Wissenschaftsgemeinschaft (Parry and Mauthner, 2004 : 140; Bishop, 2005 : 335) gewinnt Datenschutz aber immer mehr an Bedeutung. Während das Archivieren von quantitativen Daten in der Regel als relativ unproblematisch empfunden wird (siehe z. B. BstatG, 1992), fand in der qualitativen Forschung eine kontroverse Diskussion um die Datenarchivierung statt (Parry and Mauthner, 2004 : 140). Der Grund dafür liegt darin, dass die Generierung von qualitativen Daten als ein gemeinsames Unterfangen von Interviewten und Interviewenden verstanden wird, weswegen alle beteiligten Parteien Urheber- und Eigentümerrechte haben sollten (Parry and Mauthner, 2004 : 141). Fragen des Datenschutzes müssen jedoch nicht nur dort gestellt werden, wo Daten archiviert werden, sondern sie sind für jede Sozialforschung, die Daten erhebt und/oder auswertet von Bedeutung. Dieser Beitrag weist auf zentrale Aspekte des Datenschutzes in der Sozialforschung hin. Vor allem möchten wir betonen, dass Datenschutz ein integraler Bestandteil des wissenschaftlichen Forschungsprozesses ist und also auch von Beginn an in das Forschungsdesign integriert werden soll. Neben allgemeinen und theoretischen Überlegungen liefert der Beitrag auch praktische Hinweise zur Anonymisierung von Datensätzen – dem wichtigsten Bestandteil des Datenschutzes. Die Ausführungen werden durch Beispiele v. a. aus der Forschungspraxis der Abteilung Humangeographie des Geographischen Instituts der Universität Zürich veranschaulicht. The {{debate on}} data {{protection}} {{has so far}} been confined to institutions that collect and archive data in great quantities (see Corti et al., 2000; ESDS, 2004 a; ESDS, 2004 b; BstatG, 1992). In a globalised and increasingly networked (referring to geography, disciplines and institutions) scientific community (Parry and Mauthner, 2004 : 140; Bishop, 2005 : 335), data protection becomes more and more important. Previously, data from research was considered the property of the researchers. Nowadays, data sets are increasingly shared within the scientific community (Parry and Mauthner, 2004 : 140). This development has two implications: the question of the ownership of scientific data has to be addressed afresh and data protection becomes ever more important. Whereas, in quantitative research, archiving data is usually viewed as rather unproblematic (see e. g. BstatG, 1992), data protection has aroused controversy and debate in the qualitative research community (Parry and Mauthner, 2004 : 140). The reason for this debate lies in the very nature of qualitative research. As Parry and Mauthner (2004 : 141) state, “the construction of qualitative data is a joint endeavour between respondent and researcher” and therefore “both parties should retain authorship/ownership rights over the data” (Parry and Mauthner, 2004 : 141). However, data protection cannot be confined to the archiving of data but has to be considered in every social research project that collects and/or analyses data. This article covers some crucial issues of data protection for social research. Its particular aim is to emphasise the importance of data protection as a necessity to preserve scientific standards. We argue that data protection {{is an integral part of}} social research and therefore has to be included in the design of research projects. Besides general and theoretical considerations, the article gives practical advice for <b>rendering</b> data sets <b>anonymous,</b> which is the main procedure in data protection. The comments are accompanied by examples drawn mainly from the research practice of the Division of Human Geography of the University of Zurich’s Department of Geography...|$|R
