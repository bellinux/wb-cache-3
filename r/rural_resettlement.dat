40|$|Resettlement as a {{response}} to food security has been practised in Ethiopia since the imperial regime. In all the respective governments, the aim was superficially the same-moving people from drought affected areas or over populated regions and over utilized land settlement to the so called fertile arable lands. Despite the different motives the programme has been launched, it has its own positive and negative impact on the relocated and the host community. Based on this background, this study explores the impact of the current Ethiopian resettlement on the livelihoods of the host and resettler community at Isara resettlement site of Dawuro Zone in Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples` Region (SNNPR) - a region which embraces over 56 ethnic groups. With the multi-cultural context of this region, the resettlement was carried out within the region from one zonal administration to the other zonal or special district administration. Accordingly, people from the Hadiya, Kambata, Tambaro, and Wolayta ethnic zones were moved to Dauwro ethnic zone. The people relocated from these zonal administrations have different socio-economic, cultural and historical backgrounds with the receiving zone, Dawuro Zone. According to the national <b>rural</b> development policy, <b>resettlement</b> was taken as a strategy to alleviate the plight of food security by moving people within the same region of similar socio-cultural, linguistic and historical make up. But the practice in SNNPR basically violates this reality and pushed to be implemented as a region. This study looks into the challenges of this context to maintain livelihood in the new area of settlement. It answers the following questions: what impacts does the resettlement have on the host and resettler community. What livelihood activities are practised by the resettler and host community? What is the current status of the livelihoods for the resettlers and host communities? The study clearly shows that the current resettlement practice at Isara site has predominantly negative impact on the livelihoods of the host and resettler communities. This impact was traced back to the poor provision of social and agricultural input services to the relocatees and the inconsistency of the promised infrastructural and social service institutions in the site. Above all, the inappropriate use or deforestation of the locally available livelihood resource made the matter worst. Meanwhile the growing number of relocated people in the new site aggravated the clearing of more forest land to agricultural settlement. This inevitably caused the ecological imbalance in the site. This contradicts with the basic livelihood concept which incorporates - the capacity, resources affordable and the activities to make a living. Here the demolished local forest and land resources cut of f the above livelihood cycle. Likewise, the capacity where the labour force is the dominant source, is affected by the poor psycho-social support for the relocated and challenge of social networking in the new site hinders the work force motivation and welfare. The poor health and education services in the site hold back the health status of the productive power and thus affect the capacity to make livelihood. Over all, the resettlement launched at Isara site has resulted in the loss of natural resources, and thus has dwindled the effort to sustain their livelihood for the present and future...|$|R

40|$|In China, in {{the midst}} of rapid urban expansion, {{research}} has been focused on the urban sector. The rural sector is by no means less significant, yet it is left largely unexplored. Losing the land rights for urban expansion, the rural communities suffered from the deterioration of socio-economic conditions. The central government announced a <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement</b> policy in 2005 to pursue an urban-rural balanced urbanization mode. After experimenting with this plan on a large scale for one decade, its effectiveness has not been explored comprehensively. Current studies on urbanization and rural land development in China focused on the central and provincial governments, seldom paying attention to the lower level. This research analyzed and compared the outcomes and equity implications of the <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement</b> policy under different governing modes in Tianjin, where the policy has been conducted on a large scale over a ten-year period. Case studies of seven <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement</b> projects in Tianjin were conducted, mainly using qualitative methods. Different governance modes in the implementation process were explored and categorized according to the network governance concept. Based on the data from a questionnaire survey, interviews and field observation, the outcomes and equity implications of this policy were assessed and evaluated. Working definitions of governance and urban-rural equity were also developed. This study revealed that the underlying objective of the <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement</b> policy was to transfer the rural land ownership from collective-owned to state-owned, though the overt objective is to improve the livelihood of the rural people. Furthermore, the rural communities were differentiated in accordance with their economic conditions. The district and town governments were given autonomy to deal with such complex situations. The competency and the expectations of the stakeholders in the process of project implementation were found to be essential {{in the formation of the}} three governance modes. In terms of policy performance, the effectiveness of the re-drawing of land rights was greatly influenced by local economic conditions; the fact that distribution of the compensation was more determined by the governance modes; and that, without considering the characteristics of the rural people, the development of the living environment could not be recognized as efficient. Furthermore, the objective of reshaping the rural people’s economic activities was frustrated by insufficient professional training for the resettled rural laborers. In terms of the policy implications on urban-rural equity, the wellbeing of resettled households, though improved in the aspect of public facility provision, social welfare provision for them was still considered deficient. Furthermore, the rural people’s perceptions of improvement in their lives were found closely related to their general satisfaction with the policy. Therefore, the implementation of the <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement</b> policy in Tianjin has contributed to the clarification of the rural land rights system and improvement of the living standards of rural residents to some extent. However, its efforts were impaired when it failed to consider fully the local conditions and the requirements of the rural communities. Thus, further clarification of the policy objectives and the implementation process open to public consultation are considered essential factors for further improvement. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|The {{tracking}} {{of the land}} use/land cover changes {{that took place in}} Essexdale Farm (a communal resettlement area in Marondera District of Zimbabwe) from the period 1985 to 2012 was conducted using the two methods: the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Trend Analysis and the calculation of changes in proportions of the land use/land cover classes. Four land classes: woodland, cropland, wooded grassland and wetland, were considered. The analysis of the stakeholder management framework was conducted using both the formal and informal survey methods to offer an explanation for the observed trends in the land cover changes. The NDVI Trend Analysis results revealed that there is evidence of woodland and wetland degradation as was shown by the decrease in the NDVI values of the corresponding land classes from 1985 to 2012. There was however insignificant change in the trend analysis of the cropland and wooded grassland land classes. There was a general increase in the proportion of land under woodland from 1985 to 2012. However the effects of the Fast Track Land Reform process were evidenced by an increase in the proportion of the cropland at the expense the woodland. Deforestation was identified by the stakeholders to be the main environmental problem and its contributing factors being the cutting down of trees for tobacco curing, clearing land for cultivation, selling of firewood to neighbouring towns and poverty. The clearing of land for cultivation under the post 2000 era, during the Government of Zimbabweâ€™s Fast-Track Resettlement Programme, emerged as the main contributing factor. It was also noticed that the conversion of the woodland to cropland and wooded grassland was more pronounced from 2000 to 2005 than was for 2006 to 2012. It was observed that there are now more than 265 families on Essexdale Farm, a figure which is almost double the carrying capacity of 136 families pegged by the land use planners in the Ministry of Lands and <b>Rural</b> <b>Resettlement,</b> Marondera district. There are also illegal settlers (who are not recorded in the official farm register at the District Offices) farming on marginal land. The suggested possible solutions to the environmental challenges were tree planting, environmental education and awareness campaigns and firebreak construction, as well as strict environmental law enforcement. It was noted that the practicability and the effectiveness of these environmental management strategies would only be realised in a well managed sustainable stakeholder framework. This would demand the necessary political will to initiate institutional reforms and restructuring, with the major move being to shift the A 1 land resettlement mandate from the Ministry of Local Government Rural and Urban Development to the more accountable Ministry of Lands and <b>Rural</b> <b>Resettlement</b> {{to deal with the problem}} of illegal resettlements.

It {{was because the}} area gained from other LULC classes could not satisfy the losses or conversions from their original extent. The dominant reasons that largely contributed to the reduction of forest cover were conversion of its initial extent into farmlands and settlement by about 47.37 % (960.98  ha), and shrubs by about 19.26 % (390.8  ha) despite some gains from farmland and settlement. It was partly attributed to forced resettlement program between 1987 and 1991. This {{could be due to}} forest clearing in search for additional farmlands and new settlement units in socialist regime, particularly during <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement</b> program. The demand for local construction material and fuel wood, and civil war between 1990 and 1991 were the other reasons for forestland decrease. Shrubs have also been diminished as a result of conversion of its initial extent largely into grasslands by about 27 % (1975.4  ha) and farmland and settlement by about 53.8 % (3925.9  ha) despite some gains in farmland and settlement. It was partly related to political instability and change of political structure of the country, which led to the clearance of shrubs for expansion of farmlands and new settlement centers. These revealed that further vegetation clearance in search for additional farmlands, new settlement units and grazing could eventually transform the initial extents of shrubs.|$|E

The Vietnam Government has implemented a range of policies to assist migration in order to address these environmental problems. While much research has focused on the environmental causes of, and responses to, climate change there has been less research on the impact of environmentally motivated responses to climate change on labour force and human capital factors. This paper examines the experience of the Vietnam Government in encouraging internal migration from vulnerable agricultural areas to urban industrial cities, to explore the human capital effects of these environmentally motivated response to climate change. The paper first presents the environmental argument for migration in response to climate change, together with examples of what the Vietnam Government has done to encourage migration from the rural (originating) areas to other <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement</b> and city (receiving) areas. It then uses data collected as part of recent study into the impact of government encouragement for internal migration to explore the labour force and human capital impacts in both the originating region and receiving areas. The findings suggest that while there are social and economic advantages there are challenges, including ensuring that job opportunities are available, migrants and appropriate skills, and that labour contracts provide for job security and healthy and safe working result in improved living conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a more integrated approach that acknowledges and addresses associated human capital (skills upgrading) and business development needs and integrates these with environmentally-motivated policies...|$|E
40|$|Fuelled by rapid urbanisation, urban spatial {{expansion}} is increasingly encroaching on the rural hinterland of large metropolises around the world, making {{a type of}} spatiality {{referred to as the}} “peri-urban” an important focal point for urban studies. Peri-urban residential settlement development in Chinese cities has been put on a fast track in recent years, however, its current situation has been little documented and its implications for sustainability not well understood. The main contributions of this research to the existing literature is considered to be two-fold: Firstly, this research has filled the research gap by providing a more up-to-date empirical study of peri-urban settlement development in the Chinese city of Tianjin with a specific focus on residential settlements and presenting the current and emerging challenges that face sustainable peri-urban settlement development; Secondly, this research has also made contributions to research in the context of sustainability by adopting an integrated research methodology that combines case-study-based systemic evaluation with assessment of stakeholder perspectives and decision-making dynamics. In this study, a theme-based evaluation framework is developed and used to assess the sustainability outcome of three recently developed peri-urban residential settlement cases in Tianjin, China, with each representing one typical peri-urban settlement type, i. e. <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement</b> project; affordable housing compound; and suburban commercial housing estate. Their specific approaches to achieving sustainable development are discussed, and remaining problems and challenges are identified and analyzed with suggestions for the complementary approaches and progression in the planning and management of peri-urban settlements.

By making a comparison between the delivered sustainability outcome of the settlement cases and the stakeholders’ perceptions on sustainability, it was revealed that lower levels of sustainability performance in the settlement development outcome coincided, to a large extent, with lower levels of conformation on the conceptions of sustainability between the decision-makers of the development and the residents of the communities developed...|$|E

The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate that Ben Shahn, Dorothea Lange, and Russell Lee, depicted RA/FSA recipients disguised as the Madonna and Child to legitimize and promote President Franklin D. Roosevelt?s ?New Deal? RA/FSA programs. A combination of formal and iconographical analysis of RA/FSA photographs manipulated by Ben Shahn, Dorothea Lange, and Russell Lee reveal the recurring motif of the Madonna and Child. A social art historical analysis of the patronage of the RA/FSA photographers, under the direction of Roy E.

Refugees arrive with a number of chronic health conditions that require ongoing management in a healthcare system where they lack knowledge and ability to navigate. This may encourage them to seek care that is easy to access but episodic and fragmented. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and reasons for accessing care via a local emergency department by resettling refugees during their first twelve months of resettlement. Methods: Using data from domestic health screening, crossmatching was done with the Emergency Department (ED) database of a local university medical center. Records were reviewed to determine If the ED was accessed for care, day and time care was accessed, chief complaint at the time of ED arrival, discharge diagnosis and final disposition. Results: Of 2616 refugees seen for health screening during 2011 - 2015, 77 (3 %) sought care in the ED at least one time during the twelve months following their arrival, encompassing a total of 96 unique ED visits. Of the 96 ED visits, 83 (86 %) were seen and discharged with the remaining 13 (14 %) being admitted to ULH or referred for admission to another facility (e. g., mental health). Of the 83 discharged visits, 51 (61 %) were determined to be preventable ED visits. Care was accessed more frequently on Monday (19 %), Sunday (18 %) and Thursday (17 %). 57 of the 83 discharged visits (69 %) occurred during hours that reflect those common for routine business in a clinic setting (8 AM - 4 PM). Of ED visits during those routine business hours, 34 (60 %) were determined to be preventable ED visits. Discussion: This study represents the first published data regarding ED use by refugees resettling into a single community. These data provide insight into the use of an ED as a point of care access and the role that access plays in refugee healthcare, especially during the earliest phase of resettlement. Conclusions: These data may serve to inform development of a refugee-centered medical home with the objective to improve access to coordinated and comprehensive care...|$|E
40|$|A conference {{paper on}} <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement</b> and {{contract}} farming in Zimbabwe. Until {{the introduction of}} the structural adjustment programme, post independent smallholder agriculture in Zimbabwe’s resettlement schemes was dominated by the state (Bratton, 1994). Inspired by the experiences of the socialist countries which had {{played a key role in}} the predominantly land based liberation struggle, the state played, for most resettlement schemes, the role of manager, deciding how, when and what was to be grown (Mumbengegwi, 1987). The state could afford to do this because it was the source for all inputs, from seeds fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides. This high-handed managerial role was complemented by another sophisticated one: control of marketing. Eager to get as much as possible from the peasants and doubting the ability of peasants to conduct marketing, the state cast itself as the only purchaser of resettlement produce. To capture grain from peasants as well as reduce wastages, the state installed, as everywhere in Africa, marketing depots, filling up these with state functionaries (Bates, 1981; Berry, 1984; Scott, 1998). For various reasons including those relating to the collapse of socialism, the state’s dominant role in resettlement agriculture has, now, been dismantled and from its ruins has emerged a new regime based on partnership with private business. With inputs in hand and assured markets for every crop sown under contract, private business promises a lighter yoke to the smallholder. While these partnerships now mark the landscape and continue to multiply with each new resettlement scheme, there is very little research problematising them. Even though there is a rich corpus of knowledge about contract farming elsewhere (Watts and Little, 1994; Barnett, 1984), we still do not know how these contracts are framed. There remains an agenda to unravel how these contracts are formed as well as to illuminate their nature. Could it be that these contracts are ambiguous on obligations of buyers and clear on obligations of growers? And what has been the impact of these contracts on the growers? These are pertinent questions as those touching on the significance of these contracts on the Zimbabwe’s unfolding resettlement and land reform programme. This paper represents an attempt to understand these new relationships in the context of land resettlement in Zimbabwe. In particular, I seek to understand how these agrarian contracts are framed, and what this framing means for smallholders. But I also seek to understand whether contract farming can complement and enrich the ongoing land reform and resettlement programme, which has tended to be mechanistic and state driven...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is an empirical study of postwar rural-urban migration among Acholi youth in Northern Uganda. In this thesis I {{look at the}} connection between rural land access among Acholi youth and their urban-rural social resettlement after the ceasefire between The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and the Ugandan People’s Defence Force (UPDF), from the theoretical framework of Everett S. Lee’s (1966) push and pull factors in migration. The social resettlement of Acholi youth after the war {{is seen in the}} light of their current rural land access. During my fieldtrip to Northern Uganda I interviewed 13 Acholi youths in rural, semi-urban and urban areas and four expert informants. According to perceptions of informants in this study, the majority of Acholi youth have not resettled in a rural place in spite of their regained rural land access. Hence, {{there seems to be a}} weak correlation between youths’ rural land access and their <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement.</b> This can be connected to what youth informants of this study perceive to be urban advantages or urban pull factors, like urban educational and economic opportunities, which enable a more diverse lifestyle than found in rural places. Urban and semi-urban environments of displacement during the war can have played a role in enhancing the awareness among Acholi youth of urban advantages. The study also suggests that postwar rural land access combined with postwar urban youth centralization have created blurred lines between rural and urban Acholi youth. For instance, for youth informants who now have their basic homestead in an urban place, it was not uncommon to be connected to rural land through part time rural agricultural activities. Additionally, many youth was reported to have resettled in rural places after the closure of the IDP camps even though some would prefer urban resettlement. Youth who are settled in urban places can often have parents who have resettled in a rural place. Lastly, several youth informants expressed a feeling of belonging to their rural customary land, as their place of origin, even though they have resettled in an urban place. With the lack of a clear urban/rural distinction between Acholi youth, a wave of increasing tendency to privatize land in Northern Uganda and a changing postwar mentality concerning the meaning of land and wealth, Acholi youth seem to have been put in a limbo between changes of modernity and the status quo of tradition embedded in their rural customary land. This was seen in their ambivalence towards having the interest to sell rural customary land, a desire to own their own private land, their longing for an identity based on their roots and origin and the continuity reflected in their rural customary land...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of the sociocultural ramifications of the migration / resettlement phenomenon. A rapidly increasing population sharing an affluently disparate world has contributed to an ever-increasing migrancy. A corollary of this migration, in an ethnically heterogeneous world, is that more people than ever find themselves living amid unfamiliar cultures. In consequence of this both settler and host communities are obliged to find modi vivendi with which to achieve harmonious coexistences. There appear to be three trajectories possible in such intercultural encounters: (1) the abandoning of ethnocultural lifeways by way of acculturation, (2) the reification of existing cultures, and (3) the exchanging of cultural values. To what degree individuals or groups are prepared to compromise their ethnic identities or cultural values in achieving modi vivendi is dependent on circumstance. Via an analysis of the sociocultural changes that have occurred in a specific Philippine zone of resettlement I demonstrate that integration into new societies is less fraught where mutual cultural exchange takes place. In the course of the twentieth century the Philippines experienced a ten-fold increase in its population. The demographic imperative – coupled with the recognition by both colonial and independent administrations that an increase in land inventories was required to ensure food security, improve livelihoods, and ameliorate social unrest – created the conditions for the resettlement of millions of Filipinos to less populated regions. However, the Philippine’s polyethnicity dictated that this internal migration would have implications for intercultural accommodations, ones that state planners and bureaucrats had failed to anticipate. To comprehend the complex intercultural interactions that have taken place – and the requisite cultural compromises required in achieving modi vivendi – I have chosen the former state-sponsored resettlement scheme centred on Narra / Palawan 1 as a representative model. This thesis analyses the manner and degree of the sociocultural changes that have taken place in heterogeneous populations dislocated by Philippine <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement</b> programs – a process I term transmigration. For many, this internal, inter-island, inter-provincial, rural-to-rural population transfer experience has not proved socially onerous – integration into new societies has been unproblematic. I chose the Narra / Palawan resettlement zone to test the hypothesis that interethnic harmony is contingent upon the degree to which individuals and groups are prepared to adapt their lifeways by means of a mutual exchange of cultural particularities – a process I term transculturation. Not all resettlement in the Philippines – as the tribulations of the Mindanao resettlement zone attest – have gone unchallenged. It is the contrary outcomes in intercultural encounters, in both Mindanao and the wider migrancy world, that were at once the catalyst for this study and a means for understanding the potential possible in such encounters. While fieldwork for this thesis was confined to the Municipality of Narra in the Province of Palawan I draw on exemplars of resettlement in the wider world to help decode the observable sociocultural transformations that have occurred in Narra. As reference points the scholarship of others investigating a wide range of archipelagic 2 resettlement scenarios has been drawn upon. To comprehend and anchor the progression of cultural change in the Narra ‘contact zone’ I chose as a framing theory the Ortizian concept transculturation in conjunction with that of ethnic identity theory. To determine the trajectory, degree of interaction, rate of change and its ramifications for a wider resettlement world, the thesis poses two fundamental questions: (1) ‘What cultural changes take place among heterogeneous populations disrupted by resettlement?’ and (2) ‘Under which circumstances are transmigrant ethnocultural identities maintained, diminished or amplified during this process?’ Just as cultures are made of continuities and changes, in Narra I discerned that cultural exchange was an ongoing process, one from which observable inferences could be gleaned. Individual interviews and engagement with key informants provided the data that determined Narra as a zone of transculturation. Although the requisite intercultural interaction necessary for harmonious interethnic coexistences has failed to replicate in all resettlement milieux, this thesis suggests that as a model for such coexistences Narra provides an exemplar that is paradigmatic for ongoing migration / resettlement scenarios...|$|E
40|$|US Highway 62 {{crosses the}} town of Ropesville, {{population}} 480, between Lubbock and Brownfield on the South Plains of Texas. To {{the north and west}} of town, scattered among the suburban-style homes of contemporary farmers, stand several dozen small cottages of identical design. Some are still occupied, many nothing more than ruins, and a few have been added on to, stuccoed, or provided a screened porch. All are surrounded by cotton fields and most are accompanied by ramshackle outbuildings, rusted tractors, dormant windmills, and sealed irrigation wells. These farmsteads are the remains of a rural community project constructed by the federal government during the Great Depression for the resettlement of seventy-six impoverished farm families. The Ropesville Project was one of ninety-nine that were planned and built by the New Deal 2 ̆ 7 s controversial community building program. These communities were initiated during {{the early stages of the}} New Deal by the Division of Subsistence Homesteads of the Department of the Interior, then taken over by the Rural Rehabilitation Division of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). In 1935, the two agencies were transferred to the Resettlement Administration (RA) which was replaced by the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in 1937. 1 These programs, founded on a variety of social and economic theories and ideals, were all based on the belief that rational planning could guarantee a humane, democratic, and egalitarian way of life on the land. While the history of the Ropesville Project reveals much about the community building program, life as a resettlement client, and the long term effects of New Deal social planning, the paper that follows is primarily concerned with the project 2 ̆ 7 s beginnings-particularly the involvement of the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce in its initial development. This story exposes a hidden interaction between the ideals of the New Deal community program, the ambitions of elites on the local level, and the realities of farming on the South Plains. The resettlement community building program was the most ambitious and controversial effort launched by the New Deal to rehabilitate the rural poor. The communities were to provide settlers with a lifestyle few American farmers had experienced, including homes with modern plumbing and electricity; freedom from the constant threat of eviction because of market vagaries or climate; financial security for the future; and educational and cultural facilities as an integral part of community life. Although the New Deal community program is commonly associated with radical left-wing economist Rexford Tugwell and his Resettlement Administration, the concept for <b>rural</b> <b>resettlement</b> communities was proposed by agricultural economist M. L. Wilson of Montana State College. His plan called for 2 ̆ 2 subsistence homestead 2 ̆ 2 communities, in which settlers would grow food on small plots of land while they earned wages in decentralized rural industries. Residents of such subsistence communities would not add to the surpluses of commercial agriculture markets, but would have the means to feed themselves in economic downturns. The plan would also secure for them a part of the vanishing rural lifestyle that Wilson admired. 2 The plan seemed communistic to local and congressional conservatives. For every supporter, there was an opponent who doubted industry could be lured to the countryside. The Division of Subsistence Homesteads of the Department of the Interior, established by executive order in August of 1933 with Wilson as chief, drew criticism because of high costs and the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s strict control over the development of the communities. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes insisted local control would invite graft while his opponents felt that local control offered flexibility. An alternative to tight federal control was offered by the Division of Rural Rehabilitation of the FERA in 1934. 3 The FERA 2 ̆ 7 s rural rehabilitation plan was to be administered on the state level by corporations managed by a board of directors comprised of prominent agriculturalists, educators, and businessmen. Most of the funds were earmarked for direct loans to individual farmers, but the construction of 2 ̆ 2 rural-industrial 2 ̆ 2 resettlement communities in drought areas, the cut-over regions of the Great Lakes, and the coal mining regions of the Appalachians and Ozarks was a small, but significant, part of the FERA 2 ̆ 7 s program. ...|$|E
