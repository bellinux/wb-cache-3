40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} – the global roles of currencies. The concept combines the domestic and international (cross-border) use of currencies and therefore captures the overall importance of different currencies in a globalised economy. The measure of a currency’s global role {{is based on the}} size and stage of development of the underlying economy, as well as the size and stage of development of its financial markets and the scope of financial instruments available in this currency. The paper applies the concept to 22 currencies of advanced and emerging economies. The results confirm the well-known ranking for the leading currencies – in particular the US dollar and the euro – but give considerably greater weight to currencies of emerging economies than the results obtained from the international debt market, which has so far been used as the basis for measuring the international role of currencies in capital markets. The paper also discusses this established measure in detail, arguing that in view of financial globalisation, an indicator based on currency shares in the international debt market alone re{{presents a}} decreasing share of international financial market activity, as this market excludes government debt, other domestic debt and equities, which are in- creasingly of interest to international investors. The paper also presents an empirical application of the new global concept to examine cross-border portfolio holdings in debt and equity markets across advanced and emerging economies. It finds that the global <b>role</b> <b>indicator</b> is positively correlated with such holdings and, especially for emerging economies, fares better than the established international debt market indicator. The findings suggest a positive relationship between domestic financial development and international financial integration.

It reviews factors influencing the development of performance indicators, such as the growing concern for accountability in public higher education and the university community's apparent inability to develop and communicate what are regarded as effective accountability mechanisms of its own. The paper goes on to examine the <b>role</b> of <b>indicators</b> in the planning and policy process, including the improvement of educational quality and the perception of the university. It reviews the <b>role</b> of <b>indicators</b> in developing an accountability framework, something that Queen's University has done to help assess progress toward key institutional goals. The paper notes that the <b>role</b> of <b>indicators</b> in government relations includes communicating the successes and shortcomings of institutions to inform government administrators, elected officials, and the general public. Implications for institutional research include the improvement of organizational effectiveness and accountability. (Contains 13 references.)

40|$|This article {{examines}} the various <b>roles</b> that <b>indicators,</b> as boundary objects, can play as a science-based evidence for policy processes. It presents two case studies from the EU-funded POINT project that analyzed the use and infl uence of two highly different types of indicators: composite indicators of sustainable development at the EU level and energy indicators in the UK. In both cases indicators failed as direct input to policy making, yet they generated various types of conceptual and political use and infl uence. The composite sustainable development indicators served as "framework indicators", helping to advocate a specifi c vision of sustainable development, whereas the energy indicators produced various types of indirect infl uence, including {{through the process of}} indicator elaboration. Our case studies demonstrate the relatively limited importance of the characteristics and quality of indicators in determining the <b>role</b> of <b>indicators,</b> as compared with the crucial importance of "user factors" (characteristics of policy actors) and "policy factors" (policy context).

40|$|Abstract: The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the organizational perspective on improvement in performance of its mid-career professionals, as a result of their Executive MBA education in Pakistan. More specifically the study includes the identification of critical roles, which organizations consider important for the performance evaluation of mid-career professionals, and organizations’ perception of how effectively EMBA graduates perform those roles at workplace. The study mainly used a quantitative research strategy and cross sectional survey method to collect data through a structured self-administered questionnaire. Ninety three organizations responded to this survey and provided data about 140 EMBA professionals. The feedback from organisations about important role-based performance indicators and EMBA graduate managers’ performance against those indicators were obtained. Results revealed that organizations consider the work related role as the most important aspect of evaluation, followed by team related, career related, innovation related and organization citizenship related roles. Results on the efficacy of EMBA programs against these <b>role</b> <b>indicators</b> showed that though by and large organizations were satisfied there existed a gap between each of the required roles...|$|R

40|$|The article {{explores the}} social {{role played by}} family firms, with some {{comparisons}} with non-family ones. Firms’ social role has been measured by various indicators like: contribution to employment, orientation to growth, propensity to give peer opportunities to men and women, capacity to help people manage the relationships between family and work, owning family’s philantrophic activities outside the family firms. All things being equal, the paper starts from two basic hypotheses: 1) family businesses feature higher levels of social <b>role</b> <b>indicators</b> with respect to non-family ones; 2) the stronger social commitment of family businesses is particularly evident in less developed geographical areas. Both hypotheses have been tested on a sample of 620 Italian family and non-family companies of small and medium size, representative of the manufacturing and non-manufacturing business population. They have been partially verified, particularly: family firms represent the biggest source of employment and they feature higher propensity to increase their number of employees; they offer women more opportunities both {{to make a career}} and to balance work and family; the resources they generate are often invested in philantrophy...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{a theory}} of grammar which incorporated Chomsky's distinction between deep and surface structure and accepts Fillmore's proposal to exclude such subject and concepts as direct object from the base structure. While recognizing the need for specifying an underlying set of caselike relations, it is proposed that this need can best be met by hypothesizing base structure entities called <b>role</b> <b>indicators.</b> According to this theory, the input for linguistic encoding is identified at the perceptual level. The structured entity {{can be referred to}} as an event, which is primarily composed of a process or attribute and one or more things in perceived relations to one another. Events are encoded at the basal linguistic level as structured entities which may be referred to as constructs. The output at the overt level, after appropriate syntactic and phonological elements are added, is the structured entity called the sentence. The underlying structure is viewed as being divided into three components: basal, operative, and expressive. This form of grammar can provide insights into criteria for language differences and deficiencies and can suggest that child language may have less syntactic complexity than researchers have attributed to it.
