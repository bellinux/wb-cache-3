40|$|When {{cells of}} a marine pseudomonad were washed and {{suspended}} in 0. 5 m sucrose, they <b>retained</b> their <b>rod</b> shape, but thin sections, when examined in an electron microscope, {{revealed that the}} outer layer of the cell wall had separated a considerable distance from the cytoplasmic membrane. Treatment of such cells with lysozyme alone produced no obvious change, but treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) alone caused the outer wall to disappear. A combination of EDTA and lysozyme resulted in the rapid formation of spheres essentially free from hexosamine and indistinguishable from protoplasts of gram-positive bacteria. When cells were washed with 0. 5 m NaCl and then suspended in 0. 5 m sucrose, they also <b>retained</b> their <b>rod</b> shape, {{but in this case}} the outer layer separated from the cells completely and could be recovered from the suspending medium. Such cells were converted to protoplasts by the action of lysozyme alone. Cells washed and finally suspended in 0. 5 m NaCl, when treated with EDTA and lysozyme, slowly became spherical.

40|$|Background Blue Cone Monochromacy (BCM) is an X-linked {{retinopathy}} {{caused by}} mutations in the OPN 1 LW / OPN 1 MW gene cluster, encoding long (L) - and middle (M) -wavelength sensitive cone opsins. Recent evidence shows sufficient structural integrity of cone photoreceptors in BCM to warrant consideration {{of a gene}} therapy approach to the disease. In the present study, the vision in BCM is examined, specifically seeking clinically-feasible outcomes for a future clinical trial. Methods BCM patients (n = 25, ages 5 – 72) were studied with kinetic and static chromatic perimetry, full-field sensitivity testing, and eye movement recordings. Vision at the fovea and parafovea was probed with chromatic microperimetry. Results Kinetic fields with a Goldmann size V target were generally full. Short-wavelength (S-) sensitive cone function was normal or near normal in most patients. Light-adapted perimetry results on conventional background lights were abnormally reduced; 600 -nm stimuli were seen by rods whereas white stimuli were seen by both rods and S-cones. Under dark-adapted conditions, 500 -nm stimuli were seen by rods in both BCM and normals. Spectral sensitivity functions in the superior retina showed <b>retained</b> <b>rod</b> and S-cone functions in BCM under dark-adapted and light-adapted conditions. In the fovea, normal subjects showed L/M-cone mediation using a 650 -nm stimulus under dark-adapted conditions, whereas BCM patients had reduced sensitivity driven by rod vision. Full-field red stimuli on bright blue backgrounds were seen by L/M-cones in normal subjects whereas BCM patients had abnormally reduced and rod-mediated sensitivities. Fixation location could vary from fovea to parafovea. Chromatic microperimetry demonstrated a large loss of sensitivity to red stimuli presented on a cyan adapting background at the anatomical fovea and surrounding parafovea. Conclusions BCM rods continue to signal vision under conditions normally associated with daylight vision. Localized and retina-wide outcome measures were examined to evaluate possible improvement of L/M-cone-based vision in a clinical trial...|$|R

40|$|Mutations in the EYS (eyes shut homolog) gene are {{a common}} cause of {{autosomal}} recessive (ar) retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Without a mammalian model of human EYS disease, there is limited understanding of details of disease expression and rates of progression of the retinal degeneration. We studied clinically and with chromatic static perimetry, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and en face autofluoresence imaging, a cohort of 15 patients (ages 12 – 51 at first visit), {{some of whom had}} longitudinal data of function and structure.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} cell envelope is {{of critical importance}} to the function and survival of the cell; it acts as a barrier against harmful toxins while allowing the flow of nutrients into the cell. It {{also serves as a}} point of physical contact between a {{bacterial cell}} and its host. Hence, the cell envelope of Rhizobium leguminosarum is critical to cell survival under both free-living and symbiotic conditions. Transposon mutagenesis of R. leguminosarum strain 3841 followed by a screen to isolate mutants with defective cell envelopes led to the identification of a novel conserved operon (RL 3499 -RL 3502) consisting of a putative moxR-like AAA ATPase, a hypothetical protein with a domain of unknown function (designated domain of unknown function 58), and two hypothetical transmembrane proteins. Mutation of genes within this operon resulted in increased sensitivity to membrane-disruptive agents such as detergents, hydrophobic antibiotics, and alkaline pH. On minimal media, the mutants <b>retain</b> their <b>rod</b> shape but are roughly 3 times larger than the wild type. On media containing glycine or peptides such as yeast extract, the mutants form large, distorted spheres and are incapable of sustained growth under these culture conditions. Expression of the operon is maximal during the stationary phase of growth and is reduced in a chvG mutant, indicating a role for this sensor kinase in regulation of the operon. Our findings provide the first functional insight into these genes of unknown function, suggesting a possible role in cell envelope development in Rhizobium leguminosarum.

40|$|The phycobilisome (PBS) is a supramolecular antenna complex {{required}} for photosynthesis in cyanobacteria and bilin-containing red algae. While the basic architecture of PBS is widely conserved, the phycobiliproteins, core structure and linker polypeptides, show significant diversity across different species. By contrast, we recently {{reported that the}} unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 possesses two types of PBSs that differ in their interconnecting “rod-core linker” proteins (CpcG 1 and CpcG 2). CpcG 1 -PBS {{was found to be}} equivalent to conventional PBS, whereas CpcG 2 -PBS <b>retains</b> phycocyanin <b>rods</b> but is devoid of the central core. This study describes the functional analysis of CpcG 1 -PBS and CpcG 2 -PBS. Specific energy transfer from PBS to photosystems that was estimated for cells and thylakoid membranes based on low-temperature fluorescence showed that CpcG 2 -PBS transfers light energy preferentially to photosystem I (PSI) compared to CpcG 1 -PBS, although they are able to transfer to both photosystems. The preferential energy transfer was also supported by the increased photosystem stoichiometry (PSI/PSII) in the cpcG 2 disruptant. The cpcG 2 disruptant consistently showed retarded growth under weak PSII light, in which excitation of PSI is limited. Isolation of thylakoid membranes with high salt showed that CpcG 2 -PBS is tightly associated with the membrane, while CpcG 1 -PBS is partly released. CpcG 2 is characterized by its C-terminal hydrophobic segment, which may anchor CpcG 2 -PBS to the thylakoid membrane or PSI complex. Further sequence analysis revealed that CpcG 2 -like proteins containing a C-terminal hydrophobic segment are widely distributed in many cyanobacteria...|$|R

5000|$|Winchester {{at first}} did not submit a carbine design, {{as it was}} {{occupied}} in developing the [...]30-06 Winchester M2 Military Rifle. The rifle originated as a design by Jonathan [...] "Ed" [...] Browning, brother of the famous firearm designer John Browning. A couple of months after Ed Browning's death in May 1939, Winchester hired David Marshall [...] "Carbine" [...] Williams who had begun work on a short-stroke gas piston design while serving a prison sentence at a North Carolina minimum-security work farm.

40|$|Peripherin- 2 is {{a member}} of the tetraspanin family of {{membrane}} proteins that plays a critical role in photoreceptor outer segment disk morphogenesis. Mutations in peripherin- 2 are responsible for various retinal degenerative diseases including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP). To identify determinants required for peripherin- 2 targeting to disk membranes and elucidate mechanisms underlying ADRP, we have generated transgenic Xenopus tadpoles expressing wild-type and ADRP-linked peripherin- 2 mutants as green fluorescent fusion proteins in rod photoreceptors. Wild-type peripherin- 2 and P 216 L and C 150 S mutants, which assemble as tetramers, targeted to disk membranes as visualized by confocal and electron microscopy. In contrast the C 214 S and L 185 P mutants, which form homodimers, but not tetramers, were <b>retained</b> in the <b>rod</b> inner segment. Only the P 216 L disease mutant induced photoreceptor degeneration. These results indicate that tetramerization is required for peripherin- 2 targeting and incorporation into disk membranes. Tetramerization-defective mutants cause ADRP through a deficiency in wild-type peripherin- 2, whereas tetramerization-competent P 216 L peripherin- 2 causes ADRP through a dominant negative effect, possibly arising from the introduction of a new oligosaccharide chain that destabilizes disks. Our results further indicate that a checkpoint between the photoreceptor inner and outer segments allows only correctly assembled peripherin- 2 tetramers to be incorporated into nascent disk membranes...|$|R

This study examined the surface fractures, and the micro-structural changes before and after machining the carbon fibre rod. As part of the study, the tensile strength of the carbon fibre rod after machining was observed and stress and strain graphs were plotted.

40|$|The {{photoreceptor}} {{cells of}} the vertebrate retina share a common morphological design and molecular scheme for phototransduction. Within this framework, there are great functional differences with respect to response amplification, kinetics, and adaptability to different mean light levels, first, between the two main classes of photoreceptors, rods and cones, and second, between different taxonomic groups. The present thesis analyses functional differences and similarities between i) mammalian and amphibian photoreceptors, and ii) rods and cones by studying effects of temperature on electrophysiological response properties. The research is based on characterisation of sensitivity and photoresponse kinetics in rods and cones of two mammals (rat and mouse), and two amphibians (frog and toad). Photoresponses to light pulses of incremental strength were recorded by the electroretinogram (ERG) technique across isolated aspartate-treated retinas at different temperatures in the range 2 - 37 °C, and {{at different levels of}} mean illumination. One objective was to investigate how the major functional differences between different vertebrate photoreceptors can be explained without assuming large differences in the properties of the phototransduction molecules. A general conclusion is that at the same temperature photoreceptors of mammals and amphibians exhibit similar functional properties. In rods, the remaining differences in the electrophysiological properties can largely be explained by differences in outer-segment size and morphology. In cones the picture is more complex due to the highly folded structure of the outer segment as well as the presence of thermal isomerizations of visual pigment, which may occur at a rate possibly high enough to 'light-adapt' cones in darkness. Another objective was to relate the capacity for temporal integration of dark-adapted rod photoreceptors to the integration time of vision and absolute visual sensitivity. A strong correlation was found between temporal integration in rods and in a visually guided behaviour of toads at different temperatures. The results allow the conclusion that temporal integration is mainly set by the rods and explains a considerable part of differences in absolute visual sensitivity between amphibians and mammals. The thesis also includes a project in which the aim was to develop a method where the vertebrate retina {{could be used as a}} biosensor for monitoring controlled drug release from temperature-sensitive polymeric carriers. The developed method enabled accurate concentration determinations of the model drug 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX) based on the square root dependence of photoresponse kinetics on [IBMX] discovered in the work. Moreover, the biocompatibility of drug carriers can be assessed by the degree to which <b>rods</b> <b>retain</b> stable function in the presence of the carrier molecule, or its monomers...|$|R
