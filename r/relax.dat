Using {{the notion of}} <b>relaxed</b> input, where the ordinary real-valued control input {{is replaced by a}} measure-valued control input, we are able to manipulate the original system such that the resulting <b>relaxed</b> system is amenable to control. We show the applicability of using <b>relaxed</b> input for transforming a non-affine nonlinear system into an affine one such that the <b>relaxed</b> system has desirable control properties. Finally, we present a practical implementation of <b>relaxed</b> input via ordinary control input which is based on the sampled-data of the <b>relaxed</b> input...|$|R

40|$|We give an {{overview}} of the Theory of <b>Relaxed</b> Unification—a novel theory that extends the classical Theory of Unification. Classical unification requires a perfect agreement between the terms being unified. In practice, data is seldom error-free and can contain inconsistent information. Classical unification fails when the data is imperfect. We propose the Theory of <b>Relaxed</b> Unification as a new theory that <b>relaxes</b> the constraints of classical unification without requiring special preprocessing of data. <b>Relaxed</b> unification tolerates possible errors and inconsistencies in the data and facilitate reasoning under uncertainty. The Theory of <b>Relaxed</b> Unification is more general and has higher efficacy than the classical Theory of Unification. We present the fundamental concepts of <b>relaxed</b> unification, a <b>relaxed</b> unification algorithm, a number of examples...|$|R

5000|$|Relaxation: One way to {{categorize}} the <b>relaxed</b> consistency is to define which sequential consistency requirements are <b>relaxed.</b> We can have less strict models by <b>relaxing</b> either program order or write atomicity requirements defined by Adve and Gharachorloo, 1996.

40|$|We {{consider}} an optimal control problem {{described by a}} semilinear parabolic partial differential equation, with control and state constraints, where the state constraints and cost involve also the state gradient. Since this problem may have no classical solutions, it is reformulated in the <b>relaxed</b> form. The <b>relaxed</b> control problem is discretized by using a finite element method in space involving numerical integration and an implicit theta-scheme in time for space approximation, while the controls are approximated by blockwise constant <b>relaxed</b> controls. Under appropriate assumptions, we prove that <b>relaxed</b> accumulation points of sequences of optimal (resp. admissible and extremal) discrete <b>relaxed</b> controls are optimal (resp. admissible and extremal) for the continuous <b>relaxed</b> problem. We then apply a penalized conditional descent method to each discrete problem, and also a progressively refining version of this method to the continuous <b>relaxed</b> problem.

The <b>relaxing</b> protein prepared in the presence of ethylene glycol-bis (/S-aminoethylether) -N, N'-tetraacetic acid contained 4. 9 moles of sulfhydryl groups (SH) per 105 g. When incubated with N-ethylmaleimide, the SH content of the <b>relaxing</b> protein was reduced to 1. 3 moles per 105 g, whereas the <b>relaxing</b> activity of the protein was affected very little.
