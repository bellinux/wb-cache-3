Methodology Sixty human single-rooted teeth with fully formed apices were collected and decoronated. The root canals were instrumented, and then obturated with thermoplasticized gutta-percha using AH- 26 as the sealer. The roots were randomly divided into 12 different groups, and apical root-end resections were performed using eight different instrument configurations, and two different directions in which the bur moved across the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> in relation to its direction of rotation. Epoxy resin replicas of the resected root ends were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Results Each instrument produced a characteristic surface finish on the resected root end that mirrored its cutting profile. Irrespective of the design of the bur used, smearing and shredding of the gutta-percha across the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> occurred only when the handpiece was moved across the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> in reverse direction in relation to the direction of rotation of the bur. Conclusions To ensure minimal disruption and distortion of the root filling and to prevent shredding of the gutta-percha interface, care should be taken to ensure that the final pass of the bur across the root canal is in the correct direction in relation to its direction of rotation...|$|E

More precisely, {{we use the}} domain Markov property of the UIHPT to construct the so-called peeling processes and we encode information about percolation clusters with these processes. 1 Definitions and enumerative background Recall that a planar triangulation with simple boundary is a rooted planar map such that every non-root face has degree 3, and such that the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> has a simple boundary. When the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> is of degree m, it is also called a triangulation of the m-gon.

Note that the boundary vertices of a triangulation of the half-plane are naturally indexed by Z, with the root vertex being of index 0. By convention, all triangulations considered below are of type II (i. e. no self-loops but may have multiple edges, c. f. exercises for lecture I).

It is stated in terms of a remainder obtained when a certain power series in the four remaining variables, slightly transformed, is divided by a certain polynomial...|$|E

40|$|Tropisms {{represent}} fascinating {{examples of}} how plants respond to environmental signals by adapting their growth and development. Here, a novel tropism is reported, halotropism, allowing plant seedlings to reduce their exposure to salinity by circumventing a saline environment. In response to a salt gradient, Arabidopsis, tomato, and sorghum roots were found to actively prioritize growth away from salinity above following the gravity axis. Directionality of this response is established by an active redistribution of the plant hormone auxin in the root tip, which is mediated by the PIN-FORMED 2 (PIN 2) auxin efflux carrier. We show that salt-induced phospholipase D activity stimulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis of PIN 2 {{at the side of}} the <b>root</b> <b>facing</b> the higher salt concentration. The intracellular relocalization of PIN 2 allows for auxin redistribution and for the directional bending of the root away from the higher salt concentration.

40|$|AbstractApical {{surgery is}} {{considered}} a standard oral surgical procedure. It is often a last resort to surgically maintain a tooth with a periapical lesion that cannot be managed with conventional endodontic (re-) treatment. The main goal of apical surgery is to prevent bacterial leakage from the root-canal system into the periradicular tissues by placing a tight root-end filling following root-end resection. Clinicians are advised to utilize a surgical microscope to perform apical surgery to benefit from magnification and illumination. In addition, the application of microsurgical techniques in apical surgery, i. e., gentle incision and flap elevation, production of a small osteotomy, {{and the use of}} sonic- or ultrasonic driven microtips, will result in less trauma to the patient and faster postsurgical healing. A major step in apical surgery is to identify possible leakage areas at the cut <b>root</b> <b>face</b> and subsequently to ensure adequate root-end filling. Only a tight and persistent apical obturation will allow periapical healing with good long-term prognosis. The present paper describes current indications, techniques and outcome of apical surgery...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of apical {{surgery is}} to {{hermetically}} seal the root canal system after root-end resection, thereby enabling periradicular healing. The {{objective of this}} nonrandomized prospective clinical study was to report results of 2 different root-end preparation and filling methods, ie, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and an adhesive resin composite (Retroplast). METHODS: The study included 353 consecutive cases with endodontic lesions limited to the periapical area. Root-end cavities were prepared with sonic microtips and filled with MTA (n = 178), or alternatively, a shallow concavity was prepared in the cut <b>root</b> <b>face,</b> with subsequent placement of an adhesive resin composite (Retroplast) (n = 175). Patients were recalled after 1 year. Cases were defined as healed when no clinical signs or symptoms were present and radiographs demonstrated complete or incomplete (scar tissue) healing of previous radiolucencies. RESULTS: The overall rate of healed cases was 85. 5 %. MTA-treated teeth demonstrated a significantly (P =. 003) higher rate of healed cases (91. 3 %) compared with Retroplast-treated teeth (79. 5 %). Within the MTA group, 89. 5 %- 100 % of cases were classified as healed, {{depending on the type}} of treated tooth. In contrast, more variable rates ranging from 66. 7 %- 100 % were found in the Retroplast group. In particular, mandibular premolars and molars demonstrated considerably lower rates of healed cases when treated with Retroplast. CONCLUSIONS: MTA can be recommended for root-end filling in apical surgery, irrespective of the type of treated tooth. Retroplast should be used with caution for root-end sealing in apical surgery of mandibular premolars and molars...|$|E

A saliva challenge model {{was used to}} compare resistance to bacterial penetration of these alkaline cements to conventional root fillings that combine gutta percha (GP) with epoxy resin sealers. A sample of 140 human roots with single straight canals prepared to standard length and canal size were obturated with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) (Nex MTA or MTAmix), with an alkaline calcium hydroxide hard setting cement (Supercal), or with GP and a resin cement (either AH-Plus or Zirmix). Negative control roots were sealed with wax, while positive controls were left open. The test assemblies were gamma sterilised, then the coronal <b>root</b> <b>face</b> was exposed daily to fresh stimulated human saliva diluted in broth. Bacterial penetration was determined by assessing growth in sterile brain-heart infusion (BHI) medium in contact with the root apex.

In addition, statistically significant differences were noted between Supercal and AH-Plus, and between the two MTA cements. It can be concluded that alkaline cements, particularly Supercal, can show considerable resistance to bacterial penetration from constant saliva challenge, and provide superior sealing ability in comparison to resin cements. While this property is due mostly to dimensional stability, the release of hydroxide ions could be a contributing factor to impaired bacterial survival, and this aspect should be explored further...|$|E

Despite substantial efforts by the American government to mend this issue, reforms have yielded minimal improvement in results. Identifying the reasons for the declining nature of US education is essential in understanding how to improve the current academic state. Why has there been a decline in education quality in America compared to other first-world countries since World War II? In order to distinguish the characteristics correlating with low-achievement in the US, I examined cross-cultural comparisons between America and top-achieving nations. Once the absent or abnormal markers of American education were identified, I investigated possible roots through economic, social, and political perspectives. Results suggest the decline in American education is the consequence of lingering effects of the Cold War, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Standards Movement. These major societal events created a state of argument between levels of government and their partisan groups. Their products—misled reforms, drains of educational funding, poor curriculum decisions, and attempts at privatization—have contributed to poor academic achievement.
