Of the six double mutants, only the <b>rad-</b> 1;rad- 2 and <b>rad-</b> 3;rad- 7 doubles were no more hypersensitive than the most sensitive single mutant to UV-radiation. Thus, <b>rad-</b> 1 and <b>rad-</b> 2 define one epistasis group, whereas <b>rad-</b> 3 and <b>rad-</b> 7 define another. Consistent with this model was the observation that <b>rad-</b> 1 and <b>rad-</b> 2, but not <b>rad-</b> 3 and <b>rad-</b> 7, were hypersensitive to γ-radiation.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the role of Caenorhabditis elegans <b>RAD-</b> 51 during meiotic prophase and embryogenesis, making use of the silencing effect of RNA interference (RNAi). <b>rad-</b> 51 RNAi leads to severe defects in chromosome morphology in diakinesis oocytes. We have explored the effect of <b>rad-</b> 51 RNAi in mutants lacking fundamental components of the recombination machinery. If double-strand breaks are prevented by spo- 11 mutation, <b>rad-</b> 51 RNAi does not affect chromosome appearance. This {{is consistent with a}} role for <b>RAD-</b> 51 downstream of the initiation of recombination. In the absence of MRE- 11, as in the absence of SPO- 11, <b>RAD-</b> 51 depletion has no effect on the chromosomes, which appear intact, thus indicating a role for MRE- 11 in DSB induction. Intriguingly, <b>rad-</b> 51 silencing in oocytes that lack MSH- 5 leads to chromosome fragmentation, a novel trait that is distinct from that seen in msh- 5 mutants and in <b>rad-</b> 51 RNAi oocytes, suggesting new potential roles for the msh- 5 gene. Silencing of the <b>rad-</b> 51 gene also causes a reduction in fecundity, which is suppressed by mutation in the DNA damage checkpoint gene <b>rad-</b> 5, but not in the cell death effector gene ced- 3.

40|$|The BRCA 2 tumor {{suppressor}} is {{implicated in}} DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR), where it regulates the RAD 51 recombinase. We describe a BRCA 2 -related protein of Caenorhabditis elegans (CeBRC- 2) that interacts directly with <b>RAD-</b> 51 via a single BRC motif and that binds preferentially to single-stranded DNA through an oligonucleotide-oligosaccharide binding fold. Cebrc- 2 mutants fail to repair meiotic or radiation-induced DSBs by HR due to inefficient <b>RAD-</b> 51 nuclear localization and {{a failure to}} target <b>RAD-</b> 51 to sites of DSBs. Genetic and cytological comparisons of Cebrc- 2 and <b>rad-</b> 51 mutants revealed fundamental phenotypic differences that suggest a role for Cebrc- 2 in promoting {{the use of an}} alternative repair pathway in the absence of <b>rad-</b> 51 and independent of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Unlike <b>rad-</b> 51 mutants, Cebrc- 2 mutants also accumulate RPA- 1 at DSBs, and abnormal chromosome aggregates that arise during the meiotic prophase can be rescued by blocking the NHEJ pathway. CeBRC- 2 also forms foci in response to DNA damage and can do so independently of <b>rad-</b> 51. Thus, CeBRC- 2 not only regulates <b>RAD-</b> 51 during HR but can also function independently of <b>rad-</b> 51 in DSB repair processes...|$|R
40|$|Misfolded {{proteins}} accumulate and aggregate in neurodegenerative disease. The {{existence of}} these deposits reflects a derangement in the protein homeostasis machinery. Using a candidate gene screen, we report that loss of <b>RAD-</b> 23 protects against the toxicity of proteins known to aggregate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Loss of <b>RAD-</b> 23 suppresses the locomotor deficit of Caenorhabditis elegans engineered to express mutTDP- 43 or mutSOD 1 and also protects against aging and proteotoxic insults. Knockdown of <b>RAD-</b> 23 is further neuroprotective against the toxicity of SOD 1 and TDP- 43 expression in mammalian neurons. Biochemical investigation indicates that <b>RAD-</b> 23 modifies mutTDP- 43 and mutSOD 1 abundance, solubility, and turnover in association with altering the ubiquitination status of these substrates. In human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spinal cord, we find that <b>RAD-</b> 23 abundance is increased and <b>RAD-</b> 23 is mislocalized within motor neurons.

40|$|Mutations in BRCA 2 {{predispose}} {{individuals to}} breast cancer, {{a consequence of}} the role of BRCA 2 in DNA repair. Human BRCA 2 interacts with the recombinase RAD 51 via eight BRC repeats. Controversy has existed, however, about whether the BRC interactions are primarily with RAD 51 monomers or with the RAD 51 –DNA helical polymer, and whether there is a single interaction or multiple ones. We show here that the single BRC motif in the Caenorhabditis elegans BRCA 2 homolog, CeBRC- 2, contains two different <b>RAD-</b> 51 -binding regions. One of these regions binds only weakly to <b>RAD-</b> 51 –DNA filaments but strongly to <b>RAD-</b> 51 alone and corresponds to the part of human BRC 4 crystallized with RAD 51. Injection of a peptide corresponding to this region into worms inhibits the normal formation of <b>RAD-</b> 51 foci in response to ionizing radiation (IR). Conversely, peptides corresponding to the second region bind strongly to <b>RAD-</b> 51 –DNA filaments but do not bind to <b>RAD-</b> 51 alone. Three-dimensional reconstructions from electron micrographs show that this peptide binds to the <b>RAD-</b> 51 N-terminal domain, which has been shown to have a regulatory function. Injection of this peptide into worms before IR leads to a dramatic increase and persistence of IR-induced <b>RAD-</b> 51 foci. This peptide also inhibits the <b>RAD-</b> 51 ATPase activity, required for filament depolymerization. These results support a model where an interaction with <b>RAD-</b> 51 alone is likely involved in filament nucleation, whereas a second independent interaction is involved in stabilization of <b>RAD-</b> 51 filaments by BRCA 2. The multiple interactions between BRCA 2 -like molecules and RAD 51 provide insights into why mutations in BRCA 2 lead to cancer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} Caenorhabditis elegans <b>rad-</b> 51 during meiotic prophase. We showed that <b>rad-</b> 51 mutant worms are viable, have no defects in meiotic homology recognition and synapsis but exhibit abnormal chromosomal morphology and univalent for-mation at diakinesis. During meiosis <b>RAD-</b> 51 becomes localized to distinct foci in nuclei of the transition zone of the gonad and is most abundant in nuclei at late zygotene/ early pachytene. Foci then gradually disappear from chromosomes and no foci are observed in late pachytene. <b>RAD-</b> 51 localization requires the recombination genes spo- 11 and mre- 11 as well as chk- 2, which is necessary for homology recognition and presynaptic alignment. Mutational analysis with synapsis- and recombination-defective strains, {{as well as the}} analysis of strains bearing heterozygous translocation chromosomes, suggests that presynaptic alignment may be required for <b>RAD-</b> 51 focus formation, whereas homologous synaptonemal complex formation is required to remove <b>RAD-</b> 51 foci...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{response}} to genotoxic stress, cells activate checkpoint pathways {{that lead to}} a transient cell cycle arrest that allows for DNA repair or to apoptosis, which triggers the demise of genetically damaged cells. Results: During positional cloning of the C. elegans <b>rad-</b> 5 DNA damage checkpoint gene, we found, surprisingly, that <b>rad-</b> 5 (mn 159) is allelic with clk- 2 (qm 37), a mutant previously implicated in regulation of biological rhythms and life span. However, clk- 2 (qm 37) is the only C. elegans clock mutant that is defective for the DNA damage checkpoint. We show that <b>rad-</b> 5 /clk- 2 acts in a pathway that partially overlaps with the conserved C. elegans mrt- 2 /S. cerevisiae RAD 17 /S. pombe rad 1 (+) checkpoint pathway. In addition, <b>rad-</b> 5 /clk- 2 also regulates the S phase replication checkpoint in C. elegans. Positional cloning reveals that the <b>RAD-</b> 5 /CLK- 2 DNA damage checkpoint protein is homologous to S, cerevisiae Tel 2 p, an essential DNA binding protein that regulates telomere length in, yeast. However, the partial loss- of-function C. elegans <b>rad-</b> 5 (mn 159) and clk- 2 (qm 37) checkpoint mutations have little effect on telomere length, {{and analysis of the}} partial loss-of-function of S. cerevisiae tel 2 - 1 mutant failed to reveal typical DNA damage checkpoint defects. Conclusions: Using C. elegans genetics we define the novel DNA damage checkpoint protein <b>RAD-</b> 5 /CLK- 2, which {{may play a role in}} oncogenesis. Given that Tel 2 p has been shown to bind to a variety of nucleic, acid structures in vitro, we speculate that the <b>RAD-</b> 5 /CLK- 2 checkpoint protein may act at sites of DNA damage, either as a sensor of DNA damage or to aid in the repair of damaged DNA...|$|R
40|$|Chromosome {{inheritance}} during {{sexual reproduction}} relies on deliberate induction of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and repair of {{a subset of}} these breaks as interhomolog crossovers (COs). Here we provide a direct demonstration, based on our analysis of <b>rad-</b> 50 mutants, that the meiotic program in Caenorhabditis elegans involves both acquisition and loss of a specialized mode of double-strand break repair (DSBR). In premeiotic germ cells, <b>RAD-</b> 50 {{is not required to}} load strand-exchange protein <b>RAD-</b> 51 at sites of spontaneous or ionizing radiation (IR) -induced DSBs. A specialized meiotic DSBR mode is engaged at the onset of meiotic prophase, coincident with assembly of meiotic chromosome axis structures. This meiotic DSBR mode is characterized both by dependence on <b>RAD-</b> 50 for rapid accumulation of <b>RAD-</b> 51 at DSB sites and by competence for converting DSBs into interhomolog COs. At the midpachytene to late pachytene transition, germ cells undergo an abrupt release from the meiotic DSBR mode, characterized by reversion to <b>RAD-</b> 50 -independent loading of <b>RAD-</b> 51 and loss of competence to convert DSBs into interhomolog COs. This transition in DSBR mode is dependent on MAP kinase-triggered prophase progression and coincides temporally with a major remodeling of chromosome architecture. We propose that at least two developmentally programmed switches in DSBR mode, likely conferred by changes in chromosome architecture, operate in the C. elegans germ line to allow formation of meiotic crossovers without jeopardizing genomic integrity. Our data further suggest that meiotic cohesin component REC- 8 {{may play a role in}} limiting the activity of SPO- 11 in generating meiotic DSBs and that <b>RAD-</b> 50 may function in counteracting this inhibition.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} motor nerve branch block and neurotomy of the soleus nerve on triceps surae spasticity, reviewing 2 cases. METHODS: Beside clinical assessment, we carried out a quantitative measurement of the stiffness of the ankle flexor muscles. The path length of the phase diagram between elastic and viscous stiffness quantifies the reflex response to movement and reflects {{the importance of the}} spasticity. The assessments were carried out before and 30 min after motor nerve branch block of the upper soleus nerve and more than 7 months after neurotomy. RESULTS: Both patients presented with pronounced ankle plantar flexor spasticity: their path lengths were more than 6 times greater than normal values at baseline (# 1 : 354 N m <b>rad-</b> 1; # 2 : 409 N m <b>rad-</b> 1). Motor nerve branch block and neurotomy allowed a near-normalization of elastic and visc-ous stiffness of ankle plantar flexor muscles in the 2 patients.

40|$|SummaryRepair of DNA {{double strand}} breaks by {{homologous}} recombination (HR) is initiated by Rad 51 filament nucleation on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which catalyzes strand exchange with homologous duplex DNA. BRCA 2 and the Rad 51 paralogs are tumor suppressors and critical mediators of Rad 51. To {{gain insight into}} Rad 51 paralog function, we investigated a heterodimeric Rad 51 paralog complex, RFS- 1 /RIP- 1, and uncovered the molecular basis by which Rad 51 paralogs promote HR. Unlike BRCA 2, which nucleates <b>RAD-</b> 51 -ssDNA filaments, RFS- 1 /RIP- 1 binds and remodels pre-synaptic filaments to a stabilized, “open,” and flexible conformation, in which the ssDNA is more accessible to nuclease digestion and <b>RAD-</b> 51 dissociation rate is reduced. Walker box mutations in RFS- 1, which abolish filament remodeling, fail to stimulate <b>RAD-</b> 51 strand exchange activity, demonstrating that remodeling is essential for RFS- 1 /RIP- 1 function.

40|$|ATM and ATR are key {{components}} of the DNA damage checkpoint.

In the promoter region, we identified a CCAAT box-binding protein (CBP) that has the same binding characteristics as the CCAAT box-binding protein that binds to the Moloney murine sarcoma virus promoter and most likely represents the CP 1 factor. In the upstream enhancer region unique to BL/VL 3, we detected several sequence-specific complexes, one with T-lymphocyte extracts but not with fibroblast extracts. This U 3 region, UEB, may be important for the T-cell specificity of BL/VL 3 RadLV. In the enhancer, which has been uniquely rearranged in this virus, we identified three specific protein-binding sites.

The influence of plyometric training background on these relationships was also analyzed. Musculotendinous (SI MT), passive (K P) and active (SI MA) musculoarticular stiffnesses were quantified, using quick-release and sinusoidal perturbation tests, on nine French elite long or triple jumpers (athlete group, AG) and nine control subjects (CG). These ergometric parameters were related with the lower-limb stiffness (K leg) and the maximal performance (H max) measured from a force platform during vertical hopping. AG showed a significantly higher SI MT (2. 76 <b>rad-</b> 1), K P (55. 6 N m <b>rad-</b> 1), K leg (30. 3 kN m- 1) and H max (0. 48 m) compared to CG (1. 83 <b>rad-</b> 1, 37. 8 N m <b>rad-</b> 1, 19. 6 kN m- 1 and 0. 38 m, respectively). K leg was not significantly correlated with any of the intrinsic stiffness parameters (SI MT, SI MA or K P). For AG, a strong and negative correlation was observed between H max and K leg. These data indicate that, while elite jumpers presented higher stiffness of both musculotendi-nous and passive musculoarticular structures, a high compliance of musculoskeletal system was beneficial to optimize the performance in vertical hopping for these athletes. We suggested that neuromuscular strategies were designed to counterbalance this higher intrinsic stiffness to solve the problem of the conflicting requirement of the musculotendinous elements: increase in compliance to enhance the elastic recoil and increase in stiffness for a better force transmission to the periphery...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{inability}} to efficiently repair DNA damage or remove cells with severely damaged genomes {{has been linked}} to several human cancers. Studies in yeasts and mammals have identified several genes that are required for proper activation of cell cycle checkpoints following various types of DNA damage. However, in metazoans, DNA damage can induce apoptosis as well. How DNA damage activates the apoptotic machinery is not fully understood. Results: We demonstrate here that the Caenorhabditis elegans gene hus- 1 is required for DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Following DNA damage, HUS- 1 relocalizes and forms distinct foci that overlap with chromatin. Relocalization does not require the novel checkpoint protein <b>RAD-</b> 5; rather, relocalization appears more frequently in <b>rad-</b> 5 mutants, suggesting that <b>RAD-</b> 5 plays a role in repair. HUS- 1 is required for genome stability, as demonstrated by increased frequency of spontaneous mutations, chromosome nondisjunction, and telomere shortening. Finally, we show that DNA damage increases expression of the proapoptotic gene egl- 1, a response that requires hus- 1 and the p 53 homolog cep- 1. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the <b>RAD-</b> 5 checkpoint protein is not required for HUS- 1 to relocalize following DNA damage. Furthermore, our studies reveal a new function of HUS- 1 in the prevention of telomere shortening and mortalization of germ cells. DNA damage-induced germ cell death is abrogated in hus- 1 mutants, in part, due to the inability of these mutants to activate egl- 1 transcription in a cep- 1 /p 53 -dependent manner.

Symptoms of CO poisoning arenonspecific and the documentation of elevated carboxyhemoglobin(HbCO) levels in arterial blood sample is the only standard ofconfirming suspected exposure. The treatment of CO poisoning requiresnormobaric or hyperbaric oxygen therapy, according to the symptomsand HbCO levels. A new device, the <b>Rad-</b> 57 pulse CO-oximeter allowsnoninvasive transcutaneous measurement of blood carboxyhemoglobinlevel (SpCO) by measurement of light wavelength absorptions. Methods: Prospective cohort study with a sample of patients, admittedbetween October 2008 - March 2009 and October 2009 - March 2010,in the emergency services (ES) of a Swiss regional hospital and aSwiss university hospital (Burn Center). In case of suspected COpoisoning, three successive noninvasive measurements wereperformed, simultaneously with one arterial blood HbCO test. A controlgroup includes patients admitted in the ES for other complaints (cardiacinsufficiency, respiratory distress, acute renal failure), but necessitatingarterial blood testing. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. The primary endpoint was to assess the agreement of themeasurements made by the <b>Rad-</b> 57 (SpCO) and the blood levels(HbCO). Results: 50 patients were enrolled, among whom 32 were admittedfor suspected CO poisoning. Baseline demographic and clinicalcharacteristics of patients are presented in table 1. The median age was 37. 7 ans ± 11. 8, 56 % being male. Median laboratory carboxyhemoglobinlevels (HbCO) were 4. 25 % (95 % IC 0. 6 - 28. 5) for intoxicated patientsand 1. 8 % (95 % IC 1. 0 - 5. 3) for control patients. Only five patientspresented with HbCO levels >= 15 %. The results disclose relatively faircorrelations between the SpCO levels obtained by the <b>Rad-</b> 57 and thestandard HbCO, without any false negative results. However, theRad- 57 tend to under-estimate the value of SpCO for patientsintoxicated HbCO levels > 10 % (fig. 1).

We studied the open-channel blockers disopyramide and flecainide, and the lidocaine derivative <b>RAD-</b> 243. All three drugs blocked the wild-type Na+ channel in a use-dependent manner. There was no use-dependent block of IFM/QQQ mutant channels with trains of 20 40 -ms pulses at 150 -ms interpulse intervals during disopyramide exposure. Flecainide and <b>RAD-</b> 243 retained their use-dependent blocking action and accelerated macroscopic current relaxation. All three drugs reduced the mean open time of single channels and increased the probability of their failure to open. From the abbreviation of the mean open times, we estimated association rates of ∼ 106 /M/s for the three drugs. Reducing the burst duration contributed to the acceleration of macroscopic current relaxation during exposure to flecainide and <b>RAD-</b> 243. The qualitative differences in use-dependent block {{appear to be the}} result of differences in drug dissociation rate. The inactivation gate may play a trapping role during exposure to some sodium channel blocking drugs...|$|R
40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} genome {{is organized}} in a three-dimensional structure called chromatin, constituted by DNA and associated proteins, {{the majority of}} which are histones. Post-translational modifications of histone proteins greatly influence chromatin structure and regulate many DNA-based biological processes. Methylation of lysine 36 of histone 3 (H 3 K 36) is a post-translational modification functionally relevant during early steps of DNA damage repair. Here, we show that the JMJD- 5 regulates H 3 K 36 di-methylation and it is required at late stages of double strand break repair mediated by homologous recombination. Loss of jmjd- 5 results in hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and in meiotic defects, and it is associated with aberrant retention of <b>RAD-</b> 51 at sites of double strand breaks. Analyses of jmjd- 5 genetic interactions with genes required for resolving recombination intermediates (rtel- 1) or promoting the resolution of <b>RAD-</b> 51 double stranded DNA filaments (rfs- 1 and helq- 1) suggest that jmjd- 5 prevents the formation of stalled postsynaptic recombination intermediates and favors <b>RAD-</b> 51 removal. As these phenotypes are all recapitulated by a catalytically inactive jmjd- 5 mutant, we propose a novel role for H 3 K 36 me 2 regulation during late steps of homologous recombination critical to preserve genome integrity...|$|R
40|$|PHF 8 is a JmjC domain-containing histone demethylase, {{defects in}} which are {{associated}} with X-linked mental retardation. In this study, we examined the roles of two PHF 8 homologs, JMJD- 1. 1 and JMJD- 1. 2, in the model organism C. elegans in response to DNA damage. A deletion mutation in either of the genes led to hypersensitivity to interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs), while only mutation of jmjd- 1. 1 resulted in hypersensitivity to double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). In response to ICLs, JMJD- 1. 1 {{did not affect the}} focus formation of FCD- 2, a homolog of FANCD 2, a key protein in the Fanconi anemia pathway. However, the dynamic behavior of RPA- 1 and <b>RAD-</b> 51 was affected by the mutation: the accumulations of both proteins at ICLs appeared normal, but their subsequent disappearance was retarded, suggesting that later steps of homologous recombination were defective. Similar changes in the dynamic behavior of RPA- 1 and <b>RAD-</b> 51 were seen in response to DSBs, supporting a role of JMJD- 1. 1 in homologous recombination. Such a role was also supported by our finding that the hypersensitivity of jmjd- 1. 1 worms to ICLs was rescued by knockdown of lig- 4, a homolog of Ligase 4 active in nonhomologous end-joining. The hypersensitivity of jmjd- 1. 1 worms to ICLs was increased by <b>rad-</b> 54 knockdown, suggesting that JMJD- 1. 1 acts in parallel with <b>RAD-</b> 54 in modulating chromatin structure. Indeed, the level of histone H 3 Lys 9 tri-methylation, a marker of heterochromatin, was higher in jmjd- 1. 1 cells than in wild-type cells. We conclude that the histone demethylase JMJD- 1. 1 influences homologous recombination either by relaxing heterochromatin structure or by indirectly regulating the expression of multiple genes affecting DNA repair...|$|R
30|$|Radon {{concentration}} in water samples {{was measured using}} an advanced radon-in-air <b>RAD-</b> 7 radon analyzer (Durridge Co., USA) that uses alpha spectrometry technique (El-Taher 2012; Oni et al. 2014). The RAD 7 radon detector was calibrated at the Durridge radon calibration facility at Billerica Massachusetts, United States. The calibration system was compared to a precision of better than 1 %, with a secondary standard chamber, which was in turn calibrated by comparison with a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) radon standard supplied through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The calibration system’s accuracy was also check by making a direct measurement of radon level from activity and emission of a European standard radon source. The calibration achieves a reproducibility of better than ±[*] 2 % and an overall calibration accuracy of better than ±[*] 5 %. The <b>Rad-</b> 7 used was maintained at between 6 and 10 % relative humidity for its efficiency not to decrease due to neutralization of 218 Po ions by water particle (Ravikumar and Somashekar 2014). In the setup, 250 -mL sample bottle was connected to <b>RAD-</b> 7 detector via bubbling kit which enables it to degas radon from a water sample in into the air in a closed loop (Oni et al. 2014). To achieve this, the equipment was set to wat- 250 for 5  min. The equipment was allowed to rest for 5  min and then count each sample for 30  min in five cycles. Radon concentration was determined by RAD 7 taking into consideration the calibration of RAD 7, volume of the closed air loop of the set up {{and the size of}} the vial used. The counting time was shorter than 3.8  days the half-life of radon. This made <b>RAD-</b> 7 better than other detectors for 222 Rn measurement in water. Five runs were done for each sample. At the end of the runs (after the start), the <b>RAD-</b> 7 prints out automatically the summary, showing the average radon reading for the five cycles counted. The readings and typical alpha energy spectrum obtained from the capture software were shown in Figs. 5 and 6 of the Additional file 1. The samples were counted immediately after collection without any delay, therefore radon decay correction was not calculated (Ravikumar and Somashekar 2014; Hector et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>RAD-</b> 57 pulse CO-oximeter is a {{lightweight}} device allowing noninvasive measurement of blood carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO). We assessed the diagnostic value of pulse CO-oximetry, comparing SpCO values from the <b>RAD-</b> 57 to standard laboratory blood carboxyhemo-globin (COHb) measurement in emergency department patients with suspected carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. METHODS: This was a prospective, diagnostic accuracy study {{according to the}} Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria in consecutive adult emergency department patients with suspected CO poisoning. SpCO was measured with the <b>RAD-</b> 57 simulta-neously with blood sampling for laboratory blood gas analysis. We made no changes to our stan-dard management of CO poisoning. Blood COHb> 5 % for non-smokers, and> 10 % for smokers were applied as the reference standard. RESULTS: We included 93 subjects: 37 smokers and 56 non-smokers. CO poisoning was diagnosed in 26 subjects (28 %). The SpCO values ranged from 1 % to 30 %, with a median of 4 % (IQR 2. 7 – 7. 3 %). The COHb values ranged from 0 % to 34 %, with a median of 5 % (IQR 2 – 9 %). The mean differences between the COHb and SpCO values were 0. 2 % 3. 3 % (95 % limits of agreement of 6. 7 % and 6. 3 %) for the whole cohort, 0. 7 % (limits of agreement 7. 7 % and 6. 2 %) for the non-smokers, and 0. 6 % (limits of agreement 5. 0 % and 6. 2 %) for the smokers. The optimal thresholds for detecting CO poisoning were SpCO of 9 % and 6 % for smokers and non-smokers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SpCO measured with the <b>RAD-</b> 57 was {{not a substitute for}} standard blood COHb measurement. However, noninvasive pulse CO-oximetry could be useful as a first-line screening test, enabling rapid detection and management of CO-poisoned patients in the emergency department.
