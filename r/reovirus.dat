25|$|<b>Reovirus</b> {{was noted}} to be a {{potential}} cancer therapeutic when studies suggested it reproduces well in certain cancer cell lines. It replicates specifically in cells {{that have an}} activated Ras pathway (a cellular signaling pathway that is involved in cell growth and differentiation). <b>Reovirus</b> replicates in and eventually kills Ras-activated tumour cells and as cell death occurs, progeny virus particles are free to infect surrounding cancer cells. This cycle of infection, replication and cell death {{is believed to be}} repeated until all tumour cells carrying an activated Ras pathway are destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Sex {{may also}} have been present even earlier, in the RNA world that is {{considered}} to have preceded DNA cellular life forms. A proposal for the origin of sex in the RNA world was based on the type of sexual interaction that is known to occur in extant single-stranded segmented RNA viruses such as influenza virus, and in extant double-stranded segmented RNA viruses such as <b>reovirus.</b> Exposure to conditions that cause RNA damage could have led to blockage of replication and death of these early RNA life forms. Sex would have allowed re-assortment of segments between two individuals with damaged RNA, permitting undamaged combinations of RNA segments to come together, thus allowing survival. Such a regeneration phenomenon, known as multiplicity reactivation, occurs in influenza virus and <b>reovirus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Multiplicity {{reactivation}} (MR) is {{the process}} by which viral genomes containing inactivating damage interact within an infected cell to form a viable viral genome.

40|$|Experiments were {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} chymotrypsin sensitivity and trypsin sensitivity of 13 avian <b>reoviruses,</b> and {{to determine if there}} was any correlation with pathogenicity of some chicken <b>reoviruses.</b> A wide variation in the degree of sensitivity of avian <b>reoviruses</b> to chymotrypsin and trypsin was observed. Overall, the infectivity of the 13 avian <b>reoviruses</b> for Vero cells was markedly reduced by treatment with 0. 01 % chymotrypsin (the lowest concentration tested) while 0. 5 % trypsin significantly reduced the infectivity of 9 of 13 strains. Comparison of four avian <b>reoviruses,</b> three resistant and one sensitive to trypsin, for pathogenicity in day old chicks following oral inoculation showed the strains that were resistant to trypsin to be more pathogenic. Tenosynovitis and virus persistence in intestines, liver, heart and hock joint tissues occurred only in chickens inoculated with the trypsin resistant strains. It is concluded that the degree of sensitivity to chymotrypsin and trypsin among avian <b>reoviruses</b> is heterogenous. Sensitivity to trypsin influenced the development of tenosynovitis based on microscopic lesions and virus persistence in tissues.

2500|$|When {{two or more}} viruses, each {{containing}} lethal genomic damage infect {{the same}} host cell, the virus genomes often can pair {{with each other and}} undergo homologous recombinational repair to produce viable progeny. [...] This process is known as multiplicity reactivation. Enzymes employed in multiplicity reactivation are functionally homologous to enzymes employed in bacterial and eukaryotic recombinational repair.

2500|$|The two outer capsid proteins, VP2 and VP5, mediate {{attachment}} and penetration of BTV into the target cell. [...] The virus makes initial {{contact with the}} cell with VP2, triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virus. [...] The low pH within the endosome then triggers BTV's membrane penetration protein VP5 to undergo a conformational change that disrupts the endosomal membrane. [...] Uncoating yields a transcriptionally active 470S core particle which is composed of two major proteins VP7 and VP3, and the three minor proteins VP1, VP4 and VP6 {{in addition to the}} dsRNA genome. There is no evidence that any trace of the outer capsid remains associated with these cores, as has been described for <b>reovirus.</b> The cores may be further uncoated to form 390S subcore particles that lack VP7, also in contrast to <b>reovirus.</b> Subviral particles are probably akin to cores derived in vitro from virions by physical or proteolytic treatments that remove the outer capsid and causes activation of the BTV transcriptase. In addition to the seven structural proteins, three non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2, NS3 (and a related NS3A) are synthesised in BTV-infected cells. Of these, NS3/NS3A is involved in the egress of the progeny virus. The two remaining non-structural proteins, NS1 and NS2, are produced at high levels in the cytoplasm and are believed to be involved in virus replication, assembly and morphogenesis.|$|E
2500|$|Many viruses {{have evolved}} {{mechanisms}} to resist interferon activity. [...] They circumvent the IFN response by blocking downstream signaling events that occur after the cytokine binds to its receptor, by preventing further IFN production, and by inhibiting {{the functions of}} proteins that are induced by IFN. [...] Viruses that inhibit IFN signaling include Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), dengue type 2 virus (DEN-2) and viruses of the herpesvirus family, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [...] (KSHV or HHV8). Viral proteins proven to affect IFN signaling include EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) from Epstein-Barr virus, the large T antigen of Polyomavirus, the E7 protein of Human papillomavirus (HPV), and the B18R protein of vaccinia virus. [...] Reducing IFN-α activity may prevent signaling via [...] STAT1, STAT2, [...] or IRF9 [...] (as with JEV infection) or through the JAK-STAT pathway (as with DEN-2 infection). [...] Several poxviruses encode soluble IFN receptor homologs—like the B18R protein of the vaccinia virus—that bind to and prevent IFN interacting with its cellular receptor, impeding communication between this cytokine and its target cells. [...] Some viruses can encode proteins that bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to prevent the activity of RNA-dependent protein kinases; this is the mechanism <b>reovirus</b> adopts using its sigma 3 (σ3) protein, and vaccinia virus employs using the gene product of its E3L gene, p25. The ability of interferon to induce protein production from interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) can also be affected. [...] Production of protein kinase R, for example, can be disrupted in cells infected with JEV [...] Some viruses escape the anti-viral activities of interferons by gene (and thus protein) mutation. [...] The H5N1 influenza virus, also known as bird flu, has resistance to interferon and other anti-viral cytokines that is attributed to a single amino acid change in its Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1), although the precise mechanism of how this confers immunity is unclear.|$|E

In 2011, turkey <b>reoviruses</b> were isolated from tendons and synovial fluids of > 15 -week-old lame turkeys displaying swollen joints and occasionally ruptured leg tendons in Midwest, USA. These <b>reoviruses</b> were tentatively called turkey arthritis <b>reoviruses</b> (TARV) to differentiate them from <b>reoviruses</b> isolated from intestinal contents and feces of turkeys namely turkey enteric <b>reoviruses</b> (TERV). TARV {{were found to}} be genetically distinct from chicken arthritis <b>reoviruses</b> (CARV). Five experiments were conducted to test the pathogenicity of TARV in turkeys and in chickens and to compare it with that of TERV and CARV. Additionally, this work investigated the virus pathogenesis and cytokine immune responses. TARV showed unique capability to induce significantly higher tenosynovitis scores in turkeys as compared with TERV and CARV which induced minimal scores. Clinical lameness was first displayed at 8 weeks of age in TARV-inoculated turkeys at 1 week of age. Lameness in infected group reached approximately 50 % at 16 weeks of age. TARV did not induce any lesions in chickens via intratracheal or oral route. TARV inoculation via footpad route induced tenosynovitis in chickens at 2 and 3 weeks PI with no clinical lameness. In pathogenesis study, TARV displayed the greatest replication in intestines and bursa of Fabricius than in leg tendons of turkeys. Viral infection mediated effective antiviral cytokines immune response that limited virus replication in the intestines. Furthermore, viral infection mediated a significantly elevated T helper- 1 (Th 1) cytokine response in intestines and tendons and minimal Th 2 and Th 17 cytokine response during the early stage (2 weeks) of infection. This work established an experimental model to study TARV which provides early end points that are indicative of disease pathogenicity. Additionally this work developed a new grading system for histologic tenosynovitis which {{can be used in a}} wide variety of experimental models. For lameness evaluation in turkeys, this work developed a grading system for gait scores.
