2500|$|On September 14, 1874 {{armed forces}} {{led by the}} White League {{defeated}} the integrated Republican metropolitan police and their allies in pitched battle in the French Quarter and along Canal Street. The White League forced the temporary flight of the William P. Kellogg government, installing John McEnery as Governor of Louisiana. Kellogg and the Republican administration were reinstated in power 3 days later by United States troops. Early 20th century segregationists would celebrate the short-lived triumph of the White League as a victory for [...] "white supremacy" [...] and dubbed the conflict [...] "The Battle of Liberty Place". [...] A monument commemorating the event was built near the foot of Canal Street, {{to the side of}} the Aquarium near the trolley tracks. This monument was removed on April 24, 2017.

40|$|Anaerobic {{membrane}} bioreactor (AnMBR) treatment, which combines the anaerobic microbial conversion of organic compounds into methane-rich biogas with membrane separation of treated wastewater and microbial biomass, {{has been proposed}} for direct energy recovery from domestic wastewater. We demonstrated in a bench-scale investigation that AnMBR can achieve 92 ± 5 % chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal at 15 °C, but that dissolved methane in the permeate represents 40 - 50 % of the total methane produced. If unrecovered, this methane is a lost energy source and results in substantial greenhouse gas emissions. This work motivated {{an evaluation of the}} trade-offs between the membrane biofilm’s role in treatment and its contribution to fouling. We demonstrated that the development of a biofilm enriched in active syntrophic bacteria and methanogens significantly improved effluent quality, while maintaining acceptable fluxes. However, methanogenesis in the biofilm resulted in substantial levels of dissolved methane in the permeate. The lower temperature limit of AnMBR treatment was explored by sequentially lowering the operating temperature of the system from 15, 12, 9, 6, to 3 °C under conditions supporting biofilm treatment. COD removal > 95 % was achieved at temperatures as low as 6 °C. COD <b>removal</b> <b>fell</b> to 86 ± 4. 0 % at 3 °C and, at this temperature, essentially all COD removal occurred in the biofilm, suggesting that the biofilm was less inhibited by temperature decreases than the suspended biomass. Finally, we evaluated the life cycle environmental and economic impacts of AnMBR technology compared to aerobic treatment systems. AnMBR will not be net energy positive in the foreseeable future without reduction in fouling control energy demands. Currently, AnMBR is better suited for higher strength domestic wastewater treatment. Further, global warming impacts were over an order of magnitude higher than aerobic systems arising from the direct emission of effluent dissolved methane. Future research is necessary to (1) promote increased biological activity in suspended biomass at low temperatures such that membrane biofilm treatment is reduced and dissolved methane oversaturation avoided, (2) develop low-energy dissolved methane recovery technologies to limit global warming impacts, and (3) establish fouling control strategies that reduce energy demands thereby improving the net energy balance...|$|R
40|$|The {{biofilter}} is cost-effective for {{the waste}} gases treatment. The bacterial {{is the main}} microorganism in the conventional biofilters. However, it faces some problems on the elimination of hydrophobic compounds. In order to overcome these problems, the biofilters with fungi were developed. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the factors affecting ethyl mercaptan (EM) -degradation using a fungal biofilter. A laboratory experiment was set up. The effects of loading rate, empty bed residence times(EBRT) and pH on EM degradation were investigated. Over 95 % removals of EM could be achieved, under the condition of the influent loadings below g/(m (.) h) Removal efficiencies improved to 98 % with EM loading decreased to 45 g/(m (.) h). For long EBRT of 58 s corresponding to a flow rate of 0. 3 m(3) /h, the EM removal efficiencies of over 98 % were observed. However, when EBRT was decreased to 14 s, the <b>removal</b> efficiencies <b>fell</b> under 80 %. The pH range of 3 - 5 was feasible to fungi...|$|R
40|$|Transepithelial fluid {{transport}} (Jv) and intracellular Na+ and Cl- activities (aNai, aCli) {{were measured}} in isolated Necturus gallbladders {{to establish the}} contribution of different proposed apical membrane entry mechanisms to transepithelial salt transport. In 10 mM HCO 3 - Ringer's, Jv was 13. 5 +/- 1. 1 microliter X cm- 2 X h- 1, and was significantly reduced by a low bicarbonate medium and by addition of amiloride (10 (- 3) M) or SITS (0. 5 X 10 (- 3) M) to the mucosal bathing solution. Bumetanide (10 (- 5) M) was ineffective. Bilateral Na+ removal abolished Jv. The hypothesis of NaCl cotransport was rejected {{on the basis of}} the following results, all obtained during mucosal bathing solution changes: during Na+ <b>removal,</b> aNai <b>fell</b> 4. 3 times faster than aCli; during Cl- <b>removal,</b> aCli <b>fell</b> 7. 5 times faster than aNai; amiloride (10 (- 3) M) reduced aNai at a rate of 2. 4 +/- 0. 3 mM/min, whereas aCli was not changed; bumetanide (10 (- 5) M) had no significant effects on Jv or aCli. The hypothesis of Na-K-Cl cotransport was rejected for the same reasons; in addition, K+ removal from the mucosal bathing solution (with concomitant Ba 2 + addition) did not alter aNai or aCli. The average rate of NaCl entry under normal transporting conditions, estimated from Jv, assuming that the transported fluid is an isosmotic NaCl solution, was 22. 5 nmol X cm- 2 X min- 1. Upon sudden cessation of NaCl entry, assuming no cell volume changes, aNai and aCli should fall at an average rate of 4. 8 mM/min. To compare this rate with the rates of Na+ and Cl- entry by ion exchange, the Na+ or Cl- concentration in the mucosal bathing solution was reduced rapidly to levels such that electroneutral cation or anion exchange, respectively, should cease. The rate of Na+ or Cl- entry before this maneuver was estimated from the initial rate of fall of the respective intracellular ionic activity upon the mucosal solution substitution. aNai and aCli decreased at initial rates of 3. 7 +/- 0. 4 and 5. 9 +/- 0. 8 mM/min, respectively. The rate of fall of aNai upon reduction of external [Na] was not affected by amiloride (10 (- 3) M), and the rate of fall of aCli upon reduction of external [Cl] was unchanged by SITS (0. 5 X 10 (- 3) M), which indicates that net cation or anion exchange was, in fact, abolished by the changes in Na+ and Cl- gradients, respectively. I conclude that double exchange (Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO- 3) is the predominant or sole mechanism of apical membrane NaCl entry in this epithelium...|$|R
40|$|PG&E NEG Salem Harbor Station Unit 1 was {{successfully}} tested for applicability of activated carbon injection as a mercury control technology. Test {{results from this}} site have enabled a thorough evaluation of mercury control at Salem Harbor Unit 1, including performance, estimated cost, and operation data. This unit has very high native mercury removal, thus {{it was important to}} understand the impacts of process variables on native mercury capture. The team responsible for executing this program included plant and PG&E headquarters personnel, EPRI and several of its member companies, DOE, ADA, Norit Americas, Inc., Hamon Research-Cottrell, Apogee Scientific, TRC Environmental Corporation, Reaction Engineering, as well as other laboratories. The technical support of all of these entities came together to make this program achieve its goals. Overall the objectives of this field test program were to determine the mercury control and balance-of-plant impacts resulting from activated carbon injection into a full-scale ESP on Salem Harbor Unit 1, a low sulfur bituminous-coal-fired 86 MW unit. It was also important to understand the impacts of process variables on native mercury removal (> 85 %). One half of the gas stream was used for these tests, or 43 MWe. Activated carbon, DARCO FGD supplied by NORIT Americas, was injected upstream of the cold side ESP, just downstream of the air preheater. This allowed for approximately 1. 5 seconds residence time in the duct before entering the ESP. Conditions tested in this field evaluation included the impacts of the Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) system on mercury capture, of unburned carbon in the fly ash, of adjusting ESP inlet flue gas temperatures, and of boiler load on mercury control. The field evaluation conducted at Salem Harbor looked at several sorbent injection concentrations at several flue gas temperatures. It was noted that at the mid temperature range of 322 - 327 F, the LOI (unburned carbon) lost some of its ability to capture vapor phase Hg, however activated carbon performed relatively well. At the normal operating temperatures of 298 - 306 F, mercury emissions from the ESP were so low that both particulate and elemental mercury were ''not detected'' at the detection limits of the Ontario Hydro method for both baseline and injection tests. The oxidized mercury however, was 95 % lower at a sorbent injection concentration of 10 lbs/MMacf compared with baseline emissions. When the flue gas temperatures were increased to a range of 343 - 347 F, mercury removal efficiencies were limited to < 25 %, even at the same sorbent injection concentration. Other tests examined the impacts of fly ash LOI, operation of the SNCR system, and flue gas temperature on the native mercury capture without sorbent injection. Listed below are the main conclusions from this program: (1) SNCR on/off test showed no beneficial effect on mercury removal caused by the SNCR system. (2) At standard operating temperatures ({approx} 300 F), reducing LOI from 30 - 35 % to 15 - 20 % had minimal impact on Hg removal. (3) Increasing flue gas temperatures reduced Hg removal regardless of LOI concentrations at Salem Harbor (minimum LOI was 15 %). Native mercury removal started to fall off at temperatures above 320 F. ACI effectiveness for mercury <b>removal</b> <b>fell</b> off at temperatures above 340 F. (4) Test method detection limits play an important role at Salem Harbor due to the low residual emissions. Examining the proposed MA rule, both the removal efficiency and the emission concentrations will be difficult to demonstrate on an ongoing basis. (5) Under tested conditions the baseline emissions met the proposed removal efficiency for 2006, but not the proposed emission concentration. ACI can meet the more-stringent 2012 emission limits, as long as measurement detection limits are lower than the Ontario Hydro method. SCEM testing was able to verify the low emissions. For ACI to perform at this level, process conditions need to match those obtained during testing...|$|R
40|$|Depending on {{the point}} of view of the {{participants}} in the forest-to-customer supply chain, the presence of bark can be considered as either a benefit or a cost. Understanding which factors affect bark removal should help with managing bark quantities, and the design of harvesting systems and equipment. Over 4000 stems and logs in 11 studies were measured in Australia and New Zealand using digital photos and a line intercept method to determine the amount of bark removed during normal operations. Among other things, we have been able to show that bark removal is greater in spring than winter, with tree-length systems than cut-to-length systems, and with mechanized processing rather than manual processing systems. We were also able to show that the greatest portion of bark <b>removal</b> occurs during <b>felling</b> and extraction with tree-length operations, with a small proportion occurring during delimbing and bucking. There was limited and weak evidence that bark removal may differ with location on pine stems. Finally, we were able to show that the number of knives on a processor head can affect bark removal, although we would recommend that further research be carried out on this topic, since the results ran counter to expectations...|$|R
25|$|In 1868, Butler was {{selected}} {{to be one of}} the managers of the impeachment of President Johnson before the Senate. Although Thaddeus Stevens was the principal guiding force behind the impeachment effort, he was aging and ill at the time, and Butler stepped in to become the main organizing force in the prosecution. The case was focused primarily on Johnson's removal of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office Act, and was weak because the constitutionality of the law had not been decided. The trial was a somewhat uncomfortable affair, in part because the weather was hot and humid, and the chamber was packed. The prosecution's case was a humdrum recitation of facts already widely known, and it was attacked by the defense's William Evarts, who drowned the proceedings by repeatedly objecting to Butler's questions, often necessitating a vote by the Senate on whether or not to allow the question. Johnson's defense focused on the point that his <b>removal</b> of Stanton <b>fell</b> within the bounds of the Tenure of Office Act. Despite some missteps by the defense, and Butler's vigorous cross-examination of defense witnesses, the impeachment failed by a single vote. In the interval between the trial and the Senate vote, Butler searched without success for substantive evidence that Johnson operatives were working to bribe undecided Senators. After acquittal on the first article voted on, Senate Republicans voted to adjourn for ten days, seeking time to possibly change the outcome on the remaining articles. During this time, Butler established a House committee to investigate the possibility that four of the seven Republican Senators who voted for acquittal had been improperly influenced in their votes. He uncovered some evidence that promises of patronage had been made and that money may have changed hands but was unable to decisively link these actions to any specific Senator.|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigated interacting {{effects of}} canopy gaps, understory vegetation and leaf litter on recruitment and mortality of tree seedlings {{at the community}} level in a 20 -year-old lowland forest in Costa Rica, and tested several predictions based on results of previous studies. We predicted that experimental canopy gaps would greatly enhance tree seedling recruitment, and that leaf litter removal would further enhance recruitment of small-seeded, shade-intolerant seedlings in gaps. We created a large (320 - 540 m 2) gap {{in the center of}} 5 out of 10 40 m × 40 m experimental plots, and applied the following treatments bimonthly over a 14 -month-period in a factorial, split-split plot design: clipping of understory vegetation (cut, uncut), and leaf litter manipulations (removal, addition, control). As expected, experimental gaps dramatically increased tree seedling recruitment, but gap effects varied among litter treatments. Litter addition reduced recruitment in gaps, but enhanced recruitment under intact canopy. Species composition of recruits also differed markedly between gap treatments: several small-seeded pioneer and long-lived pioneer species recruited almost exclusively in gaps. In contrast, a few medium-to-large-seeded shade-tolerant species recruited predominantly under intact canopy. Leaf litter represents a major barrier for seedling emergence and establishment of small-seeded, shade-intolerant species, but enhances emergence and establishment of large-seeded, shade-tolerant species, possibly through increased humidity and reduced detection by predators. Periodic clipping of the understory vegetation marginally reduced tree seedling mortality, but only in experimental gaps, where understory vegetation cover was greatly enhanced compared to intact canopy conditions. Successful regeneration of commercially valuable long-lived pioneer trees that dominate the forest canopy may require clear-cutting, as well as weeding and site preparation (litter <b>removal)</b> treatments in <b>felling</b> clearings. Management systems that mimic natural canopy gaps (reduced-impact selective logging) could favor the regeneration of shade-tolerant tree species, potentially accelerating convergence to old-growth forest composition. In contrast, systems that produce large canopy openings (clear-cutting) may re-initiate succession, potentially leading to less diverse but perhaps more easily managed "natural plantations" of long-lived pioneer tree species. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{numbers of}} salmonellas in raw sewage {{entering}} a treatment plant varied hourly and diurnally; their peak concentration preceded the peak influent waste water {{flow into the}} plant by about 2 hours. Salmonellas were detected in all raw influent samples collected from 2 sewage works and the mean population level at the daily peak period was about 3000 organisms/l. On average, 70 - 80 % of the salmonellas were removed in 6 - 7 h during primary sedimentation when upwards of 76 - 82 % of solids were removed, Biological treatment and secondary sedimentation removed a further 70 - 100 % of the pathogen. Compared with the activated sludge process, the trickling filters were less efficient in removing salmonellas and they were adversely affected by increased loading following rainfall. The number of salmonellas in the final effluents varied from 0 - 50 / 1 in the activated sludge plant (overall salmonella removal efficiency = 99. 83 %) and 1 - 2500 / 1 in the trickling filter plant (overall salmonella removal efficiency = 98. 70 %); {{these results suggest that}} greater emphasis should be placed on the actual quality of the effluent rather than on percentage removal efficiencies. The performance of both processes were discussed in relation to the current E. E. C. guidelines concerning the level of salmonellas in surface waters intended for both drinking and swimming. A total of 43 different serotypes were isolated, and of these, only 21 were common to both towns. The common serotypes included, in order of decreasing frequency, S. typhimurium, S. bredeney, S. virchow, S. reading, S. st. paul and S. agona. The isolation of several species from the sewage coincided with the occurrence of clinical cases of salmonellas infection in the human population in the town concerned. Removal of salmonellas from waste water was studied in a laboratory model of the activated sludge process. It appeared to occur in two phases. During the first phase, the salmonellas were rapidly adsorbed to the activated sludge floes and was completely removed from the liquid in under 15 hours. There-after, a slower elimination was observed which was due to predation by ciliate protozoa. This was confirmed by inhibition of predation in the presence of manoxol which inactivated the ciliate protozoan populations. The rate of salmonellas destruction increased with increasing temperature up to 25 °C. At 30 °C, the ciliate protozoa were destroyed by heat and the salmonella <b>removal</b> rate <b>fell</b> dramatically, A batch anaerobic digestion process was efficient at eliminating salmonellas in raw sludge. A 7 -log 10 reduction was achieved in under 9 days but the pathogens survived for considerably longer periods when the proportion of raw sludge in the digester was reduced. The bactericidal agent was most effective at low pH (< 5. 0) and appeared to comprise the volatile fatty acids. Simple storage of raw sludge in open vessels also led to reductions in their salmonella content but was markedly less efficient compared to the anaerobic digestion process. The reasons why intermittently fed anaerobic digesters do not attain maximum pathogen kills were discussed {{in the light of the}} experimental results obtained, and proposals were made to modify the mode of operation of digesters to improve the efficiency of the process with regard to the elimination of the salmonella group and other microbial pathogens...|$|R
