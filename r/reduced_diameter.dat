25|$|The {{flow speed}} of a fluid can be {{measured}} using a device such as a Venturi meter or an orifice plate, which can be placed into a pipeline to reduce {{the diameter of the}} flow. For a horizontal device, the continuity equation shows that for an incompressible fluid, the reduction in diameter will cause an increase in the fluid flow speed. Subsequently, Bernoulli's principle then shows that there must be a decrease in the pressure in the <b>reduced</b> <b>diameter</b> region. This phenomenon is known as the Venturi effect.|$|E
25|$|The Bank of Korea {{announced}} in early 2006 {{its intention to}} redesign the 10-won coin {{by the end of}} that year. With the increasing manufacturing price, then at 38 won per 10-won coin, and rumors that some people had been melting the coins to make jewelry, the redesign was needed to make the coin more cost-effective to produce. The new coin is made of copper-coated aluminium with a <b>reduced</b> <b>diameter</b> of 18mm, and a weight of 1.22 g. Its visual design is the same as the old coin. The new coin was issued on December 18, 2006.|$|E
25|$|For aneurysms in the aorta, arms, legs, or head, the {{weakened}} {{section of}} the vessel may {{be replaced by a}} bypass graft that is sutured at the vascular stumps. Instead of sewing, the graft tube ends, made rigid and expandable by nitinol wireframe, can be easily inserted in its <b>reduced</b> <b>diameter</b> into the vascular stumps and then expanded up to the most appropriate diameter and permanently fixed there by external ligature. New devices were recently developed to substitute the external ligature by expandable ring allowing use in acute ascending aorta dissection, providing airtight (i.e. not dependent on the coagulation integrity), easy and quick anastomosis extended to the arch concavity Less invasive endovascular techniques allow covered metallic stent grafts to be inserted through the arteries of the leg and deployed across the aneurysm.|$|E

2500|$|Such {{cast lead}} bullets, {{intended}} for use with a gas check, will have a <b>reduced</b> <b>diameter</b> {{at the rear of}} the cast lead bullet, onto which the gas check can be swaged using a lubricating/resizing press. [...] All cast lead bullets, whether with or without a gas check, must still be lubricated, to prevent leading of the rifling of the barrel. [...] A lubricating/resizing press, which is a special purpose bullet processing press, can be either a standalone press dedicated to lubricating and resizing bullets, or can be an add-on to a reloading press, at the option of the handloader. [...] Not all handloaders resize cast lead bullets, although all handloaders do lubricate cast lead bullets. [...] An option to using a lubricating press is simply to coat the bullets with bullet lube, which can be done either with a spray, in a tumbler, in a plastic bowel with a liquid lube, in a tray with melted bullet lube, or even with a manual lubricating process.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} Bf 109 E, the Bf 109 F was much {{improved}} aerodynamically. The engine cowling was redesigned to be smoother and more rounded. The enlarged propeller spinner, adapted {{from that of the}} new Messerschmitt Me 210, now blended smoothly into the new engine cowling. Underneath the cowling was a revised, more streamlined oil cooler radiator and fairing. A new ejector exhaust arrangement was incorporated, and on later aircraft a metal shield was fitted over the left hand banks to deflect exhaust fumes away from the supercharger air-intake. The supercharger air-intake was, from the F-1 -series onwards, a rounded, [...] "elbow"-shaped design that protruded further out into the airstream. A new three-blade, light-alloy VDM propeller unit with a <b>reduced</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3m (9ft 8.5in) was used. Propeller pitch was changed electrically, and was regulated by a constant-speed unit, though a manual override was still provided. Thanks to the improved aerodynamics, more fuel-efficient engines and the introduction of light-alloy versions of the standard Luftwaffe 300 litre drop tank, the Bf 109 F offered a much increased maximum range of 1,700km (1,060mi) compared to the Bf 109 E's maximum range figure of only 660km (410 miles) on internal fuel, and with the E-7's provision for the 300 litre drop tank, a Bf 109E so equipped possessed double the range, to 1,325km (820mi).|$|E

So far, methods for <b>reducing</b> nanopore <b>diameter</b> have been divided into two categories. The first type is the deposition means, in which material was deposited in the nanopore surface to <b>reduce</b> the <b>diameter</b> of the nanopore.

50|$|The De Poray boiler is French in origin.
