Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) wraps are an excellent material for strengthening concrete to increase its axial load capacity.

It is necessary to assess the effect of that operation (tool, procedure, etc) upon the integrity of the <b>residual</b> <b>concrete</b> substrate, prior to the placement of the repair material, since it can affect significantly the adhesion of the repair system. This paper summarizes the findings of a study intended to develop a simple test method for that purpose. After a thorough review of the related scientific documentation, it has been decided to adapt the so-called pull-off test, which is commonly used to determine the bond strength of repair products. An experimental program has been conducted to evaluate the influence of various test parameters on the measured cohesion of a reference concrete surface: transfer plate thickness and diameter, core drilling depth, speed of loading, adhesive type and thickness, and number of tests. A multivaried statistical analysis of the test results clearly shows that the plate diameter and core depth are the most significant parameters, presumably with threshold values, and that there exists a synergetic effect between them. Also, a minimum number of tests can be defined based on the standard deviation and required level of confidence of the results. Overall, the test method shows good potential for a sound quantitative evaluation of a concrete surface mechanical integrity prior to repair, provided that the test parameters are selected properly.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{of a fire}} in a building raises {{a number of important}} questions regarding the post-fire or residual strength and stiffness of any exposed concrete members. Loss of residual strength and stiffness due to heating has been demonstrated by a number of previous studies, most of which have utilized experiments where unstressed specimens were heated and allowed to cool prior to testing them to failure at ambient temperature. This paper describes elevated temperature tests where the specimens were loaded during heating and cooling prior to testing them to failure at ambient temperature. This paper describes the results of such testing undertaken on eighteen identical plain concrete cylinders (&# 0216; 65 mm &# 0215; 150 mm) which were exposed to temperatures of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 &# 0176;C whilst they were subjected to 30 % of maximum load during the heating and cooling phases, prior to testing at ambient temperature. The properties examined were residual compressive strength, residual secant modulus of elasticity and the effect on the stress-strain relationship of concrete. The exposure to high temperature decreased the <b>residual</b> <b>concrete</b> compressive strength, concrete modulus of elasticity and initial slope of stress-strain curves for the cylinders. It was found that the decrease in secant stiffness of concrete is more pronounced than the corresponding decrease in residual compressive strength.

Whenever a tight bond between the repair and the old concrete is required, the soundness of the prepared surface should thus be assessed. Although this is widely recognized, there is no standard method intended to characterize the integrity of a concrete substrate after concrete removal. This paper {{presents the results of}} an investigation intended to assess and compare quantitatively different test methods, namely the Schmidt rebound hammer, the pull-out test and the pull-off test, to evaluate superficial mechanical integrity of a substrate after concrete removal operations. Although it does not yield a precise evaluation of compressive strength, the Schmidt rebound hammer test is recognized as a useful tool for performing quick surveys to assess concrete uniformity. The pull-off test is very well correlated with the splitting-tensile test, but it is not suited for vertical and overhead surfaces. The Capo pull-out test has limited interest for surface preparation, as it is applicable to flat surfaces only. Conversely, the accelerated pull-out test showed interesting potential as a simple and relatively rapid means for assessing the mechanical integrity of a concrete surface prior to repair for any type of concrete surface. More work is definitely required to refine the procedures and develop performance criteria. Nevertheless, it appears from the results generated in this study that the combination Schmidt hammer / pull-off test could fill the needs for the evaluation of horizontal surfaces after concrete removal, while the combination Schmidt hammer / accelerated pull-out test could be used effectively on vertical and overhead surfaces.

40|$|Many {{existing}} {{reinforced concrete}} (RC) members built using old design codes {{are susceptible to}} catastrophic collapse during a major earthquake due to their insufficient shear strength and member ductility. Use of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites as the external bonding/jacketing material of RC members to improve their shear strength and ductility has been a widely used {{because of the high}} strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance of FRP composites. The most often used FRP composites include carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), glass-fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP), and aramid-fiber-reinforced polymer (AFRP) composites, which are termed conventional FRPs. In recent years, a new category of FRP composites, which are made of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers, have emerged as an alternative to conventional FRPs as the strengthening materials of RC members. These FRPs have a much larger rupture strain (LRS) compared to conventional FRPs. Although their elastic modulus and strength are relatively low, they are much cheaper than conventional FRPs. It {{should be noted that the}} relatively low strength and modulus of LRS FRP can be compensated by the use of a greater amount of the fiber material, whereas the small rupture strain of conventional FRP cannot be compensated in this way. Up till now, it has remained unclear how to predict the shear strength of LRS FRP-strengthened RC members, which in turn influence their overall behaviors. Moreover, the efficiency of LRS FRP composites for the shear strengthening of RC members remains a concern because concrete degradation may occur before the full activation of the strain capacity of LRS FRP composites. This research program aims to conduct an experimental study for the first time on the shear strength and deformation behavior of RC members strengthened with LRS FRP composites. Tests on ten RC beams strengthened in shear with fully wrapped PET FRP sheets have been conducted considering the following test parameters: the strengthening ratio, the longitudinal reinforcement ratio and the shear-span to effective-depth ratio. The increase in the amount of PET FRP sheets led to an increase of the shear strength and shear ductility, whereas a lower longitudinal reinforcement ratio and a smaller shear-span to effective-depth ratio corresponded to improved shear ductility. PET FRP sheets developed very high strains, namely the maximum strains of 1. 4 – 6 % at the peak shear loads and as high as 14. 0 % at the defined ultimate state (i. e., the load dropped by 20 % compared to its peak load). Consequently, PET FRP sheets can be used to enhance the shear strength of RC beams while substantially increasing the member ductility. In particular, PET FRP sheets did not rupture at the peak load, and led to a ductile shear failure of the strengthened RC members. This failure mode also enabled us to clearly observe the behavior of shear strength degradation of concrete with increase in shear deformation even before the peak strength was developed. The shear contribution of concrete was found to degrade by 0 – 54. 6 % depending on the volumetric ratio of the FRP sheets, the shear-span to effective-depth ratio and the member depth. Owing to the close relationships among the concrete shear deterioration, the member shear deformation and the strain levels in both FRP sheets and transverse steel reinforcement as observed in the current study, further research work was carried out to build up a comprehensive model to explain the above relationships. The development of a comprehensive shear strength model is proposed to precisely predict not only the concrete shear deterioration but also the overall load-deformation responses of RC members. The proposed model, based on the work of Sato et al., is extended to account for the stiffness of both flexural and shear reinforcements, enabling us to connect interaction between flexural and shear strength behaviors. To address this interaction, a flexure-shear interaction (FSI) analytical method is presented and verified using existing experimental results, and demonstrate shear strength and ductility enhancement of RC columns confined with several alternative jacketing materials, including CFRP, AFRP, PEN, and PET FRPs. As part of the overall analytical process, in specimens failing in shear, the reduction in loadcarrying capacity with increase in deformation can be considered as a reduction of the contribution of the shear strength behavior caused by the reduction in secant stiffness of both shear and flexural reinforcements and <b>residual</b> <b>concrete</b> strength. However, in specimens failing in flexure, the load-carrying capacity decreases due to concrete crushing along with the buckling of the compression reinforcement. The influence of the shear strength behavior on the flexural deformation is introduced through the tension shift phenomenon which increases the flexural deformation. Meanwhile, the flexural strength behavior affects the shear deformation through the yielding of flexural reinforcement, which decreases the shear strength of concrete and also increases the shear reinforcement strain, causing an increase of the shear deformation. The FSI analytical method can precisely predict the strain response of shear reinforcement, including the rupture of the FRP jackets. It is proven that FRP with high fracture strain (PEN and PET) is less likely to fracture than conventional fiber (Aramid and carbon) at ultimate deformation. The final goal of this research program is to extend the FSI analytical method to the cases of steel-jacketed RC members with different jacketing shapes (i. e., elliptical and rectangular shapes). Comparing FRP and steel jacketing, FRP jacket can resist the shear crack opening only in the fiber alignment whereas steel jacket can resist the opening in both vertical and lateral, leading to different in the concrete shear strength and its degradation. Namely, concrete shear strength in steel jacketing is larger than that in FRP jacketing since shear crack opening restrained by a steel jacket causes the aggregate interlock of concrete, which results in it contributing to the shear resistance. In the FSI analytical method, the concrete contribution to the shear strength is therefore significantly affected by the steel jacket, and its contribution to shear strength is considered equivalent to that in a continuous transverse steel reinforcement. Considering confinement shape, elliptical steel jackets provides better enhancement of the flexural performance of inadequately confined columns than that of rectangular jacket. Using these concepts, the FSI analytical method can successfully predict the load-deformation envelope responses of RC columns with steel-jacketing. It can be concluded that the FSI analytical method is expeditious and efficient for use in predicting structural response of RC members with and without various types of seismic jacketing, while maintaining a high degree of accuracy...|$|E

Since the residual strength is temperature dependent, methods may be used to assess the strength indirectly by measuring the alteration in the material as function of the temperature and illustrate how cracks appear and the colour of the concrete changes from red (300 - 600 °C) to whitish grey (600 - 900 °C).

40|$|Ever since Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRPs) {{have been}} used to {{externally}} reinforce concrete beams, it has been known that the strength of the bond is what controls the design. Recently, it has been proven that the primary mode of debonding failure is cohesive failure within the concrete substrate close to the FRP/concrete interface. To further enhance the research in this area, finite element analysis has been used to help study this debonding phenomenon. This thesis is a parametric study of the FRP/concrete interface using finite element analysis software. The finite element model was calibrated using experimental data.

This code deals with the fire resistance of reinforced concrete structures during fire and provides a strength decrease formulation {{as a function of the}} temperature, as well as the thermal properties of calcareous and siliceous concrete. In EN 1992 - 1 - 2, simplified methods are described to calculate the fire resistance, such as the 500 °C isotherm method. This method takes only the concrete heated below 500 °C in account and considers the strength decrease of the reinforcement at the actually obtained temperature during fire. However, after fire exposure the concrete strength will reduce further. First, when the concrete is cooled with water by the fire brigade, additional strength losses of up to 30 % were noticed in experiments performed by the author. Second, experiments show that storage of the concrete in air and in water may result in additional strength losses of up to 20 % in the first weeks after cooling, after which slow recovery is possible. These additional residual strength losses are not considered in the EN 1992 - 1 - 2, since the models are intended for reinforced concrete during a fire. In this paper the residual bearing resistence of a pretensioned small beam, heated during a real fire and afterwards submitted to a static loading test is calculated.

Conventionally, the thermal model was used to estimate the residual thickness and to monitor the temperature of refractory with thermocouples installed on the refractory. Recently, Impact Echo method is being applied to measure the <b>residual</b> thicknesses of <b>concrete</b> or nonmetallic stiff structures. The method should be accompanied with verification in the actual blast furnace since there are differences in the reflection characteristics of the ultrasonic velocity depending on physical parameters of the steel shell, the refractory and ramming part between the steel shell and the refractory such as the size, the shape, the temperature, the consisting materials and etc. In this study, we compared various sensors such as accelerometer, a microphone and an ultrasonic sensor and the experimental methods in determining the ultrasonic velocity of the anisotropic refractory material. In addition, measuring refractory thickness of the actual blast furnace was carried out before dismantling and verified with exact thickness of refractory by means of measuring length of the core-boring sample and dismantling investigatio...|$|R
40|$|Forestry {{harvesting}} on peats {{is known}} to result in significant losses of soil phosphorus (P) to adjacent waters, and the issue is becoming an increasingly serious concern as peatland forest stocks mature and reach harvestable age. One potential solution could be the use of low-cost P recovery techniques based on the chemical precipitation and/or adsorption of the dissolved fraction of soil P, which would otherwise be lost. Such recovery techniques have shown promise in similar applications on mineral soils. However, the interaction of peat with P adsorbing materials can significantly alter their adsorptive characteristics, and it is consequentially not known what materials might be suitable for this application. This study compared the performance of six potential soil amendments (aluminum water treatment <b>residual</b> (Al-WTR), crushed <b>concrete,</b> gypsum, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, and steel wool) in removing P from aqueous solution {{in the presence of}} a typical forest peat soil. Comparison of adsorption isotherms plotted from these batch adsorption studies showed that the observed P adsorption maxima of Al-WTR and steel wool were increased by the presence of peat, from 10. 6 mg g- 1 and 20. 4 mg g- 1, to 11. 8 mg g- 1 and 52. 5 mg g- 1, respectively. In contrast, the observed P adsorption maxima of crushed concrete, gypsum, and magnesium oxide were reduced in the presence of peat, by 44 %, 87 %, and 37 %, respectively. The maximum P adsorption achieved by magnesium hydroxide was increased from 29. 8 mg g- 1 to 59 mg g- 1 at an amendment to peat-solid ratio of 1 : 4, but decreased from 73. 9 mg g- 1 to 23. 6 mg g- 1 at an amendment to peat-solid ratio of 1 : 10. It was concluded that Al-WTR, in particular, shows considerable promise for use as a soil amendment for P immobilization in a peat environment.

40|$|Chapter 1 seeks an {{explanation}} for the oft-observed correlation between plant-level productivity measures and market-level indexes of competition. The set of potential explanations can be divided into two econometrically separable bins: X-inefficiency and dynamic selection. The former is a plant-level treatment effect of competition and the latter is a selection story in which larger, more competitive markets select more aggressively on productivity type. The distinction is identified both by mechanism and by outcome: by mechanism, a nonparametric selection correction controls for the effect of dynamic selection; by outcome, one compares the predicted and the actual effects on quantiles of the market-level distribution of productivity <b>residuals.</b> The ready-mix <b>concrete</b> industry, using data from the US Census of Manufactures, is a natural setting to apply these methods. Results from both identification strategies point to X-inefficiency as the dominant explanation, raising important questions about within-plant responses to competition. Chapter 2 considers the set of comparative statics that can be obtained from industry dynamics models without writing down a parametric model of the stage game. Results are obtained for average type and turnover with respect to changes in market size and entry cost. Those for market size depend on a simple and economically meaningful increasing differences assumption on the relationship between firm type and competition. The generality of these results is important for the booming literature that applies parametric variations of industry dynamics models to match empirical stylized facts of plant-level production data and the effects of trade policy. Chapter 3 constructs a model of repeated second-price auctions in which bidders are persistent and have multidimensional private valuations. In this setting, equilibrium bids are shaded by the endogenous option value of losing to bid another day. We prove existence of this equilibrium and characterize the ergodic distribution of types. Having developed a demand system, we show that it is non-parametrically identified from panel data. Relatively simple nonparametric and semiparametric estimation procedures are proposed and tested by Monte Carlo simulation. The analysis highlights the importance of both dynamic bidding strategies and panel data sample selection issues when analyzing these markets...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{experiences}} volumetric {{changes as}} a result of material formation (cement hydration), thermal variations, or moisture losses. If these volume changes are prevented by the structure surrounding the concrete or volumetrically stable phases inside the <b>concrete,</b> <b>residual</b> stresses can develop. In many cases, these residual stresses may be large enough to result in cracking. While the premature cracking of concrete is significant enough to be considered in the design of concrete facilities, existing test methods and design methodologies need to be updated to better quantify the cracking potential especially when the concrete experiences non-uniform deformations. ^ Most design and testing approaches assume that concrete behaves like a homogeneous material. However, concrete is a composite that consists of cement paste and aggregates that have dissimilar material properties. When concrete changes its volume, localized internal residual stresses develop due to heterogeneity (i. e., paste and aggregates) that could lead to microcracking and premature cracking of concrete. Therefore, to properly evaluate the cracking behavior of concrete, an analytical tool considering the heterogeneous nature of concrete should be developed. ^ This research begins with quantifying the impact of non-uniform shrinkage on the residual stress development in the restrained ring test considering that the concrete experiences non-uniform moisture loss (drying). The role of the boundary conditions and the degree of restraint on residual stress development is also discussed. Next, the internal residual stresses that develop in a multi-phase composite system are examined by varying the series of parameters (material properties of each-phase, volume fraction of aggregate, and bond conditions between the phases). Analytical modeling is used to assess the microcracking and cracking behavior of concrete composite systems using the object-oriented finite element code. ^ It is the hypothesis of this research that the cracking behavior of concrete can be properly evaluated by assuming that concrete is a heterogeneous multi-phase composite with the assistance of a recently developed object-oriented finite element code that enables meshing a complex material meso-structure using optical mesostructural images. Although this research focuses on shrinkage in cementitious composites only, this software could have numerous applications in determining damage development in other composites as well. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{were two}} {{principal}} objectives for this thesis. The first {{was to develop}} a methodology and evaluation model of moisture redistribution {{in order to make the}} future relative humidity in a screeded concrete slab predictable. The second objective {{was to develop a}} method to determine the critical humidity for ion transport in <b>concrete.</b> <b>Residual</b> moisture in screeded concrete slabs may be redistributed to the top screed surface under a semi-permeable flooring, thus elevating the relative humidity, RH, and possibly exceeding the critical humidity level. Passing the critical humidity level may result in material damage to the flooring and adhesive. In order to avoid such damage there is a need of a methodology to estimate the maximum humidity obtained underneath flooring. The redistribution of residual moisture may increase the concentration of alkali at the contact area between the adhesive and concrete. This alkali increase may initiate and sustain adhesive deterioration, which is a common moisture related damage. Several screeded concrete slabs with PVC flooring were prepared to reproduce and monitor moisture distribution and the subsequent redistribution. The moisture distribution before flooring and after a certain period of redistribution is presented. In addition, sorption isotherms including scanning curves were determined in a sorption balance for materials used in the floor constructions, viz, w/c 0. 65 concrete, w/c 0. 4 concrete, w/c 0. 55 cement mortar, and Floor 4310 Fibre Flow, a self levelling flooring compound. Repeated absorption and desorption scanning curves starting from the desorption isotherm were also investigated. The measurements performed made it possible to develop both a qualitative and quantitative model of moisture redistribution and to quantify the humidity achieved under the flooring. The hysteresis phenomenon of the sorption isotherm is considered in the model. The model is well suited for estimations of the future RH underneath flooring in a screeded concrete slab and may also be used on homogeneous slabs. Results from previous research suggested that early drying of the concrete slab can mitigate the increase in relative humidity that occurs when an impermeable floor covering is installed. A study was conducted to verify these results. The results of this new study of the effects of early drying could not demonstrate any significant difference between an early and late dehydration. The redistribution of ions under different moisture conditions was investigated with a newly developed method. The method is divided into a preconditioning of test specimens and also a method to determine the redistribution of potassium ions. This preconditioning provides a well defined moisture condition of the specimen, which is important for determining the critical humidity for the transport of ions. The redistribution is detected by examining the ion content distribution before and after the preconditioning of ion species already present in the concrete. Previous research in this area has been conducted through adding chloride ions to the specimens. However, redistribution of chloride ions is impeded in that they bind to the inner pore surfaces, which poses a risk that the critical moisture level may be affected/misjudged...|$|R
40|$|To further {{efforts toward}} improvement, an {{innovative}} and durable High Performance Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC) was developed, using hybrid steel macro-fibers with designed hook-ends, and polyvinyl alcohol micro-fibers for optimal fiber synergistic effects, crack width control, durability, and reduced maintenance and life-cycle costs for bridges. For functional performance improvements, an off-the-shelf phase change material (PCM) was utilized, optimized and {{incorporated into the}} HPFRCC as a bridge slab warmer, to improve freeze-thaw cycling durability, to reduce the use of de-icing salts, to provide improved skid resistance, and to improve safety in cold climates and to reduce traffic congestions. The goal for developing and deploying HPFRCC with controllable functional performance is to utilize new, durable cementitious composites resistant to stringent climate demands compromised of freeze-thaw cycles, de-icing salts, plastic shrinkage and drying shrinkage cracks, chloride and sulfate attacks, corrosion and scaling, and excessive abrasion/wear due to tire chains. This thesis utilized both numerical modeling and experimental. First, mechanical properties after incorporating PCM were discussed. Subsequently, destructive tests were performed in order to study {{the effect of adding}} PCM. In addition, thermal performance after incorporating PCM was also addressed as an important topic. As a result, freeze-thaw testing was performed in order to study PCM performance. Numerical modeling regarding material mechanical properties was proposed and compared with experimental data. Numerical modeling regarding concrete composite thermal performance was also studied. Lastly, concrete interior temperature, mechanical properties and <b>concrete</b> composite <b>residual</b> capacity were discussed. In chapter 3, several experimental tests were performed in order to study the behavior of hybrid fiber reinforced concrete with PCM and to verify the validity of the theoretical model. Experimental tests can be divided into two categories. One is a destructive test; where concrete composite compressive strength, tensile strength and ductile capacity can be determined. The other category is a freeze-thaw test where concrete composite freeze-thaw resistance can be studied. In chapter 4, a new crack bridging model accounting for slip-softening interfacial shear stress was proposed for randomly distributed and randomly oriented fibers after PCM were added, based on a micromechanics analysis of single fiber pull-out. The concrete composite bridging stress versus a crack mouth opening displacement (CMOP) curve and associated fracture energy were theoretically determined. In addition, a constant interfacial shear stress model was also proposed in order to compare this with a slip softening interfacial shear stress model. By applying the proposed model on various concrete composites, including 5 % PCM and 7 % PCM hybrid fiber reinforced concrete, the present model can well describe the slip-softening behavior during fiber pull-out. In chapter 5, the new proposed slip-softening model was used to predict the ultimate tensile stress of a single fiber. Maximum fiber debonding stress and fiber pull-out stress was determined based on slip softening interfacial shear stress. By applying the rule of mixture, maximum fiber debonding and pull-out stress, the maximum tensile stress of a concrete composite was able to be predicted when subjected to three point bending test. In chapter 6, PCM concrete composite interior temperature was modeled and compared with concrete without PCM after being subjected to freeze-thaw cycle. With PCM inside of concrete, interior temperature can be controlled. In preceding chapters, microcracks would be generated inside of the concrete and eventually become larger cracks by going through the freeze-thaw process. The aim of this chapter was to find a temperature gradient inside of concrete using an enthalpy method and specific heat capacity method to solve moving boundary problems. Numerical efficiency from both the enthalpy method and specific heat capacity method were also compared. Two different layouts of how PCM were incorporated into a concrete mix and were discussed {{in order to determine the}} efficiency of each design. In chapter 7, concrete mechanical properties after being subjected to freeze-thaw cycle were modeled. In addition, <b>concrete</b> composite <b>residual</b> capacity after freeze-thaw process was also determined based on a stress-strain relationship. With PCM inside of concrete, interior temperature can be controlled. However, the relationship between concrete structure mechanical properties, number of freeze-thaw cycles and freeze-thaw temperature differences also needs to be determined. After a correlation is found between concrete mechanical properties, number of freeze-thaw cycles and temperature difference, the stress-strain relationship can then be determined by using damaged concrete mechanical properties. A Constitutive relationship can be derived based on thermodynamic theory. Elastic damage and plastic damage were both evaluated. Once the stress-strain relationship is obtained, <b>concrete</b> <b>residual</b> life and residual durability can be stimated after going through a freeze-thaw action. Normal concrete was also compared with PCM concrete. The aim of this chapter was to develop a damage model that account for concrete structure strength, number of freeze-thaw cycles and freeze-thaw temperature differences. <b>Concrete</b> composite <b>residual</b> capacity was also estimated and derived from free energy potential function...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} report of the high risk of {{spalling}} in high strength concrete at elevated temperatures in the early 1990 s, {{there have been numerous}} studies of the mitigation of spalling in concrete. Polypropylene fibres {{have been found to be}} effective for spalling protection, but there are conflicting views in the literature about the effect of fibre geometry on this protection, so that the extrapolation of the data beyond this limit often results in confusion. Thus, a systematic investigation of the effect of fibre characteristics on spalling protection of concrete is required. Further, since spalling of concrete occurs due to a vapour-induced stress and thermal stresses, and the addition of polypropylene fibres can only mitigate the level of spalling against the vapour-induced stress, other mitigation methods against the thermally-induced stresses should be considered for full protection of concrete from spalling. However, the data reporting this issue in the literature are currently limited, and thus further research into developing the method for mitigation of spalling against the thermally-induced stresses is also required. In the present research, the first aim was to investigate the effect of fibre characteristics on spalling protection of concrete in fire. Various types of fibres (polypropylene, polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose and nylon) with different lengths, diameters and melting points were used for this investigation. It was found that the total number of fibres per unit volume (N) is the most important fibre parameter for determining the effectiveness of fibres for spalling protection. Other important fibre parameters include the length of fibres (Lf) and the melting point of fibres (Tm). These parameters are important because the main role of fibres in concrete is not only to create void spaces on melting, but more importantly to provide connections between pores forming a porous network that provides pathways for water vapour to evacuate. Of the three important fibre parameters, N affects the level of distribution of fibres, Lf affects the level of connection to pores further apart, and Tm affects the time for vapour discharge, in the concrete at elevated temperature. Hence, it is suggested that the calculation for fibre content for fire resistant concrete should be a function of N, Lf and Tm, rather than % by volume or kg per volume as commonly expressed. This is because the diameter of fibres was found to have little or no effect on the spalling protection of concrete, and the conventional measure for fibre content (% by volume or kg per volume) is a function of the fibre diameter. The proposed expression for fibre content provides a clear explanation for the conflicting views of fibre geometry in the literature. Furthermore, the design of fibres using this expression with other pertinent parameters (inter-aggregate spacing, mean size of coarse aggregate used, critical fibre number required for percolating concrete) found in the present study is useful to constantly predict the level of spalling protection and is possible to optimise fibre content for the required level of spalling protection. By optimising these three fibre parameters, it was found that the fibre content can be reduced up to four times to achieve the same level of spalling protection, compared to the fibre content designed by a conventional way. As it is unlikely that there is only one type of fibre satisfying the optimum level of fibre parameters for a given fibre content, i. e. high N, optimum Lf and low Tm, the present study investigates the effect of more than one type of fibre on spalling protection of concrete. Combinations of polypropylene, polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose and nylon fibres with various lengths were used for the investigation. It was found that for a given fibre content, a combination of two selected fibres with optimum lengths can achieve the optimum level of fibre parameters (N, Lf and Tm) for effective spalling protection. At this optimum level, the fibre content required is less than that of a single type of fibre for the same level of spalling protection. In another part of this research, the application of lateral confinement using metal meshes in concrete is investigated to develop a mitigation method that can resist spalling against thermally-induced stresses (thermal gradient and thermal incompatibility). It was found that by resisting the thermally-induced stresses, this metal mesh confinement improves the residual properties of the concrete at a structural level after fire exposure. The feasibility of metal mesh confinement along with fibre addition was examined by applying the technique in practice, and it was found that this technique works in practice. Since current fire codes worldwide have no specification for the design of fire resistant concrete for spalling protection, in the last part of this research, the effect of factors including water to binder ratio, air content, moisture content, aggregate size, aggregate type and mineral admixture type on the spalling of concrete at a material level is investigated, and then a design method for fire resistant concrete is proposed. In the proposed design, a detailed procedure is developed of how to design the optimum fibre content and of how to design the dimensions of the mesh confinement to achieve the desired <b>residual</b> strength of <b>concrete</b> after fire exposure...|$|R
