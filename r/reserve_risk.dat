40|$|A {{major part}} of the {{literature}} on non-life insurance <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> has been devoted to the ultimo risk, the risk in the full run-off of the liabilities.

This paper aims at clarifying the one-year risk concept and describing simulation approaches, in particular for the one-year <b>reserve</b> <b>risk.</b> We also discuss the one-year premium risk and its relation to the premium reserve. Finally, we initiate a discussion on the role of risk margins and discounting for the reserve and premium risk, with focus on the Cost-of-Capital method.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this article is to {{introduce}} the topic of both Unexpired <b>Risk</b> <b>Reserve</b> and loss Reserving, especially of the Incurred but not reported reserves (IBNR). We will focus on the purpose, common definitions and basic principles. We will explore the common techniques used by practicing actuaries in estimating of Unexpired <b>Risk</b> <b>Reserve</b> and loss <b>reserves.</b> Unexpired <b>Risk</b> <b>Reserve</b> is the present value of loss and expense payments to be provided for by premiums covering the period from the valuation date to expiry on all contracts in force on the valuation date. A loss reserve is a provision for an insurer’s liability for claims. Loss reserving is a major challenge to the casualty actuary because the estimation process involves not only complex technical tasks but considerable judgment as well. This are a critical point, as the actual financial reserves in the accounts has a direct impact on shareholder’s equity, solvency, and also on underwriting profit. <b>reserves</b> for unexpired <b>risks,</b> equalization loss <b>reserves,</b> outstanding loss reserves, IBNR, claim rate, average cost per claim method, run-off triangle...|$|R

In the latter study the <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> calculation of non-life long tail insurers is investigated, based on a sample of 45 supervised European insurance companies. We start by giving an overview of risk measures used in a solvency environment. Next, we show that the Value-at-Risk measure is the solution of a general optimization problem. In a way this supports the current regulatory regime for banking supervision established by the Basel Capital Accord and the Solvency II regulatory regime under construction.

40|$|Mestrado em Ciências ActuariaisUnder Solvency II, {{insurance}} undertakings must have, {{as part of}} their risk management system, a regular practice of assessing their overall solvency needs with a view to their specific risk profile, known as 'Own Risk and Solvency Assessment' (ORSA).

In this context, this work aims at estimating the undertaking specific parameters (USP) for <b>reserve</b> <b>risk,</b> for Motor Vehicle Liability and Motor Others. In a long term perspective, alternative models were applied to the estimation of the ultimate <b>reserve</b> <b>risk.</b> For Solvency Capital Requirements, a short-term perspective, it is necessary to estimate the one-year <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> factors, which was done by applying the three different methods presented and allowed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} the parameter risk {{in the context of}} internal modelling of the <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> under Solvency II. We discuss two opposed perspectives on parameter uncertainty and point out that standard methods of classical reserving focusing on the estimation error of claims reserves are in general not appropriate to model the impact of parameter uncertainty upon the actual risk of economic losses from the undertakings's perspective. Referring to the requirements of Solvency II we assess methods to model parameter uncertainty for the <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> by comparing the probability of solvency actually attained when modelling the solvency risk capital requirement based on the respective method to the required confidence level. Using the simple example of a normal model we show that the bootstrapping approach is not appropriate to model parameter uncertainty according to this criterion. We then present an adaptation of the approach proposed in froehlich 2014. Experimental results demonstrate that this new method yields a risk capital model for the <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> achieving the required confidence level in good approximation...|$|E

The aim of this thesis is to construct the reserving model based on the individual claims. Following the recent legislative changes, the <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> has been redefined from ultimate claim horizon to a one-year risk horizon.

To this end, we provide here a stochastic methodology in order to evaluate the distribution of claims reserve and to quantify the capital requirement for <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> of a single line of business. This proposal extends some existing approaches (see [12], [13], [17] and [19]) and it could represent a viable alternative to well-known methodologies in literature.

40|$|Stochastic {{models for}} {{outstanding}} claims valuation have been recently developed {{with the aim}} to obtain either a variability coefficient or the probability distribution of the reserve, useful {{for the assessment of}} the <b>Reserve</b> <b>Risk</b> capital requirement. Different methodologies, like Bootstrapping or Bayesian methods, allow to determine the prediction error and the claims reserve distribution under some assumptions based on the data figured out in the run-off triangle. The International Actuarial Association (IAA) proposed a different way to analyse out-standing claim reserve, focused on a paper by Meyers, Klinker and Lalonde where the overall reserve of a single LoB (without any distinction among different accident years) is described as a compound mixed poisson process, by a similar approach used for aggregate amount of claims when premium risk is to be estimated. In the present paper we extend this approach assuming that each single cell of {{the lower part of the}} run-off triangle follows a Compound Poisson Process (either Pure or Mixed). This assumption leads, under independence constraint, to obtain quite easily the exact moments of the reserve distribution only through the knowledge of the characteristics of the two main random variables (number and claim size of future payments). Furthermore, Monte Carlo methods allow to simulate outstanding claims distributions for each accident year, for both the overall reserve until complete run-off and the next calendar year only (in case of a one-year time horizon as prescribed in Solvency II). Model s parameters are calibrated from observed data and through a deterministic model (in the present paper an average cost method is used, namely Fisher-Lange method) based on the separate estimate of number of claims to be paid and future average costs for each cell of the lower triangle to be estimated. Finally, we analyze the one-year <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> in the perspective adopted by Solvency II. In particular a simulation approach, now usually called re-reserving, is here applied with the target to estimate the variability of claims development result and the percentiles, in order to quantify the capital requirement for the <b>reserve</b> <b>risk.</b> Main results will be compared using different stochastic reserving models, analysing the effect on both capital requirement for only <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> and risk margin...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} simple actuarial {{rationale}} for the non-life economic capital formula proposed for Solvency II in QIS 3. On the statistical side we improve on the methodology in QIS 3 by defining company specific estimators for all quantities of interest including premium risk and <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> volatilities as well as correlation coefficients at the granularity level of lines of business. We develop the non-life Solvency II economic capital formula applying both the value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) risk measures under a log-normal distribution of the portfolio combined ratio, which {{is defined as the}} ratio of incurred claims inclusive “run-off ” to the premium and reserve volume. We determine confidence levels under which both methods yield approximately identical practical results. Moreover, we point out that economic capital modeling should neither be restricted to a log-normal distribution assumption nor to the VaR and CVaR risk measures and refer to the actuarial literature for various extensions on this. The portfolio combined ratio is decomposed in a weighted sum of the premium risk ratio and the <b>reserve</b> <b>risk</b> ratio as suggested in QIS 3. Based on the basic portfolio risk ratio model summarized in the Appendix, we propose simple weighted estimators for all volatilities and correlation coefficients of interest.

These new requirements will come in force since 1 st January 2014 and will be by far more risk-sensitive than Solvency I capital requirements (firstly introduced in the Seventies and only slightly modified in 2002), thus enabling a better coverage of the real risks run by any insurer.

Currently, many regulatory and internal company models are attempting to combine insurance risk into a VAR modeling structure. VAR models view insurance related risk differently than the traditional actuarial models since risk is defined as the one-year fluctuation in market value of insurance liabilities. The paper starts by explaining the concepts behind VAR models of Economic Capital used in banking. Differences between actuarial and financial views of risk are reviewed and explained.

40|$|In the {{presented}} thesis we {{deal with}} the generalized linear models framework in a claims reserving problem. Claims reserving in non-life insurance is firstly described and the considered class of models is introduced. Consequently, this branch of stochastic modelling is implemented in the reserving setup. For computation of the risk associated with claims reserving, we need a predictive distribution of future liabilities in order to evaluate risk measures such as Va- lue at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk. Since datasets in non-life insurance commonly consist of a small number of observations and estimation of predictive distributions can be complicated, we adopt a bootstrap method for this purpose. Model fitting, simulations and consequent measuring of the <b>reserving</b> <b>risk</b> are performed within the use of real-life data. Based on this, an analysis of fitted models and their comparison together with graphical outputs is included. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the study for this {{dissertation}} {{is the relationship between}} pricing and <b>reserving</b> <b>risks</b> for property-casualty insurance companies. Since the risk characteristics of insurers differ based on their structure, objectives and incentives, segmenting the insurers into subgroups would allow for a better understanding of group-specific risks. Based on this approach to analyzing insurer financial risks, we find that, in a given accident year, the pricing and reserving errors are positively correlated, especially in long-tailed lines of business. Large insurers, stock insurers, and multi-state insurers, in general, exhibit a strong correlation between accident-year price and reserve errors. However, only size of insurers appears to be a factor that influences the interaction between price changes and the calendar year loss reserve adjustments. Furthermore, we find that the pricing <b>risk</b> and <b>reserving</b> <b>risk</b> are marginally more homogenous within a market segment when size, type and number of states are employed as criteria for market segmentation, hence insurance regulators should consider the refined market segments for the RBC formula. The empirical results also indicate that, in general, Chain-Ladder reserving method likely contributes to loss reserve errors when there is a change in the loss development pattern and the magnitude of the errors is worse for large insurers. Finally, we find that our proposed measurement method for the product diversification benefit provides support for the notion that the diversification benefit on the incurred losses increases with the number of lines in the portfolio. Yet, the diminishing returns tend to decrease the diversification benefit on the incurred losses for insurers that write the business in more than six of the selected lines. To the contrary, our proposed measure does not provide clear evidence that writing business in many product lines increases the product diversification benefit with respect to adverse loss development. We do find that the diversification benefit for both incurred losses and loss development is higher for larger insurers. Hence, for risk management and regulatory purposes, a stronger case can be made for considering firm size than product diversification...|$|R
