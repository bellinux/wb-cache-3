According to the World Bank and USAID, ONEA has an excellent <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> in West Africa. It serves 43 cities and towns throughout the country. ONEA’s and the government’s mutual responsibilities are laid out in three-year performance contracts (contracts plans) with explicit operational targets. A board of directors {{is responsible for the}} supervision of ONEA’s performance and for all strategic decisions. It has the authority to appoint (and fire) the general manager and determine employees’ pay scales, while a general manager makes day-to-day operational decisions. The utility is allowed to cut off service for nonpayment of water bills, and its workers are subject to private sector (not civil service) rules.|$|E

40|$|Swine breeders in {{this country}} have been {{handicapped}} by not having had a satisfactory basis for the effective selection of their breeding stock. The judging of livestock by experienced men based on visual inspection has been responsible for considerable progress, but it should be supplemented by additional facts in order to determine accurately such essentials as ability to reproduce efficiently, to grow rapidly and to convert a unit of feed into a near-maximum of quality meat and by-products. Actual <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> have been used for years as a basis for the breeding of race horses. The dairyman and the poultryman also use <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance.</b> The regular weighing of the milk from each individual cow and the testing of the fat content of the milk by means of the Babcock test, and the trap-nesting of hens are modern, more fundamental methods of discriminating between desirable and undesirable animals.

50|$|Stage {{direction}} {{at various}} parts of the play (e.g. Fight and beat them away at line 101, and Give them the letters and they stampe and storme at line 2130) strongly suggests that the play was performed. Additionally, the division of 'dramatis personae' into 'Eleaven who may easily acte this comedie' is perhaps indicative of the 'division of labour' which would have been required for a travelling troupe. It is a possibility, then, that Thomas Heywood wrote the play for the purposes of performing it with his travelling company - Worcester's Men. Nevertheless, no extant <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> exists for this drama.|$|E

After just a few months, however, he decided this was not a good fit for him, so he resumed his career with the Army.

Because of his outstanding <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> during the Civil War, he was promoted in September of that year to captain.
