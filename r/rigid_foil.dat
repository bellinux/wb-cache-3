40|$|The {{wake of a}} {{flexible}} foil undergoing pitching oscillations in a low-speed hydrodynamic tunnel is {{used to examine the}} effect of chord-wise foil flexibility in the dynamical features of flapping-based propulsion. We compare the regime transitions in the wake with respect to the case of a <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> and show that foil flexibility inhibits the symmetry breaking of the reverse Bénard-von Kármán wake reported in the literature.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{experimental}} study, we investigate thrust production from a pitching flexible foil {{in a uniform}} flow. The flexible foils studied comprise a <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> in the front (chord length CR) that is pitched sinusoidally at a frequency f, with a flexible flap of length C-F and flexural rigidity El attached to its trailing edge. We investigate thrust generation {{for a range of}} flexural rigidities (El) and flap length to total chord ratio (C-F/C), with the mean thrust ((C) over bar (T)) and the efficiency of thrust generation (eta) being directly measured in each case. The thrust in the <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> cases, as expected, is found be primarily due to the normal force on the <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> (C-F/C) with the chordwise or axial thrust contribution ((C-TA) over bar) being small and negative. In contrast, in the flexible foil cases, the axial contribution to thrust becomes important. We find that using a nondimensional flexural rigidity parameter (R*) defined as R* = EI/(0. 5 p U- 2 C-F(3)) appears to combine the independent effects of variations in El and CF/C at a given value of the reduced frequency (k = pi fc/U) for the range of C-F/C values studied here (U is free-stream velocity; p is fluid density). At k; 6, the peak mean thrust coefficient found to be about 100 % higher than the <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> thrust, and occurs at R* value of approximately 8, while the peak efficiency is found to be approximately 300 % higher than the <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> efficiency and occurs at a distinctly different R* value of close to 0. 01. Corresponding to these two optimal flexural rigidity parameter values, -we find two distinct flap deflection shapes; the peak thrust corresponding to a mode 1 type simple bending of the flap with no inflection points, while the peak efficiency corresponds to a distinctly different deflection profile having an inflection point along the flap. The peak thrust condition is found to be close to the `resonance' condition for the first mode natural frequency of the flexible flap in still water. In both these optimal cases, we find that it is the axial contribution to thrust that dominates ((C-TA) over bar >> (C-TN) over bar), in contrast to the <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> case. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements for the flexible cases show significant differences in the strength and arrangement of the wake vortices in these two cases...|$|E

40|$|Thrust-generating {{flapping}} foils {{are known}} to produce jets inclined to the free stream at high Strouhal numbers St = fA/U-infinity, where f is the frequency and A is the amplitude of flapping and U-infinity is the free-stream velocity. Our experiments, in the limiting case of St —> infinity (zero free-stream speed), show that a purely oscillatory pitching motion of a chordwise flexible foil produces a coherent jet composed of a reverse Benard-Karman vortex street along the centreline, albeit over a specific range of effective flap stiffnesses. We obtain flexibility by attaching a thin flap to {{the trailing edge of}} a rigid NACA 0015 foil; length of flap is 0. 79 c where c is <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> chord length. It is the time-varying deflections of the flexible flap that suppress the meandering found in the jets produced by a pitching <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> for zero free-stream condition. Recent experiments (Marais et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 710, 2012, p. 659) have also shown that the flexibility increases the St at which non-deflected jets are obtained. Analysing the near-wake vortex dynamics from flow visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, we identify the mechanisms by which flexibility suppresses jet deflection and meandering. A convenient characterization of flap deformation, caused by fluid-flap interaction, is through a non-dimensional effective stiffness', EI* = 8 EI/(rho V-TEmax(2) s(f) c(f) (3) / 2), representing the inverse of the flap deflection due to the fluid-dynamic loading; here, EI is the bending stiffness of flap, rho is fluid density, V-TEmax is the maximum velocity of <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> trailing edge, s(f) is span and c(f) is chord length of the flexible flap. By varying the amplitude and frequency of pitching, we obtain a variation in EI* over nearly two orders of magnitude and show that only moderate EI*. (0. 1 less than or similar to EI * less than or similar to 1 generates a sustained, coherent, orderly jet. Relatively `stiff' flaps (EI* greater than or similar to 1), including the extreme case of no flap, produce meandering jets, whereas highly `flexible' flaps (EI* less than or similar to 0. 1) produce spread-out jets. Obtained from the measured mean velocity fields, we present values of thrust coefficients for the cases for which orderly jets are observed...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{experimentally}} study thrust generation from sinusoidally pitched rigid and flexible foils {{immersed in a}} uniform flow. The flexible foils are made by attaching a flexible flap of known flexural rigidity and flap length to {{the trailing edge of}} a <b>rigid</b> <b>foil.</b> For such thrust generating systems, a propulsive efficiency (η) may be defined as the ratio of the useful work done to the input energy requirement. In the present experiments, the propulsive efficiency (η) of the flapping foil can be determined from direct measurement of the unsteady forces and torque on the foil. The effects of systematic variation of the flexural rigidity of the foil, from highly flexible to rigid, on the thrust and efficiency characteristics of the foil are investigated. Studying such oscillating foils helps one to understand and mimic the efficient thrust generating mechanism in fishes and other creatures that use flapping to locomote themselves. A strain guage based loadcell is used to measure the forces normal to the foil (N) and forces along the chord of the foil (A). With a potentiometer, the instantaneous angular position (θ) is also measured, so that instantaneous lift (L) and thrust (T) can be calculated. The measured moment (M) is used to calculate the instantaneous power input (P = Mθ˙). The foil is immersed in a uniform flow (u) set in a water tunnel, and the sinusoidal pitching (θ = θmaxsinωt) is provided by a servo motor. The Reynolds number (Re = uc/ν) in the present study is in the range of 103 to 104. For the case of the <b>rigid</b> <b>foil,</b> the thrust and efficiency characteristics are presented for variation of the non-dimensional flapping frequency called the ‘reduced frequency’ (k = πfc/u), which is varied in the range of 1 to 10. At small reduced frequency (k 3, the foil experiences a mean thrust that grows rapidly as the reduced frequency (k) is increased. The thrust characteristics of the <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> are decided mainly by the normal force’s phase with respect to θ (φCN) and its magnitude ([CN]), as the chord-wise force is very small compared to the normal force (A << N). The measurements show that the non-dimensional mean thrust coefficient (CT) scales as k 2 and non-dimensional mean power (CP) scales as k 3 for k Ҳ 4. The maximum efficiency for rigid foils is found to be 8 % and it occurs at k 6. For the flexible foil case, the effect of making a portion of the total foil flexible by means of attaching a flexible flap of known flexural rigidity (EI) and flap length (cF) to a <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> of length (cR) is studied. Unlike the rigid foils, the chordwise force (A) becomes an important factor in determining the thrust and efficiency characteristics of the flexible foils, due to the bending of the flap. We present results for a broad range of flexural rigidities from highly flexible flaps to stiff flaps, with the extent of flexibility fixed at cF /cR = 0. 8. We find that there is an optimal flexural rigidity for which the efficiency (η) reaches a maximum of 28 %. This represents a 250 % improvement compared to the <b>rigid</b> <b>foil.</b> The flexible foils with stiff flaps show a strange behavior with all the mean thrust coming from chordwise forces (A), unlike other flexible foils where the contribution to mean thrust come from both normal and chordwise forces. The effect of varying the extent of flexibility (cF/cR) with fixed flexural rigidity has also been studied. We define a non-dimensional flexibility parameter, R∗ = EI/(0. 5 ρu 2 sc 3 F), which can combine the effect of variations in EI and cF /cR. Using this non-dimensional flexibility parameter (R∗), we find out that mean thrust and efficiency data for both the EI and cF/cR variation study collapse onto a single curve, indicating that R∗ can indeed be a single parameter characterizing flexibility. The present work shows that flexible foils can improve efficiency over rigid foils. Efficiency improvements can come in two ways depending on the R∗ of the flexible foil. Flexible foils with R∗ in the range of 10 − 2 to 100 show nearly 250 % improvement in efficiency, accompanied by nearly 70 % loss in thrust compared to an entirely <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> of the same total chord. Flexible foils with R∗ in the range of 100 to 101 show nearly 50 % improvement in efficiency accompanied by nearly 100 % increase in thrust...|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{provides a}} propulsion {{system based on}} "thuniform" movement of a foil member to achieve desired directional movement of a vehicle such as an unmanned submarine type of vessel. A pair of foil members are mounted to the vehicle body for reciprocating oscillating movement {{towards and away from}} each other, creating forward movement due to the compression of a fluid medium between the foil members and the expulsion of the compressed fluid rearwardly of the foil members. Each foil member is mounted to a pivot shaft for limited rotational movement with respect to the vehicle body. Damping means are connected between each pivot shaft and its associated foil member so that during operation of the propulsion system damping torque will offset hydrodynamic loads imposed on the foil members by the fluid medium. The damping means will in turn control the pitch angle of the foil members during operation, meaning that a thrust is generated for <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> members when moving at zero forward speed.

The results presented investigate {{the effect of}} amplitude, depth and flexible trailing-edge devices on the drag reduction of a NACA 0012 airfoil plunging at a range of frequencies. At low Strouhal number based on amplitude, SrA, the drag reduction follows a parabolic trend with greater effect for greater amplitude, similar to Garrick predictions. At SrA ≈ 0. 08 larger amplitudes break from this trend due to leading-edge vortex formation. As a result smaller amplitudes become preferable for SrA> 0. 12. The effect of depth is twofold, firstly with decreasing depth {{there is a general}} departure from Garrick trends. Secondly a reduction in thrust is observed around a constant unsteady parameter of τ ≈ 0. 25; around this value significant free surface waves form that detract from thrust creation. For depths greater than two chords there is negligible free surface effect. Flexible trailing edge devices are shown to increase drag reduction by up to 28 %. The device acts to strengthen the trailing-edge vortices leading to a stronger time-averaged jet.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} use of {{constrained}} surrogate models to solve the multi-design optimization problem of a flexible hydrofoil. The surrogate-based optimization (EGO) substitutes the complex objective function of the problem by an easily evaluable model, constructed from {{a limited number of}} computations at carefully selected design points. Associated with ad-hoc statistical strategies to propose optimum candidates within the estimated feasible domain, EGO enables the resolution of complex optimization problems. In this work, we rely on Gaussian processes (GP) to model the objective function and adopt a probabilistic classification method to treat non-explicit inequality constraints and non-explicit representation of the feasible domain. This procedure is applied to the design of the shape and the elastic characteristics of a hydrofoil equipped with deformable elements providing flexibility to the trailing edge. The optimization concerns the minimization of the hydrofoil drag while ensuring a non-cavitating flow, at selected sailing conditions (boat speed and lifting force). The drag value and cavitation criterion are determined by solving a two-dimensional nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problem, based on a static vortex lattice method with viscous boundary layer equations, for the flow, and a nonlinear elasticity solver for the deformations of the elastic components of the foil. We compare the optimized flexible hydrofoil with a <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> geometrically optimized for the same sailing conditions.

The aim of the forego-ing studies was to demonstrate the effect of plant pruning and topping manner on yield quantity and earliness. The experiment was conducted in the years 2001 – 2003. The study objects were the plants of ‘Epic F 1 ’ cultivar. Eggplant was grown in <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> cylinders of the capacity of 10 dm 3 in the peat substrates. The plants were trimmed, managing for one, two, three, four, five, six guiding shoots and in the natural form, without trimming. Top-ping cut was performed in each combination after the first fruit harvest. The experiment was established and conducted as a two-factor one, in accordance with a complete ran-domization system: A – pruning method (a = 7), B – topped and non-topped plants (b = 2). Each combination of the examined factors was represented by 20 plants (experimental units). A significant effect of pruning intensity on the quantity and earliness yielding was demonstrated. The highest marketable fruit yield was obtained from plants managed for two (3. 82 kg. m- 2), three (3. 98 kg. m- 2), and four (3. 87 kg. m- 2) guiding shoots. Managing for one guiding shoot significantly decreased the total and marketable fruit number. The highest early yield was collected from plants managed for one and two guiding shoots.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of flapping remains a subject a great {{theoretical and practical}} interest. Propulsion and maneuvering by flapping, optimized through years of evolution, is ubiquitous in nature, yet marine pulsars inspired by examples of highly maneuverable marine life or aquatic birds remain unheard of. The motivation of this research stems from the notion that better propulsive strategies could be obtained from flapping foils; presenting superior alternatives to the conventional propeller for waterborne propulsion. The propulsive properties of a Nasa 0012 linearly tapered <b>rigid</b> <b>foil,</b> with a. 5. 5 cm average chord and 24. 6 cm span performing a combined roll and pitch motion are investigated. The mean planform area thrust coefficient and efficiency are recorded over a paramtetric space that included three roll amplitudes, with induced heave (at 0. 7 span) to chord ratio, á¸£₀. ₇ / c = 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0; Strouhal numbers ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 6 and maximum angle of attack varying from 15 to 45 degrees. Results show that a maximum planform area thrust coefficient of 2. 09 is achieved at h₀. ₇ / c = 1. 5, St = 0. 6 and,[alpha][max] = 30 ⁰. The thrust and efficiency data also reveal a useful performance trend where at low [alpha][max], high thrust and efficiency can be gained at sufficiently high Strouhal numbers. (cont.) DPIV is next used to study the vortical signature created by the flapping foil. Two planes of view, at mid- and 0. 8 span were recorded over regimes of low and high thrust. Results show that the vortex patterns are heavily influenced by the foil geometry and kinematics. Three distinct patterns were observed. In particular, the interaction from the shedding of a mixed vortex pair in the wake unveils evidence of strong thrust production. Vorticity control through the replication of this wake vortex pattern can potentially offer optimal solutions for flapping foil propulsion. by Keith K. L. Lim. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In {{conventional}} sailboat design, the heeling momentum {{introduced by}} the <b>rigid</b> connection of <b>foils</b> in air and water is a limitation on the maximum ve- locity. By removing the hull all together, wetted surface induced drag can be removed and increase the theoretical maximum velocity of a sailboat. Today ROV s are limited by their attachment to a parent ship through the umbil- ical. AUV s have operational limits due to energy storage capacity. Wind is a readably available energy source and is exploited in traditional sailing. By exploiting the wind energy a marine vehicle can increase the operational space compared to conventional vehicles. This {{can be done by}} incorporat- ing foils for sailing and an energy harvesting system to increase no wind performance. The high vantage point of kites can improve communication and energy harvesting capabilities. Efficient aerofoils have unstable flight dynamics and high frequency response, and introduce several challenges for a control system. By neglecting higher order dynamics, a simplified model in combination with experimental data can be used to investigate different approaches in control system design regarding a wind powered marine vehi- cle application where a kite is utilized for propulsion. A paravane can reflect the kite forces in the water with minimum drag and opts for a high speed sailing vehicle that can expand or combine the existing workspace covered by ROV s and AUV s today. A PID-controller {{will not be able to}} control a kite when a random walk pro- cess is introduced on the ambient wind. Different optimization approaches, such as MPC using NLP algorithms and thrust allocation theory, should be considered in future work regarding design of a control system for kites. However, the solution in a thrust allocation approach may not always exist, and specially at critical points in the system response. A feedback lineariza- tion approach may not be trivial to apply, as the control inputs are coupled for a parawing kite.

It was also found that the best propulsive efficiency and smallest thrust coefficient occurred at about same phase angle position, and vice versa. The best propulsive efficiency was found when the pitching axis was placed at 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8 root chord position for the flukes of white whale, fin whale and white-sided dolphin respectively.

Engineering and Applied ScienceBibliography: leaves 154 - 160 An {{unsteady}} numerical method, {{called the}} quasi-vortex-lattice method (QVLM), to calculate aerodynamic forces on oscillating wings is investigated {{and applied to}} the problem of oscillating foil propulsion. It is based on the vortex-lattice-method (VLM). The method was formulated for prediction of aerodynamical characteristics of a non-planar wing with arbitrary shape in unsteady harmonic motion. Based on three dimensional (3 — D) unsteady lifting surface theory, the method h. us been designed to handle irregular wing shapes of both planar and non-planar wings and to work with low aspect ratio foils. A computer program was written for the prediction of propulsion features of a harmonically oscillating hydrofoil. This computer program was checked by comparing present results with existing published results for some given planforms. The computer program is capable of solving unsteady three dimensional, non-planar <b>rigid</b> <b>foil</b> propulsion problems.
