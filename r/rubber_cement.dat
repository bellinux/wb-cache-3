5|$|Despite {{representing}} a new vessel, the Enterprise-A {{was the same}} model {{that had been used}} since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the Enterprises hairline cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and so when the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in The Voyage Home, where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged <b>rubber</b> <b>cement,</b> with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this study}} a {{resonant}} column apparatus {{was used to}} obtain the shear modulus and damping ratio of the waste granular <b>rubber</b> and <b>cement</b> soil mixtures. Specimens were tested for different rubber contents and confining pressures. Experiments show that with the rubber increased, the damping ratio of the <b>rubber</b> and <b>cement</b> soil mixtures increases, dynamic modulus decreases. When the confining pressure increases, the shear modulus of <b>rubber</b> and <b>cement</b> soil mixtures increase gradualy, damping ratio increase slightly...|$|R

Thickening agents such as solvents, foam polystyrene, baking soda, petroleum jelly, tar, strips of tyre tubing, nitrocellulose, XPS foam, motor oil, <b>rubber</b> <b>cement,</b> detergent and dish soap have been added to help the burning liquid adhere to the target and create clouds of thick, choking smoke.|$|E
25|$|Harvey Flax, who in 1949 {{was just}} {{entering}} the Los Angeles Flax business {{to work with}} his father Meyer, commissioned a young designer named Louis Danziger {{to create a new}} trademark. The logo was originally intended to support a private label program for a new formula of pressure sensitive <b>rubber</b> <b>cement,</b> but soon thereafter the 'F' was adopted and shared with the other Flax businesses across the country as a unifying branding element.|$|E
500|$|After this setback, Colt {{turned his}} {{attention}} to perfecting tinfoil cartridges he had originally designed for use in his revolvers. The standard at the time was to have powder and ball contained in a paper or skin envelope or [...] "cartridge" [...] for ease of loading. However, if the paper got wet it would ruin the powder. Colt tried alternate materials such as <b>rubber</b> <b>cement,</b> but settled on a thin type of tinfoil. In 1841 he made samples of these cartridges for the army. During tests of the foil cartridges, 25 rounds were fired from a musket without cleaning. When the breech plug was removed from the barrel no fouling from the tin foil was evident. The reception was lukewarm and the army purchased a few thousand rounds for further testing. In 1843 the army returned to Colt with an order for 200,000 of the tinfoil cartridges packed 10 to a box for use in muskets.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{adhesives}} that harden by drying: solvent-based adhesives and polymer dispersion adhesives, also known as emulsion adhesives. Solvent-based adhesives are a mixture of ingredients (typically polymers) dissolved in a solvent. White glue, contact adhesives and <b>rubber</b> <b>cements</b> are members of the drying adhesive family. As the solvent evaporates, the adhesive hardens. Depending on the chemical composition of the adhesive, they will adhere to different materials to greater or lesser degrees.|$|R
25|$|In 1903, Ludwig Roselius popularized {{the use of}} benzene to decaffeinate coffee. This {{discovery}} led to {{the production}} of Sanka. This process was later discontinued. Benzene was historically used as a significant component in many consumer products such as Liquid Wrench, several paint strippers, <b>rubber</b> <b>cements,</b> spot removers, and other products. Manufacture of some of these benzene-containing formulations ceased in about 1950, although Liquid Wrench continued to contain significant amounts of benzene until the late 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Glue and {{gasoline}} sniffing {{is also a}} problem in parts of Africa, especially with street children. In India and South Asia, {{three of the most}} widely abused inhalants are the Dendrite brand and other forms of contact adhesives and <b>rubber</b> <b>cements</b> manufactured in Kolkata, and toluenes in paint thinners. Genkem is a brand of glue which had become the generic name for all the glues used by glue-sniffing children in Africa before the manufacturer replaced n-hexane in its ingredients in 2000.|$|R
500|$|A {{descendant}} of the wealthy Tunt family, Cheryl is introduced as a clingy and emotionally fragile individual. Early on she is intermittently referred to as Carol by her coworkers (a premise which becomes one of the shows' longest running jokes) as they are initially dismissive of her somewhat morbid behavior and neglectful of her presence. As the series progresses, the character abandons her lugubrious traits and embraces a more sadistic and maniacal personality. Cheryl is often sexually aroused from being choked and enjoys sniffing and drinking <b>rubber</b> <b>cement.</b> She possesses a ditzy demeanor, which often interferes with her work ethic. An array of descriptions have been established for the character by critics, mainly her [...] "incompetent" [...] and [...] "insane" [...] tendencies. Throughout the series' run, the character has been applauded by television commentators, as has Greer's voice work, which {{has resulted in the}} actress being nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in a Television Production.|$|E
2500|$|Ballpoint pens with [...] "erasable ink" [...] were {{pioneered by}} the Paper Mate pen company. The ink {{formulas}} of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to <b>rubber</b> <b>cement,</b> allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent. Erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurised cartridges to facilitate inkflow—meaning {{they can also}} write upside-down. Though these pens are equipped with erasers, any eraser will suffice.|$|E
50|$|The {{solvents}} used in <b>rubber</b> <b>cement</b> {{present some}} hazards, including flammability and potential for abuse as inhalants. Therefore, {{as with any}} adhesive, <b>rubber</b> <b>cement</b> {{should be used in}} an open area. Also, care needs be taken to avoid heat sources, as n-heptane and n-hexane are highly flammable. <b>Rubber</b> <b>cement</b> and <b>rubber</b> <b>cement</b> thinner (which is used to replace the solvent that evaporates from the container and to remove stains of glue) that contain acetone will damage polished surfaces and many plastics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rubber</b> <b>cements</b> are {{solutions}} {{of synthetic}} or natural rubber products in solvents, {{with or without}} resins and gums. Vulcanizers, accelerators, and stabilizers are considered problematic {{due to the nature}} of their compounds. One example is the additive of sulfur which is harmful to some types of material, including silver, because it can cause discoloration. Rubber adhesives can be confused with epoxy resins due to their similar appearance. However, unlike epoxy resins, rubber adhesives will stretch when pulled. Nitromors or Polystrippa solvent brands are used as a solvent but warm water can also loosen the bond.|$|R
50|$|Natural rubber {{was first}} used as {{material}} for adhesives starting in 1830. In 1839, Charles Goodyear discovered that a rubber and sulfur mixture, when heated, becomes elastic. In 1843, Thomas Hancock named this process vulcanization. In 1862, a British patent (number 3288) was issued for the plating of metal with brass by electrodeposition to obtain a stronger bond to rubber. The development of the automobile {{and the need for}} rubber shock mounts required stronger and more durable bonds of rubber and metal. This spurred the development of cyclized rubber treated in strong acids. By 1927, this process was used to produce solvent-based thermoplastic <b>rubber</b> <b>cements</b> for metal to rubber bonding.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{the lineup}} of Kircher, Dutmer, Harris, Johnson who, with the {{intention}} of at long last producing an LP, recorded There's No Sky (Oh My My) in 2008. This time the group took to their practice space in the basement of Milwaukee artist space, The Borg Ward. A former funeral home in Milwaukee's lower west side, the space still retained a body cooler in the basement where the band practiced. The four recorded the basic tracks to There's No Sky live, over a weeks time. Kircher then spent the following 6 months adding and overdubbing guitars, keys, vocals and effects, creating a lo-fi but lush sound. It was pressed on 12" [...] vinyl with blank jackets, the cover art a black and white xerox <b>rubber</b> <b>cemented</b> on.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} {{inclusion}} of waste crumb <b>rubber</b> and <b>cement</b> on the unconfined compressive strength and wet-dry durability of clayey soil has been investigated. Crumb <b>rubber</b> and <b>cement</b> were added to clayey soil at ranges of 2. 5 %- 10 % and 3 %- 6 % respectively. The {{results of the investigation}} revealed that the incorporation of crumb rubber influenced the unconfined compressive strength, axial strain at failure, energy absorption capacity and wet-dry durability of the cement-stabilized clay. The study reveals that as the content of crumb rubber in the cement-stabilized clayey soil increases the unconfined compressive strength decreases but prosperously changes the behavior of the cement-stabilized clay from brittle to ductile. The axial strain corresponding to peak axial stress and energy absorption capacity of the specimens can be increased by limiting the content of crumb rubber up to 5 %. The weight loss of the cement-stabilized clay mixed with crumb rubber increases as the content of crumb rubber increases. With the prolongation of the curing period, the weight loss of cement-stabilized clay mixed with crumb rubber decreases. Further, the weight loss of 90 days cured specimens of clayey soil incorporated with 6 % <b>cement</b> and crumb <b>rubber</b> up to 5 % meets the recommendation of the material to be used in construction of road pavements as a base, sub-base, and shoulder. Most importantly, the utilization/disposal of this hazardous waste material reduces its impact on environment and health...|$|R
