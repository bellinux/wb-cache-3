40|$|Nowadays, {{the use of}} R 744 or {{carbon dioxide}} has been {{increased}} as a working fluid in many refrigerant systems. Nevertheless, one disadvantage for use this refrigerant is the thermodynamic losses produced in the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>system</b> when the fluid is throttled. These losses are increased if the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>system</b> is working in transcritical operation conditions. But, there is an option and it consists of using an ejector instead of the conventional expansion valve {{in order to reduce}} the energy losses and to increase the energy efficiency of the R 744 <b>refrigerant</b> <b>system.</b> Thus, the R 744 ejector refrigeration system is converted into a real possibility comparing to the conventional refrigeration system and it provides a significant reduction of the environmental contamination. This work has been performed with the purpose to increase the knowledge about how the ejector refrigeration system works at different operation conditions by means of an experimental analysis. Also, the test facility used in this experimental analysis is a two phase ejector refrigeration system with R 744 as a working fluid. The experimental results obtained show that the ejector works more efficiently using a pressure lift between 4 and 9 bar and with a entrainment ratio from 0. 10 to 0. 48, approximately. Furthermore, the ejector efficiency achieves the higher values working with the pressure ratio between 1. 1 to 1. 35, and the highest efficiency is found at the pressure ratio of 1. 275, approximately. Besides, it is demonstrated that working at high inlet temperatures the ejector efficiency is better than working at low temperatures. This is due to the fact that more energy is saved by the ejector working at high temperatures because the expansion work is bigger than using the ejector at low temperatures. Therefore, it is shown that the ejector performs more efficiently in warm climates than running the ejector in cold climates...|$|E

Almost in all the cases, when R- 134 a was replaced with HCs the COP of the system was improved, ON time ratio and energy consumption was reduced. Due to a higher value of latent heat of HCs, the amount of refrigerant charge was also reduced as compared with HFC- 134 a.

40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} cost {{of electricity}} and the high demand charges levied by utility companies, thermal storage for cooling is rapidly becoming a widely recognized method to lower cooling costs. There are three maior types of thermal storage systems: ? Ice Storage: This utilizes the {{latent heat of fusion}} of ice for thermal storage.

Chilled Water Storage: Chilled water is generated and stored during off-peak periods and used for cooling during on-peak hours.
