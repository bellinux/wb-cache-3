5|$|The Vrba–Wetzler {{report was}} not {{distributed}} widely until weeks after Vrba's escape in April 1944. Between 15 May and 7 July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews (12,000 a day) were deported to Auschwitz. Vrba believed {{they would have}} <b>run</b> <b>or</b> fought had they been told they were being sent to their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian striker Fred, who was {{replaced}} by Willian in the 70th minute, received a particularly hostile reaction from the home fans. According to Opta Sports, Fred failed to make a single tackle, cross, <b>run</b> <b>or</b> interception during the match, and actually spent {{the majority of his}} time in possession of the ball on the centre spot due to six restarts.|$|E
5|$|One-day {{track and}} field {{meetings}} form {{the most common and}} seasonal aspect of the sport – they are the most basic level of {{track and field}} competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately <b>run</b> <b>or</b> independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.|$|E

5|$|Play {{behaviour}} in calves differs {{between the}} sexes; females <b>run</b> <b>or</b> chase {{each other while}} males play-fight. The former are sexually mature {{by the age of}} nine years while the latter become mature around 14–15 years. Adulthood starts at about 18 years of age in both sexes. Elephants have long lifespans, reaching 60–70 years of age. Lin Wang, a captive male Asian elephant, lived for 86 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{first white}} {{settlers}} in Lackawanna County settled near Keyser Creek. Timothy Keys, Solomon Hocksey, and Andrew Hickman constructed homes at this location in 1769. The creek {{is named after}} Timothy Keys. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission added a Pennsylvania State Historical Marker near the creek in 1948 to commemorate the settlers. Another early settler in the area was Cornelius Atherton, who arrived at a hill overlooking the creek in 1782. In maps from the 1700s, the creek {{is referred to as}} Beaver <b>Run</b> <b>or</b> Beaver Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} middle-distance track events are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, {{although}} the 3000 metres {{may also be}} classified as a middle-distance event. The 880 yard <b>run,</b> <b>or</b> half mile, was the forebear of the 800m distance and it {{has its roots in}} competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s. The 1500m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500m track, which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult judgment call where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned <b>run</b> <b>or</b> an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{made his}} debut for New South Wales {{at the age}} of 18 against South Australia during the 1955–56 season. His lack of {{contribution}} was highlighted against the backdrop of his team's crushing innings victory: O'Neill failed to score a <b>run</b> <b>or</b> take a wicket. New South Wales bowled first and had South Australia at 6/49 when Miller introduced O'Neill's occasional leg spin, presumably to ease the debutant's nerves by bringing him into the game. The home team struck 18 from three overs. O'Neill was listed to bat in the lower middle order but after the top order had made a big start, Miller brought O'Neill up. He came in against the second new ball and was clean bowled. O'Neill was dropped and did not play another match for the season, but had gained invaluable experience.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 2008, Thackeray {{was arrested}} in Ratnagiri after Mumbai police had {{received}} a non-bailable warrant issued by a Jamshedpur court against the MNS chief. Raj's arrest ignited violence by his supporters in {{large parts of the}} city forcing it to shut down. Irate supporters went on the rampage torching public transport and telling office goers to return home. Many shops and commercial establishments, especially those <b>run</b> <b>or</b> managed by non-Maharashtrians, chose not to open at all to avoid trouble.

5|$|The {{principal}} motivation {{or driving}} force behind the re-establishment of religious houses in the kingdom of the English, living in strict accordance with the Rule of Saint Benedict, was a desire to restore to their former glory some of the ancient houses known from the pages of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, from other literary works, from historical traditions of the later eighth and ninth centuries, or indeed from the physical remains of buildings... Modern historians will recognise how much was owed to the monastic reform movements on the continent, and will find extra dimensions, such as a wish to extend royal influence into areas where a king of the West Saxons might not expect his writ to <b>run,</b> <b>or</b> a more general wish to revive a sense of 'Englishness', through raising awareness of the tradition of the past.|$|E
5|$|They {{team up with}} a {{group called}} the Sweeper Alliance to storm the Apostles of the Stars' island, {{organized}} by Chronos assassin Lin Shaolee in disguise to act as decoys for Chronos' own attack. Separated upon arriving, Train, Sven and Eve each get involved in fights with members of the Apostles, while Chronos, who landed after them, get to Creed first. Sephiria Arks faces off against Creed, but loses. Sven, Eve and Chronos then fight bio-warrior weapons fused with nanotechnology, while Train begins his battle with Creed. Creed has obtained immortality, although he reveals to Train his only weakness; his brain cannot be repaired like the rest of his body. Train defeats Creed using one last full-powered railgun shot to destroy his Imagine Blade and Eve uses her own nanomachines to take those that give Creed immortality out of his body. Train and Sephiria allow Creed to walk away, and the survivors of the Apostles of the Stars are shown on the <b>run</b> <b>or</b> hiding.|$|E
5|$|Dean and Knapp {{record that}} in early 1707 Keiser {{surrendered}} the lease of the Gänsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became {{responsible for the}} staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts {{is that the two}} parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original <b>run,</b> <b>or</b> of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.|$|E

5|$|The {{technique}} of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared {{to an average}} bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed {{in order to remain}} in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either <b>run</b> <b>or</b> face into a strong wind in order to take off.|$|E
