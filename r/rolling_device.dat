40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{mechanical}} process termed "Compression rolling" {{on the structure of}} sawn timber have been investigated {{in the course of this}} work. 1. 	A wood rolling mill was designed on the basis of preliminary experiments and the experiences of previous workers. The multi-functional <b>rolling</b> <b>device</b> contains a series of innovations which were necessary to test the effects of different rolling parameters on the timber structure. 2. 	A multifactorial, randomized, fully-replicated block design was set up to determine the effects of the process on the diffusivity and on the permeability of Nothofagus fusca heartwood (New Zealand red beech). The results showed that the process had a pronounced effect on permeability, which was assessed after a pressure treatment with CCA preservatives, whereas the drying characteristics were only modified to a minor degree. 3. 	The importance of level of saturation at the time of rolling was determined. With a decrease in moisture content structural alterations were increasingly confined to microscopic damage, whereas application of the process to highly saturated boards resulted in substantial macroscopic damage. Thus any advantage in compression rolling with respect to drying is vitiated by having to pre-dry before hand! 4. 	Detailed scanning electron microscopical (SEM) examination was undertaken to observe anatomical alterations induced by compression rolling of red beech. Most noticeable was the effect on the vessels and on the intra- and intervascular structure (perforation plates, tyloses and vessel to vessel pits), which appeared deformed and occasionally collapsed and ruptured. 5. 	The SEM was used to investigate the effects of hot water soaking and compression rolling. The recorded improvements in drying rate were attributed to the dilution and partial extraction of phenolics from the ray parenchyma and its redistribution, whereas the subsequent rolling process was not able to increase further the radial or tangential drying rate. 6. 	The effects of rolling on the structure and permeability of the heartwood of two refractory softwoods (Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea sitchensis) were determined. In both species permeability was only improved to a small extent and the improvement observed was confined to small bands mainly within the latewood. 7. 	Similar structural alterations in both species at macroscopical and microscopical level are indicative of an irregular strain distribution throughout the boards. This was attributed to a large variation in density and inherent permeability between earlywood and latewood...|$|E

The need for a continuous flow device for cell sorting has resulting in the development of devices such as deterministic lateral displacement devices (DLD) and deterministic cell <b>rolling</b> <b>devices.</b> Although these devices are quite effective at sorting cells, they are not used in clinical settings.

To achieve DLD like results, a segment of mesh was sealed from top and bottom to allow lateral flow through the mesh. The meshes were sealed using either microscope slides to form a rigid device or thermoplastics to form a flexible device. To achieve roll over like results, meshes were placed into an etched channel and sealed using a thermoplastic to allow cells to roll over the mesh. Results from these devices showed consistent displacement as particles maneuvered through and over the mesh.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} thesis is concerned with analytical, numerical and experimental studies {{of the effect of}} cold rolling on the fatigue behaviour of threaded drillstring connections. A comprehensive literature study is made of the various effects on the fatigue behaviour of residual stresses introduced by mechanical deformation of notched components. Some of the effects studied are cyclic hardening behaviour after prestraining, cyclic creep, fatigue initiation in prestrained materials, short cracks and crack growth models including crack closure. Residual stresses were introduced in the surface of a smooth pipe by a <b>rolling</b> <b>device</b> to simulate a cold rolling process and verify the calculated residual stresses by measurements. Strain hardening and contact algorithm of the two bodies were incorporated in the FE analyses. Two significant errors were found in the commercial software package for residual stress evaluation, Restan v. 3. 3. 2 a also called SINT, when using the Schajer method. The Schajer algorithm is the only hole-drilling algorithm without theoretical shortcomings, and is recommended when measuring large residual stress gradients in the depth directions. Using the Schajer method solved by in-house Matlab-routines good agreement between measured residual stress gradients and residual stress gradients from FE analyses was found. Full scale fatigue tests were performed on pipes cut used drillstrings with notches of similar geometry as threads used in drillstring connections. The simulated threads consisted of four full depth helix notches with runouts at the surface. The pipe threads were cold rolled and fatigue tested in a full-scale four-point rotating bending fatigue testing rig. The test results showed that cold rolling had an effect on the crack initiating period. A major part of the fatigue life was with cracks observed at the notch root, but due to the increased fatigue crack propagation resistance the final fracture initiated at pits inside the pipe. Therefor, an optimisation of the roll geometry and rolling parameters was not possible. However, a significant fatigue life improvement was achieved. Based on experiments, a roller with similar profile as the thread root is recommended. A rolling force of maximum 20 KN is recommended to minimise the possibility of damaging the thread profile. Shallow cracks were observed typically when 5 % of the fatigue life had expired. Re-rolling after 50 % of expected improved fatigue life, when also short cracks were observed in the notch roots further increased the fatigue improvements. Pretensioned small steel specimens with a notch were used to simulate cold rolled threats. The specimens were fatigue tested in tension with minimum load close to zero. Pretensioning increased the fatigue life form approximately 50 000 cycles to an infinite number of cycles. In these test non-propagating cracks of typically 0. 4 mm length were found. The benefit from pretensioning gradually disappeared with increasing mean stress. FE analyses indicated that an almost instant relaxation of residual stresses to a level with no monotonic strain hardening from preloading would take place when cycled to moderate mean stress. Cycled at low mean stress, an instant relaxation of the surface layer was found in analysis. All observations from notched pretensioned fatigue specimens were in good agreement with the available literature. However, preloading was found to be strain rate dependent in tests where a pretension load held for 2 minutes gave a longer fatigue life than a sinusoidal loading-unloading cycle performed over a one minute interval. Strain hardening was found not contributing to the fatigue life improvement, whereas the polishing effect from improved surface quality after cold rolling increased the fatigue initiation period. However, residual stress and subsequent early crack closure was the dominating effect at moderate cyclic mean loads. The material data required to perform FE fatigue simulation studies of a full threaded cold rolled coupling incorporating make-up torque, include cyclic stress strain behaviour at various amplitudes and mean stress caused by various degrees of prestraining. Such data are not readily available today, and are only possible to obtain in carefully planned and executed experiments. Also, 3 D FE model required for cold rolling analysis is extremely CPU time consuming. Consequently, cold rolling simulations could not be successfully implemented in this work. One of the main conclusions from this work is that drillstring connections will respond differently to thread rolling at the pin or box. A significant improvement in the fatigue life of box threads from residual stresses is expected mainly from increased resistance to crack propagation. However, the compressive residual stress is sensitive to overloading in compression, and the improvement from residual stress depends strongly on the mean stress (or R-ratio). At values of R of approximately 0. 6 or higher the beneficial of rolling therefore tends to disappear. At the critical locations of the pin, which are the last engaged thread or the stress relief groove, the effect of residual stresses introduced by rolling is therefore likely to be severely reduced by the high mean stress imposed during make-up of the connection. However, a beneficial effect of rolling is expected to remain due to improved surface condition and due to a possible effect of strain hardening. The net results of these factors on the fatigue performance of actual drillstrings can only be determined in full scale rotating bending tests. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
