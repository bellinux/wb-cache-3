40|$|High-rise <b>residential</b> <b>building</b> {{is a type}} {{of housing}} that has multi-dwelling units built on the same land. This type of housing has become popular each year in urban area due to the {{increasing}} cost of land.

5|$|Immediately {{following}} Nur ad-Din's {{death in}} 1174, Damascus {{was seized by}} Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt. In that year, Saladin rode from Egypt past the Crusader states to Damascus with only 700 horsemen.

Saladin added a tower to the citadel and refurbished the <b>residential</b> <b>buildings.</b> Like his predecessor Nur ad-Din, Saladin died of an illness in the citadel on 4 March 1193.

Other reasons were the pure value of the land which the airport occupies, {{and the fact that the}} airport is dividing the city of Eilat into two parts with the hotels and tourist areas on one side, and the <b>residential</b> <b>buildings</b> on the other.|$|E
