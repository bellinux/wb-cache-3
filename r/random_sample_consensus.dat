50|$|<b>Random</b> <b>sample</b> <b>consensus</b> (RANSAC) is an {{iterative}} method to estimate parameters of {{a mathematical model}} from a set of observed data that contains outliers, when outliers are to be accorded no influence on {{the values of the}} estimates. Therefore, it also can be interpreted as an outlier detection method. It is a non-deterministic algorithm {{in the sense that it}} produces a reasonable result only with a certain probability, with this probability increasing as more iterations are allowed. The algorithm was first published by Fischler and Bolles at SRI International in 1981. They used RANSAC to solve the Location Determination Problem (LDP), where the goal is to determine the points in the space that project onto an image into a set of landmarks with known locations.|$|E
50|$|Further motion {{detection}} algorithms {{can also}} be classified depending upon the number ofviews: two and multi view-based approaches namely.The two-view based approaches are usually based on epipolar geometry. Consider two perspective camera views of a rigid body and find its feature correspondences. These correspondences are seen to satisfy either an epipolar constraint for a general rigid-body or ahomography constraint for a planar object. Planar motion in a sequence is the motion ofthe background, facade or the ground. Thus it is a degenerate case of rigid body motiontogether with general rigid body objects e.g. cars. Hence in a sequence we expect to seemore than one type of motion, described by multiple epipolar constraints and homographies.The view based algorithms are sensitive to outliers but recent approaches deal with outliersby using <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> <b>consensus</b> (RANSAC) and enhanced Dirichlet process mixture models. Other approaches use global dimension minimization to reveal the clusterscorresponding to the underlying subspace. These approaches use only two frames for motionsegmentation even if multiple frames are available as they cannot use multi frame information.Multiview-based approaches utilize the trajectory of feature points unlike two-view basedapproaches. A number of approaches have been provided which include Principle Angles Configuration (PAC) and Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) methods. Thesework well {{in two or three}} motion cases. These algorithms are also robust to noise with atradeoff with speed, i.e. they are less sensitive to noise but slow in computation. Otheralgorithms with a multi-view approach are spectral curvature clustering (SCC), latentlow-rank representation-based method (LatLRR) and ICLM-based approaches. Thesealgorithms are faster and more accurate than the two-view based but require greater numberof frames to maintain the accuracy.|$|E
