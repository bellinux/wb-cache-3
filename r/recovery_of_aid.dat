40|$|This case {{arose from}} a {{decision}} of the Italian authorities to extend an existing regional aid scheme – a social security concession for the south of Italy - to the cities of Chioggia and Venice in the north, which fell outside the designated regional aid areas approved {{on the basis of}} Article 107 (3) (a). This measure was not notified to the Commission in advance and, following an investigative procedure, the Commission reached a decision requiring the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> except insofar as it had been paid either to SMEs, to firms located in designated assisted areas, concerned the employment of ‘hard-to-place’ employees or to specified municipal companies. The recovery decision was contested before the General Court. The Commission claimed that the applicants lacked standing, but this was rejected by the Court which found that belonging to a closed class of actual beneficiaries of an aid scheme affected by the obligation to repay aid was sufficient to differentiate them from all other persons. On substance, the applicants argued, inter alia, that the measures were compensation for additional costs arising from their location in the Venice lagoon (not State aid), that the Commission had failed to account of the situation of undertakings other than selected municipal companies, and that the Commission had infringed Article 107 (3) (c) in relation to regional aid. The substantive claims were rejected by the General Court. The applicants also challenged the legality of the recovery order, arguing that the measure was a mere extension in time and territory of a measure dating back to the 1970 s. This was not accepted by the General Court which accordingly dismissed the actions. The applicants appealed the General Court’s judgment before the Court of Justice. For its part, the Commission, by cross appeal, sought the annulment of the General Court’s judgment insofar as it declared the applicants’ actions admissible. The Court of Justice upheld the General Court’s ruling on the standing of the applicants, though it found that the General Court had erred in law in finding that it was not for the national authorities to verify in each individual case whether the conditions for the existence of aid were met. The Court of Justice dismissed the main appeals of the applicants against the judgment of the General Court and confirmed the order for the recovery of the unlawful aid...|$|E
40|$|In 2005 the European Commission {{conducted}} an extensive review <b>of</b> the State <b>Aid</b> regulations as part <b>of</b> its State <b>Aid</b> Action Plan. The review also affects fiscal State Aid. In this paper, the author addresses two issues {{that should have}} been included in that review. First, the author reflects on the Commission's approach to regional tax autonomy as reflected in its Gibraltar decision. The main issue here is how to determine the borderline between fiscal autonomy and state <b>aid</b> control <b>of</b> regional tax regimes. Second, the author addresses the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> fiscal state <b>aid.</b> Under EU rules, tax incentives granted in violation <b>of</b> EU state <b>aid</b> provisions should normally be recovered from taxpayers except for special circumstances. Both the issue of fiscal autonomy and <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> have first been addressed by the author in his PhD Thesis 'Assessment and <b>Recovery</b> <b>of</b> Tax Incentives in the EC and the WTO: a View on State Aids, Trade Subsidies and Direct Taxation' (Intersentia Publishers, 2003).

40|$|Taxation as State <b>Aid</b> The purpose <b>of</b> {{my thesis}} is to analyse {{taxation}} {{in connection with}} state aid. The reason for my research {{is to find out}} how Member States of European Union can use taxation without interfering with state aid provisions. The thesis is composed of three chapters. Chapter One is an introduction to the topic. There is a description <b>of</b> basic state <b>aid</b> provisions, taxation within European Union and the tax competition between Member States. Chapter Two examines article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of taxation. The chapter consists of nine parts. Five ones further discuss constituent elements <b>of</b> state <b>aid,</b> where the main attention is given to selectivity as the main problem in state aid cases. Another four parts focus on procedure, judicial review, <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> and de minimis regulation. This chapter is the key part of the thesis because it pursues better understanding <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> definition with respect to taxation. Chapter Three concentrates on problems resulting from the intersection <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> and taxation such as the influence on double taxation treaties, discretionary powers of Member State's authorities, different taxation of autonomous regions, and so on.

40|$|Tax rulings are binding {{decisions}} that taxpayers may seek from tax authorities to determine in advance how certain transactions {{will be treated}} fiscally. However, tax rulings can have an "alternative use": that of granting a particularly advantageous fiscal treatment to specic taxpayers, typically large multinational groups willing to invest and create jobs in the tax jurisdiction concerned, without extending it to other taxpayers and without triggering a tax war with other jurisdictions. This article focuses on the European Commission's enforcement <b>of</b> State <b>aids</b> rules against certain EU Member States in respect of tax rulings issued {{to a number of}} multinational companies. After a brief account of the economic rationale for tax rulings and their potential relevance in the context of EU tax competition, the article provides an overview of the Commission's individual and general measures regarding tax rulings and their alleged use by Member States as confidential incentive measures designed to attract multinational investors in return for signicant fiscal advantages. The central part of the article provides an analytical assessment of the Commission's on-going and closed proceedings on tax ruling practices, having regard to the four constituent elements of the notion <b>of</b> State <b>aid.</b> Regard is then had to the peculiar challenges involved with the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> State <b>aids</b> granted in the form of tax rulings and, finally, to the systemic implications of the Commission's initiatives for the division of competences between the EU and its Member States and {{for the establishment of a}} fiscal union...|$|R

40|$|Certain tax jurisdictions enable {{taxpayers to}} request binding decisions, known as "tax rulings", {{as to how}} tax provisions, notably those on {{transfer}} pricing, will be applied to a particular case. However, according to the European Commission, several EU Member States have employed tax rulings to grant preferential fiscal treatments to select multinational groups, such as Amazon, Apple, FIAT, and Starbucks. Following {{an account of the}} rationale of tax rulings and of their "alternative use" as means of unfair tax competition, this article provides an analysis of those measures {{on the basis of the}} constituent elements of the notion <b>of</b> State <b>aid</b> (advantage, selectivity, imputability to the State, use of State resources, effects on trade, and distortion of competition). Regard is then had to the unique challenges posed by the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the alleged <b>aids</b> granted via the contested tax rulings as well as to the strategies proposed to stop the "alternative use" of this instrument by Member States.

40|$|The study {{examines}} the remedy of interim protection in EU law, in sectors where {{the interest of}} effectiveness of EU law are at stake.

It explores the outcomes of the two patterns in recent european case-law. Finally, it concludes that the principle of effective (and “neutral”) judicial protection mainly leaded the Court in the shaping of the European standard of interim judicial protection. In some crucial sectors of EU substantive law (such as the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> illegal State <b>aids</b> before the national judge), hovewer, the effectiveness of judicial protection is balanced against the overriding EU interest (in the recovery) : the outcomes of the case-law prove that the interim protection is eventually weakened (and {{the consistency of the}} remedy likewise) ...|$|R

30|$|The group most {{consistently}} {{affected negatively}} by its ethnicity was the African-Americans. Significant negative {{differences were found}} in the aid received between African-Americans and both Anglos and Hispanics, even after controlling for demographic and damage differences. Indeed, these findings reaffirm the ethnic segregation evident in the local power structures that disseminated aid, and an attitude which was often expressed to researchers showing a resentment or negative judgment toward the dissemination <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>aid</b> to those who were perceived as not “deserving” it, or simply using this event as another opportunity to benefit at the taxpayers’ expense. Media depictions of African-Americans as lazy and leeches to “white America” only serve to reaffirm and ingrain this, often, unconscious and virulent form of segregation (Horton et al. 1999). On occasion, references were made about specific individuals, qualifying the person as “one of the good ones”.

40|$|This {{research}} adds greater {{dimensions to}} the understanding of the recovery-aid acquisition process for households in rural communities with a racially heterogeneous and contentious population. The study population is divided into three categories based on ethnicity: Anglo, African-American, and Hispanic. The disaster-recovery process assessed if variations exist the disaster-aid acquisition process of households which correlate with ethnicity. During the investigation, researchers examined if the sources of disaster-aid a household was able to acquire was influenced by ethnicity. Relationships along ethnic lines were also examined in the types <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> acquired by the various groups. These measurements were undertaken to see if different paths to housing recovery resulted in differential rates <b>of</b> <b>recovery.</b> The societal context in which these processes took place has also been considered to establish if it affected the speed and efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>recovery</b> process. This research has helped identify some common problems faced in the disaster-recovery process by resource strapped communities, which also lack the ability to effectively engage vertical and horizontal ties to promote speedy and equitable recovery after a major natural disaster. Results indicate that ethnicity plays a significant role in the disaster-aid acquisition process, but one that varies from expectations developed through a review of previous literature on this subject. These finding may be an indication that the ethnic variations examined in this casestudy are an artifact of social-status and social-integration more so than because of any cultural construct of a particular ethnic group. The overreaching implications of this study show, however, that ethnicity is an important variable in determining the process and availability of major sources <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>aid</b> in the housing recovery process, particularly in a rural community...|$|R

40|$|The {{member states}} of the European Union grant {{subsidies}} for various reasons. The purpose <b>of</b> such State <b>aid</b> can be economic and social {{as well as political}} and strategic. It can correct market failures by, for example, supporting research and development as well as investment in environmental technology. At the same time however, EC law has indeed a strict view on the granting of subsidies, since it may affect the competition through out the union in a negative way and thus distort the common market. Member states are therefore obliged to notify the Commission and await its examination <b>of</b> the proposed <b>aid</b> measure before putting it into action. And before approving a measure, the Commission thoroughly examines its compatibility with the Common market. However, while the tasks <b>of</b> examining State <b>aid</b> measures and deciding whether they are to be approved or not, or recovered or not, are placed upon the Commission, the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> unlawful and illegal State aids is to be carried out by the national courts, in accordance with national procedures. And as a consequence to the frequent slowness and sometimes lack of such procedures, the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> illegal State <b>aids</b> and the enforcement <b>of</b> State <b>aid</b> rules, have repeatedly been on the Commission’s agenda. In addition, changes have been made within the procedure of the Commission’s examination <b>of</b> potential State <b>aid</b> measures, where additional exemptions to the obligation to notify under Article 88 (3) EC Treaty have been approved. By this, the examination in these exempted areas has been replaced by conditions in secondary EC law and the Commission’s soft law. And as a consequence, the position of the beneficiary seems to have been weakened. The purpose of this thesis is, in general, to provide a picture of the situation of the beneficiaries during the examination and recovery procedure under EC law, and in particular, to examine on what grounds a recipient undertaking of unlawful or illegal State aid, believed to be lawful and legal, can be protected from recovery by the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations. It provides, in other words, an examination and analysis of the different sources that may create legitimate expectations. And since such expectations merely can be entertained when contrary to a general principle of community law or when exceptional circumstances prevail, this thesis also provides a picture of in which context such claims can be successfully invoked. Last but not least, the above mentioned changes <b>of</b> the State <b>aid</b> field possess indeed a potential of affecting the position of the beneficiary and thus the notion of legitimate expectations. Therefore, this report also examines in what way and to what extent that may be the case...|$|R

Broad conclusions were threefold – firstly, such communities have strong local networks and high levels of social capital which come to the fore in times of crisis; secondly, that business recovery is dependent on infrastructural re-establishment; and thirdly, that the priorities and types <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> vary over time...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} short- and medium-run {{economic}} returns to capi-tal and inherent ability {{by studying the}} <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> fishermen in Aceh, Indonesia, from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Since the natural disaster wiped out a sig-nificant portion of productive physical capital among fishermen, the subsequent quasi-random infusion <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> boats generates a natural experiment. Using panel data from fishing households, I first examine whether boat aid increases overall productivity. Second, I investigate whether fishermen who were relatively more productive pre-tsunami retain their productive edge ex-post. Focusing on the sample of fishermen who lost their pre-tsunami boats, I find that the impact <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> boat length on fishing revenue is positive but diminishes over time. In contrast, I find {{that the impact of}} pre-tsunami productivity on fishing revenue increases.

30|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} survey {{findings}} regarding disaster recovery processes among {{ethnic groups in}} a rural Texas community. The research was conducted over a 4 -year period {{with most of the}} survey data collected over the summer of 2004. The research was descriptive in nature, attempting to document processes and sources <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>aid</b> acquisition following a natural disaster, and viewed through the lens of cultural and ethnic literature regarding minorities and disaster recovery processes. The difficulty in explaining research findings {{comes from the fact that}} data was collected at the household level, yet the explanations which best elucidate the findings are derived from a different level of analysis than that of the survey. The variation in aid acquisition between ethnic groups is best understood as a manifestation of community cultural norms, which implies both individual, cognitive norms, as well as social norms. Ethnic literature focused on minorities in disaster situations, excerpts from qualitative data, and personal observations are used to support the interpretation of the data presented herein pointing to cultural flexibility in recovery processes, which are stifled by institutional barriers hampering recovery efficiencies.|$|R

This was not an ideal analysis since there was no way to capture many of the economic externalities that are essential to the recovery process. But, it does give one a sense of the importance of the various sources <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> For example, if family provided assistance with all types <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> listed (i.e., rent, replacing belongs, building materials, and labor or services), then family could be assumed to be an invaluable source of help because of the breadth of services provided, even if the depth of that service could not be measured.
