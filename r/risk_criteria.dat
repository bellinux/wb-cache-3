40|$|By {{adjusting}} the maintenance approach towards the significant components of ship’s engines and equipment, {{through the use}} of operational data from the ship machinery’s daily reports, higher operability and navigation safety can be achieved. The proposed maintenance adjustment model consists of an operation data analysis and risk analysis. The risk analysis comprises the definition of the upper and the lower <b>risk</b> <b>criterion,</b> as well as the definition of a risk index. If the risk index is higher than the lower <b>risk</b> <b>criterion,</b> the component is significant, while it is not significant and has an acceptable risk index if the risk index is lower than the lower <b>risk</b> <b>criterion.</b> For each significant component with a risk index found to be “unacceptable” or “undesirable”, an efficient maintenance policy needs to be adopted. The assessment of the proposed model is based on data regarding the power engine original operation throughout a 13 -year period. The results of engine failure examinations reveal that the exhaust valve is the most vulnerable component with the highest rate of failure. For this reason the proposed model of {{adjusting the}} maintenance approach has been tested on the exhaust valve sample. It is suggested that the efforts to achieve higher ship operability and navigation safety should go in the direction of periodical adjustments of the maintenance approach i. e. choosing an efficient maintenance policy by reducing the risk indices of the significant engine components.

40|$|The {{development}} of a means to quantify risk, the determination of a <b>risk</b> <b>criterion,</b> {{and the establishment of}} a method to compare risks are three essential components in a probabilistic safety assessment. In this paper, the quantitative definition of risk given by Kaplan and Garrick is converted from a table to a graph to accommodate Farmer`s method of constructing a <b>risk</b> <b>criterion.</b> Farmer`s criterion is limited to a straight line, but its slope is made a free parameter. The high-frequency small-consequence problem noted by Farmer is solved by using an auxiliary vertical line to exclude scenarios with insignificant consequences. To compare risks associated with various accident scenarios, an index of risk relative to the straight-line <b>risk</b> <b>criterion</b> is proposed and developed. The results allow various accident scenarios to be ranked according to their weighted risks and, in turn, provide a measure of the effectiveness of mitigation...|$|R

50|$|WIC {{was created}} by an {{amendment}} to section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 on September 26, 1972. The legislation (P.L. 92-433, sponsored by Senator Hubert Humphrey (D) of Minnesota) established the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) as a two-year pilot program. Eligibility was limited to children up to age 4 and excluded non-breastfeeding postpartum women. By the end of 1974, WIC was operating in 45 states. On October 7, 1975, WIC was established as a permanent program (P.L. 94-105). Eligibility was extended to non-breastfeeding women (up to 6 months postpartum) and children up to 5 years of age. However, all participants must be deemed to be at nutrition risk and with inadequate income (however, what constituted inadequate income was not defined). In 1978, P.L. 95-627 defined nutrition risk and established income eligibility standards that were linked to the income standards associated with reduced price school meals. Another income standard change took place in 1989, when P.L. 101-147 established similar income eligibility for Food Stamp, Medicaid, and AFDC participation, thus lowering the WIC income standard and simplifying the application process. WIC began to promote and support breastfeeding women in the late 1980s, and in 1989 Congress mandated $8 million be used specifically for that purpose. Also in 1999, the WIC program standardized nutrition <b>risk</b> <b>criteria</b> for program eligibility and began assigning individual nutrition risk priority levels.|$|E
