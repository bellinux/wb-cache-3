25|$|The FAO Goodwill Ambassadors Programme was {{initiated}} in 1999. The {{main purpose of}} the programme is to attract public and media attention to the unacceptable situation that some 1 billion people continue to suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition {{in a time of}} unprecedented plenty. These people lead a life of misery and are denied the most basic of human rights: the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} 2011–2013, an {{estimated}} 842 {{million people were}} suffering from chronic hunger. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, or FAO, identified the four pillars of food security as availability, access, utilization, and stability. The United Nations (UN) recognized the <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Food</b> in the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and has since noted that it is vital for the enjoyment of all other rights.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{inequality}} both {{leads to}} {{and is a}} result of food insecurity. According to estimates women and girls make up 60% of the world's chronically hungry and little {{progress has been made in}} ensuring the equal <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>food</b> for women enshrined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Women face discrimination both in education and employment opportunities and within the household, where their bargaining power is lower. On the other hand, gender equality is described as instrumental to ending malnutrition and hunger. Women tend to be responsible for food preparation and childcare within the family and are more likely to spend their income on food and their children's needs. Women also play an important role in food production, processing, distribution and marketing. They often work as unpaid family workers, are involved in subsistence farming and represent about 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries, varying from 20% in Latin America to 50% in Eastern and Southeastern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, women face discrimination in access to land, credit, technologies, finance and other services. Empirical studies suggest that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, women could boost their yields by 20–30%; raising the overall agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5 to 4%. While those are rough estimates, the significant benefit of closing the gender gap on agricultural productivity cannot be denied. The gendered aspects of food security are visible along the four pillars of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{explores the}} effects of {{international}} and European business law on {{the realization of the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adequate <b>food,</b> which includes the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> freely and consciously choose a diet which is not only nutritious and healthy, but also respects consumers’ civic expectations about social, cultural and ethical qualities of specific foods. It appears that current international and european trade law is hardly compatible with a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> know in order to make better choices, which undermines the realization of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adequate <b>food...</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{right to}} {{adequate}} food, {{also referred to}} as the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>food,</b> is interpreted as requiring [...] "the availability of food in a quantity and quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, free from adverse substances, and acceptable within a given culture". This must be accessible to all, implying an obligation to provide special programmes for the vulnerable. This must also ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to need, taking into account the problems of food-importing and food-exporting countries. The right to adequate food also implies a right to water.|$|E

It also consulted on a limited range of high-level options for addressing ILUC to which 17 countries and 59 organizations responded. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Food</b> and several environmental organizations complained that the 2008 safeguards were inadequate.

2500|$|The UN Millennium Development Goals {{are one of}} the {{initiatives}} aimed at achieving food security in the world. The first Millennium Development Goal states that the UN [...] "is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty" [...] by 2015. Olivier De Schutter, the UN Special Rapporteur on the <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Food,</b> advocates for a multidimensional approach to food security challenges. This approach emphasizes the physical availability of food; the social, economic and physical access people have to food; and the nutrition, safety and cultural appropriateness or adequacy of food.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{international}} community's concerns regarding the steep increase in food prices, on April 14, 2008, Jean Ziegler, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Food,</b> at the Thirtieth Regional Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Brasília, called biofuels a [...] "crime against humanity", a claim he had previously made in October 2007, when he called for a 5-year ban for the conversion of land for the production of biofuels. [...] The previous day, at their Annual International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group meeting at Washington, D.C., the World Bank's President, Robert Zoellick, stated that [...] "While many worry about filling their gas tanks, many others around the world are struggling to fill their stomachs.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It first {{appeared}} from Global Health Governance via [URL] Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH) represents a significant opportunity <b>to</b> realize the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> health globally. However, in order to succeed the FCGH must be carefully considered: it must take a new evidence-based approach that departs meaningfully from past shortcomings in realizing the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> health. Central to this approach is recognizing, formally incorporating, and operationalizing the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adequate <b>food.</b> This <b>right</b> should be correctly interpreted as a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a standard of nutritional quality and not as a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a minimum number of calories. Because nutrition is critical to the achievement and maintenance of good health, particularly for the most deprived populations, this right is an indispensable substantive condition of achieving the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> health. In addition to helping the FCGH to be effective, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adequate <b>food</b> will help it achieve comprehensiveness, legitimacy, and efficiency. There are several ways the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adequate <b>food</b> can be operationalized in tandem with the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> health, including through formal enshrinement in health and other policies, and through the enactment of several types of measures to improve dietary behaviors and health outcomes. Incorporating a broadly conceived <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adequate <b>food</b> into the FCGH acknowledges and formally takes steps to address nutrition’s critical role in realizing the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> health, particularly for the most deprived populations. It will strengthen the FCGH and improve its chances of success...|$|R

2500|$|The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) {{recognizes that}} {{conflicts}} may {{exist between the}} respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights. In 2001 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued a document called [...] "Human rights and intellectual property" [...] that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human well-being, intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws. According to the Committee, when systems fail to do so they risk infringing upon the human <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>food</b> and health, and to cultural participation and scientific benefits. In 2004 the General Assembly of WIPO adopted The Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization which argues that WIPO should [...] "focus more {{on the needs of}} developing countries, and to view IP as one of many tools for development—not as an end in itself".|$|E

2500|$|According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, {{there are}} five stages of school feeding. The first stage {{includes}} school feeding programs that rely mostly on external funding and implementation, while the last stage includes school feeding programs that rely mostly on internal government funding and implementation. Countries that are within the first stage include Afghanistan and Sudan, where country governments are unable to lead school feeding programs. Countries that are within the fifth stage include Chile and India, which have functional, country-led school feeding programs. For example, the Government of Chile has provided a school feeding program for over 40 years through the La Junta Nacional de Auxilio Escolar y Becas (National Board of School Assistance and Scholarships) through a public-private partnership. This program involves technology that allows food to be centrally mass-produced and then distributed across the country. [...] Additionally, the Government of India has supported school feeding programs since 2001, when the country recognized Indians' Constitutional <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Food.</b> Countries {{that are in the}} middle of the stages, such as Kenya and Ecuador may have some but not all of the governmental policies, financial capacities, or institutional capacities to operate school feeding programs without external funding or implementation.|$|E
40|$|This book {{introduces}} the human <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adequate <b>food</b> and nutrition as evolving concept and identifies two structural "disconnects" fueling food insecurity for a billion people, and disproportionally affecting women, children, and rural food producers: {{the separation of}} women’s rights from their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adequate <b>food</b> and nutrition, and the fragmented attention <b>to</b> <b>food</b> as commodity and the medicalization of nutritional health. Three conditions arising from these disconnects are discussed: structural violence and discrimination frustrating the realization of women’s human rights, {{as well as their}} private and public contributions <b>to</b> <b>food</b> and nutrition security for all; many women’s experience of their and their children’s simultaneously independent and intertwined subjectivities during pregnancy and breastfeeding being poorly understood in human rights law and abused by poorly-regulated food and nutrition industry marketing practices; and the neoliberal economic system’s interference both with the autonomy and self-determination of women and their communities and with the strengthening of sustainable diets based on democratically governed local food systems.
