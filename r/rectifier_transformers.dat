The end of life of a transformer is linked to the rate of degradation of the winding paper insulation which is mainly due to heating processes. <b>Rectifier</b> <b>transformers</b> are subject to high thermal stress due to harmonic currents flowing through them. The need of monitoring and regulation of the hotspot temperature on the rectifier transformer winding is of great importance to keep the temperatures within safe limits as to preserve its life span.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Raylı sistemlerde cer gücü tedarik sisteminin birincil fonksiyonu trenlere hareketi için gerekli olan elektrik gücünü mümkün olan en verimli ve en ekonomik şekilde iletmektedir. Bu fonksiyonu sebebiyle cer gücü tedarik sistemleri kesintisiz ve kaliteli bir metro taşımacılığı için hayati öneme sahiptir.   Genel olarak cer gücü tedarik sistemi 3 temel sistemden oluşmaktadır. DC veya AC ihtiyaç duyulan hat geriliminin elde edildiği trafo merkezleri, elde edilen bu hat geriliminin akım toplayıcı sistemler tarafından trenlere taşındığı akım toplama sistemleri ve son olarak elektrik enerjisini tren hareketine dönüştüren cer elektrik motorları ve sürücü devreleri. Tüm bu sistemlerin herbirinin altında daha birçok bileşenler de olması sebebiyle cer gücü tedarik sistemi oldukça kapsamlı ve önemlidir. DC cer gücü tedarik sisteminin karekteristiklerini bilgisayar destekli inceleyebilmek, çeşitli benzetim ve analizler yapabilmek için öncelikle sistemin modeli oluşturulmalıdır. Ancak bileşenlerin çokluğu ve karmaşıklığı sebebiyle bu işlem oldukça zordur.   Yapılan bu tezde 750 V DC hat gerilimi kullanılan bir metro sisteminin cer gücü tedarik sisteminin modellemesi MATLAB ® Simulink ortamında Güç Sistemleri Blok Seti (Power System Blockset, PSB) kullanılarak yapılmıştır. Oldukça kapsamlı olarak yapılan bu modellemede Enerji İletim Şirketinin 154 kV iletim hatlarından alınan enerji, öncelikle indirici trafo merkezlerinde indirilerek istasyonlar arasında 34, 5 kV orta gerilim ring sistemi oluşturulmuştur. 34, 5 kV gerilim seviyesi trenleri beslemek için ihtiyaç duyulan 750 V DC üçüncü ray gerilimine redresör trafosu ve doğrultucu üniteleri vasıtasıyla dönüştürülmüştür. Daha sonra eşdeğer direnç olarak modellenmiş olan üçüncü ray iletkeni üzerinden trenüstü kolektör pabucu vasıtasıyla trende bulunan toplam 12 adet 3 fazlı sincap kafesli asenkron cer motoruna enerjilendirilmektedir. Toplam 4 araçtan oluşan tren setinin yalnızca 3 aracı motorlu olup her bir araçta 2 boji ve 4 cer motoru olduğundan toplam 12 adet asenkron cer motoru bulunmaktadır. Modelde cer motorları PWM sinyali tarafından kontrol edilen 3 fazlı IGBT invertörü tarafından sürülmektedir. Tüm bu bahsedilen ana gruplar ve alt bileşenlerin her biri ayrı ayrı MATLAB ® Simulink altında modellenmiş ve bu alt birimler ile gruplar bloklar halinde işletme şekline göre birbiri ile irtibatlanmıştır. Çalışma için örnek olarak toplam iki adet 4 ’lü tren setinin aynı bölgeden kalkış yaptığı durum incelenmiştir. Fakat istenildiği takdirde tren sayısı ve istasyon sayısı rahatlıkla artırılabilir ve bloklar içindeki veriler rahatlıkla değiştirilebilir. İstasyonlar arası mesafe üçüncü ray eşdeğer direnç değeri değiştirilerek rahatlıkla ayarlanabilirken trenler birbiriyle eş olması sebebiyle bir tren bloğu kopyalanarak hatda bulunan toplam tren sayısı da rahatlıkla artırabilir. Böylece tüm hattın modellemesini ve benzetimi yapmak mümkün olacaktır.   Oluşturulan bu model genişletilebilir ve geliştirilebilir olup farklı işletme koşullarının kapsamlı incelemesini gerçekleştirmeye uygundur. Bu incelemede tren kalkış anı karekteristikleri ile birlikte trenlerin çektiği büyük reaktif akımlardan dolayı oluşan harmoniklerin incelemesi yapılmıştır. Tren kalkış anı akım karekteristiklerinin kısa devre hata akımlarına olan benzerliği incelenmiştir. The primary {{function}} of railway traction {{power supply system}} is to provide necessary electrical power to operate the trains in the most efficient and the most cost-effective manner. This is especially important in today urban transportation where passengers cannot even accept minutes of delays. Reliability and availability of traction power supply systems at all the time is the key. Since, traction power supply system is vital for an efficient and reliable railway transport, {{it is important to}} study on modelling and simulation of this system which will enable to study and analyze different operating conditions including short circuit faults and energy quality issues.   A typical traction power supply system has three main subsystems which are power supply system, current collection system and traction drives and motors. The train draws electrical power from the distribution network via suitably spaced substations along the railway line. The electrical power from the substations is transferred to moving trains through a continuous conductor. In the case of overhead current collection system, the power is received from a contact wire that is suspended above track. Pantograph, which is an apparatus mounted {{on the roof of the}} car, is used to collect power through contact wire. In the case of third rail current collection, the power is received from a third rail laid along the side of the track by the help of trainborne collector shoes. In both cases return current usually flows through running rails when only one overhead contact wire or conductor rail is provided. The final part of traction power supply system consists of traction drives and electric motors. Either DC or AC traction motors are used to drive the trains. A 750 V DC traction power supply system, which is in use in Yenikapi-Taksim-Haciosman line of Istanbul Metro, is modelled using Matlab ® Simulink environment. 750 V DC line volatge and third rail current collection systems is used in this metro line. The model is very comprehensive since it consists of all three main systems of traction power supply system. In the developed model, first of all, necessary electrical traction power is received from national high voltage 154 kV network and then converted to 34, 5 kV medium voltage via power transformers. A medium voltage ring system is provided between all substations for the relaiblity of the supply power. This follows by further reducing the voltage by means of <b>rectifier</b> <b>transformers</b> and the reduced AC voltage is finally converted to 750 V DC by means of uncontrolled diode rectifer units. In the developed MATLAB model that is shown by step by step. The third rail current collection system is modelled as equivalent of resistance together with equivalent resistance between the third rail and trainborne collecter shoe. The metro train used in Yenikapi-Taksim-Haciosman metro line consists of 4 -car set. 3 of those 4 -car is motorized cars and each of motorized car consists of 4 traction motor. Thus, the metro train is modelled as total of 12 three-phase squirrel cage induction motor. Traction motor is fed by 3 -phase IGBT units which is controlled by PWM signal.   Only two 4 -car set trains are used in the simulation to study train starting current. It is assummed that two 4 -car train set start running at the same time and in the same zone. However, it is also possible to run the simulation with more trains and thanks to the Simulink environment, the parameters of all blocks can be changed easily. This enable to simulate different scenarios easily. For example, in case of using 8 -car train sets on the track, the two 4 -set car can be coupled easily and connected to any location between the substaions. In the developed model third rail current collection system is modelled as equivalent resistance of 1 km sections. This can be easily changed. A train set can be placed between two adjacent third rail blocks and in that way it will be possible to simulate complete track with desired numbers of trains on the desired location between the stations.   The developed DC metro model can be used in many different applications, however it is the primary objective of this project to use the model in order to study train starting current. It is very important to understand the distinction between train starting currents and the short circuit currents in railway systems since they have similar current magnitude and its rising rate. The phenomena of mis-operation and mal-operation cannot be avoided with the traditional protection. Because problems involved in providing protection to traction systems are very different from those faced in protecting other transmission and distribution lines. This is due to the continous movement of train load, which is in the range of a few MW, change in the lenght of the line during operation and high levels of harmonic currents.   Simulation results are given for both only one train set is running and two train set running at the same time. Third rail voltage, line current, 154 kV busbar voltage and currents, 154 kV busbar energy measurements, IGBT phase-to-phase voltage, tarction motor rotor and stator currents, traction motor voltage, traction motor speed-time graph and electromagnetic torque waveforms are all given in the results. Simulation results pointed out the diffuculty of discrimination remote short circuit current against train starting current. That is because the train starting current even for only one 4 -car train set is more than 4000 A. Train reach that current level in miliseconds. Results also shows that even using only two 4 -car train set 154 kV busbar voltage and current waveforms is not pure sinusoidal because of the excess harmonic currents driven by trains. In the simulation compensation system does not modelled in order to analyze harmonics at 154 kV busbar. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis was {{executed}} at the Department of Electrical Power Engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The thesis was initiated {{to establish and}} evaluate an alternative model representation of the facility at Ormen Lange. Traditionally, a PQ-model {{has been used to}} represent Ormen Lange. This thesis, however, has implemented three two-terminal dc line models (converter models) to represent the facility. The first part of the thesis starts with an overall introduction to the basic principles of configuration, operation and control of HVDC systems. The objective of this part is to provide an overview of the HVDC technology which is treated in detail later in the thesis. The software tool 9 ̆ 3 Power System Simulator for Engineering 9 ̆ 4 (PSS/E) was used for both power flow and dynamic simulations performed in this thesis. The second part of the thesis describes the power flow establishment, and constitutes the basis for both power flow and dynamic simulations. The main focus in this part is the modeling of the two-terminal dc line model which is implemented at Nyhamna. Data for the two-terminal dc line model is presented on three consecutive data records. Since these data enables not only power flow analysis but also establishes the initial steady-state for the dynamic analysis, a detailed description is presented in this section. The latter data is based on technical information provided by ABB and default values in PSS/E. The third part of the thesis presents the power flow simulations. The objective of this part is to gain knowledge about the performance of the two-terminal dc line model implemented at Ormen Lange. This knowledge facilitates the understanding of the following dynamic simulations. Two cases were studied to simulate the action of the converter control system when exposed to a depression in rectifier bus voltage. In the first case the <b>rectifier</b> <b>transformer</b> tap settings were adjustable. In the second case the rectifier tap settings were locked to its initial value. The purpose of locking the tap setting was to represent a transient situation where the tap changer action is too slow and hence not considered. The result showed that with adjustable rectifier tap settings, the depression in rectifier bus voltage is handled by reducing the <b>rectifier</b> <b>transformer</b> tap position and firing delay angle. This increased the voltage on the valve side of the <b>rectifier</b> <b>transformer</b> and enabled the rectifier to maintain dc current control. Consequently, the scheduled dc values were unaffected by the depression in rectifier bus voltage. However, with the rectifier tap setting locked, the transformer did not boost the voltage on the valve side of the <b>rectifier</b> <b>transformer.</b> This caused the control logic to reduce the rectifier firing delay angle to its minimum, and the inverter assumed control of the dc current. With the inverter in control of the current, the scheduled dc current was reduced by a fraction equal to the current margin along with the remainder dc values. Hence, the presence of an adequate <b>rectifier</b> <b>transformer</b> setting is essential for the two-terminal dc line model to maintain scheduled dc values during voltage depression. All simulations showed that a voltage depression at the rectifier bus leads to a reduction in rectifier reactive power consumption. This is due to the action from the control logic which reduced the rectifier firing delay angle to counteract the voltage depression. The greatest reduction in rectifier reactive consumption was experienced when the rectifier firing delay angle was reduced to its minimum value. Hence, in situations with depressed bus voltage, the latter operation of the converter control logic causes the two-terminal dc line model to exhibit less stress to the ac system than the PQ-model. The fourth part of this thesis contains {{a detailed description of the}} dynamic modeling of the two-terminal dc line model (CDC 4 T). Many of the chosen parameters are based on an example in [15], and do not necessary represent realistic values. The final part of this thesis presents the dynamic simulations. The objective of this part is to analyze the control actions of the CDC 4 T model under normal regulation and during temporary overriding the normal regulation. This was performed by introducing ac system faults which depressed the rectifier bus voltage to a varying degree. Further, this part analyzed the consequence of using the dynamic model CDC 4 T to represent Ormen Lange instead of a PQ-model. The purpose was to determine whether the response from the ac system differs when using the CDC 4 T model instead of a PQ-model. It is important to emphasize that this part does not evaluate stability issues associated with the implementation of CDC 4 T. The results from the dynamic simulations showed that CDC 4 T exhibited an instantaneous response to changes in rectifier ac voltage. This is because CDC 4 T is a pseudo steady-state dynamic model which omits the L/R dynamic of the dc system and high frequency firing angle controller dynamics. Further, the results revealed an important characteristic of the CDC 4 T model. After fault clearance, the rectifier bus exhibited small voltage fluctuations. The rectifiers compensated these fluctuations by adjusting their firing delay angles correspondingly. Consequently, the latter resulted in fluctuations in reactive power consumption. This means that the ac system perceives the CDC 4 T model as a varying reactive load following fault clearance. Comparing the ac system response when using the CDC 4 T model and when using the PQ-model, the results showed that the main difference was CDC 4 T 9 ̆ 2 s generation of reactive power fluctuations. These fluctuations were experienced in the transmission line going into Nyhamna and Viklandet, and were substantial compared to the initial loading of the transmission lines. Two arguments were used to substantiate why the response from the CDC 4 T model only differs from the PQ-model in terms of reactive power fluctuations: I. The calculated value of the short circuit ratio at Nyhamna indicated a strong interconnected ac/dc system. II. The dynamic behavior of the pseudo-steady state model, CDC 4 T, is limited. Both the L/R dynamic of the dc line, smoothing reactors and high frequency controller dynamics are omitted. In further studies where converter modeling at Ormen Lange is considered, a more complex dynamic dc model should be utilized to represent the converters. This model should include L/R dynamic of the dc system and high-speed controller dynamics, and will thus influence the ac system to a greater extent than CDC 4 T. Further, the model establishment should focus on achieving a sufficiently realistic load representation of Ormen Lange. In this manner, the converters 9 ̆ 2 influence on system stability can be evaluated...|$|R

This new inverter works with a controller to produce any kind of output waveform. The inverter is found to have four different modes of operation. The new inverter is modeled using state space averaging. The system is a fourth order system which is non-linear due to the inherent switching involved in the circuit. The system is linearized around an operating point to study the system as a linear system. The control to output transfer function of the inverter is found to be non-minimum phase. The transfer functions are studied using root locus. From the control perspective, the presence of right half zero makes the design of the controller structure complicated. The PV cell is modeled using the cell equations in MATLAB. A maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is implemented to make sure the output power of the PV cell is always maximum which allows full utilization of the power from the PV cell. The perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm is the simplest and is used here. The use of this new inverter eliminates the various stages involved in the conventional solar micro inverter. Simulation and experimental results carried out on the setup validate the proposed structure of inverter...|$|R

Subjects {{to be addressed in}} this topic include obtaining zero-voltage switching; selecting and driving synchronous <b>rectifier</b> MOSFETs; optimizing <b>transformer</b> design; and comparing equivalent forward and flyback solutions side by side, emphasizing the performance benefits of each topology that can be achieved as a trade-off against circuit complexity and cost.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} switched-capacitor (SC) -based {{step-down}} AC-DC power converter with high-frequency feed without <b>rectifier</b> or <b>transformer.</b> The operational {{principle of the}} circuits and the design considerations are described. The main advantage of the circuit is that step-down voltage can be achieved in the circuit by simply configuring with cascaded stages, which {{will be much more}} convenient to be modular development and easy for replacement and maintenance; the voltage and current stresses of most components are smaller than the conventional converter. Using buffer capacitor to reserve energy, there are no magnetic energy storage elements in the circuits. Weight and size can be further reduced due to high-frequency-power line operation. Zero current switching (ZCS) is achieved by introducing small resonant inductors. Therefore, higher efficiency and power density can be achieved. The performance of the converter has been demonstrated by an experiment with 50 kHz 50 V power feed which is emulated by a signal generator and high-frequency amplifier to prove the concept.

40|$|Traditional {{transformer}} in high-voltage {{power supplies}} has many disadvantages {{such as high}} turn’s ratio, large volume and great design difficulties. Parallel resonant converters (PRCs) are widely used in high-voltage power supplies. A kind of high-voltage circuit topology can be formed by combining PRCs and voltage-doubler rectifier, which is called parallel resonant dual voltage converters (PRDVCs). In PRDVCs both voltage-doubler <b>rectifier</b> and <b>transformer</b> can boost voltage, which reduced turn’s ratio and volume of the transformer, {{making it easier to}} produce. Thus it not only realizes the high-voltage output, but also realizes the miniaturization of high-voltage power supply. Three modes of the converters were researched and simulated. Converting conditions of three modes were given. At last, PRDVCs was used to design a 5000 V/ 50 mA high-voltage power supply. The waveforms and results of the experiment were given, which validated the feasibility of the converters and its conversion efficiency might be improved to 93 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Zero-current-transition, discontinuous-conduction-mode (ZCT-DCM) {{converters}} are intro-duced in this paper. Compared to hard-switching (PWM) converters in DCM, the ZCT-DCM con-verters {{have similar}} current stresses and conduction losses, and much reduced turn-off switching losses. At {{the expense of}} increased voltage stresses, zero-current/zero-voltage switching is maintained {{for a wide range}} of loads and voltage conversion ratios with-out the need for auxiliary active devices. In ac/dc applications, high power factor is obtained automat-ically, without the need for active control over the input current.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{an initial}} set of power conditioning models created to generate 'ballpark' power management and distribution (PMAD) component mass and size estimates. It contains converter, <b>rectifier,</b> inverter, <b>transformer,</b> remote bus isolator (RBI), and remote power controller (RPC) models. These models allow certain studies to be performed; however, additional models {{are required to}} assess {{a full range of}} PMAD alternatives. The intent is to eventually form a library of PMAD models that will allow system designers to evaluate various power system architectures and distribution techniques quickly and consistently. The models in this report are designed primarily for space exploration initiative (SEI) missions requiring continuous power and supporting manned operations. The mass estimates were developed by identifying the stages in a component and obtaining mass breakdowns for these stages from near term electronic hardware elements. Technology advances were then incorporated to generate hardware masses consistent with the 2000 to 2010 time period. The mass of a complete component is computed by algorithms that calculate the masses of the component stages, control and monitoring, enclosure, and thermal management subsystem...|$|R
