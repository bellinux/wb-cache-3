The records of all such procedures performed at the Department of Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Urology of the 'Sapienza' University (Rome), between January 2004 and December 2012, and of all those done at the 'San Filippo' Hospital (Rome), between January 2010 and December 2012, were analysed. Data gathered included women's age, obstetric history, <b>reasons</b> for <b>requesting</b> the STIA, gestational age, mode of intervention, and complications if any. During the study period, 353 women requested a STIA. Karyotype or genetic anomalies were the <b>reason</b> for the <b>request</b> in 187 cases (53 %), while structural anomalies, both single and multiple, were given as the reason in 158 (45 %).

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} the number of and <b>reasons</b> for <b>requests</b> of Euthanasia and physician assisted suicide (E/PAS) in Dutch General Practice after implementing the Euthanasia Act in 2002. Design: Retrospective dynamic cohort study during the period 1977 – 2007. Participants Standardized registration forms were used to collect data annually on E/PAS via the Dutch Sentinel Practice Network. This network of 45 general practices represents 0. 8 % of the Dutch population and is representative at a national level for age, sex, geographic distribution and population density. Results: Analysis of 1011 E/PAS requests (54 % male) showed an increasing trend until 1990. Thereafter a slight decrease, which stabilized after 2004 around 2. 2 per 10 000 (P < 0. 05). Malignancies were reported in 74. 8 % of these requests. The group younger than 60 years of age (23. 7 %) is overrepresented. Pain showed a declining trend over the years (P < 0. 001), but remained the most frequent <b>reason</b> for <b>requesting</b> E/PAS. Deterioration was a frequent <b>reason</b> for patients’ <b>requests</b> until around 1991; thereafter this reason decreased (P < 0. 01). Dyspnoea showed a decreasing frequency during the period 1977 – 2007 (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The incidence of requests for E/PAS in Dutch General Practice did not increase after implementing the Euthanasia Act. Pain has declined, but remained the most frequent <b>reason</b> in <b>requesting</b> E/PAS in Dutch General Practice throughout the study period. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
