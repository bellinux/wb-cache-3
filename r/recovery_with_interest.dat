40|$|In April of 2010 Serbia was {{rocked by}} the news that a dog whose paws had been cut off {{was found in the}} Medakovic {{neighborhood}} of Belgrade. Miraculously, the dog was still alive, but in bad condition. The news media named the dog Mila (which, aside from being a Serbian female name, can also mean “dear one” or “gentle one”) and the Serbian public followed the story of Mila’s plight and subsequent <b>recovery</b> <b>with</b> great <b>interest</b> and much comment, {{so much so that the}} event became a trigger for a moral panic of sorts. In this paper I have attempted to point out how the Serbian public, with reference to the case of Mila the dog, conceptualizes violence against animals, as well as to point out that folk classifications of living creatures - such as the one which distinguishes animals from meat (see Mullin 1999) - influence the understanding and conceptualization of violence as a phenomenon. Secondly, I have attempted to uncover which elements of the event in question caused a moral panic in Serbia, and which had inhibited the development of a serious public discussion of the issue of animal suffering. In that sense, the object of this paper is twofold - on the one hand it aims to point out why a discussion of the systematic and systemic violence against animals did not occur, and on the other, it serves to point out those elements of the event which caused the panic...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} European offshore gas-recycling in the North Sea to an exemplar onshore carbon capture-utilization-and-storage project (CCUS) in North America. Natural gas recycling has a long and successful history in the North Sea; while North America has pioneered the utilization of CO 2 for enhanced oil <b>recovery.</b> <b>With</b> renewed <b>interest</b> in CO 2 EOR {{as a means of}} stimulating carbon capture and storage (CCS), a simple comparison of these two gas injection cultures illuminates the potential of CCUS to change the velocity of, and cost- of-entry for, large CCS projects in Europe. The comparison of Weyburn, a large CO 2 EOR operation in Canada, with Åsgard, offshore Norway, a large natural gas recycling operation, is based on a comparative CO 2 price of 70 USD per tonne and conservative oil price for the last decade of 70 USD per barrel. A hypothetical offshore CO 2 EOR scenario is described to illustrate how the revenue-expenditure ratios are similar for offshore and onshore projects – around 5 : 1 for the additional oil produced from acquired CO 2. A nominal carbon tax of 35 USD per tonne increases this to 10 : 1, demonstrating the potential for CO 2 EOR to stimulate CCS. However, large upfront capital investments and a regional shortage of captured CO 2 are significant hurdles to offshore European CCUS. The comparison also suggests a CO 2 emissions-storage ratio of 2 : 1. While this is a low carbon footprint for oil, in order for these projects to have a zero carbon footprint, they would require a transition to significant associated storage. It follows that the role of CO 2 EOR in a European CCUS context is primarily to stimulate the role-out of capture and transport infrastructure, and to access to large offshore CO 2 storage hubs in the North Sea...|$|R
