40|$|SummaryThe time of <b>reward</b> and the {{temporal}} structure of <b>reward</b> occurrence fundamentally influence behavioral reinforcement and decision processes [1 – 11]. However, despite knowledge about timing in sensory and motor systems [12 – 17], we {{know little about}} temporal mechanisms of neuronal <b>reward</b> processing. In this experiment, visual stimuli predicted different instantaneous probabilities of <b>reward</b> occurrence that resulted in specific temporal <b>reward</b> structures. Licking behavior demonstrated that the animals had developed expectations for the time of <b>reward</b> that reflected the instantaneous <b>reward</b> probabilities. Neurons in the amygdala, {{a major component of}} the brain's <b>reward</b> system [18 – 29], showed two types of <b>reward</b> signal, both of which were sensitive to the expected time of <b>reward.</b> First, the time courses of anticipatory activity preceding <b>reward</b> delivery followed the specific instantaneous <b>reward</b> probabilities and thus paralleled {{the temporal}} <b>reward</b> structures. Second, the magnitudes of responses following <b>reward</b> delivery covaried with the instantaneous <b>reward</b> probabilities, reflecting the influence of temporal <b>reward</b> structures at the moment of <b>reward</b> delivery. In being sensitive to temporal <b>reward</b> structure, the <b>reward</b> signals of amygdala neurons reflected the temporally specific expectations of <b>reward.</b> The data demonstrate an active involvement of amygdala neurons in timing processes that are crucial for <b>reward</b> function...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, total <b>reward</b> {{stochastic}} {{games are}} surveyed. Total <b>reward</b> games are motivated as a refinement of average <b>reward</b> games. The total <b>reward</b> {{is defined as}} the limiting average of the partial sums of the stream of payoffs. It is shown that total <b>reward</b> games with finite state space are strategically equivalent to a class of average <b>reward</b> games with an infinite countable state space. The role of stationary strategies in total <b>reward</b> games is investigated in detail. Further, it is outlined that, for total <b>reward</b> games with average <b>reward</b> value 0 and where additionally both players possess average <b>reward</b> optimal station-ary strategies, it holds that the total <b>reward</b> value exists.

40|$|The {{representation}} of <b>reward</b> anticipation and <b>reward</b> prediction errors {{is the basis}} for reward-associated learning. The {{representation of}} whether or not a <b>reward</b> occurred (<b>reward</b> receipt) is important for decision making. Recent studies suggest that, while <b>reward</b> anticipation and <b>reward</b> prediction errors are encoded in the midbrain and the ventral striatum, <b>reward</b> receipts are encoded in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. In order to substantiate this functional specialization we analyzed data from an fMRI study in which 59 subjects completed two simple monetary <b>reward</b> paradigms. Because <b>reward</b> receipts and <b>reward</b> prediction errors were correlated, a statistical model comparison was applied separating the effects of the two. <b>Reward</b> prediction error fitted BOLD responses significantly better than <b>reward</b> receipt in the midbrain and the ventral striatum. Conversely, <b>reward</b> receipt fitted BOLD responses better in the orbitofrontal cortex. Activation related to <b>reward</b> anticipation was found in the orbitofrontal cortex. The results confirm a functional specialization of behaviorally important aspects of <b>reward</b> processing within the mesolimbic dopaminergic system...|$|R
40|$|Prediction about {{outcomes}} {{constitutes a}} basic mechanism underlying informed economic decision making. A stimulus constitutes a <b>reward</b> predictor when it provides {{more information about}} the <b>reward</b> than the environmental background. <b>Reward</b> prediction can be manipulated in two ways, by varying the <b>reward</b> paired with the stimulus, as done traditionally in neurophysiological studies, and by varying the background <b>reward</b> while holding stimulus-reward pairing constant. Neuronal mechanisms involved in <b>reward</b> prediction should also be sensitive to changes in background <b>reward</b> independently of stimulus-reward pairing. We tested this assumption on a major brain structure involved in <b>reward</b> processing, the central and basolateral amygdala. In a 2 × 2 design, we examined the influence of <b>rewarded</b> and unrewarded backgrounds on neuronal responses to <b>rewarded</b> and unrewarded visual stimuli. Indeed, responses to the unchanged <b>rewarded</b> stimulus depended crucially on background <b>reward</b> in a population of amygdala neurons. Elevating background <b>reward</b> {{to the level of the}} <b>rewarded</b> stimulus extinguished these responses, and lowering background <b>reward</b> again reinstated the responses without changes in stimulus-reward pairing. None of these neurons responded specifically to an inhibitory stimulus predicting less <b>reward</b> compared with background (negative contingency). A smaller group of amygdala neurons maintained stimulus responses irrespective of background <b>reward,</b> possibly reflecting stimulus-reward pairing or visual sensory processes without <b>reward</b> prediction. Thus in being sensitive to background <b>reward,</b> the responses of a population of amygdala neurons to phasic stimuli appeared to follow the full criteria for excitatory <b>reward</b> prediction (positive contingency) rather than reflecting simple stimulus-reward pairing (contiguity) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to evaluate <b>reward</b> processing in unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD). Specifically, we investigated whether adults with MDD demonstrated hyporesponsivity in striatal brain regions and/or hyperresponsivity in cortical brain regions involved in conflict monitoring using a Wheel of Fortune task designed to probe responses during <b>reward</b> selection, <b>reward</b> anticipation, and <b>reward</b> feedback. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data indicated that the MDD group was characterized by reduced activation of striatal <b>reward</b> regions during <b>reward</b> selection, <b>reward</b> anticipation, and <b>reward</b> feedback, supporting previous data indicating hyporesponsivity of <b>reward</b> systems in MDD. Support was not found for hyperresponsivity of cognitive control regions during <b>reward</b> selection or <b>reward</b> anticipation. Instead, MDD participants showed hyperresponsivity in orbitofrontal cortex, a region associated with assessment of risk and <b>reward,</b> during <b>reward</b> selection, as well as decreased activation of the middle frontal gyrus and the rostral cingulate gyrus during <b>reward</b> selection and anticipation. Finally, depression severity was predicted by activation in bilateral midfrontal gyrus during <b>reward</b> selection. Results indicate that MDD is characterized by striatal hyporesponsivity, and that future studies of MDD treatments that seek to improve responses to <b>rewarding</b> stimuli should assess striatal functioning. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Sensory {{decisions}} may {{be influenced}} by non-sensory information regarding <b>reward</b> magnitude or <b>reward</b> likelihood.

Here, we investigated the ability of macaque monkeys to integrate <b>reward</b> magnitude and prior <b>reward</b> likelihood information into a categorical decision about stimuli with high signal strength but variable decision uncertainty. In the asymmetric <b>reward</b> magnitude condition, monkeys over-adjusted their decision criterion such that they chose the highly <b>rewarded</b> alternative far more often than was optimal; in contrast, monkeys did not adjust their decision criterion in response to asymmetric <b>reward</b> likelihood. This finding shows that in this setting, monkeys did not adjust their decision criterion based on the product of <b>reward</b> likelihood and <b>reward</b> magnitude as has been reported to be the case in value based decisions that do not involve decision uncertainty due to stimulus categorization...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBasic {{tenets of}} sensory {{processing}} {{emphasize the importance}} of accurate identification and discrimination of environmental objects [1]. Although this principle holds also for <b>reward,</b> the crucial acquisition of <b>reward</b> for survival would be aided by the capacity to detect objects whose <b>rewarding</b> properties may not be immediately apparent. Animal learning theory conceptualizes how unrewarded stimuli induce behavioral reactions in <b>rewarded</b> contexts due to pseudoconditioning and higher-order context conditioning [2 – 6]. We hypothesized that the underlying mechanisms may involve context-sensitive <b>reward</b> neurons. We studied short-latency activations of dopamine neurons to unrewarded, physically salient stimuli while systematically changing <b>reward</b> context. Dopamine neurons showed substantial activations to unrewarded stimuli and their conditioned stimuli in highly <b>rewarded</b> contexts. The activations decreased and often disappeared entirely with stepwise separation from <b>rewarded</b> contexts. The influence of <b>reward</b> context suggests that dopamine neurons respond to real and potential <b>reward.</b> The influence of <b>reward</b> context is compatible with the <b>reward</b> nature of phasic dopamine responses. The responses may facilitate rapid, default initiation of behavioral reactions in environments usually containing <b>reward.</b> Agents would encounter more and miss less <b>reward,</b> resulting in survival advantage and enhanced evolutionary fitness...|$|R

5|$|On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited {{launched}} Octopus <b>Rewards,</b> {{a program}} that allows cardholders to earn <b>rewards</b> at merchants that are partners in the program. Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor-made offers and privileges. The <b>rewards</b> that the program offers are {{in the form of}} points, or reward dollars, stored on the card. Once a card is registered for the program, the cardholder may accumulate reward points by making purchases at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves. The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made. At Wellcome, for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200; and at Watsons, points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase. Once these reward dollars are accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per reward dollar. To redeem the accumulated reward dollars, cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially. If the purchase price is lower than the amount of reward dollars available, the amount difference remains stored on the card. Founding partners for the Octopus <b>Rewards</b> program include HSBC, UA Cinemas and Wellcome.|$|E

5|$|One study {{looked at}} how reward {{discounting}} is context specific.

They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food <b>rewards,</b> but will not wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances.|$|E
40|$|<b>Reward</b> sensitivity, or the {{tendency}} to engage in motivated approach behavior {{in the presence of}} <b>rewarding</b> stimuli, may be a contributory factor for vulnerability to disinhibitory behaviors. Although evidence exists for a <b>reward</b> sensitivity-related increased response in <b>reward</b> brain areas (i. e. nucleus accumbens or midbrain) during the processing of <b>reward</b> cues, it is unknown how this trait modulates brain connectivity, specifically the crucial coupling between the nucleus accumbens, the midbrain, and other reward-related brain areas, including the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala. Here, we analysed the relationship between effective connectivity and personality in response to anticipatory <b>reward</b> cues. Forty-four males performed an adaptation of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task and completed the Sensitivity to <b>Reward</b> scale. The results showed the modulation of <b>reward</b> sensitivity on both activity and functional connectivity (psychophysiological interaction) during the processing of incentive cues. Sensitivity to <b>reward</b> scores related to stronger activation in the nucleus accumbens and midbrain during the processing of <b>reward</b> cues. Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that midbrain-medial orbitofrontal cortex connectivity was negatively correlated with sensitivity to <b>reward</b> scores for high as compared with low incentive cues. Also, nucleus accumbens-amygdala connectivity correlated negatively with sensitivity to <b>reward</b> scores during <b>reward</b> anticipation. Our results suggest that high <b>reward</b> sensitivity-related activation in <b>reward</b> brain areas may result from associated modulatory effects of other brain regions within the <b>reward</b> circuitry...|$|R
