40|$|The need {{to provide}} {{increased}} access to flight simulator training for U. S. regional airlines, which historically have been limited by cost considerations {{in the use of}} such equipment for pilot <b>recurrent</b> <b>training,</b> is discussed. In light of that need, the issue of whether more affordable fixed-base simulators, identical to full flight simulators in all respects except for absence of platform motion, might provide an equivalent level of safety when employed for <b>recurrent</b> <b>training,</b> is examined. Pertinent literature from the past two decades is reviewed. The paper observes that no definitive conclusion can be drawn that would warrant modification of current qualification requirements for platform motion in full flight simulators. The article concludes that this situation will remain unchanged unless new research is undertaken, which takes into account the lessons learned from past research, and the opportunities engendered by new technology. Broad guidelines for an appropriate research design are discussed...|$|R

A first study, which tested “as is ” motion in an FAA qualified full flight simulator, had not found any effect of motion. Under the enhanced motion conditions of the present study many effects of motion emerged that have not been previously shown in the airline-pilot training and evaluation context, indicating that motion may be required at least for pilot evaluation purposes. The implications of the results for <b>recurrent</b> <b>training</b> are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{cognitive}} model of instructor Crew Resource Management (CRM) assessment was developed {{as an integral}} component of a prototype CRM assessment expert system. The {{cognitive model}} provides an instructor-centered approach to CRM assessment in the multi-tasking, time-constrained environment of <b>recurrent</b> Line-Oriented Flight <b>Training</b> (LOFT). This cognitive modeling is based on systematic analysis of how experienced instructors are able to attend to key crew behaviors and derive consistent CRM assessments in the complex simulator-based training environment. Concept sorting data, collected from <b>recurrent</b> <b>training</b> instructors, was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis. The analysis identified the mental organization or knowledge structures required to make efficient CRM assessments in the time-constrained LOFT environment. There were three primary assessment clusters that experienced instructors had in common. These clusters of assessment concepts were used to develop the architecture {{and content of the}} assessor modules for the prototype CRM assessment expert system. That expert system provides an efficient CRM assessment that is similar to the process and output of the experienced <b>recurrent</b> <b>training</b> instructor. These findings have operational implications for the feasibility of an instructor CRM assessment tool and for making the CRM assessment process more systematic...|$|R
