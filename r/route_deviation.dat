40|$|AbstractAn {{increasing}} number of people use smartphoneapplications to plan their trips. Unfortunately, for variousreasons, bus trips suggested by such applications are not asreliable as other trip types (e. g. by car, on foot, or by bicycle),which can result in excessive waiting time, or even the needto revise a planned trip. Traditional punctuality-based busservice reliability metrics do not capture <b>route</b> <b>deviations,</b> whichare especially frequent in rapid changing urban environmentsdue to rapidly changing road conditions caused by trafficcongestion, road maintenance, etc. The prevalence of GPS dataallows buses to be tracked and <b>route</b> <b>deviations</b> to be captured. We use such data to propose and calculate a novel reliabilityscore for bus trips. This score is a linear weighted combinationof distance, time, and speed deviations from an expected, predefinedbus trip. GPS trajectory data is large and noisy whichmakes it challenging to process. This paper also presents anefficient framework that can de-noise and semantically splitraw GPS data by pre-defined bus trips in citywide.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this paper}} is to present some {{modelling}} approaches related to a special form of advanced public transport operations and called with different names such as <b>route</b> <b>deviation</b> line, point deviation bus line, corridor deviation line and checkpoint dial-a-ride. A checkpoint dial-a-ride transit system combines characteristics both of traditional fixed route transit and of advanced door-to-door dial-a-ride service. It resembles fixed route operations because some users have to walk to and from at a finite number of stops located on a corridor and always visited. The checkpoint dial-a-ride system also resembles a door-to-door service because some users are picked up and dropped on demand at another finite number of special stops, called deviated stops or checkpoints, located near their trip ends. Such checkpoints are the main elements of a <b>route</b> <b>deviation</b> bus operations, which accepts user demands and, by communicating with a central control unit, makes the bus deviate from its regular route to serve the off-fixed-line request and then return on the regular route. <b>Route</b> <b>deviation</b> bus systems has been proposed and applied in several countries in order to enhance effectiveness of urban transit during off-peak periods, as well-suited service for small cities or as part of a larger integrated transit system.

40|$|Abstract—Sensory {{augmentation}} operates by synthesizing {{new information}} then displaying it through an existing sensory channel {{and can be}} used to help people with impaired sensing or to assist in tasks where sensory information is limited or sparse, for example, when navigating in a low visibility environment. This paper presents the design of a 2 nd generation head-mounted vibrotactile interface as a sensory augmentation prototype designed to present navigation commands that are intuitive, informative and minimize information overload. We describe an experiment in a structured environment in which the user navigates along a virtual wall whilst the position and orientation of the user’s head is tracked in real time by a motion capture system. Navigation commands in the form of vibrotactile feedback are presented according to the user’s distance from the virtual wall and their head orientation. We test the four possible combinations of two command presentation modes (continuous, discrete) and two command types (recurring, single). We evaluated the effectiveness of this ‘tactile language’ according to the users’ walking speed and the smoothness of their trajectory parallel to the virtual wall. Results showed that recurring continuous commands allowed users to navigate with lowest <b>route</b> <b>deviation</b> and highest walking speed.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{improving}} the performance of all-optical Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks in terms of blocking probability. Blocking in such network architecture is caused mainly by the so-called wavelength continuity constraint (wcc), which requires a provisioned lightpath to occupy the same wavelength on all the links along its route. To alleviate the effect of wcc on the blocking performance, a rerouting strategy is proposed. The main idea behind this strategy lies in ensuring the creation of wavelength-continuous routes for the connections that are blocked due to wcc. Particularly, the proposed rerouting strategy is built upon two main pillars, namely wavelength reassignment and <b>route</b> <b>deviation.</b> The former strives to keep the physical route followed by the lightpath intact, while the latter changes the route of the lightpath when wavelength reassignment proves to be ineffective. The performance of the rerouting strategy is studied through extensive simulations in the context of networks employing the least congested path (LCP) routing algorithm and the first-fit (FF) wavelength assignment strategy. The reported results show that the proposed rerouting strategy can guarantee significant enhancement in terms of blocking probability while achieving near-optimal performance for networks utilizing a small number of wavelengths per fiber.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} AAA routing in roaming situations over heterogeneous wireless networks. While traveling, a mobile user often initiates an authentication process with the user’s home network AAA server to use the resources of a remote network. In the process, the user wants to affect {{the selection of a}} roaming path to the user’s home network, because pricing and other services differ by the path. We present a network-based solution for the selection that eliminates the necessity of user’s inquiring, collecting, and analyzing data over, possibly, heterogeneous wireless networks. The solution assists the user in selecting a roaming path with respect to a user-preferred metric and performing a mutual authentication afterward via the selected path. We first propose a routing and label computation algorithm for generating pre-provisioned routes through which authentication traffic would pass. At the heart of the solution is a mutual authentication protocol that, together with registration, handshake, and <b>route</b> <b>deviation</b> detection schemes, provides a secure, privacy preserving, and ultra-lightweight way of authentication. Using password-based identification, the solution is generic and requires no particular transmission mechanism, payload, or routing framework. It should be incrementally deployable over selected AAA servers interoperable with existing AAA infrastructure not knowing of the solution...|$|E

40|$|The {{optimization}} {{of traffic}} flows in congested airspace with varying convective weather is a challenging problem. One {{approach is to}} generate shortest routes between origins and destinations while meeting airspace capacity constraint {{in the presence of}} uncertainties, such as weather and airspace demand. This study focuses on development of an opti-mal flight path search algorithm that optimizes national airspace system throughput and efficiency in the presence of uncertainties. The algorithm is based on dynamic program-ming and utilizes the predicted probability that an aircraft will deviate around convective weather. It is shown that the running time of the algorithm increases linearly with the total number of links between all stages. The optimal routes minimize a combination of fuel cost and expected cost of <b>route</b> <b>deviation</b> due to convective weather. They are consid-ered as alternatives to the set of coded departure routes which are predefined by FAA to reroute pre-departure flights around weather or air traffic constraints. A formula, which calculates predicted probability of deviation from a given flight path, is also derived. The predicted probability of deviation is calculated for all path candidates. Routes with the best probability are selected as optimal. The predicted probability of deviation serves as a computable measure of reliability in pre-departure rerouting. The algorithm can also be extended to automatically adjust its design parameters to satisfy the desired level of reliability. I...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 58 - 60). Optical networking is {{a promising}} {{solution to the}} growing bandwidth requirements of today’s communication networks. The continuous challenge {{is to look for}} technological advances to improve network capacity, reliability, scalability and cost. This work addresses some of these factors by presenting a rerouting strategy for reducing the effect of the wavelength continuity constraint and improving the performance of all-optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks in terms of blocking probability. The problem of routing and wavelength assignment (RWA), of main interest in this study, is critically important for increasing the efficiency of WDM networks under wavelength continuity constraint. The proposed scheme introduces a rerouting strategy based on wavelength reassignment, with the First-Fit (FF) wavelength assignment algorithm, and <b>route</b> <b>deviation,</b> utilizing the Least Congested Path (LCP) routing algorithm. In addition, this approach is applied in the context of quality of service (QoS) differentiation to help network service providers to satisfy and guarantee service transmission priorities and tolerable delay requirements. Finally, a neural network model is developed to investigate the prediction of upcoming blocking times in the network in an attempt to reduce the network disruption caused by unnecessary rerouting, therefore improving the performance of the proposed strategy. Extensive simulations allowed us to verify our proposed rerouting strategy and enhancement models and assert their effectiveness in enhancing the network performance in terms of blocking probability especially for networks utilizing a small number of wavelengths per fiber. 1 bound copy: xiii, 62 leaves; col. ill.; 31 cm. available at RNL...|$|E

It results from reflections carried out as from research on the support to navigation by blind pedestrians whose study objective was the guided decision-making of 4 congenital blind, 4 adventitious blind and 4 low-vision blind {{in the process of}} route finding. The field study took place at the Education Faculty of the Federal University of Pernambuco – Recife – Brazil. The proposed experiment has been divided in 2 phases: learning and experimentation. Each one of them consisted of 3 steps with the following tasks for each user: plan a route, perform and represent it. A map was made upon a wooden structure covered by cardboard, upon which acetate was laid on the circulation areas. Different textures indicating the route to be followed by volunteers as well as the architectonic elements of the space to be experienced were placed upon them. Two reading strategies were used by the blind people to understand the space and plan a route: one based, exclusively, on the tracking of the route to be followed; and another devised as from the tracking of the general map. Those who limited their knowledge of the environment through the route, tended to memorize a lot of the decision-making orientation, thus causing hesitations and <b>route</b> <b>deviation.</b> Those who tracked the whole map, developed a panoramic idea of the space, generally related to some of the elements in the environment connected to the route structure, thus facilitating their spatial orientation.

Their cost-effectiveness is {{compared to that of}} fixed route systems with no transfers and door-to-door dial-a-ride systems. The results are derived for a simple routing strategy, and involve some simplifications which facilitate the comparisons. For high demand levels, the total cost per passenger for fixed route and checkpoint systems is very close. In fact, their optimal configurations are so alike, and the occurrence of <b>route</b> <b>deviations</b> is so rare, that fixed route systems should be preferred, as they can be operated on a schedule and require less dispatching effort. As the demand level decreases, demand responsive systems become relatively more attractive than fixed route systems, and checkpoint systems might possibly become cost-effective. However, by the time demand responsive systems are significantly better than fixed route systems, door-to-door service can be provided at an even lower cost. This appears to limit the situations where checkpoint dial-a-ride systems can be applied efficiently to a small window of demand levels (and special situations) where they only narrowly outperform other systems. ...|$|R
