5|$|In 1938 Los Angeles, two gangsters in Eddie Valentine's gang steal a <b>rocket</b> pack from Howard Hughes. During their escape, {{they find}} {{themselves}} on an airfield, where they hide the <b>rocket</b> pack, ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord's Gee Bee racer is totaled during the accident; he and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the <b>rocket</b> pack hidden in a biplane cockpit. Movie star Neville Sinclair had hired Valentine's gang to steal the <b>rocket</b> pack, and he sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the <b>rocket</b> pack is at the airfield.|$|E
5|$|Multiple <b>rocket</b> launcher: The first {{multiple}} <b>rocket</b> launchers {{were made}} during the medieval Chinese Song dynasty. It was designed to launch multiple <b>rocket</b> arrows from a gunpowder box. These also appeared later, in an expanded version, in the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, where they were used with great effectiveness against the Japanese invasions of 1592–98, most notably the Battle of Haengju. Multiple <b>rocket</b> launchers evolved from Chinese fire lances when the Song military favored multiple <b>rocket</b> launchers that fired simultaneously up to 100 small fire-arrow rockets after the Mongol siege of Kaifeng. The typical powder section of such an arrow-rocket was 1/3 and 1/2 ft (10 to 15 cm) long. Bamboo arrow shafts varied from 1.5 ft (45 cm) to 2.5 ft (75 cm) long and the striking distance reached 300 to 400 paces. The Chinese also enhanced <b>rocket</b> tips with poison and made sure that the launchers were also mobile. Song Chinese <b>rocket</b> designers designed multiple <b>rocket</b> launchers that could be carried and operated by a single soldier.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rocket</b> {{propellant}}: Solid fuel <b>rocket</b> propellant began {{during the}} 1200s during the medieval Chinese Song dynasty {{at a time}} when bows, arrows, and catapult-based projectile launchers were state of the art military technology in medieval Europe. The Song Chinese invented solid propellant rockets in 1232 during the military siege of Kaifeng. The <b>rocket</b> propellants were powered by solid gunpowder fuel.|$|E

They include the Syrian-made (Chinese-designed) M-302 and the locally-made M-75, {{which have the}} range to target Tel-Aviv. Other <b>rockets</b> include the Soviet Katyushas and Qassams. The Israeli Defense Force {{reported}} that {{at the beginning of}} the 2014 conflict, Hamas had close to 6,000 <b>rockets</b> in its possession. This included 1,000 self-produced short range <b>rockets</b> (15–20km range), 2,500 smuggled short range <b>rockets,</b> 200 self-made Grad <b>rockets,</b> and 200 smuggled Grad <b>rockets.</b> In addition, to these short range <b>rockets,</b> Hamas held an assortment of mid and long range <b>rockets,</b> both self-made and smuggled, that totaled over several thousand.|$|R

5|$|According to {{literary}} critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé's story include Jules Verne's 1870 novel Around the Moon and the 1950 American film Destination Moon. Hergé was certainly {{inspired by a}} number of photographic stills from the Destination Moon film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first computer to be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his moon <b>rocket</b> on the designs of the V-2 <b>rocket</b> which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white checker pattern on Hergé's <b>rocket</b> was based upon an illustration of a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon's 1947 book German Research in World War II. He commissioned the construction of a model <b>rocket</b> with detachable parts from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he showed it to Ananoff, asking him if it was a realistic representation of what a moon <b>rocket</b> might look like. He and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{laboratory}} assistants, Professor Bernard Quatermass anxiously awaits {{the return to}} Earth of his new <b>rocket</b> ship and its crew, who have become the first humans to travel into space. The <b>rocket</b> is at first thought to be lost, having dramatically overshot its planned orbit, but eventually it is detected by radar and returns to Earth, crash-landing in Wimbledon, London.|$|E
5|$|Although {{none were}} ever built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid <b>rocket</b> motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets. Another suggestion was to mount the entire <b>rocket</b> atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.|$|E
50|$|The R-7 {{family of}} <b>rockets</b> (Р-7) {{is a series}} of <b>rockets,</b> derived from the Soviet R-7 Semyorka, the world's first ICBM. More R-7 <b>rockets</b> have been {{launched}} than any other family of large <b>rockets.</b>|$|R
2500|$|During the Ming dynasty, {{the design}} of <b>rockets</b> were further refined and {{multi-stage}} <b>rockets</b> and large batteries of <b>rockets</b> were produced.

50|$|There {{were two}} types of larger <b>rockets</b> {{launched}} from the site, Arcas at about six feet and the much larger Nike Apache <b>rockets.</b> Both of these <b>rockets</b> were two-stage <b>rockets</b> that could carry a substantial payload. The Nike Apache <b>rockets</b> weighed about 1700 lb, were over 28 ft tall and reached an altitude of almost 100 mi.|$|R
5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the <b>rocket</b> pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the <b>rocket</b> pack. Hughes explains that his <b>rocket</b> pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the <b>rocket</b> pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E
5|$|By 1953 Quatermass is {{the head}} of the British Experimental <b>Rocket</b> Group, which has a {{programme}} to launch a manned <b>rocket</b> into space from a base in Tarooma, Australia. Although Quatermass succeeds in launching a three-man crew, the <b>rocket</b> vastly overshoots its projected orbit and returns to Earth much later than planned, crash-landing in London. Only one of the crew, Victor Carroon, remains, and he has been taken over by an alien presence, eventually forcing Quatermass to destroy him and the other two crewmembers who have been absorbed into him in a climax set in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Chiswick {{was bombed}} repeatedly, with both {{incendiary}} and high explosive bombs. Falling anti-aircraft shells and shrapnel also caused damage. The first V-2 <b>rocket</b> to hit London fell on Staveley Road, Chiswick, at 6.43pm on 8 September 1944, killing three people, injuring 22 others and causing extensive damage to surrounding trees and buildings. Six houses were demolished by the <b>rocket</b> {{and many more}} suffered damage.

5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a <b>rocket</b> as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's <b>rocket</b> follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the <b>rocket</b> can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their <b>rocket.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a major {{space policy}} speech in April 2010, Obama {{announced}} a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency.
