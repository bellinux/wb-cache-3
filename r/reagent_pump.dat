Liquid samples and <b>reagents</b> were <b>pumped</b> by centrifugal force in the rotating disc, and their positions and movements were controlled through a programmable light from a laser diode. This novel water analysis platform required only 500 mu L of sample (100 mu L for each nutrient) and 10 - 30 mu L of reagents for colorimetric detection. In addition, the fully automated parallel processes and efficient mixing in the rotating disc allowed for {{a significant reduction in}} total analysis time (similar to 7 min 40 s) and increased accuracy.

This process is typically referred to as in situ solidification/stabilization (S/S). In situ S/S involves mixing a binding reagent into the contaminated media or waste using soil augers and has been used to treat both organic and inorganic hazardous waste constituents. Cement-based mix designs are most commonly used for S/S treatment of hazardous waste, however, a variety of additives such as fly ash, hydrated lime, bentonite can also used to meet specific project requirements.

40|$|A {{microfluidic}} chip-based {{total analysis system}} (µ-TAS) integrating {{two independent}} monolithic electroosmotic pumps (EOPs) [1] for sample preconcentration [2] and reagent delivery has been developed. Based on our previous work on EOPs and a microchip-based flow injection analysis system (µ-FIA) using monolithic EOPs [3, 4], the novelty of the µ-TAS reported here (Fig. 1) rests in the integration of two independent EOPs, one as the <b>reagent</b> µ-FIA <b>pump</b> (EOP-a), and a second (EOP-b) for analyte preconcentration by micro-solid phase extraction (µ-SPE); both using silica monolithic capillary columns embedded in the chip, and applying light emitting diode (LED) based photometric and capacitively coupled contactless conductometric (C 4 D) detections. The chip was designed so that the µ-FIA reagent {{was placed in a}} reagent reservoir (Fig. 1) propelled indirectly by the EOP-a pumping water. In this way, the composition of the reagent can be independent from the propellant liquid, which is kept constant (water). The µ-SPE preconcentration step is followed by elution of the analyte from the EOP-b and injection of the zone of preconcentrated analyte in a µ-FIA stream of reagent. This is visualised in Fig. 2 where eluted Ca 2 + as a test analyte is seen exiting the EOP-b as blue zone as it reacts with o-cresolphthalein complexone (o-CPC).

With the emergence of microfluidics, there is an increased focus in addressing this need. While many platforms have been created to successfully complete an immunoassay, they still require bulky external equipment to manipulate fluid within the device. Using technology developed in the BioMiNT lab, we've created an immunoassay platform {{that is capable of}} on-chip pumping and mixing with lateral and vertical-cavity acoustic transducer (LCAT & VCAT respectively) coupled to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). PDMS devices were fabricated, molded and bonded to glass slides adhered with antigen-spotted nitrocellulose pads. Once they are primed with blocking buffer to introduce air bubbles, the devices are actuated with a PZT to drive fluid pumping and mixing. The <b>reagents</b> are <b>pumped</b> into the device serially and after completion, the spotted antigens on the pad become a dark purple hue, indicating an antibody-antigen binding event. For quantitative results, the intensities are evaluated using computer software. Results show that the resulting spot intensities are comparable to an established, optimized microarray platform in one-fifth of the time. We also show that these results cannot be reproduced in a passive or flow-through microfluidic device, indicating that convective mixing is necessary for improved signal intensity. Using the LCAT/VCAT platform, an immunoassay can be performed in 20 minutes and with increased sensitivity. Future work will involve expanding the device to allow for an automated point-of-care platform...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{simplest}} forms of a microreactor is a 'T' reactor.

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{availability of}} inexpensive fiber optics and small volume pumps {{in the early}} 1990 's provided the components necessary for the successful development of low power, low reagent consumption, autonomous optofluidic analyzers for marine applications. It was evident that to achieve calibration-free performance, reagent-based sensors would require frequent renewal of the <b>reagent</b> by <b>pumping</b> the <b>reagent</b> from an impermeable, inert reservoir to the sensing interface. Pumping also enabled measurement of a spectral blank further enhancing accuracy and stability. The first instrument that was developed based on this strategy, the Submersible Autonomous Moored Instrument for CO 2 (SAMI-CO 2), uses a pH indicator for measurement of the partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2). Because the pH indicator gives an optical response, the instrument requires an optofluidic design where the indicator is pumped into a gas permeable membrane and then to an optical cell for analysis. The pH indicator is periodically flushed from the optical cell by using a valve to switch from the pH indicator to a blank solution. Because of the small volume and low power light source, over 8, 500 measurements can be obtained with a ~ 500 mL reagent bag and 8 alkaline D-cell battery pack. The primary drawback is that the design is more complex compared to the single-ended electrode or optode that is envisioned as the ideal sensor. The SAMI technology has subsequently been used for the successful development of autonomous pH and total alkalinity analyzers. In this manuscript, we will discuss {{the pros and cons}} of the SAMI pCO 2 and pH optofluidic technology and highlight some past data sets and applications for studying the carbon cycle in aquatic ecosystems...|$|R

High sensitivity was achieved using multivariate and univariate screening experiments, optimized reagent concentrations, a reaction time of 130 s and a sampling-loop volume of 300 mul or higher. The <b>reagents</b> were <b>pumped</b> at 1. 2 ml min- 1 and the sample at 4. 7 ml min- 1, yielding a sampling rate up to 120 h- 1, with negligible carryover. The effects of Fe(III), Ti(IV), W(VI), Cr(VI), V(V), PO 43 - and ionic strength on the analytical signal were evaluated under these conditions. Only Ti(IV) does not interfere significantly. Hence, a prior separation step is necessary, consisting of an extraction of Mo(VI) into HCl-saturated chloroform as an alpha-benzoin oxime complex. For a reaction time of 130 s and an ambient temperature of 22 +/- 2 -degrees-C the calibration graph, obtained by submitting Mo(VI) standards to the extraction procedure, follows the equation DELTAA = - 0. 0018 + 0. 0172 c(Mo) (r 2 = 0. 998), where DELTAA is the net analytical response, taken as {{the difference between the}} catalysed and non-catalysed signals, and c(Mo) is the molybdenum concentration, in ng ml- 1. Under these conditions, the linear range extends to 50 ng ml- 1, the calculated detection limit is about 1. 0 ng ml- 1 and the relative standard deviation is close to 1. 0 % over the entire linear range. The sensitivity and linear ranges of the MCFA procedure can be easily modified by simply changing the sampling volume and the reaction time. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by means of plant samples supplied by the 'International Plant-analytical Exchange' (IPE), from the Wageningen Agricultural University, The Netherlands. The results obtained for the determination of Mo(VI) in these samples were acceptable under the recommended IPE criteria...|$|R

Miniaturized Total Analysis Systems (µTAS) {{have the potential}} to fulfill this un-met need via low-cost, portable, and disposable point-of-care (POC) diagnostic devices. Inherent advantages of µTAS systems can be utilized to transform diagnostic technologies that currently require significant investment in centralized laboratories and highly trained personnel into automated, integrated, and miniaturized platforms. This dissertation addresses the development of microfabrication techniques and resulting component technologies that are realized in low-cost thermoplastic substrates. A thermoplastic microfabrication technique termed orogenic microfabrication, based on a non-reversible solvent-assisted swelling mechanism, is developed to provide unique capabilities for microscale and nanoscale patterning in rigid thermoplastics with minimal infrastructure. Orogenic microfabrication is compatible with multiple masking techniques including photolithography, chemical surface modification, contact and noncontact spotting, and inkjet deposition techniques, with each masking method offering unique influence on resulting orogenic structures that can be applied to microfluidic and µTAS systems. Direct ink masking is further explored as a low-cost rapid prototyping tool for fabrication of simple microfluidic devices where channel formation and bonding are combined into a single step, resulting in fully enclosed microfluidic channels within 30 minutes. Chemical surface passivation by UV-ozone treatment is utilized in combination with orogenic swelling and thermocompression bonding to develop single-use burst valves with tunable burst pressures. In addition to assisting in on-chip fluid manipulation, the normally closed burst valves enable on-chip reagent packaging and hermetic sealing of bioactive material in lyophilized format, and can be used for delivery of stored reagents for a range of disposable point-of-care assays. On-chip integrated micropumps are also developed, using simple fabrication process compatible with conventional thermoplastic fabrication techniques such as direct micromilling or injection molding. Direct displacement of liquid <b>reagents</b> using screw-assisted <b>pumping</b> can be operated either automatically or manually, with on-demand delivery of liquid reagents {{in a wide range of}} flow rates typically used in microfluidic applications.

40|$|Atomic spectrometric {{techniques}} such as ICP-MS offer exceptional sensitivity and multi-element capability for trace metal analysis but the formation of polyatomic ions (particularly below m/z = 80) can cause serious interferences. Such interfering species may be introduced via precursor atoms in atmospheric gases, the sample matrix or impurities in the reagents and gases. There is an environmental need to establish rapid multi-element methods of analysis for trace metals in environmental waters and the subsequent speciation of these trace elements. Natural waters, particularly those with a high dissolved solids content such as sea water are difficult to analyse directly by ICP techniques due to the sample matrix forming polyatomic ion interferences when using ICP-MS and matrix modification of the background when undertaking ICP-AES studies. This thesis describes {{the development of an}}alytical methodologies involving on-line sample preconcentration and matrix removal for the determination of trace elements in natural waters and brines using ICP-MS and ICPAES detection for the determination of a suite of trace elements including cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead manganese, nickel, selenium and zinc. Chapter one summarises the techniques used for such analyses and a review of solid phases used for sample preconcentration and matrix removal is given. Chapter two describes the development of an on-line Fl-atomic spectrometric matrix elimination method for the determination of trace metals in the samples discussed. The method involved the chelation of the analytes onto a Metpac CC- 1 ® IDA resin with the simultaneous removal of matrix ions, e. g. Na and CI. The method was successfully validated for the analysis of open ocean sea water and riverine water, and the application of FI-FAAS to the determination of Mn in riverwater using extended preconcentration times to improve sensitivity is described. The influence of sample matrix on the atomic emission of these trace analytes is also discussed. Chapter three describes the application of the developed method to the quantification of trace elements in produced water samples from the north sea oil and gas production fields. Results using FI-ICP-MS and FI-ICP-AES are compared, and a sample is digested using U. V. radiation {{in order to determine the}} amount of trace analytes bound to organic material. The influence of matrix concentration on analyte retention and column capacity is investigated, and data obtained from a series of breakthrough curves is used to predict the maximum breakthrough volumes of sample required before analyte is lost as the operating capacity of the column is exceeded, for samples of differing salinities. Chapter four describes the development of an in-situ method of preconcentration of a suite of trace elements using the column system described previously. In-situ preconcentration offers a number of advantages over traditional sample collection and preservation techniques and minimises the potential for sample contamination. The in-situ method involves the use of a battery powered preconcentration unit containing columns, reagents and suitable <b>reagent</b> and sample <b>pumping</b> facilities, and subsequent analysis of these samples in the laboratory by the use of FI-ICP-AES. The method is successfully validated using a coastal sea water certified reference material, and the method is applied to the determination of trace elements in a sample taken from the Tamar Estuary, Devon. Chapter five describes the development of an on-line FI preconcentration-HG-ICP-AES method for the speciation of inorganic selenium in water. Sample was preconcentrated on a Benson BA-XIO® exchange resin. On-line separation of Se(IV) and Se(VI) was achieved, and sensitivity was improved by the adoption of hydride generation prior to analysis for the determination of Se(IV). Se(VI) was determined after off-line pre-reduction to Se(IV).
