5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated <b>ribosomal</b> <b>proteins,</b> as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E
25|$|In {{bacterial}} cells, ribosomes are synthesized in the cytoplasm {{through the}} transcription of multiple ribosome gene operons. In eukaryotes, the process takes place {{both in the}} cell cytoplasm and in the nucleolus, which is a region within the cell nucleus. The assembly process involves the coordinated function of over 200 proteins in the synthesis and processing of the four rRNAs, as well as assembly of those rRNAs with the <b>ribosomal</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{ribosome}} is {{a highly}} complex cellular machine. It is largely made up of specialized RNA known as ribosomal RNA (rRNA) as well as dozens of distinct proteins (the exact number varies slightly between species). The <b>ribosomal</b> <b>proteins</b> and rRNAs are arranged into two distinct ribosomal pieces of different size, known generally as the large and small subunit of the ribosome. Ribosomes consist of two subunits that fit together (Figure 2) and work as one to translate the mRNA into a polypeptide chain during protein synthesis (Figure 1). Because they are formed from two subunits of non-equal size, they are slightly longer in the axis than in diameter.|$|E

Measurements of the differential synthesis rate of <b>ribosomal</b> <b>protein,</b> αr (<b>ribosomal</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis rate/total protein synthesis rate), indicate that <b>ribosomal</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis is regulated directly or indirectly by availability of charged tRNA, and that the synthesis of <b>ribosomal</b> <b>protein,</b> like the synthesis of rRNA, {{is subject to the}} influence of the rel gene control system...|$|R

50|$|A <b>ribosomal</b> <b>protein</b> {{leader is}} a {{mechanism}} used in cells {{to control the}} cellular concentration of a protein that forms {{a part of the}} ribosome, {{and to make sure that}} the concentration is neither too high nor too low. <b>Ribosomal</b> <b>protein</b> leaders are RNA sequences that are a part of the 5' UTR of mRNAs encoding a <b>ribosomal</b> <b>protein.</b> When cellular concentrations of the <b>ribosomal</b> <b>protein</b> are high, excess protein will bind to the mRNA leader. This binding event can lower gene expression via a number of mechanisms; for example, in the protein-bound state, the RNA could form an intrinsic transcription termination stem-loop. When cellular concentrations of the <b>ribosomal</b> <b>protein</b> are not high, they are occupied in the ribosome, and are not available in significant quantities to bind the mRNA leader. This leads to increased expression of the gene, which leads to the synthesis of more copies of the <b>ribosomal</b> <b>protein.</b> Many examples of <b>ribosomal</b> <b>protein</b> leaders are known in bacteria, including <b>ribosomal</b> <b>protein</b> L20 leader and ribosomal S15 leader.|$|R

Subsequently, he pursued his Ph.D. work in bio{{chemistry and}} molecular {{biology at the}} Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin Dahlem in which Heinz-Günter Wittmann was department head. While determining the primary structures of several E. coli <b>ribosomal</b> <b>proteins,</b> he developed manual micro-methods for isolating peptides using two-dimensional separation on cellulose thin layer plates (instead of using a series of chromatography columns) followed by dansyl-Edman degradation. This reduced the required protein material by one to two orders of magnitude towards the 100 nMol range. This method was shortly thereafter superseded by automated protein sequencing operating in the low picoMol range.|$|E
25|$|In most {{bacteria}} {{the most}} numerous intracellular structure is the ribosome, {{the site of}} protein synthesis in all living organisms. All prokaryotes have 70S (where S=Svedberg units) ribosomes while eukaryotes contain larger 80S ribosomes in their cytosol. The 70S ribosome {{is made up of}} a 50S and 30S subunits. The 50S subunit contains the 23S and 5S rRNA while the 30S subunit contains the 16S rRNA. These rRNA molecules differ in size in eukaryotes and are complexed with a large number of <b>ribosomal</b> <b>proteins,</b> the number and type of which can vary slightly between organisms. While the ribosome is the most commonly observed intracellular multiprotein complex in bacteria other large complexes do occur and can sometimes be seen using microscopy.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of action is unique and complex. The drug works by damaging bacterial DNA, since its reduced form is highly reactive. This is {{made possible by the}} rapid reduction of nitrofurantoin inside the bacterial cell by flavoproteins (nitrofuran reductase) to multiple reactive intermediates that attack <b>ribosomal</b> <b>proteins,</b> DNA, respiration, pyruvate metabolism and other macromolecules within the cell. Nitrofurantoin exerts greater effects on bacterial cells than mammalian cells because bacterial cells activate the drug more rapidly. It is not known which of the actions of nitrofurantoin is primarily responsible for its bactericidal activity. The broad {{mechanism of}} action for this drug likely is responsible for the low development of resistance to its effects, as the drug affects many different processes important to the bacterial cell.|$|E

Zebrafish embryos exposed to hypoxia decreased expression of genes involved in the citric acid cycle including, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase, and increased expression of genes involved in glycolysis such as phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, aldolase, and lactate dehydrogenase. A decrease in protein synthesis is an important response to hypoxia in order to decrease ATP demand for whole organism metabolic suppression.
