5|$|I <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> {{they came}} to record 'Spice Up Your Life'. It {{was in the middle}} of the chaos. It had been booked in, that they were coming in to record their next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can you {{possibly}} do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E

25|$|Though the 9-2 1966 {{season was}} one of the best in program {{football}} history up to that point (along with the 1928 Florida Gators football team), the Gators fell short of their elusive first conference title due to a 27-10 upset loss to arch-rival Georgia, a loss that Spurrier would <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> he returned as Florida's coach and made beating Georgia a priority.|$|E

25|$|Prospective {{memory is}} {{required}} to <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> to take oral contraceptive pills. A study performed by Matter and Meier (2008) showed that women who self-reported higher prospective memory ability were more satisfied with oral contraceptive use and experienced lower stress levels. Having better memory makes {{it is easier for}} these women to remind themselves to take their contraceptives at the required time of the day.|$|E
25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} {{have a lower}} density than water, {{which means}} they are lighter and will form a separate layer on top of water. An important exception: most of the halogenated solvents like dichloromethane or chloroform will sink {{to the bottom of}} a container, leaving water as the top layer. This is important to <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> partitioning compounds between solvents and water in a separatory funnel during chemical syntheses.|$|E
25|$|In February 2006, Farnham {{performed}} four {{shows at}} the Sydney Opera House, with the Sydney Symphony, followed by {{shows at the}} Victorian Arts Centre's Hamer Hall, Melbourne. These shows were sponsored by Dairy Farmers and a percentage of revenue received from the 'I <b>Remember</b> <b>When</b> I was Young' concerts went to the Dairy Farmers 'Creating Greener Pastures' program to help farmers and their communities. A 2006 DVD of Farnham entitled John Farnham with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra was released, it debuted at No. 2 on the ARIA DVD charts and then peaked at #1.|$|E

25|$|Episode two: Brian and Froso - Woodall and Constantine find Brian and Froso {{in a very}} troubled {{marriage}}. They soon {{learn that}} Brian and Froso's marriage almost fell apart eighteen months before. Froso {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer on Christmas Eve that same year, and both saw a traumatic time ahead, but united as a couple throughout her treatment and subsequent mastectomy. Froso is now undergoing her recovery and coming to terms with her breast prosthesis, but the couple is experiencing a difficult time in their relationship and fail to <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> they last went out. Unable to share the truth of her body with Brian, Froso fights hard to confront her insecurities with the help of Woodall and Constantine and their silhouette screen. After she shows her body to her husband for the first time after her surgery, their relationship becomes stronger and they feel burdens released. They are soon given a new look and image. Woodall and Constantine take them to a secretly organised service where family and friends are assembled to witness the renewing their wedding vows.|$|E
25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. <b>Remember</b> <b>when</b> the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E
25|$|Stan later flirts with Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), {{and offers}} her a loan when he learns {{that she is}} {{struggling}} for money. When Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill) suffers an epileptic fit, Stan and Shirley unite to help her and successfully deal with the issue. Wanting to reconcile with Shirley further, Stan calls Dean to The Vic. However, the reunion does not go well and Mick ends up punching Dean when he turns nasty with Shirley. Shirley blames Stan for the situation and threatens to throw him out, but he tells her if she does that he will reveal that it was her, not Shirley's mother Sylvie, that tried to drown Mick when he was very young. When the Carters decide to re-paint the exterior of The Vic, Tina tells Mick that she can <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> they were decorating and when Mick nearly drowned in a bath, and that their mother Sylvie was not present. Mick believes that Stan was the culprit who tried to drown him, and orders him to leave The Vic immediately. Mick later violently grabs him and taunts him with drowning in the bath, although Shirley stops with the truth. Stan helps Linda allow her son, Johnny (Sam Strike), some independence after he reveals he is gay. Stan grows closer to Cora when he holds her a late birthday celebration as everyone forgets the date. He refuses to believe Mick is guilty of soliciting a prostitute when he arrested for the crime, despite his plea in court. Cora reveals the offence to the whole pub, and distances herself from Stan. He is suspicious and realises when speaking to Cora's granddaughter Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) that Cora knows the prostitute involved. Cora apologises to the Carters when her daughter Rainie (Tanya Franks), the prostitute, confesses that she lied about Mick.|$|E

500|$|... "Remember the Time" [...] {{is a new}} jack swing song. The lyrics {{recall a}} {{youthful}} love affair: [...] "Do you <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> we fell in love/We were young and innocent then". The song {{is set in the}} key of an original F Minor with Jackson's voice range from Eb3 to C5. The song's tempo is moderate at 116 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically. When speaking about Lennon, Turner said; [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I {{really wanted to be}} able to write an [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] type song, and I found it very difficult. You listen to that and it sounds like it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon definitely had a knack for that".|$|E
500|$|... "Mine Again" [...] is an [...] "old-school '70s smooth soul", and neo soul ballad. The lyrics {{revolve around}} the protagonist wishing for a second chance at a {{seemingly}} failed relationship. [...] "Mine Again" [...] is written in the key of B-flat major and is set in common time with a moderate dance groove with 66 beats per minute (BPM). Carey's vocal range spans three octaves from the lower note of F4 to the higher note of F7. The song includes piano keys and guitar strings {{as part of its}} instrumental composition. The song begins with the lyric, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> you used to be mine, way back then." ...|$|E

500|$|People {{connected}} with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I first heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw." [...] Gary Smith, {{who at the time}} was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he [...] "was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record." [...] Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production [...] "sounded way better than the other ones." ...|$|E
500|$|Schembechler later {{recalled}} that he remained loyal to Elliott {{when he took}} over as Michigan's head coach in 1969. [...] When Schembechler won the Big Ten championship in 1969, he said, [...] "I made certain I let everyone know I won with Bump's kids. [...] Bump was a man of great class and he showed it to me again and again in that first year, never getting in the way, always trying to be helpful, always trying to encourage me." [...] After Michigan won the 1969 Ohio State game, the team presented the game ball to Elliott, and Schembechler noted that [...] "I don’t <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> I felt happier about anything in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Negative {{reviews from}} critics were mainly {{centered}} around them {{feeling that the}} album was released only for profit. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave This Is It {{two and a half}} out of five stars. Erlewine commented that, [...] "an important thing to <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> considering the soundtrack to This Is It: this entire film and CD project was never supposed to happen". He noted that Jackson's death had [...] "created considerable demand" [...] for his final rehearsal footage and that This Is It was an [...] "accompaniment" [...] to the film. Andy Gill of The Independent strongly criticized This Is It describing it as being a [...] "shoddy apology for an album" [...] and felt that it was made just for a profit, commenting, ...|$|E

500|$|SF writer Alfred Bester, {{an editor}} of Holiday Magazine and a {{sophisticated}} Manhattanite, recounted at some length his [...] "one demented meeting" [...] with Campbell, a man he imagined from afar to be [...] "a combination of Bertrand Russell and Ernest Rutherford." [...] The first thing Campbell said to him was that Freud was dead, destroyed by the new discovery of Dianetics, which, he predicted, would win L. Ron Hubbard the Nobel Peace Prize. Campbell ordered the bemused Bester to [...] "think back. Clear yourself. Remember! You can <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> your mother tried to abort you with a button hook. You've never stopped hating her for it." [...] Bester commented: [...] "It reinforced my private opinion {{that a majority of}} the science-fiction crowd, despite their brilliance, were missing their marbles." ...|$|E
500|$|The Briarcliff Manor {{police force}} {{was founded by}} Edward Cashman, a one-person force who covered his beat on foot and by bicycle. The crime rate was low during both world wars, and village police work {{primarily}} involved rounding up animals (as the constabulary had done since before the Revolution). Most other cases were traffic violations, due to the village's size and parkway access. During the 1980s (as in the 1940s), the police blotter primarily consisted of accidents and traffic violations on the four major roads traversing the village; a 1939 village history asserted that [...] "Briarcliff {{has never had a}} serious crime". Burglaries have been primarily residential, and murder is rare. In 1989, when the police force considered replacing its [...]38 six-shot revolvers with semiautomatic 9mm pistols, opinion was divided; village officials could not <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> an officer last fired a gun on duty.|$|E
500|$|The comrades {{eventually}} {{decide to}} act on their own, calling themselves [...] "Freeborn British Communists". They start experimenting with explosives and build a car bomb. Alice does not fully support this action, but accepts the majority decision. They target an upmarket hotel in Knightsbridge, but their inexperience results in the premature detonation of the bomb, which kills Faye and several passers-by. The remaining comrades, shaken by what they have done, decide to leave the squat and split up. Alice, disillusioned by Jasper, chooses not to follow him and remains behind because she cannot bear to abandon the house into which she has poured so much effort. Despite her initial reservations about the bombing, Alice feels a need to justify their actions to others, but realises it would be fruitless because [...] "rdinary people simply didn't understand". She acknowledges {{that she is a}} terrorist now, though she cannot <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> the change happened.|$|E
