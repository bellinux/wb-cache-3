25|$|Although {{poetry in}} {{traditional}} classical forms had mostly {{fallen out of}} fashion by the 1960s, the practice was kept alive by poets of great formal virtuosity like James Merrill (1926–1995), author of the epic poem The Changing Light at Sandover, Richard Wilbur, and British-born San Francisco poet Thom Gunn. The 1980s and 1990s saw a re-emergent interest in traditional form, sometimes dubbed New Formalism or Neoformalism. These include poets such as Molly Peacock, Brad Leithauser, Dana Gioia, Donna J. Stone, Timothy Steele, and Marilyn Hacker. Some of the more outspoken New Formalists have declared that the return to rhyme and more fixed meters {{to be the new}} avant-garde. Their critics sometimes associate this traditionalism with the conservative politics of the <b>Reagan</b> <b>era,</b> noting the recent appointment of Gioia as Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts. More recent examples of New Formalism, however, have sometimes crossed over into the more experimental territory of Language poetry, suggesting that both schools are being gradually absorbed into the poetic mainstream.|$|E

David Denby of New York Magazine, called the film [...] "a nauseating {{distillation}} of the slack, greedy side of Reaganism." [...] Author Christina Lee agreed, adding it was a “splendidly ridiculous exercise in unadulterated indulgence,” and the film “encapsulated the <b>Reagan</b> <b>era's</b> near solipsist worldview and insatiable appetite for immediate gratification—of living in and for the moment....” Gene Siskel panned the film from a Chicago-centric perspective saying “Ferris Bueller doesn't do anything much fun ... hey don't even sit in the bleachers where all the kids like to sit {{when they go to}} Cubs games.” Siskel did enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Charlie Sheen. Ebert thought Siskel was too eager to find flaws in the film's view of Chicago.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{some of the}} issues raised in researching the 'problematic' of rural life-styles are discussed. It is argued that {{traditional}} normative approaches to the study of deprivation and poverty need to be supplemented by an understanding of varying social and cultural constructions of reality, community, living standards, and welfare. The importance of such social and cultural constructs is illustrated in a discussion of the discursive transformation of previous codes, symbols, and concepts of welfare and poverty during the Thatcher and <b>Reagan</b> <b>eras</b> in Britain and the USA, respectively. In a series of contested transformations, the relationship between individual, society, and state in the provision and receipt of welfare has been redefined. Moreover, it is suggested that there are important spatial differences between the urban and the rural within this discursive context, with the urban construction of 'underclass' contrasting with rural constructions of 'idyll', the latter suggesting codes and symbols of self-help which negate the need for state intervention in welfare. ...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2012. Major: Communication Studies. Advisor: Laurie Ouellette. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 229 pages. This dissertation examines family sitcoms {{in the context}} of the <b>Reagan</b> <b>era's</b> perceived "crisis in the family" and gendered shifts in domestic life. Through a combination of Foucaultian and feminist theories, I ask how television sitcoms shape family life. I look at popular long-running programs like Who's the Boss?, Full House, and Family Ties as pedagogical texts that offered guidelines to viewers struggling with competing ideas about family, gender, parenting, and domestic labor. While providing lessons in household governance, these sitcoms simultaneously enact liberal feminist fantasies of work and domesticity. By bringing together historical analysis of the television industry during the late-network era with a look at policy and political objectives, I show that networks were seeking to appeal to upwardly mobile "career women," thus the proliferation of sitcoms dealing with non-nuclear families and the reorganization of housework arrangements...|$|R

In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Jon Pareles commented that Jackson [...] "doubled his ambitions and multiplied his audience" [...] with the album and wrote of its legacy, [...] "Thriller had extramusical help in becoming the best-selling noncompilation album of all time: Jackson's dancing feet and dazzling stage presence, amplified by the newfound promotional reach of music video and the <b>Reagan</b> <b>era's</b> embrace of glossy celebrity.

[...] Woolverton credits Belle's knowledge and love of books with providing the character with a [...] "point of view {{of her life and}} that doesn't necessarily involve a man getting her there." [...] One of the film's main themes, Belle is considered an outsider because her love of reading provides her with knowledge of the outside world as opposed to her [...] "narrow-minded" [...] village peers. Writing for Wired.com, Matt Blum dubbed Belle [...] "the geekiest heroine of any Disney animated film", exemplified by an opening number that demonstrates just how much she does not fit in with her peers due to her intelligence and active imagination. Similarly, Boxoffices Amy Nicholson coined the character [...] "Disney's Smartest Heroine," [...] while Rob Burch of The Hollywood News observed that the character [...] "comes across as arrogant at times" [...] because she [...] "spends much of the first act complaining."

[...] Comparing Belle's personality to that of the princess in the Brothers Grimm's fairy tale [...] "The Frog Prince", The Meanings of [...] "Beauty and the Beast": A Handbook author Jerry Griswold described the character as a similarly [...] "feisty and outspoken" [...] heroine. Writing for St. Francis Xavier University, Dawn Elizabeth England observed that Belle possesses equally as many traditionally feminine as she does masculine traits, citing her bravery, independence and assertiveness as masculine, and her sensitivity and fearfulness as feminine. According to Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in the <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era</b> author Susan Jeffords, [...] "Belle's credentials as heroine are established ... when she {{is the only one of}} the town's single women not to swoon over Gaston," [...] while the character's love of reading is essentially manipulated [...] "to mark her as better than the rest of the townspeople." [...] Writing for The Statesman, David O'Connor cited Belle's intelligence and bibliophilia as [...] "in stark opposition to the insensitive and significantly dim-witted Gaston." [...] Critics continue to debate over whether Belle or the Beast is the film's protagonist.

2500|$|On {{the issue}} of women's rights there was much division, with many feminists {{frustrated}} with Carter, the only candidate who supported the Equal Rights Amendment.

40|$|This eye-opening study uncovers {{the history}} of the most {{important}} instrument of U. S. counterterrorism today: the armed drone. It reveals that, contrary to popular belief, the CIA’s covert drone program is not a product of 9 / 11. Rather, it is the result of U.

Tracing the evolution of counterterrorism policy and drone technology from the fallout of Iran-Contra and the CIA’s “Eagle Program” prototype in the mid- 1980 s to the emergence of al-Qaeda, Fuller shows how George W. Bush and Obama built upon or discarded strategies from the <b>Reagan</b> and Clinton <b>eras</b> as they responded to changes in the partisan environment, the perceived level of threat, and technological advances. Examining a range of counterterrorism strategies, he reveals why the CIA’s drones became the United States’ preferred tool for pursuing the decades-old goal of preemptively targeting anti-American terrorists around the world...|$|R
500|$|After the May 1987 Gary Hart–Donna Rice scandal, a {{questionnaire}} by The New York Times requested {{things such as}} psychiatric records and access to FBI files from all 14 presidential candidates. Candidates from each party expressed opinions {{on both sides of}} the personal privacy issue, and Kemp rejected the Times inquiry as [...] "beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate". His campaign was on an early positive course with many key early endorsements in New Hampshire, but Bush held the support of much of the Republican establishment in New York. Although he had an eclectic mix of supporters, Kemp's campaign began borrowing against anticipated Federal matching funds because it had quickly spent itself into the red, which may have been due to the use of expensive direct mail fundraising techniques. To offset his socially moderate stances, Kemp clarified his opposition to abortion, his support of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and his support for a stronger military than that favored by Secretary of State George Shultz. To position himself as Reagan's successor, Kemp called for Shultz's resignation based on claims that Shultz had neglected freedom fighters in Afghanistan and Nicaragua and had waffled on SDI. In an attempt to highlight his stands on key <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era</b> foreign policy initiatives, Kemp traveled in September 1987 to Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador to lobby the presidents of those nations against the Arias Peace Plan—a peace accord US conservatives felt too conciliatory to Central American communists. He was accompanied on the trip by 50-plus US conservative leaders.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era</b> followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{argue that}} Stephen Skowronek?s theory of {{political}} {{time can be}} used as analytic to better understand the rhetorical opportunities and constraints for presidents and presidential candidates. In particular, I look to Ronald Reagan as a case study: as a president who came {{on the heels of the}} end of FDR?s liberal <b>era,</b> <b>Reagan</b> set the tone for a new presidential regime, consisting of particular rhetorical and policy commitments that were all shaped through his neoliberal economic policy. After identifying the rhetorical hallmarks of the neoliberal era as constructed by Reagan, I analyze the rhetorical efforts of his successor, regime articulation president George H. W. Bush, to negotiate the changing domestic and international atmosphere within the rhetorical and policy constraints of Reagan?s neoliberalism. Finally, I identify and analyze the preemptive efforts of Bill Clinton and Ross Perot during the 1992 election as they attempted to renegotiate key aspects of Reagan?s rhetorical and policy commitments to win the presidency. The analysis of each individual?s rhetoric is aided by attention to both discursive and visual rhetoric: the rhetorical interiors and exteriors of regime discourse. The analysis of Reagan?s neoliberal regime emergence begins with the 1964 primary run against Barry Goldwater and continues through his presidency. Analysis of Bush begins with his 1980 primary election contest against Ronald Reagan and culminates in the 1992 election. Both Clinton and Perot were analyzed using stump speeches and advertisements from the primaries through the 1992 presidential election. For each individual, analysis of Time magazine covers provided visual confirmation or rejection of each rhetor?s rendition of neoliberal regime commitments. In the end, while Reagan was successful in establishing the rhetorical and policy commitments of the Neoliberal regime, Bush was unable to perform those commitments to the satisfaction of the base; as a result, Clinton?s rendition of the neoliberal regime, which he presented as a ?third way? during the 1992 presidential election, succeeded in winning the presidency...|$|R

Comparing Reagan and Obama, Van Jones wrote: [...] "Instead of [...] "government is the problem," [...] the president reminded us that we could all fall victim to sudden misfortune. Instead of pinning blame for every social problem on the size of government, the president recognized both individual responsibility and the role of community in giving each child the opportunity to succeed."

According to Rothkopf Obamas words sketched an America better than what the Founding Fathers of the United States imagined.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} identify and analyze the cultural work performed by the Hollywood youth narrative during the 1980 s and early nineties, a period that James Davison Hunter has characterized as a domestic "culture war. " This era of intense ideological confrontation between philosophical agendas loosely defined as "liberal" and "conservative," increasing social change, and social polarization and gender/sexual orientation backlash began with Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1980 and continued for twelve years through the presidency of George Bush, Sr. The dissertation examines the Hollywood youth narrative {{in the context of}} the family values debate and explicates its role in negotiating and resolving social conflict in a period of intense social change. The dissertation theorizes the historic and cultural function of the Hollywood youth narrative in "translating" complex social problems into generational and familial conflicts that can be easily, if superficially, resolved through conventional Hollywood genre narrative structures. In the specific instance of the family values debate, the dissertation analyzes how important low-budget Hollywood youth narratives both supported and challenged the traditional translation of social conflict into easily resolved generational conflict to reveal the complex social and economic factors behind the "crisis in the American family. " "The Fifties" played a critical role in debates regarding family life during the <b>Reagan</b> and Bush <b>era.</b> The dissertation explicates and contrasts the definitions of "the Fifties" and the use of 1950 s Hollywood film and television materials in the Hollywood youth narrative and Family Values Campaign and demonstrates how young filmmakers used the icons, images and narrative structures of important 1950 s Hollywood films to both support and challenge the socially conservative vision of American family life promoted by the Family Values Campaign and its New Right supporters. Through an analysis of Tim Hunter's River's Edge and Micheal Lehmann's Heathers, the dissertation demonstrates how two Hollywood youth narratives of the period reveal the fundamental contradictions between the New Right's idealized versions of American family values and the values of laissez faire capitalism, the often devastating impact of Reaganomics on the family as a site of social reproduction, and the troubled relationship between youth and consumer culture...|$|R

I'm trying to look for an album in 2012." [...] In June 2011, Lamar released [...] "Ronald <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era</b> (His Evils)", a cut from Section.80, featuring Wu-Tang Clan leader RZA. On July 2, 2011, Lamar released Section.80, his first independent album, to critical acclaim. The album features guest appearances from GLC, Colin Munroe, Schoolboy Q, and Ab-Soul, while the production was handled by Top Dawg in-house production team Digi+Phonics as well as Wyldfyer, Terrace Martin and J. Cole. Section.80 went on to sell 5,300 digital copies in its first week, without any television or radio coverage and received mostly positive reviews.|$|E
5000|$|The {{endpoint}} of the <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era</b> {{is usually}} {{seen as the}} election of Democrat Barack Obama in 2008. [...] Midterm Elections in 2010 and United States elections, 2014 seemed to cast doubt on a true end of the <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era</b> as conservative Republicans claimed two major victories claiming both the House and later the Senate. However, the sweeping policies pursued by the Obama Administration constituted a clear break with <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era</b> economics and social issues, as Americans became more supportive of social issues like gay marriage and the legalization of marijuana as well as showing more support for government involvement in healthcare and education. The recent election of President Donald Trump has stirred debate over whether his rise signifies the continued strength of the <b>Reagan</b> <b>Era</b> in American politics or represents a paradigm shift for American politics.|$|E
