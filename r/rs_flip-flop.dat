Each digit of a number would be stored as the state of a ring counter composed of several triodes. Whether vacuum tubes or thyratrons, the triodes were the most expensive part of a counter.

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) enables RFID {{readers to}} perform fully {{automatic}} wireless identification of objects labeled with RFID tags and is widely deployed to many applications, such as access control, electronic tickets and payment {{as well as}} electronic passports. This prevalence of RFID technology introduces various risks, in particular concerning the privacy of its users and holders. Despite the privacy risk, classical threats to authentication and identification systems must be considered to prevent the adversary from impersonating or copying (cloning) a tag. This thesis summarizes {{the state of the}} art in secure and privacy-preserving authentication for RFID tags with a particular focus on solutions based on Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). It presents advancements in the design, analysis and evaluation of secure and privacy-preserving authentication protocols for RFID systems and PUFs. Formalizing the security and privacy requirements on RFID systems is essential for the design of provably secure and privacy-preserving RFID protocols. However, existing RFID security and privacy models in the literature are often incomparable and in part do not reflect the capabilities of real-world adversaries. We investigate subtle issues such as tag corruption aspects that lead to the impossibility of achieving both mutual authentication and any reasonable notion of privacy in one of the most comprehensive security and privacy models, which is the basis of many subsequent works. Our results led to the refinement of this privacy model and were considered in subsequent works on privacy-preserving RFID systems. A promising approach to enhance the privacy in RFID systems without lifting the computational requirements on the tags are anonymizers. These are special devices that take off the computational workload from the tags. While existing anonymizer-based protocols are subject to impersonation and denial-of-service attacks, existing RFID security and privacy models do not include anonymizers. We present the first security and privacy framework for anonymizer-enabled RFID systems and two privacy-preserving RFID authentication schemes using anonymizers. Both schemes achieve several appealing features that were not simultaneously achieved by any previous proposal. The first protocol is very efficient for all involved entities, achieves privacy under tag corruption. It is secure against impersonation attacks and forgeries even if the adversary can corrupt the anonymizers. The second scheme provides for the first time anonymity and untraceability of tags against readers as well as secure tag authentication against collisions of malicious readers and anonymizers using tags that cannot perform public-key cryptography (i. e., modular exponentiations). The RFID tags commonly used in practice are cost-efficient tokens without expensive hardware protection mechanisms. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) promise to provide an effective security mechanism for RFID tags to protect against basic hardware attacks. However, existing PUF-based RFID authentication schemes are not scalable, allow only for a limited number of authentications and are subject to replay, denial-of-service and emulation attacks. We present two scalable PUF-based authentication schemes that overcome these problems. The first protocol supports tag and reader authentication, is resistant to emulation attacks and highly scalable. The second protocol uses a PUF-based key storage and addresses an open question on the feasibility of destructive privacy, i. e., the privacy of tags that are destroyed during tag corruption. The security of PUFs relies on assumptions on physical properties and is still under investigation. PUF evaluation results in the literature are difficult to compare due to varying test conditions and different analysis methods. We present the first large-scale security analysis of ASIC implementations of the five most popular electronic PUF types, including Arbiter, <b>Ring</b> Oscillator, SRAM, <b>Flip-Flop</b> and Latch PUFs. We present a new PUF evaluation methodology that allows a more precise assessment of the unpredictability properties than previous approaches and we quantify the most important properties of PUFs for their use in cryptographic schemes. PUFs have been proposed for various applications, including anti-counterfeiting and authentication schemes. However, only rudimentary PUF security models exist, limiting the confidence in the security claims of PUF-based security mechanisms. We present a formal security framework for PUF-based primitives, which has been used in subsequent works to capture the properties of image-based PUFs and in the design of anti-counterfeiting mechanisms and physical hash functions. ...|$|R

40|$|Logical <b>RS</b> <b>flip-flop</b> {{circuits}} are investigated {{once again}} in the context of discrete planar dynamical systems, but this time starting with simple bilinear (minimal) component models based on fundamental principles. The dynamics of the minimal model is described in detail, and shown to exhibit some of the expected properties, but not the chaotic regimes typically found in simulations of physical realizations of chaotic <b>RS</b> <b>flip-flop</b> circuits. Any physical realization of a chaotic logical circuit must necessarily involve small perturbations - usually with quite large or even nonexisting derivatives - and possibly some symmetry-breaking. Therefore, perturbed forms of the minimal model are also analyzed in considerable detail. It is proved that perturbed minimal models can exhibit chaotic regimes, sometimes associated with chaotic strange attractors, {{as well as some of}} the bifurcation features present in several more elaborate and less fundamentally grounded dynamical models that have been investigated in the recent literature. Validation of the approach developed is provided by some comparisons with (mainly simulated) dynamical results obtained from more traditional investigations.

40|$|Abstract: Gene {{regulatory}} networks (GRNs) form naturally predefined and optimised computational units envisioned {{to act as}} biohardware able {{to solve}} hard computational problems efficiently. This interplay of GRNs via sig-nalling pathways allows the consideration as well as implementation of interconnection-free and fault tolerant programmable computing agents. It has been quantitatively shown in an in vivo study that a reporter gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (gfp) can be switched {{between high and low}} expression states, thus mimicking a NAND gate and a <b>RS</b> <b>flip-flop.</b> This was accomplished by incorporating the N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) sensing lux operon from Vibrio fischeri along with a toggle switch in Escherichia coli. gfp expression was quantified using flow cytometry. The computational capacity of this approach is extendable by coupling several logic gates and flip-flops.

40|$|In microfluidics, {{a variety}} of {{platforms}} have emerged facilitating various physical effects for manipulating small volumes. Despite great functional diversity, most technologies are incapable of acting on direct feedback from the process liquid and instead require a sophisticated external control unit off-chip. Here, a microfluidic platform concept is demonstrated utilizing the volume phase transition of polymers via transistor-like components to actively switch between discrete fluid streams. Control is integrated at chip level for the first time, relying on information carried within the process liquid. Control commands are chemical signals such as solvent concentration, pH-value, or even salt. The developed logical modules can be interconnected independently through conclusive signal propagation, supporting an integrated circuit concept and large-scale integration.

40|$|Single-electronics {{circuits}} {{can detect}} charges {{much smaller than}} the charge of an electron. This enables phenomenally precise charge measurements but it also means that charged defects (often referred to as offset charges) can disrupt device operation. It has been suggested that large scale integration of single-electron devices could be used to construct fast logic circuits with a high device packing density. It small circuits, the offset charges are tuned away by applying voltages to a number of gates. In large circuits, it is impractical to tune the offset charges by coupling a gate to every device. Since the complete elimination of offset charges is probably impossible, offset-charge independent circuits must be developed. Here an offsetcharge independent <b>RS</b> <b>flip-flop</b> is described. This circuit is equivalent to a static RAM memory cell. Although the flip-flop is offset-charge independent, it does occasionally forget the information that was stored in it. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In recent year’s {{reversible}} logic {{has been}} considered as an important issue for designing low power digital circuits. This has led many researches to take reversible logic very seriously in building important circuits related to low power CMOS design, optical information processing, DNA computing. The main purposes of designing reversible logic are to decrease the number of gates, garbage outputs, and power consumption. Since the output of a sequential circuit depends {{not only on the}} present inputs but also on the past input conditions, the construction of sequential elements using reversible logic gates is quite complex than that of combinational circuits. In this paper, we have verified some of the reversible gates both using Cadence Virtuoso and H-Spice tools, we have also designed and simulated reversible logic based sequential elements such as D latch, D flip-flop, T flip-flop, <b>RS</b> <b>flip-flop</b> and compare them in terms of average power, number of garbage outputs and number of constant inputs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We propose an {{implementation}} of an asynchronous arbiter for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) which can reduce failures caused by metastability of <b>RS</b> <b>flip-flop</b> (RSFF). We adopt a binary tree structure of 2 -input arbiters, {{which is called}} a tree arbiter. The tree arbiter has hierarchical structure of 2 -input arbiters, in which each 2 -input arbiter selects {{one of the two}} requests progressively. The tree arbiter can prevent increase of latency and has also an advantage in throughput. The 2 -input arbiter has glitch killer circuits in order to prevent the failures caused by metastability of RSFF. However, it is impossible to implement the glitch killer circuits into FPGA. Therefore, we propose a method for preventing such failures applicable to FPGA. We also analyze the metastability of RSFF implemented with a crossed connection of logic blocks. Finally we generate a circuit model from implemented FPGA in order to take place an analysis by SPICE. I...|$|E
