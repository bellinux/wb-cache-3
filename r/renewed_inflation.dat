5000|$|By {{contrast}} to the mild economic upheaval, the political upheaval was enormous. Socialist Leon Blum, leading the Popular Front, brought together Socialists and Radicals to become Prime Minister from 1936 to 1937; {{he was the first}} Jew and the first Socialist to lead France. The Communists in the Chamber of Deputies (parliament) voted to keep the government in power, and generally supported the government's economic policies, but rejected its foreign policies. The Popular Front passed numerous labor reforms, which increased wages, cut working hours to 40 hours with overtime illegal, And provided many lesser benefits to the working class, such as mandatory two-week paid vacations. However, <b>renewed</b> <b>inflation</b> canceled the gains in wage rates, unemployment did not fall, and economic recovery was very slow. Historians agree that the Popular Front was a failure in terms of economics, foreign policy, and long-term stability. [...] "Disappointment and failure," [...] says Jackson, [...] "was the legacy of the Popular Front." [...] There is general agreement that at first the Popular Front created enormous excitement and expectations on the left—including very large scale sitdown strikes—but in the end it {{failed to live up to}} its promise. In the long run, however, later Socialists took some inspiration from the attempts of the Popular Front to set up a welfare state.|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} half of 1990 the economy was marked by healthy growth under {{sustainable}} conditions. Demand and output showed <b>renewed</b> strength, while <b>inflation</b> remained stable and the current account equilibrium was maintained. Industrial output has been progressing steeply since last autumn, giving stimulus also to other sectors of the economy. Exports are rising unabated at double-digit annual rates despite an upward tendency in the effective Schilling exchange rate. Demand has shifted towards Austria's traditional markets in Western Europe, particularly Germany, while deliveries to the East are lagging behind. Beneficial effects from the liberalisation process will materialize only gradually. Private consumption rebounded strongly in early 1990, with demand concentrating on durables. Raw material prices have eased thereby offsetting the stronger upward drift in wage costs. The annual rise in the consumer price index has been unchanged at 3. 1 percent for the last three months.

40|$|Despite globalization, liberalized {{trade and}} growing global income, billions {{of people are}} {{underemployed}} and condemned to life-long poverty. Over {{two thirds of the}} world’s poor reside in rural regions. Inequality in living standards between developed and developing regions remains a major challenge. Rising inequality has been tied to a declining terms of trade against commodities and towards manufactured goods. The recent increase in commodity prices has aided growth in developing countries, but it has also triggered <b>renewed</b> concern over <b>inflation</b> and access to key commodities. Standard responses to inflation are tighter monetary policy in the industrialized world, and devalued currencies with price controls in developing countries. Such policies will continue to aggravate global imbalances, and stymie long term investment in commodity production. Nicholas Kaldor in 1964 suggested a bold new international monetary system to equilibrate growth between agriculture and industry, and remove bottlenecks to industrialization. Specifically he proposed the creation of a ‘sound money’ international reserve backed by a basket of stored commodities, tying reserve liquidity to international world trade. His proposed commodity reserve currency would not only balance economic progress between regions, but also mitigate global imbalances. This paper argues that such an ambitious global macro proposal could be usefully studied to provide insights into current policy debates on the Millennium Development Goals, a new international monetary order, new global partnerships in resource security, and ways to stabilizing cost-push inflation. price stability, commodity reserve currency, commodity prices, international inflation...|$|R

40|$|Although {{circumstances}} are propitious {{for a modest}} expansion in output, business confidence is low and there is as yet no indication {{of the increase in}} investment necessary for a sustained longer-term recovery. Given the traumatic shocks of the past three years, industry may be slow to respond to relatively modest changes in the exchange rate and in the level of domestic demand, and more substantial pump-priming may be needed to make any impact on current unemployment levels. However, the high level of import propensity means that even a moderately-large growth in demand may not encourage significant growth in output and employment, and may instead lead to the familiar cycle of balance of payments problems, sterling depreciation and higher import prices, and <b>renewed</b> <b>inflation.</b> World economic trends are also considered in this brief paper...|$|E

40|$|Volcanism at Mount Etna (Italy) {{has been}} {{observed}} for millennia and inspired ancient mythologies as well as scientific thought through countless generations. Yetmuch of {{our understanding of the}} way this volcano works stems fromstudies of the past 20 years, and in particular from strengthened monitoring since the late 1980 s. In addition, the eruptive activity of Etna has undergone significant changes during the past 13 years, and these have led to an improved understanding {{of the relationship between the}} plumbing system of the volcano and instability of its eastern to southern f lanks. Following the end of the 1991 – 1993 eruption, a new eruptive cycle began, which so far has produced about 0. 23 km 3 of lavas and pyroclastics (dense-rock equivalent). The cycle evolved frominitial recharging of the plumbing system and inf lation, followed by powerful summit eruptions and slow spreading of the eastern to southern f lanks, to a sequence of f lank eruptions accompanied by accelerated f lank displacement. Structurally, the volcanic system has become increasingly unstable during this period. Volcanological, geophysical and geochemical data allow the cause–effect and feedback relationships between magma accumulation below the volcano, f lank instability, and the shift from continuous summit activity to episodic f lank eruptions to be investigated. In this scenario, the growth of magma storage areas at a depth of 3 – 5 km below sea level exerts pressure against those f lank sectors prone to displacement, causing them to detach from the stable portions of the volcanic edifice. Geochemical data indicate that magma remains stored belowthe volcano, even during phases of intense eruptive activity, thus causing a net volumetric increase that is accommodated by f lank displacement. Instability can be enhanced by the forceful uprise ofmagma through the f lanks, as in 2001, when the f irst f lank eruption of the current eruptive cycle took place. Subsequent f lank eruptions in 2002 – 2003 and 2004 – 2004, on the other hand, were, at least in part, facilitated by the opening of fractures at the head of moving f lank sector, although the eruptions were significantly dissimilar from one another. <b>Renewed</b> <b>inflation</b> of the volcano after the 2004 – 2005 eruption, continued displacement of the unstable f lank sector, and gradual resumption of summit activity in late- 2005, demonstrate that the same feedback mechanisms continue to be active, and the Etna system remains highly unstable. The evolution of earlier eruptive cycles shows that a return to a state of relative stability is only possible once a voluminous f lank eruption effectively drains the magmatic plumbing system...|$|E
40|$|The Yellowstone caldera, {{like many}} other late Quaternary calderas of the world, {{exhibits}} dramatic unrest. Between 1923 and 1985, {{the center of the}} Yellowstone caldera rose nearly 1 m along an axis between its two resurgent domes (Pelton and Smith, 1979; Dzurisin and Yamashita, 1987). From 1985 until 1995 – 1996, the caldera subsided at about 2 cm/yr (Dzurisin and others, 1990). More recent radar-interferometry studies show <b>renewed</b> <b>inflation</b> of the northeastern resurgent dome between 1995 and 1996; this inflation migrated to the southwestern resurgent dome from 1996 to 1997 (Wicks and others, 1998). We extend this record back in time using dated geomorphic evidence of postglacial Yellowstone Lake shorelines around the northern shore and Yellowstone River levels in the outlet area. We date these shorelines using carbon-isotopic and archeological methods. Following Meyer and Locke (1986) and Locke and Meyer (1994), we identify the modern shoreline as S 1 (1. 9 ± 0. 3 m above the lake-gage datum), map paleoshoreline terraces S 2 to S 6, and infer that the prominent shorelines were cut during intracaldera-uplift episodes that produced rising water levels. Doming along the caldera axis reduces the gradient of the Yellowstone River from Le Hardys Rapids to the Yellowstone Lake outlet and ultimately causes an increase in lake level. The 1923 – 1985 doming is part of a longer uplift episode that has reduced the Yellowstone River gradient to a “pool” with a drop of only 0. 25 m over most of this 5 -km reach. We also present new evidence that doming has caused submergence of some Holocene lake and river levels. Shoreline S 5 is about 14 m above datum and estimated to be ~ 12. 6 ka because it postdates a large hydrothermal-explosion deposit from the Mary Bay area that occurred ~ 13 ka. S 4 formed about 8 m above datum ~ 10. 7 ka as dated by archeology and 14 C and was accompanied by offset on the Fishing Bridge fault. About 9. 7 ka, the Yellowstone River eroded the “S-meander,” followed by a ~ 5 -m rise in lake level to S 2. The lowest generally recognizable shoreline is S 2; it is ~ 5 m above datum (3 m above S 1) and is ~ 8 ka, as dated {{on both sides of the}} outlet. Yellowstone Lake and the Yellowstone River near Fishing Bridge were 5 – 6 m below their present level about 4 – 3 ka, as indicated by 14 C ages from submerged beach deposits, drowned valleys, and submerged Yellowstone River gravels. Thus, the lake in the outlet region has been below or near its present level for about half the time since a 1 -km-thick ice cap melted from the Yellowstone Lake basin about 16 ka. The amplitude of two rises in lake and river level can be estimated based on the altitude of Le Hardys Rapids, indicators of former lake and river levels, and reconstruction of the river gradient from the outlet to Le Hardys Rapids. Both between ~ 9. 5 ka and ~ 8. 5 ka, and after ~ 3 ka, Le Hardys Rapids was uplifted about 8 m above the outlet at Fishing Bridge, suggesting a cyclic deformation process. Older rises in lake level are suggested by locations where the ~ 10. 7 -ka S 4 truncates older shorelines and where valleys were truncated by the ~ 12. 6 -ka S 5 shoreline. Using these controls, a plot of lake level through time shows five to seven millennial-scale oscillations since 14. 4 ka. Major cycles of inflation and deflation are thousands of years long. Le Hardys Rapids has twice been uplifted ~ 8 m relative to the lake outlet. These two locations span only the central 25 percent of the historic caldera doming; so if we use historic doming as a model, total projected uplift would be ~ 32 m. This “heavy breathing” of the central part of the Yellowstone caldera may reflect a combination of several possible processes: magmatic inflation; tectonic stretching and deflation; and hydrothermal-fluid sealing and inflation, followed by cracking of the seal, pressure release, and deflation. Over the entire postglacial period, subsidence has balanced or slightly exceeded uplift as shown by older shorelines that descend toward the caldera axis. We favor a hydrothermal mechanism for inflation and deflation because it provides for both inflation and deflation with little overall change. Other mechanisms, such as inflation by magma intrusion and deflation by extensional stretching, require two separate geologic processes to alternate and yet result in no net elevation change. In addition to inflation and deflation, new LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data demonstrate previously unrecognized local deformation along the north shore of Yellowstone Lake. The newly recognized Fishing Bridge fault shows a progressive increase in offset from 0. 5 m for the ~ 8 -ka S 2 to perhaps 5 m for the ~ 12. 6 -ka S 5. Uplift of the Storm Point hydrothermal center tilts shorelines westward as much as 6 m/km. A local anticline has as much as 3 m of relief in 0. 5 km. LIDAR data also show the Mary Bay hydrothermal-explosion debris has a surface relief of about 1 m over 100 m, and that it overlies S 5. 5 and S 6 shorelines, but not S 5. Although the postglacial deformation record does not indicate voluminous magma accumulation or other large-scale eruption precursors, strong local deformation associated with hydrothermal centers does suggest the possibility of future hydrothermal explosions and associated hazards...|$|E
