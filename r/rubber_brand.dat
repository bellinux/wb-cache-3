40|$|The vials {{used for}} the {{preparation}} of breath samples for automated solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrom-etry analysis are crimped with septa. These septa often emit specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) confounding the measurement results of breath samples. In the current paper, 14 different brands of magnetic caps with silicone–polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), butyl–PTFE, or butyl rubber septa were tested. The total emission of septa over a 4 h period was also evaluated. The tested septa emitted 39 different compounds, which are mainly hydrocarbons, alcohols, and ketones. Acetone and toluene are the most abundant out-gassing products. The concentration of acetone was {{in the range from}} 55 to 694 ppb for butyl–PTFE septum (brand 14) and butyl <b>rubber</b> (<b>brand</b> 10), respectively. The measured toluene amount was 69 – 1323 ppb for the septum brand 14 and brand 8 (silicone–PTFE), respectively. Generally, the butyl rubber septa released higher amounts of contaminants in comparison to the silicone ones...|$|E

40|$|The {{dimensional}} accuracy of four duplicating materials, including one brand of agar reversible hydrocolloid, one <b>brand</b> of polyether <b>rubber,</b> and two <b>brands</b> of polyvinyl siloxane (addition silicone) rubber was studied. A standard stainless steel specimen of 76 x 76 x 9. 5 mm was made. Vertical and horizontal grooves {{were made on}} the specimen as reference marks. The horizontal grooves were in different depths and widths. The duplicating materials were prepared and poured over the standard die to make a negative likeness. These negatives were poured with the same investment material. Twelve investment specimens were measured for accuracy and detail reproduction with a Talysurf finish analyzer. Results of this study indicated that polyvinyl siloxane and polyether rubbers are superior in accuracy compared to the agar reversible hydrocolloid. No significant differences in detail reproduction were noted {{in any of the}} duplicating materials tested...|$|R
