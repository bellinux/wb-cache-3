40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a superlattice infrared photodetector, which has a 20 -period GaAs/AlGaAs superlattice embedded between two AlGaAs current blocking layers are investigated. We propose a model to explain the conduction of dark current and photocurrent. In particular, the interesting feature of this detector, which can also be explained by our model, is bias redistribution due to the background photocurrent. With the background radiation incident upon the detector, the blocking layers are tilted up for 126 meV at zero bias. The electrons are all confined by the tilt-up blocking layers and cannot tunnel through them. As the external bias increases, 70 % of the voltage is added on the <b>rear</b> <b>blocking</b> layer and attempts to decrease its barrier height. Especially at- 0. 18 V, the barrier is flat and the barrier height is 16. 5 meV higher than {{the bottom of the}} second miniband. In this case, only those photoelectrons with high enough energy can pass the blocking layer. As the external bias increases up to- 0. 33 V, the <b>rear</b> <b>blocking</b> layer is tilted down for 105 meV. The blocking layer seems to be transparent to all photoelectrons to tunnel through. In addition, the photo responsivity due to the short wavelength excitation indicates that the photoelectrons do have the inelastic relaxation of the energy along the growth direction...|$|R

40|$|AbstractON and OFF {{pathways}} separately relay {{increment and decrement}} luminance {{signals from}} retinal bipolar cells to cortex. ON-OFF retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are activated via synaptic inputs onto bistratified dendrites localized in the ON and OFF regions of the inner plexiform layer. Postnatal maturational processes convert bistratifying ON-OFF RGCs to monostratifying ON and OFF RGCs. Although visual deprivation influences refinement of higher visual centers, no previous studies suggest that light regulates either {{the development of the}} visual-evoked signaling in retinal ON and OFF pathways, nor pruning of bistratified RGC dendrites. We find that dark <b>rearing</b> <b>blocks</b> both the maturational loss of ON-OFF responsive RGCs and the pruning of dendrites. Thus, in retina, there is a previously unrecognized, pathway-specific maturation that is profoundly affected by visual deprivation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} the major dynamic parameters as well as the EMG activation of muscles in a sprint start as the first derivative of sprint velocity. The subject of the analysis was block velocity, the production of force in the front and <b>rear</b> starting <b>blocks,</b> the block acceleration in the first two steps and the electromyographic activity (EMG) of the following muscles: the erector spinae muscle, gluteus maximus muscle, rectus femoris muscle, vastus medialis muscle, vastus lateralis muscle, biceps femoris muscle and gastrocnemius–medialis muscle. One international-class female sprinter participated in the experiment. She performed eight starts in constant laboratory conditions. The 3 -D kinematic analysis was made using a system of nine Smart-e 600 cameras operating at a frame rate of 60 Hz. Dynamic parameters were established by means of two separate force platforms to which the starting blocks were fixed. A 16 -channel electromyograph was used to analyse electromyographic activity (EMG). It was established that the block velocity depended on the absolute force produced in the front and <b>rear</b> starting <b>blocks</b> and that it was 2. 84 ± 0. 21 m. s- 1. The maximal force on the <b>rear</b> and front <b>blocks</b> was 628 ± 34 N and 1023 ± 30 N, respectively. In view of the total impulse (210 ± 11 Ns) the force production/time ratio in the <b>rear</b> and front <b>blocks</b> was 34 %: 66 %. The erector spinae muscle, vastus lateralis muscle and gastrocnemius–medialis muscle generate the efficiency of the start. The block acceleration in the first two steps primarily depends on the activation of the gluteus maximus muscle, rectus femoris muscle, biceps femoris muscle and gastrocnemius–medialis muscle. A sprint start is a complex motor stereotype requiring a high degree of integration of the processes of central movement regulation and an optimal level of biomotor abilities...|$|R

40|$|The study {{analysed}} and identifi ed {{the major}} kinematic {{parameters of the}} phases of sprint start and block acceleration that infl uence the results of sprint running. The biomechanical measurements and kinematic analysis were performed on the best world’s best sprinters during his preparation for the European Athletics Championship in Geteborg 2006. In this competition Matic Osovnikar won the bronze medal in a 100 - metre run set the Slovenian national record with 10. 14 s. The kinematic parameters of the sprint start were established {{on the basis of}} a 2 -D kinematic analysis, using a high-speed camera with a frequency of 200 F/s. The measurements of block acceleration were made by means of the OPTO TRACK technology and an infra-red photo cell system. The athlete performed fi ve, 20 m low-start sprints in constant and controlled measurement conditions. The subject of the study was the set position from the point of view of the height of the total body centre of gravity (TBCG), the block time at the front and <b>rear</b> <b>blocks,</b> block velocity, the block face angle, the velocity of the TBCG in the fi rst three metres and the kinematic parameters of block acceleration in the fi rst ten steps. The study showed the following were the key performance factors in the two phases of sprint running: medium start block distance, block velocity, low block face angles, fi rst step length, low vertical rise in the TBCG in the fi rst three metres of block acceleration, contact phase/fl ight phase index in the fi rst ten steps and the optimal ratio between the length and frequency of steps...|$|R
