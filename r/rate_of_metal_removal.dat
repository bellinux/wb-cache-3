40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is removal of copper, nickel, {{chromium}} and zinc from their model solution by precipitation and adsorption processes where metal ions are adsorbed onto the surface of materials. Inorganic granular material (Slovakite) with high content of MgO. CaCO 3 was used in this study. Slovakite proved to be efficient for copper, nickel and chromium removal. Langmuir´s and Freundlich´s isotherm models adequately describe adsorption process from aqueous solution. Removal efficiency of metals, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> and bond strength between Slovakite and metal was investigated. Slovakite is an alkaline adsorbent; therefore, pH value increases with concentration of Slovakite in solution.

Influence of operating parameters such as electrode material, current density, soil temperature and inter-electrode spacing is investigated. A maximum of 61. 8 removal of cadmium is achieved using titanium electrodes (under natural conditions simulating rain water present in soil). Removal efficiency improves {{with the increase in}} current density and soil temperature. About 73 of copper removal is achieved within 20 hours when the soil temperature is constant at 29 Â°C as compared to 32 removal at 18 Â°C. <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> increases as the inter-electrode spacing decreases to 10 cm, which demonstrates the highest copper removal of 88. 1 at a current density of 8. 9 mA/cm 2.

A maximum energy consumption of 5 kWh/m 3 of soil means the process can be economically scaled up.

40|$|Hard metals can {{be defined}} as {{composites}} containing extremely hard ceramic particles in a softer metal matrix. They are characterised by their extreme hardness and brittleness. Given the strength of these materials, their working presents a considerable challenge for which mechanical methods are often insufficient. The cause of this lies in the very high cost of machining tools and the long machining times involved which make such operations on economic. Electrochemical machining(ECM) offers the potential for high precision micromachining. Among its advantages are its ability to shape materials without imposing thermal or mechanical stress. The anodic dissolution of the workpiece depends solely on its electrochemical properties. Mechanical properties such as hardness or ductility have no effect. This makes ECM an attractive alternative machining process for materials difficult to work by mechanical means. In the present study, a specialised operation for micro-patterning <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> carbides was studied in which an electrolyte jet was used in a closed circuit electrolyte loop(Jet-ECM). A special feature of this technology is that the current is restricted to the zone on which the jet impinges. This ensures a very localised removal of material. Even complex structures can be machined in this way using continuous DC current and so high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> can be achieved in comparison to processes using pulsed current. In this work, metal was selectively removed from the surface of tungsten carbide to form point or line microstructures. In the former case, there was no movement of the jet nozzle. In the latter case, linear or multiaxial tool movement was used. Beyond this, by creating overlapping lines, a three-dimensional pattern could be formed on the test material...|$|R
40|$|Native Octopus vulgaris {{hemocyanin}} (Hc) {{reacts with}} cyanide stepwise. The first step involves {{the formation of}} a complex HcCN with O 2 displacement. This complex reacts further with cyanide causing the removal of one copper ion from the active site. The same reaction sequence occurs for the extraction of the second metal ion. The formation of the HcCN complex and the removal of the first and the second copper ion can be differentiated according to the KCN concentration. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> is slightly affected by KCN concentration. The kinetics are dominated by site-site interactions. The kinetic curves show only slight differences when the protein is in the 11 S or 49 S aggregation states, suggesting that the site-site interactions are restricted mainly within the 11 S structure. A kinetic model describing the removal of the first copper ion is proposed assuming that the 11 S component (MW 250, 000) is an annular-shaped structure made by five equivalent functional subunits (MW 50, 000).

This arouses concern over the potential adverse effects of a commonly used antibiotic, oxytetracycline (OTC), on plants used for soil remediation and possible stimulation of antibiotic resistance genes in soils. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate different rates (0, 1, 5, and 25 mg kg(- 1)) and frequencies (one single high and daily low application) of OTC addition to soil on phytoremediation of a heavy metal contaminated soil by Sedum plumbizincicola and/or Medicago sativa (alfalfa). After 90 days both Cd and Zn were substantially removed by phytoextraction into S. plumbizincicola shoots especially at the high OTC (25 mg kg(- 1)) treatment which also led to inhibition of antioxidative enzyme activities in both plant species. Soil microbial activity decreased significantly {{with the addition of}} OTC, and this was ameliorated by planting alfalfa and S. plumbizincicola together.

40|$|As global populations {{grow and}} become more demanding, {{resource}} limitation and the treatment of industrially generated waste constitute an escalating dual challenge. There is, however, a growing awareness of the potential of waste streams as a resource. Metal removal and recovery employing currently available physicochemical techniques are expensive, energy intensive and often unsuitable in cases of voluminous effluents containing complexing organics and low metal concentration. Immobilised biofilms {{have the potential to}} simultaneously biodegrade organics whilst in parallel immobilising and recovering metals: the focus of this research. In this study, the maximum metal uptake was 24. 60 mg/g and 5. 23 mg/g for Zn (II) and Mn (II), respectively, for an initial metal concentration of 80 mg/L. The biosorption of binary system was found to be competitive in nature; Zn (II) removal decreased up to 87 % whereas the Mn (II) removal decreased up to 66 %. In order to improve the potential of biofilms as means of recovering resources, the mechanism by which they immobilise metals was investigated. This is the first study to investigate the potential of ultraviolet (UV) as an analytical tool for determining pollutant removal mechanisms by biofilms. A comparative assessment of chemical (sodium azide) and physical (UV) methods of cell inactivation was undertaken to determine the relative contributions of passive and metabolically active processes on organic and metal removal. Industrial effluents typically contain both organics and metals; therefore, the effect of organics on the metal removal ability of biofilms, which is poorly understood, was elucidated to help develop biologically-based treatment strategies for treating chemically mixed wastes. Chelation had by far the most inhibitory impact on the passive metal removal mechanism, reducing the zinc biosorption by 60 % in fully chelated Zn-EDTA complex system. In contrast, nonionic surfactants were the only organics that increased the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>removal,</b> whilst having no detectable impact on biosorption capacity. Hence, they are potentially good candidates for reducing metal-organic competition, assisting metal recovery in the presence of organics. The recovery of biosorbed Zn (II) from microbial biofilms using sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate (SDBS) surfactant was another novel aspect of this study. This achieved high and stable Zn (II) recovery over four successive biosorption-recovery cycles. Moreover, 94 % of the Zn (II) was cumulatively recovered over six successive wash cycles, confirming that SDBS is a potential zinc recovery agent for biofilms. The findings from this study have established that the employment of biofilms to remediate chemically mixed effluents is a favourable potential alternative to energy demanding physical and chemical treatment options. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a growing sulphate reducing bacteria consortium for Sr 2 +, Co 2 + and Cs+ removal from solution in a batch sulphidogenic bioreactor was investigated. Metal removal by the growing bacterial consortium, and microbial culture growth and metabolic activities (biological sulphate removal) were continuously monitored in the bioreactors over {{the duration of the}} treatment period. On the other hand, diversity changes within the bacterial consortium before and after bioreactor operation (28 days) were performed using the partial 16 S rRNA fingerprinting method. In the original bacterial consortium, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus sp. were the dominant bacterial species. However, the presence of Sr 2 +, Co 2 + and Cs+ in the growth media, resulted in the emergence of new bacterial species belonging to the Citrobacter, Paenibacillus, and Enterococcus and Stenotrophomonas genera, respectively. The Citrobacter and Paenibacillus sp. demonstrated high tolerance towards the presence of the divalent cations, Sr 2 + and Co 2 +, respectively, while the Enterococcus and Stenotrophomonas sp., demonstrated Cs+ high tolerance. The bacterial growth and sulphate removal rate were significantly decreased at initial metal ion concentrations ≥ 100 mg/L. The toxicity and inhibitory effects of the metals on the present SRB consortium was observed in the order Sr>Co>Cs. The metal uptake capacity (qτ) of the bacterial consortium decreased with increasing initial metal concentration, and complete Sr 2 +, Co 2 + and Cs+ removal was observed at initial metal concentrations ≤ 75 mg/L. Overall, the present SRB consortium demonstrated a superior Sr 2 + removal capacity (qmax= 405 mg/g), and the least for Cs 2 +, where qmax = 192 mg/g. The present SRB culture exhibited a superior Sr+ and Cs+ binding capacity, compared to other studies in literature. Results from Sr 2 +, Co 2 + and Cs+ biosorption kinetics indicate that initial concentration and solution pH played a vital role in determining the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> kinetics. The experimental data was successfully analysed by the pseudo-second-order rate model, demonstrating that chemisorption is the main rate limiting step for the removal of Sr 2 +, Co 2 + and Cs+ from solution. In this study, the adsorption behaviour of protons and of Sr 2 +, Co 2 + and Cs+ onto the bacterial consortium cell surfaces was evaluated under anaerobic conditions as a function of pH (4 - 10), ionic strength (0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 1 M) and temperature (25, 50 and 75 °C). Acid-base titrations of the bacterial suspension indicated that the titration data could be adequately described by a four site non-electrostatic model, with pKa values of 4. 41, 6. 69, 8. 10 and 10. The Sr 2 +, Co 2 + and Cs+ adsorption data could be fitted with a two site non-electrostatic model, involving the type 1 and 2 sites (carboxylic and phosphoryl sites). Increasing the ionic strength had a negative effect on the adsorption of metal ions from solution. There was no observed temperature dependence on the adsorption of Co 2 + and Cs+ from solution. In summary, results obtained in this study have shown that the processes involved in microbial Sr 2 +, Co 2 + and Cs+ removal from contaminated sources is a direct function of the microbial characteristics and efficiency, mass transfer and surface complexation effects under varying environmental conditions. One important goal to be achieved in future studies will be the determination of the intrinsic stability constants and the structure of the formed metal complexes species. These constants can be used directly in risk assessment programs. Thesis (PhD(Eng)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Chemical Engineeringunrestricte...|$|E

Czern.) {{and winter}} wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown for 50 days in pots of {{contaminated}} soil was studied with application of elemental sulphur (S) and EDTA. Sulphur {{was added to}} the soil at 5 rates (0 - 160 mmol kg(- 1)) before planting, and EDTA was added in solution at 4 rates (0 - 8 mmol kg(- 1)) after 40 days of plant growth. Additional pots were established with the same <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> S and EDTA but without plants to monitor soil pH and CaCl 2 -extractable heavy metals. The highest application <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> S acidified the soil from pH 7. 1 to 6. 0. Soil extractable Pb and Zn and shoot uptake of Pb and Zn increased as soil pH decreased. Both S and EDTA increased soil extractable Pb and Zn and shoot Pb and Zn uptake. EDTA was more effective than S in increasing soil extractable Pb and Zn, and the two amendments combined had a synergistic effect, raising extractable Pb to > 1000 and Zn to > 6 times their concentrations in unamended control soil. Wheat had higher shoot yields than Indian mustard and increasing application <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> both S and EDTA reduced the shoot dry matter yields of both plant species to as low as about half those of unamended controls. However, Indian mustard hyperaccumulated Pb in all EDTA treatments tested except the treatment with no S applied, and the maximum shoot Pb concentration was 7100 mg kg(- 1) under the highest application <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> S and EDTA combined. Wheat showed similar trends, but hyperaccumulation (1095 mg kg(- 1)) occurred only at the highest <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> S and EDTA combined.

40|$|Passive {{treatment}} of mine water uses {{chemical and biological}} processes to decrease metal concentrations and neutralize acidity. Compared to conventional chemical treatment, passive methods generally require more land area, but use less costly reagents, and require less operational attention and maintenance. Currently, the three most common types of passive technologies are aerobic ponds and wetlands, anoxic limestone drains (ALDs), and reducing and alkalinity-producing systems (RAPS). Aerobic wetlands promote mixed oxidation and hydrolysis reactions, and are effective when the raw mine water is net alkaline. Anoxic limestone drains generate bicarbonate alkalinity {{and can be used}} to convert water that is net acidic into netalkaline water for treatment in aerobic ponds and wetlands. RAPS promote reducing conditions and limestone dissolution. They extend the concept of ALDs by pre-treating the water before it contacts the limestone, to eliminate dissolved oxygen and reduce dissolved ferric iron to ferrous iron. These systems can generally be used to treat more acidic water than ALDs, and can better treat water with significant aluminum concentrations. In passive treatment systems, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> and acidity <b>removal</b> and alkalinity generation have been developed empirically. Aerobic wetlands remove iron from alkaline water at <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> 10 to 20 g m & 2 d & 1.

40|$|The {{vibratory}} {{dynamics of}} the grinding process performed by a robot arm is studied in this thesis. The robotic grinding process under development at Hydro-Québec’s research institute (IREQ) for maintenance operations on hydropower equipment is a high material removal rate task used for profiling large parts and complex geometries. The profiling application is unlike conventional grinding in which, {{a thin layer of}} material is removed as a finishing procedure. One major hurdle for this technology is the significant vibrations inherent to the process. However, the maneuverability that the robot brings into the operations makes it, sometimes, the only practical solution for machining in hard-to-reach areas. The main features of the robotic tool holder which affect its vibratory dynamics, i. e. the robot’s high compliance and its configuration-dependent dynamics are studied. The objective is to investigate vibrations and instability based upon appropriate understandings of the instantaneous {{dynamics of the}} material removal process performed by the articulated multi-body robot arm. Since vibrational instability in material removal is caused by the interactions between the dynamics of the cutting process and the tool holder’s structural dynamics, two lines of research are conducted accordingly. An experimental investigation substantiated by numerical simulations is carried out on the steady vibratory dynamics of the process. Due to the compliance of the robot arm, material removal is found governed by vibro-impacts, occurring mainly at the spindle’s rotational frequency, between the cutter and the workpiece. The “impact-cutting” behavior is characterized through angular analysis of the cyclic impacting oscillations. The measured instantaneous rotational frequency of the spindle during robotic grinding is mapped into a representation suited for monitoring the dynamic evolutions in the impacting regime. The “impact-cutting map” was also used to validate a plausible hypothesis for uniform disk wear when exhibiting an impact-cutting operation. The measured drop in the instantaneous angular speed, as a transient which is excited impulsively by the cutting impacts, was found well correlated to grinding power. The practical significance of this latter result is considered as to integrate the real-time measurement of the speed drop and the number of impacts per spindle revolutions into the robot control strategy in order to improve the metal removal estimation. In a following step, an impact-cutting model for metal removal was used to estimate the grinding power required for a grinding task performed by the robot. Constant coefficients of the model were first identified experimentally. Robotic grinding tests were performed while setting the target grinding power in the control strategy based upon the impact-cutting model. It was demonstrated that a uniform cut with a target <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> and a target cutting depth can be achieved in presence of stabilized impacting oscillations. The waviness amplitude on the finished surface is found to be much smaller than the amplitude of vibro impact oscillations. The knowledge about vibro-impact oscillations present in the process helps improving the strategy of controlled material removal rate employed in the robot control strategy. The iterative procedure of grinding/profile scanning to reach the desired tolerance level on the surface can be improved based upon the estimation of the material removal rate by the impact-cutting model. The limit of stable impact cutting due to regenerative chatter was investigated next. The investigation resulted into understanding that the high compliance of the robot arm locates the problem of robotic grinding regenerative chatter on the far upper right of the first lobe on the stability chart. In this region, the limit of stable operation is defined by very large gain values. This is different from traditional machining which is located inside the “lobes zone” on the stability lobes diagram. The cyclic impacting dynamics of material removal is invoked to investigate instability in this region. The limit of stable operation is identified from numerical simulations of impact-cutting. The boundary is found to be very close to the margin predicted using the traditional approach for regenerative chatter analysis. It is concluded that the large gain is typical for robotic grinding. The impacting dynamics of material removal due to robot compliance must be considered to understand such large gain values, never occurring in conventional grinding. Experiments are performed to substantiate the new understanding regarding the problem of regenerative chatter in robotic grinding. A second line of research was focused on the robotic tool holder’s structural dynamics. The goal was to provide a modeling tool for an investigation of the effect of robot’s configuration-dependent dynamics on vibrations and instability in the process. A 6 -DOF multi-body dynamic model was developed for the robot manipulator. Experimental modal analysis on the robot structure was used to validate the mode shapes and natural frequencies predicted by the model. A discussion is provided about how the developed modeling tool can serve an investigation of mode-coupling chatter in robotic machining. The study of vibrations and instability in this thesis contribute into understanding the vibratory dynamics that govern the robotic grinding process. Further development of the robotized technology for precision profiling of industrial parts relies on such understanding bases...|$|E

Another mode <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> is bioprecipitation through the precipitant ligands (inorganic phosphate, sulfide) generated by the organism. The metal may be precipitated as highly insoluble metal phosphate or sulfide (8 - 10). In this paper, we have presented the utility of a very simple biological system i. e., an E. coli expressing multiple copies of PhoN (acid phosphatase from S. enterica subsp. typhi) and having high specific activity for bioprecipitating cadmium from aqueous solution (Fig. 1) Precipitation kinetics and pH dependence were also studied. An attempt was also made to draw a correlation between enzyme activity at different pH and the corresponding <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> precipitation.

30|$|As shown from Fig.  4 a, both 60 # and 180 # {{grit size}} {{abrasives}} have good <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> ability. 28  μm <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> was ground away {{by using a}} 60 # grit size abrasive; and 20  μm more in thickness was removed by adding one more step of the grinding process using the 180 # grit size abrasive. However, the 280 # and 400 # grit size abrasives have relatively lower <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> ability, they are used for the surface finish process; only 8  μm in thickness <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> was ground away by using a 280 # grit size abrasive for 5  min plus another 5  min grinding by a 400 # grit size abrasive. The machine power also has a large influence on the <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> behavior. As illustrated in Fig.  4 b, when using same grit size abrasives and same grinding procedures, a maximum <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> rate was seen with the intermediate power (60 %). A lower machine power (30 %) gave 25  μm <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> compared to 48  μm at 60 %, at 90 % power the <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> dropped to 34  μm. Higher machine power introduced higher grinding force. When grinding with a lower machine power (grinding force), the abrasive grits slide and rub over the material surface instead of effective cutting and ploughing. Using a higher machine power (grinding force) increased friction between the abrasive and the workpiece surface as well as wear of abrasive grits. Figure  4 c shows the significant improvement <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> ability by using grinding lubrication; the removed thickness was more than doubled (from 48  μm increased to 102  μm) by using lubricant. This {{can be explained by}} the fact that grinding lubrication can help reducing friction at the contact surfaces, diffusing away heat, retaining sharpness of the abrasive grits, thus induces a favorable <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> mode (Manimaran et al. 2014; Fredj et al. 2006).|$|R
