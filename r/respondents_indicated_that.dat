40|$|Research {{suggests}} that family camp experiences can enhance family relationships. Families often participate in family camp experiences for a vacation, {{as part of}} a therapeutic and/or intervention strategy, or to gain general enrichment or engagement. To better understand the impacts of family camp experiences on family functioning, a mixed-methods study was conducted with 60 families across 18 camps. Respondents shared that family camp experiences benefit families because of the positive impacts of the camp staff, parenting reinforcement, and enhancement of family relationships, with 60 % of <b>respondents</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> family camp experiences reinforced good parenting and 86 % of <b>respondents</b> <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> the family camp experience reinforced family relationships.

30|$|With {{respect to}} direct {{discussion}} of the imaging findings between patients and radiologists when the patient asked, results showed that in under half of the participating countries the radiologist would routinely discuss the imaging findings with the patient, and in 12 Â % this rarely occurred. Free text comments <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> again there may be variation between private and state-provided care. Other factors cited were the time available and variation depending on the modality, for example more discussion was likely to take place about ultrasound examinations that MRI. One <b>respondent</b> also <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> radiologists did not discuss the findings because the referring doctors preferred to discuss the examination results with the patients (with which the radiologist <b>respondent</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> they did not agree).|$|R

According to the survey 28.2 percent of <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> they support a formal declaration for Taiwan independence, a rise of 3.7 percent compared to a similar poll conducted earlier in 2012. Asked whether Taiwan would eventually declare itself a new and independent nation, 49.1 percent replied yes while 38 percent responded negatively, the Global Views Monthly said. Only 22.9 percent agreed that Taiwan should eventually unify with China, while 63.5 percent disagreed.|$|E

A Tearfund survey in 2007 showed only one in ten Britons actually attend church weekly. Between the 2001 and 2011 census there was a decrease in the amount of people who identified as Christian by 12%, whilst the percentage of those reporting no religious affiliation doubled. This contrasted with growth in the other main religious group categories, with the number of Muslims increasing by the most substantial margin to a total of about 5%. The Muslim population has increased from 1.6 million in 2001 to 2.7 million in 2011, making it the second-largest religious group in the United Kingdom.|$|E

30|$|The use {{of local}} {{perception}} and LULC changes {{in understanding the}} effects of anthropogenic factors linked to climate change on mountain grassland ecosystems is crucial for future management and conservation of these ecosystems. In the current study, using local perceptions and analyses of remotely sensed images, we generated evidence of human-climate induced patterns of LULC dynamics supported by GIS technology in the mountain grasslands of Sidama. In the mountain grasslands of Sidama, perceptions of <b>respondents</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> land use/cover changes are occurring {{as a result of}} multiple drivers with potential consequences of climate change. Observations of respondents and analyses of remotely sensed images further suggest the existence of extensive changes in land use cover dynamics with increasing drought, deforestation, and expansion of agricultural lands. These reflect rapid changes in human population growth, land tenure, and associated pressures on the environment with consequences of major shifts in land use, which also agree with Chase et al. (1999). Observations of <b>respondents</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> land use/cover dynamics in the mountain grasslands of Sidama in South Ethiopia is accelerated by drought and changes in the timing of rain. Among others, experiences of respondents show that the rapid growth of human population, expansion of settlements, and increased mountain side farming are major factors for the loss of forest landscape.|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the responses to}} a questionnaire sent to equity traders through TraderForum of the Institutional Investor. The respondents manage in total a very significant percentage of equity assets under management in the United States. The focus of the questions was {{the extent of the}} demand for immediate execution of orders. We found that the majority of traders are willing to trade patiently if this reduces execution costs. Many traders <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> they frequently delay trades to obtain better prices. Most <b>respondents</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> they are typically given more than a day to implement a large order, that they typically break up more than 20 % of their large orders for execution over time, and that they regularly take more than a day for a large order that has been broken into lots to be executed completely. There is a generally positive view of alternative electronic trading systems, such as Instinet and Investment Technology Group's POSIT. The key motives for trading on these systems are reduced market impact, lower spreads, better liquidity, and anonymity. The <b>respondents</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the key changes that would make alternative electronic systems more attractive are an increase in execution rates and more convenient times of trading. The responses to the survey also show that alternative electronic systems would be used more if the traders did not have soft dollar arrangements. ...|$|R

Instead of using a new and unproven technology, the firm instead chose to use an already proven technology but used this technology in new ways. This reduced somewhat the risk of the product failing.

30|$|Pastoral {{resources}} {{were reported to}} have generally changed across the three land use types in the Amboseli ecosystem.

The variety of pastures, diversity of habitats and tree cover were mentioned to have declined significantly over the period under study. This was attributed to the rising grazing pressure due to restricted herd movements.
