40|$|A key {{requirement}} for the complete autonomy of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is the replenishment of its energy source and other consumables. Such processes are typically overseen and conducted by a human operator, may be time consuming and effectively reduce the operating range of the system. To satisfy the requirements of UAV customers such as military surveillance networks, that seek faster, broader and more fully autonomous systems, and hobbyists, who seek to avoid the hassle associated with changing the fuel source, we develop automated energy recharging systems. Focusing on battery operated remote control helicopters, we employ the Axiomatic Design methodology to develop design concepts of platforms to act as automatic service stations. We propose three station designs for refilling platforms and one concept for battery exchange platforms. In addition, we analyze the economic feasibility of automatic consumable replenishment stations, consider two types of station (<b>container</b> <b>refilling</b> and <b>container</b> exchange) and discuss the application of these systems. Refilling platforms better suit low coverage unmanned aerial systems (UAS) while exchange stations allow high coverage with fewer UAVs...|$|R
50|$|In 1961, Marquina {{invented the}} {{anti-drip}} oil/vinegar cruet (decanter), an emblematic design {{that has been}} the object of numerous copies throughout the world. The design allows the user to dose the liquid. It consists of a glass container in the shape of two cones placed together, the lower one serving as the container for the oil or vinegar while the upper one catches any drops that may drip from the spout while allowing air to enter the recipient for easy flow of the oil or vinegar. The neck is buffed or frosted so as to keep the spout in place, and the spout can be easily removed for <b>refilling</b> the <b>container.</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{transposition}} of the New Tobacco Product Directive (TPD) 2014 / 40 /UE in Italy - the law n. 6 / 2016 - {{entered into}} force in 2016. This law contains all the TPD regulations, {{and other new}} measures: 1. Stricter enforcement of the tobacco sale ban to minors, with higher fines and withdrawal of the sell licence for tobacco retailers; 2. Smoking ban in cars with minors and pregnant women 3. Smoking ban in outdoor areas closed to Pediatric and Gynecologic Hospital Departments 4. Sale ban of e-cig and <b>refill</b> <b>containers</b> to minors. Main aim is to show the evaluation plan of the new TPD in Italy. Material and Methods Presentation of the different tools of the evaluation plan. Results - The behavioural risk factor PASSI, the ISTAT, and the DOXA surveys on representative samples of Italians, will allow to study smoking and e-cigarette prevalence in adults; quitting attempts among smokers; the impact of pictorial warnings on smokers; second-hand smoke exposure; attitudes, perception, and behaviours of Italians after the coming into force of the new law; - The GYTS will monitor smoking and e-cig prevalence, tobacco access and availability among adolescents aged 13 - 15 years; - the National Institute of Health (ISS), in collaboration with some Regional Health Departments in Italy, will monitor the compliance with the smoking ban in cars, and with the outdoor ban in hospitals; - Temporal trend in phone calls to the Italian Quitline will be monitored. Moreover, the impact of pictorial warnings will be studied among smokers calling the Italian Quitline, or attending Italian Smoking Cessation Centers. - The online acquisition and transmission of ingredients from tobacco companies will be followed at ISS. Conclusions This evaluation plan will allow to study all {{the dimensions of the}} impact of the TPD in Italy. Funding This study was funded by the Italian Ministry of Health (MADES project, chapter 4100 / 22) ...|$|R
5000|$|Nicolò Licata {{was born}} on February 20, 1897 in the small Italian town of Camporeale, in Sicily (although his surname may suggest family origins in Licata). He {{was the son of}} Colagero and Vita, and had six {{brothers}} and two sisters. According to his records at Ellis Island, he boarded the Sant' Anna in Palermo at age 16 with $25. On December 5, 1913, Licata arrived in the United States and joined his brother Leonardo in Brooklyn. He later legally anglicised his first name to [...] "Nick". During the 1920s Licata became involved in bootlegging in Detroit during the prohibition era. He eventually became a made man in the Detroit crime family. He left for Los Angeles after offending its boss, Joseph Zerilli. He endeared himself to L.A. Boss Jack Dragna who was able to convince Zerilli to call off a murder contract on Licata. He was accepted {{as a member of the}} L.A. family and became close to Dragna's brother, consigliere Tom Dragna. On March 25, 1932 Licata became a naturalized citizen.

A 74 -year-old {{man with a}} 15 -year history of diabetes mellitus was <b>refilling</b> a <b>container</b> with household detergent at home. He splashed the detergent in his eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed extensive epithelial damage to the left eye, leading to a persistent corneal epithelial defect. We used a bandage soft contact lens with levofloxacin eye drops as concomitant therapy {{in order to promote}} healing. However, a strain of fluoroquinolone-resistant Corynebacterium colonized the eye, so that the corneal ulcer eventually became severe. Use of the bandage soft contact lens was discontinued. His antimicrobial agent was changed to cefmenoxime, a drug to which fluoroquinolone-resistant Corynebacterium is sensitive, and topical instillation of autologous serum subsequently promoted improvement of the ulcer. On day 38 after injury, iris rubeosis led to hyphema and ghost cell glaucoma. With improvement of his corneal epithelial defect, the iris rubeosis and hyphema regressed and his visual acuity improved to 20 / 25 on the left eye. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a case resulting in severe complications due to chemical injury by a neutral detergent. Ophthalmologists should be aware that corneal epithelial damage may become prolonged in elderly patients with diabetes, and unexpectedly severe when wearing bandage soft contact lens, with infection of Corynebacterium resistant to fluoroquinolones, even if the chemical agent is a neutral detergent.

50|$|In {{the second}} round of the Island Challenge, both teams got to a fast start. Claw were ahead and first to start filling their water {{container}}. Sting then reached their hose and filled some of their container quicker than Claw. The other members of Sting watching shouted at them to throw a cog but Janardan waited for the right time. Sting went back to their bucket, then Claw started speeding ahead of them, but Claw went too quickly that they started losing some of their collected water. Janardan threw a cog at Claw and succeeded at making them spill more of their water. As they were emptying their water, Abbey from Claw threw the cog Janardan had just thrown back at them, but missed. Claw went out to collect some more water, so Sting left some of their water in the container to get some more quicker than Claw. As they were going back, Janardan threw another cog at Claw but missed. Claw had some trouble with their hose but finally tried to quickly <b>refill</b> their <b>container,</b> when Sting decided to fill their container with as much as they could. Both teams then went back to their bucket, Maddy and Harriet were both holding on to their container steadily so they wouldn't lose more water. Janardan threw his last cog at Claw but missed again. As Claw was carrying less water than Sting, they filled their bucket quicker and went back to get some more. Sting however, were trying to get every last drop from their container. Sting was about to get some more water but then the time ran out. Sting had a significantly larger amount of water than Claw, therefore winning the challenge and earning their next Sands of Time.|$|R

Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own homes.Remember there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away. By leaving your homes you could be exposing yourselves to greater danger. If you leave, you may find yourself without food, without water, without accommodation and without protection. Radioactive fall-out, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many times more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open. Roofs and walls offer substantial protection. The safest place is indoors.Make sure gas and other fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished. If mains water is available, this can be used for fire-fighting. You should also <b>refill</b> all your <b>containers</b> for drinking water after the fires have been put out, because the mains water supply may not be available for very long.Water must not be used for flushing lavatories: until you are told that lavatories may be used again, other toilet arrangements must be made. Use your water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes. Water means life. Don't waste it.Make your food stocks last: ration your supply, because it may have to last for fourteen days or more. If you have fresh food in the house, use this first to avoid wasting it: food in tins will keep.If you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given, stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out.
