50|$|Different {{types of}} heaps {{implement}} the operations in different ways, but notably, insertion is often done {{by adding the}} new element {{at the end of}} the heap in the first available free space. This will generally violate the heap property, and so the elements are then sifted up until the heap property has been reestablished. Similarly, deleting the root is done by removing the <b>root</b> <b>and</b> then putting the last element in the <b>root</b> <b>and</b> sifting down to rebalance. Thus replacing is done by deleting the <b>root</b> <b>and</b> putting the new element in the <b>root</b> <b>and</b> sifting down, avoiding a sifting up step compared to pop (sift down of last element) followed by push (sift up of new element).|$|R

40|$|The role of leaf in {{regulation}} of <b>root</b> <b>and</b> shoot growths in single node softwood cuttings of grape (Vitis vinifera) was characterised. Leafy cuttings showed early rooting, vigorous <b>root</b> growth <b>and</b> subsequent shoot development. Defoliation at planting induced early sprouting, but adversely affected <b>rooting</b> <b>and</b> decreased {{the survival of}} cuttings irrespective of pre-planting treatment with 100 ΜM indole 3 -acetic acid (IAA). Treatment with IAA {{did not affect the}} percent rooting of leafy cuttings but increased <b>root</b> <b>and</b> shoot growth. Leaf weight (wt) and leaf area of the cuttings showed a highly significant correlation to root wt of the new plant at 4 wk after planting, while cutting stem + petiole wt was either not or less significantly correlated to <b>root</b> <b>and</b> shoot weights of the subsequent plant. The greater the area or wt of leaf, the better the <b>root</b> <b>and</b> shoot growths, implying that leaf contributed to adventitious root growth. However, retaining the leaf for just 2 days was enough to stimulate rooting in more than 80 % of the cuttings, suggesting that leaf tissue could also induce root formation. Root growth increased with the period of leaf retention but leaf removal before 3 wk triggered sprouting leading to high mortality in rooted cuttings. Bringing the leaf closer to the rooting zone by preparing leaf at base (LAB) cuttings delayed <b>rooting</b> <b>and</b> sprouting compared with the standard leaf at top (LAT) cuttings. An inhibitory effect on <b>rooting</b> <b>and</b> sprouting by the exposed upper internode region in LAB cuttings is suggested...|$|R

5|$|Most {{bears are}} {{opportunistic}} omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, <b>roots,</b> <b>and</b> berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted {{to such a}} diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available. For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents are herbivorous, feeding {{exclusively}} on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are omnivorous {{and a few}} are predators.

It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. The plains pocket gopher eats plant material found underground during tunneling, and also collects grasses, <b>roots,</b> <b>and</b> tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground larder chambers.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims A {{number of}} <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>root</b> hair traits have been {{proposed}} as important for acquisition of P. However, it remains unknown whether these traits are most important in determining macro- and micronutrient uptake at low soil fertility. This study investigated the variations in <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>root</b> hair traits among spring wheat genotypes <b>and</b> examined which <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>root</b> hair traits are most important for high uptake of macro- and micronutrients. Methods Six spring wheat genotypes were grown in a soil with low nutrient availability. The <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>root</b> hair traits {{as well as the}} content of macro- and micronutrients were identified. Results A significant genetic variability in <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>root</b> hair traits was found. High <b>root</b> growth vigour <b>and</b> long <b>and</b> dense <b>root</b> hairs enhanced uptake of macro- and micronutrients under low soil nutrient availability. Root growth vigour, however, was a better predictor of early nutrient acquisition than <b>root</b> hair length <b>and</b> density. Conclusions Selection and breeding for high <b>root</b> growth vigour <b>and</b> long <b>and</b> dense <b>root</b> hairs is a promising strategy to ensure efficient acquisition of both macro- and micronutrients in the early establishment of spring wheat in nutrient-limited soil and low nutrient input cropping systems. ...|$|R
