5000|$|Cost - Private jet {{travel is}} very expensive, and the {{fractional}} {{model can be}} the most costly option (when compared to memberships, charter, etc.). The plans are also complex, with multiple layers of cost that make it nearly impossible to calculate a realistic fully loaded bottom-line per-flight cost. Owners are charged a monthly fee whether or not they fly, and the often-overlooked fuel surcharges can add up to over $1,000 per flight-hour. When owners sell their share back to the provider, the [...] "residual value" [...] calculation can vary substantially, depending on market conditions for used aircraft. Additionally, planes in fractional fleets tend to be flown harder, with more hours and takeoff/landing cycles than the average. This negatively affects residual value. The initial purchase price for a 1/16 share of a light jet starts at over $300,000. Monthly management fees start at about $9,000 per month. Occupied hourly <b>rates</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> about $1,500.|$|E
50|$|The stipend {{is around}} £13,000 {{per year for}} three years, (sometimes higher by £2,000-3,000 in London), {{whether or not the}} degree {{continues}} for longer (within the usual four-year span). This implies that the fourth year of Ph.D. work is often unfunded. A very small number of scientific studentships are sometimes paid at a higher rate - for example, in London, Cancer Research UK, the ICR and the Wellcome Trust stipend <b>rates</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> around £19,000 and progress annually to around £23,000 a year; an amount that is tax and national insurance free. Research Council funding is sometimes 'earmarked' for a particular department or research group, who then allocate it to a chosen student, although in doing so they are generally expected to abide by the usual minimum entry requirements (typically a first degree with upper second class honours, although successful completion of a postgraduate master's degree is usually counted as raising the class of the first degree by one division for these purposes). The availability of funding in many disciplines (especially humanities, social studies and pure science subjects) means that in practice only those with the best research proposals, references and backgrounds are likely to be awarded a studentship. The ESRC (Economic and Social Science Research Council) explicitly state that a 2.1 minimum (or 2.2 plus additional master's degree) is required—no additional marks are given for students with a first class honours or a distinction at masters level. Since 2002, there has been a move by research councils to fund interdisciplinary doctoral training centres which concentrate resources on fewer higher quality centres.|$|E

40|$|Landuse {{change in}} upland Mindanao {{is driven by}} the history of {{commercial}} logging, the disregard for indigenous communities, the lack of tenure for migrants and the limited development of sustainable resource management strategies. The area's climate, forest hydrology and nutrient balances are a source of sustainability, yet with landuse change the potential for erosion and loss of the limited nutrient base, broader environmental degradation is probable without greater accountability and better options. Responses from traditional management indicate some of the possible options to be involved The main forest type is a tangile-oak association (premontane) with total estimated biomass being 479 tha-I. High clay levels, low bulk density and porosity are reflective of the undisturbed forest, estimated infiltration <b>rates</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> 10, 000 mmhr-l levelling off in 30 minutes at 1, 700 mmhr-l, high throughflow allows for fast delivery, yet baseflow is sustained during dry season. The other five land uses reflect lower clay, porosity, infiltration rates and nutrient loss especially maize with coffee being an exception given associated activities of soil fauna. The annual precipitation is over 2500 mm, while during El Nifto (1997 - 8) less than 2000 mm fell, registering 3 to 6 months drought in the broader area. Hydrographs give a discharge pattern of quick return to base flow which is sustained at half rate during droughts. Calculated potential evapotranspiration for maize area is around 28 % while for forest is 55 %of rainfall. More than 30 % of the rainfall events are potentially erosive. Establishing the rainfall pattern and forest water budget gives a definite characterisation and importance to the uplands as valuable water producing areas. Nutrients in precipitation are in the order of sodium, calcium and potassium and, other than magnesium from weathering, are the crucial inputs in a tight forest nutrient cycle. For Bendum, high infiltration may be enough to give constant stream chemistry with established equilibria between aqueous and solid phases, due to the storage time in the soil for where there is good land cover. Ranking of landuses according to levels of sustainability on-site and off site were established [...] .. With expanding agriculture and forest utilization greater soil and water conservation, utilization of buffer zones and a new level of integrated water resource management is needed locally and in both extension work and landuse planning by local government.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple and {{thermodynamically}} consistent cosmology with a phenomenological model of quantum creation of radiation due to vacuum decay. Thermodynamics and Einstein’s equations lead to an equation in which H {{is determined by the}} particle number N. The model is completed by specifying the particle creation rate Γ = ˙ N/N, which leads to a second-order evolution equation for H. We propose a simple Γ that is naturally defined and that conforms to the thermodynamical conditions: (a) the entropy production <b>rate</b> <b>starts</b> <b>at</b> a maximum; (b) the initial vacuum (for radiation) is a non-singular regular vacuum; and (c) the creation rate is initially higher than the expansion rate H, but then falls below H. The evolution equation for H then has a remarkably simple exact solution, in which a non-adiabatic inflationary era exits smoothly to the radiation era, without a reheating transition. For this solution, we give exact expressions for the cosmic scale factor, energy density of radiation and vacuum, temperature, entropy and super-horizon scalar perturbations.

In the youngest male cohorts there was a significant flattening in the rate of decline in the most recent periods. Comparison of age-specific mortality across cohorts showed the mortality at any period to be lower in the most recent cohort.

Decreases of ∼ 30 – 50 % in anomalous He and galactic H are observed at V 2 when the shock passes this location inside the termination shock.
