40|$|AbstractApparent {{motion is}} an illusory {{perception}} of movement {{that can be}} induced by alternating presentations of static objects. Already in Wertheimer’s early investigation of the phenomenon [Wertheimer, M. (1912). Experimentelle Studien über das Sehen von Bewegung. Zeitschrift fur Psychologie, 61, 161 – 265], he mentions that voluntary attention can influence {{the way in which}} an ambiguous apparent motion display is perceived. But until now, few studies have investigated how strong the modulation of apparent motion through attention can be under different stimulus and task conditions. We used bistable motion quartets of two different sizes, where the perception of vertical and horizontal motion is equally likely. Eleven observers participated in two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants were instructed to either (a) hold the current movement direction as long as possible, (b) passively view the stimulus, or (c) switch the movement directions as quickly as possible. With the <b>respective</b> <b>instructions,</b> observers could almost double phase durations in (a) and more than halve durations in (c) relative to the passive condition. This modulation effect was stronger for the large quartets. In Experiment 2, observers’ attention was diverted from the stimulus by a detection task at fixation while they still had to report their conscious perception. This manipulation prolonged dominance durations for up to 100 %. The experiments reveal a high susceptibility of ambiguous apparent motion to attentional modulation. We discuss how feature- and space-based attention mechanisms might contribute to those effects...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we address}} the problem faced by modern {{operating}} systems due to the exploitation of Hardware-Assisted Full-Virtualization technology by attackers. Virtualization technology has been of growing importance these days. With the help of such a technology, multiple operating systems can be run on {{a single piece of}} hardware, with little or no modification to the operating system. Both Intel and AMD have contributed to x 86 full-virtualization through their <b>respective</b> <b>instruction</b> set architectures. Hardware virtualization extensions can be found in almost all x 86 processors these days. Hardware virtualization technologies have opened a whole new frontier for a new kind of attack. A system hacker can abuse hardware virualization technology to gain control over an operating system on-the-fly (i. e., without a system restart) by installing a thin Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) below the native operating system. Such a VMM based malware is termed a Hardware-Assisted Virtual Machine (HVM) rootkit. We discuss the technique used by a rootkit named Blue Pill to subvert the Windows Vista operating system by exploiting the AMD-V (codenamed "Pacifica") virtualization extensions. HVM rootkits do not hook any operating system code or data regions; hence detecting the existence of such malware using conventional techniques becomes extremely difficult. This thesis discusses existing methods to detect such rootkits and their inefficiencies. In this work, we implement a proof-of-concept HVM rootkit using Intel-VT hardware virtualization technology and also discuss how such an attack can be defended against by using an autonomic architecture called SHARK, which was proposed by Vikas et al., in MICRO 2008.

30|$|During {{assisted}} navigation, {{the navigation}} system automatically selects and depicts environmental properties (e.g., landmarks) without any user intervention, which leads to decreased attentiveness to relevant properties (Taylor, Brunyé, & Taylor, 2008). Consequently, the navigator does not attend to the traversed surroundings, but reallocates attention toward the automated navigation system (Gardony et al., 2013; Willis et al., 2009). The resources are transferred toward the system itself and a <b>respective</b> <b>instruction</b> execution (Parasuraman, 2000). The navigator has to constantly switch between a survey perspective offered by {{the navigation system}} and a route perspective, i.e., the first-person view (Dai et al., 2018; Gardony et al., 2013). The distribution of human attentional resources changes {{with the use of}} navigation systems compared to no use of a navigation aid. Without a system, humans actively make decisions and interact predominately with their surroundings. Several studies have demonstrated that automated guidance divides a navigator’s attention between the navigation system and the environment (e.g., Gardony et al., 2013; Ishikawa et al., 2008). For example, a constantly updating GPS position signal (blinking light or beeping sound) on a navigation system can induce such an attentional division. As the navigator’s position is continuously updated, the visual tracking of the GPS signal distracts the navigator’s attention from the surroundings toward the system (Ishikawa et al., 2008). When continuously relying on this kind of positional updates, we do not attend to the information the traversed environment provides, and thus we lose the respective skill (Parush et al., 2007). But if the navigation system fails, navigators have to rely on their acquired knowledge, which would be challenging because not mentally processing properties along a travelled route results in decreased spatial knowledge in the end (e.g., Hirtle & Raubal, 2013; Huang, Schmidt, & Gartner, 2012; Münzer et al., 2006; Parasuraman, 2000; Parush et al., 2007).|$|E

The adhesives were bonded to dentin according to their <b>respective</b> manufacturer's <b>instructions.</b> Additional groups of SB and OS systems were created, in which the phosphoric acid etching time was doubled (30 seconds). After bonding, build-up crowns were constructed incrementally with Z 250 resin composite and the teeth were stored for 24 hours in distilled water at 37 °C. The teeth were serially and vertically sectioned to obtain several bonded beams with approximately 0. 8 mm 2 of cross-sectional area. Beams were tested in microtensile (0. 6 mm/minute) either immediately (control) or after storage for 6 months or 1 year in either distilled water or mineral oil. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison tests. Results: Significant reductions (P< 0. 05) in bond strength were observed after both long-term storage periods in water for all the materials, regardless of the etching time for SB and OS.

Although not significantly different, one-step self-etch adhesives tended to have lower microTBS than two-step self-etch and two-step total-etch adhesives. Specimen failures during sample preparation occurred with Prompt L-Pop 2 (4 pretesting failures out of 17 specimens) and NRC/Prime & Bond NT (7 pretesting failures out of 14 specimens). CONCLUSION: Adhesives with simplified application procedures, either following a total-etch or self-etch approach, produced lower bond strengths to dentin than a conventional three-step total-etch adhesive. Some concern exists regarding the consistency in bonding effectiveness to dentin of some self-etch adhesives. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The new three-step {{adhesive}} 'cmf adhesive system' (CMF, Saremco) {{is free of}} co-monomers such as TEGDMA and HEMA for biocompatibility reasons, {{for instance}} in prevention of allergic reactions of patients and dental staff. The {{purpose of this study}} was 1) to determine the micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) to enamel/dentin, and 2) to characterize its interfacial interaction with enamel/dentin using transmission electron microscope (TEM). Methods: Twelve intact freshly extracted human third molars were used for µTBS. Optibond FL (OBFL, Kerr) served as control. After bonding procedures following the <b>respective</b> manufacturer's <b>instructions</b> and subsequent composite build-up (Z 100, 3 M ESPE), specimens were sectioned to 1. 8 x 1. 8 mm sticks and trimmed at the interface to a cylindrical hour-glass shape (± 1. 2 mm) using the MicroSpecimen Former (University of Iowa). TEM non-demineralised and demineralised sections, and sections of specimens immersed in ammoniacal silver nitrate were prepared by ultra-microtomy and examined (EM 900, Zeiss). Results: µTBS CMF OBFL p-value (t-test) Enamel 30. 7 ± 9. 2 MPa, n= 10 26. 7 ± 5. 0 MPa, n= 11 p= 0. 3512 Dentin 25. 7 ± 5. 8 MPa, n= 10 45. 6 ± 9. 9 MPa, n= 10 p< 0. 0001 No pre-testing failures were recorded. TEM showed a tight interface at enamel. The etch-pits produced by the 'mild' phosphoric-acid conditioner (pH= 1. 5) were rather shallow, but resulted in clearly defined micro-tags. A relatively thick, completely demineralised and acid-resistant hybrid layer was formed, varying in thickness between 1. 5 - 3 µm at dentin. The dentin tubules were opened and enabled the formation of resin tags. Some degree of spot and cluster-like nanoleakage was observed, but did not differ in extent and form in comparison to that observed with the OBFL control. Conclusion: The new three-step adhesive 'cmf adhesive system' showed clear indications of good bond reliability. status: submitte...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although a few {{growth media}} are {{available}} for selective isolation of the cariogenic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), it is still unclear as to {{which is the most}} efficacious. This study compared the selectivity and sensitivity of five different media for growing a laboratory strain of S. mutans (NCTC 10449), and for enumerating S. mutans from teeth of a group of young children, aged 2 - 10 years. Methods: The media tested in this study were mitis salivarius with bacitracin (MSB), mitis salivarius-kanamycin-bacitracin (MSKB), glucose-sucrose-tellurite-bacitracin (GSTB), trypticase soy-sucrose-bacitracin (TYS 20 B) and tryptone-yeast-cysteine-sucrose-bacitracin (TYCSB) agars. These were prepared according to the <b>respective</b> manufacturer’s <b>instructions.</b> Results: The results showed that at concentrations of bacteria 1103 to 11010 /mL, the recovery of the laboratory S. mutans strain was highest in TYCSB agar, followed by in descending order by TYS 20 B, MSB, GSTB, and MSKB (p< 0. 01). Similar results were obtained using dental plaque samples collected from swabs of the teeth of a group of children. In the clinical samples, TYCSB again showed the highest recovery rates of S. mutans compared to the other four media. Results were reproduced at dilutions of the samples at 1 : 20106 to 1 : 2106, and S. mutans concentrations of 1. 6 to 7. 7 Log 10 CFU/mL. In addition, there were highest ratios of mutans to non-mutans bacteria in TYCSB compared to the other media, suggesting high selectivity of this media for mutans species. Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that TYCSB is the most sensitive and selective media for culture of S. mutans for laboratory and clinical studies. Key words: Streptococcus mutans, early childhood caries, mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar, tryptone-yeast-cysteine-sucrose-bacitracin agar, selective agar.

40|$|Seven hundred thirty-two female {{urogenital}} {{samples were}} collected for Chlamydia trachomatis testing by both the Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur (Chaska, Minn.) Chlamydia Microplate EIA by the shortened protocol and the Syva (San Jose, Calif.) MicroTrak II EIA, {{and the results were}} compared with those obtained by cell culture. For the analysis of samples from female patients, the patients were divided into high- and low-risk categories. An additional 121 male urethral {{samples were collected}} and tested by the Sanofi Microplate EIA and cell culture; for the analysis of samples from male patients, the patients were divided into asymptomatic and symptomatic categories. All specimens positive by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were confirmed by a blocking assay following the <b>respective</b> manufacturer's <b>instructions.</b> Specimens negative by EIA that fell within a gray zone 30 % below the cutoff and negative cultures with one or more corresponding positive EIA results were tested further by cytocentrifugation and direct immunofluorescent assay. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for Syva versus culture were 94, 98. 8, 85. 5 and 99. 6 %, respectively. After resolution, the results were 94. 5, 99. 6, 94. 5, and 99. 6 %, respectively. The parallel results for the Sanofi Microplate EIA versus culture were 94. 0, 98. 7, and 83. 9, and 99. 6 %, respectively, and after being resolved, the results were 94. 9, 100, 100, and 99. 6 %, respectively. In the small male population tested, the resolved results of the Sanofi Microplate EIA versus culture demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100, 100, 100, and 100 %, respectively. The present study demonstrated that the Sanofi Microplate EIA shortened protocol is highly sensitive and specific in comparison with cell culture and the Syva MicroTrak II EIA...|$|R
