5|$|Marostica {{announced}} {{his bid for}} re-election to the legislature in January 2008; Marostica's campaign <b>raised</b> <b>about</b> {{five times as much}} money as that of Democratic opponent Kenneth Bennett, bringing in over $80,000 by mid-October, of which $10,000 was contributed by Marostica personally; His re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post, Marostica ultimately won with 58 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, doubts were <b>raised</b> <b>about</b> {{both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and it was suggested that she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the murder to dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that the dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E

5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been <b>raised</b> <b>about</b> the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the trial, {{questions}} were <b>raised</b> <b>about</b> the fairness and legality of the court-martial proceedings. Owing to public pressure, the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men. Widespread publicity surrounding the case {{turned it into a}} cause célèbre among certain Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944–45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated to the lives lost in the disaster.|$|E

5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after walking down the streets of New York and seeing several stone gargoyles on the corner, staring at him. Gordon developed the concept with series creator Chris Carter, who suggested the addition of more psychological aspects to the episode. Originally, the teaser was planned to be filmed at a Catholic hospital, but the shot was relocated {{to the site of}} a historic post office after concerns were <b>raised</b> <b>about</b> attaching a fake gargoyle to the building.|$|E
5|$|In May 2006, The Sunday Business Post {{reported}} that Steorn {{was a former}} dot-com company which was developing a microgenerator product {{based on the same}} principle as self-winding watches, as well as creating e-commerce websites for customers.

5|$|Shortly {{after its}} opening, {{concerns}} were <b>raised</b> <b>about</b> the bridge's safety. Following an inspection by John Hawkshaw and Edwin Clark in 1861, an additional support chain was added on each side. Despite the strengthening {{there were still}} concerns about its soundness, and a weight limit of 5 tons was imposed. At the same time, the name was changed from Victoria Bridge to Chelsea Bridge, as the government {{was concerned about the}} reliability of suspension bridges and did not want a potential collapse {{to be associated with the}} Queen.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{growth has been}} driven by the expansion of services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors.

Many studies reveal increases in the severity of the effect with the progress of climate change.|$|E
5|$|Two polls {{conducted}} {{shortly after}} Schiavo's feeding tube was removed {{for the final}} time in 2005 showed that {{a large majority of}} Americans believed that Michael Schiavo should have had the authority to make decisions on behalf of his wife, Terri, and that the United States Congress overstepped its bounds with its intervention in the case. However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were <b>raised</b> <b>about</b> the wording of all the polls.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were <b>raised</b> <b>about</b> {{the safety of}} the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the epicenter of the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers in protecting the museum, situated beside the burning ruling party headquarters. Looters managed to enter during the night from the roof to damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E

Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for general control of development in their areas and are required to take into consideration the views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In regard to this specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there is neither a current planning permission or application for a mosque, nor is one expected in the near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E
5|$|Concerns were <b>raised</b> <b>about</b> {{these changes}} in society. William Langland wrote the poem Piers Plowman {{in the years before}} 1380, praising peasants who {{respected}} the law and worked hard for their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding higher wages. The poet John Gower feared England might see an uprising similar to the French Jacquerie revolt of 1358, in which the peasants had risen up against their masters. There was a moral panic about the threat posed by newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against their masters. New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing conspiracy laws were more widely applied and the treason laws were extended to include servants or wives who betrayed their masters and husbands. By the 1370s, there were fears that if the French invaded England, the rural classes might side with the invaders.|$|E
5|$|Coprinellus micaceus has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, {{and has been}} collected in northern Africa, South Africa, Europe (including Turkey), North America (as far north as Alaska), the Hawaiian islands, South America, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences from specimens collected in southeastern Asia and Hawaii show that the Hawaiian species form a distinct clade with little genetic diversity compared to Asian populations; {{this suggests that the}} Hawaiian populations have been introduced relatively recently and have not had much time to develop genetic variation. One study suggests that in South Africa, where C.micaceus is rare, it has been frequently confused with the similar-appearing C.truncorum, a more common species in that region. A similar inference has been <b>raised</b> <b>about</b> North American species.|$|E
50|$|Although {{this passage}} appears {{early in the}} novel and is {{to a great extent}} negated by Diana's later {{submission}} to Ahmed, the questions it <b>raises</b> <b>about</b> women's rights echo some of the main themes of contemporary suffragists.|$|R
