50|$|The Aquidabán {{region has}} forests and large fields, lagoons, swamps and lakes. In the forest Specimens of Trébol, Timbó, <b>Red</b> <b>Quebracho,</b> Karanda, Palo Blanco, Juasy’y Guazú, Urundey-mi, Kurupa’y, Curuñi, and Jata’i {{can be found}} in the forests; in the meadows, {{specimens}} of Arasupe; and in palm fields, Karanday.|$|E
50|$|The {{trees in}} the area are short and thorny; there are {{brushwood}} and cactus, dunes and small hills, especially in the north of the department. Some species of trees in this region are in danger of extinction: the urunde'y, white and <b>red</b> <b>quebracho,</b> samu'u also known as palo borracho and palo santo.|$|E
5000|$|... 880 {{species of}} {{vascular}} plants and 28 species of spore plants (plants without flowers) have been {{registered in the}} National Park, {{as well as an}} estimated 1500 species of higher plants. Some examples which stand out are the <b>red</b> <b>quebracho</b> (Schinopsis lorentzii), black soto (Schinopsis cornuta), black guayacán (Izozogia nelly), cuchi (Myracrodruon urundeuva), purple guayacán (Bulnesia sarmientoi), soto de arenales (Schinopsis corneta), and cupesí (Prosopis chilensis).|$|E
50|$|The {{climate is}} warm, with annual {{rainfall}} between 500 - 700 mm. A {{large part of}} the park is made up of forests, with the Santiago <b>red</b> <b>quebracho</b> (quebracho colorado santiagueño) being its characteristic tree species. This tree has a strong wood and high content of tannin, and in the past it suffered a devastating exploitation {{in other parts of the}} country. At the beginning of the 20th century, Santiago del Estero was 80% quebracho scrubland; nowadays only 20% remain.|$|E
50|$|The area harbors several environments: {{scrubland}}, savanna, swamps, {{and small}} lakes. The scrubland is the habitat of the <b>red</b> <b>quebracho</b> (Schinopsis lorentzii), white quebracho (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco), algarrobo (Prosopis alba), and lapacho (Tabebuia spp.), {{all of which}} are commercially valuable species. The fauna includes large predators such as cougars. In the lakes one finds yacare caimans and capybaras. Elsewhere there are armadillos, South American tapirs and plains viscachas, as well as birds (more than 340 species). The fauna also includes the black howler monkey (Alouatta caraya).|$|E
50|$|Schinopsis balansae is a {{hardwood}} tree known as willow-leaf <b>red</b> <b>quebracho</b> which forms {{forests in the}} subtropical Gran Chaco ecoregion of north-eastern Argentina, and Paraguay. It {{is also found in}} the wild Pantanal vegetation in Brazil. Some of its vernacular names are quebracho colorado chaqueño and quebracho santafesino. Other species, like Schinopsis lorentzii, bear the general name quebracho and have similar properties and uses. S. balansae shares its habitat with a species of the same genus, S. heterophylla, and the two are often confused.|$|E
5000|$|Schinopsis lorentzii is a {{hardwood}} tree known as <b>red</b> <b>quebracho,</b> {{native of the}} Paraguayan subtropical area, which forms forests in Gran Chaco region of Argentina, in Paraguay, and Bolivia. Some of its common names are coronillo, quebracho Cornillo (Brazil), quebracho chaqueño, quebracho colorado santiagueño, quebracho macho, and quebracho bolí. The qualification colorado ("red") differentiates it from other species of common quebracho tree, the Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco (quebracho blanco, [...] "white quebracho", family Apocynaceae). The indication santiagueño (from Santiago del Estero) is made to distinguish it from quebracho colorado chaqueño, a closely related species (Schinopsis balansae).|$|E
40|$|Two levels (1 % and 3 %) of {{condensed}} tannin extract from <b>red</b> <b>quebracho</b> (QT) {{were added to}} a diet of growing rabbits in a 6 -wk feeding trial up to 12 wk of age. Health status was unaf- fected by the QT supplementation. The E. coli count of caecal content denoted a bactericidal activity of the QT. Weight gain and slaughter weigh were significantly higher and conversion index was sig- nificantly lower in rabbits fed QT diets, compared to those fed the control diet (P< 0. 05). Meat traits, as well the meat fatty acid profile weren’t influenced by the QT supplementation. Our results contributed to increase the knowledge on the dietary use of QT in the rabbit. QT extract supplemented at 1 % and 3 % in fattening rabbits diet had a clear beneficial effect on live performance. Further {{studies are needed to}} assess if supplementing diets with QT can be a valuable strategy...|$|E
