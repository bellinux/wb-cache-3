5|$|An area of {{cloudiness}} and rainshowers developed {{several hundred}} miles east-southeast of Bermuda on August 25, likely {{in association with}} a low-level disturbance that formed along a cold front. For several days, it moved southwestward, and, while located on the southwestern end of an upper-level trough {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico, deep convection throughout the system increased. The system tracked westward, and initially <b>remained</b> disorganized while surface pressures <b>remained</b> high. The system turned to a northwest drift, and began to slowly organize on August 30 while located a few hundred miles northeast of the Bahamas. A broad low-pressure area developed on August 31 though convection <b>remained</b> disorganized as winds of 20 to 25mph (32 to 40km/h) were reported in squalls.
