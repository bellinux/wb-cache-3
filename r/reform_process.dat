Rejecting an offer to become a cabinet {{minister}} and leaving his leading position in the opposition, al-Jamri returned from the United Kingdom in December 2001, eight months after his father had obtained a consent from the Emir to establish two newspapers. Initially, he was sceptical about the king's reform plan, but al-Jamri received a personal invitation by the king and was given a large margin of freedom of expression. Al-Jamri, backed by 39 other private investors (US$5.3 million capital) had initially planned to establish two independent newspapers, Al-Wasat in Arabic and Gulf Observer in English.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, Suharto for {{the first}} time did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit, which was later {{revealed}} to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah. However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF <b>reform</b> <b>process,</b> further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.|$|E

The congress allowed existing party members to engage in private ownership. This was a controversial amendment and was a break with the theory of exploitation of man by man. While the amendment was approved, the third plenum of the 10th Central Committee restricted the change to party members who had worked in state-owned enterprises which have been privatized.|$|E

40|$|Owing to {{the high}} energy content of {{hydrogen}} {{and the possibility of}} converting this energy in fuel cell devices into electric power without any pollutant emissions, hydrogen has grown {{to be one of the}} most useful sources of energy, especially if it is produced from renewable sources. In recent years, the development of an efficient process for hydrogen production has become an important goal for energy researchers. Numerous studies have evaluated the catalytic reforming of glycerol for hydrogen production both experimentally and thermodynamically. To enhance hydrogen pro-duction and make the production process efficient, researchers have investigated different <b>reforming</b> <b>processes</b> under a wide range of operating conditions. Moreover, the main focus of these studies was the development of a high-perfor-mance reforming catalyst that can increase the hydrogen yield and decrease carbon formation and processing costs. Several <b>reforming</b> <b>processes</b> can be used to produce hydrogen from glycerol. This article reviews these <b>reforming</b> <b>processes</b> with emphasis on the common catalysts and the operating conditions used in thermodynamic analyses and experimental work.

5|$|Indonesia was {{the country}} {{hardest hit by}} the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997–98. From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the Indonesian Rupiah to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7% leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country. Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic <b>reform</b> <b>process.</b> In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set-up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks {{in order to prevent}} the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy.|$|E

40|$|In this work, process modelling, {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis and}} optimization of stand-alone dry and partial oxidation reforming of methane as well as, the auto-thermal <b>reforming</b> <b>processes</b> were investigated. Firstly, flowsheet models were developed {{for both the}} stand-alone systems and auto-thermal <b>reforming</b> <b>process</b> using ASPEN HYSYS®. Furthermore, thermodynamic studies were conducted for the stand-alone and auto-thermal <b>reforming</b> <b>processes</b> for temperatures range of 200 – 1000 °C and pressure range of 1 – 3 bar using Gibbs free energy minimization methods which was also performed using ASPEN HYSYS®. The simulation of the auto-thermal <b>reforming</b> <b>process</b> was also performed at 20 bar to mimic industrial process. Process parameters were optimized in the combined <b>reforming</b> <b>process</b> for hydrogen production using desirability function. The simulation results show that 84. 60 kg/h, 62. 08 kg/h and 154. 7 kg/h of syngas were produced from 144 kg/h, 113 kg/h and 211 kg/h of the gas fed into the Gibbs reactor at CH 4 /CO 2 /O 2 ratio 1 : 1 : 1 for the stand-alone dry reforming, partial oxidation <b>reforming</b> and auto-thermal <b>processes</b> respectively. Equilibrium conversion of CH 4, CO 2, O 2 were thermodynamically favoured between 400 and 800 °C with highest conversions of 100 %, 95. 9 % and 86. 7 % for O 2, CO 2 and CH 4 respectively. Highest yield of 99 % for H 2 and 40 % for CO at 800 °C was obtained. The optimum conditions for hydrogen production were obtained at CH 4 /CO 2, CH 4 /O 2 ratios of 0. 634, 0. 454 and temperature of 800 °C respectively.
