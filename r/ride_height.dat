5|$|The second {{practice}} session {{was held in}} wet but drying weather conditions. During the session, Schumacher went off the track at the exit of turnfive, damaging his car's front wing in the process. However, he still set the fastest time of the session (1:23.607) after a change to his car's <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> proved beneficial to its performance. The top six was completed by Berger, Hill, Häkkinen, Alesi, and Olivier Panis' Ligier.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} the race, Joe Gibbs Racing were given {{penalties}} for Kyle Busch's car. Joe Gibbs Racing's penalty, for unauthorized alterations to the <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> of Kyle Busch's car, included a fine of $25,000 for crew chief Steve Addington, {{and the loss of}} 25 owner and driver points for Joe Gibbs and Kyle Busch respectively. Addington was also placed on probation until December 31, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The team {{used the}} BT49 over four seasons. In the 1980 season Piquet scored three wins {{and the team}} took third in the Constructors' Championship with Piquet second in the Drivers' Championship. This season saw the {{introduction}} of the blue and white livery that the cars would wear through several changes of sponsor, until the team's demise in 1992. With a better understanding of ground effect, the team further developed the BT49C for the 1981 season, incorporating a hydropneumatic suspension system to avoid <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> limitations intended to reduce downforce. Piquet, who had developed a close working relationship with Murray, took the drivers' title with three wins, albeit amid accusations of cheating. The team finished second in the Constructors' Championship, behind the Williams team.|$|E
40|$|The {{force and}} {{pressure}} {{behavior of a}} generic diffuser in ground effect were investigated. The diffuser model is a bluff body with a rear diffuser at 17 deg to the horizontal, and side-plates. Measurements were conducted in a low speed wind tunnel equipped with a moving ground facility. Techniques employed were force balance, pressure taps, and surface flow visualization. The diffuser flow in ground effect was characterized by vortex flow and three-dimensional flow separation. Four types of force behavior were observed: (a) down-force enhancement at high <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> characterized by an attached symmetric diffuser flow, (b) maximum down-force at moderate <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> characterized by a symmetric diffuser flow and separation on the diffuser ramp surface, (c) down-force reduction at low <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> characterized by an asymmetric diffuser flow and flow separation, and (d) low down-force at very low <b>ride</b> <b>heights,</b> also characterized by an asymmetric diffuser flow and flow separation. The down-force reduction near the ground is attributed to flow separation at the diffuser inlet and subsequent loss of suction {{in the first half}} of the diffuser...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic package for the MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the turning vanes to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the rear floor designed to reduce the impact of airflow washing over the rear wheels and disrupting the rear diffuser, which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> and rake, or the angle between the front and rear <b>ride</b> <b>height.</b> These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. With the engine and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, he was running as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the night before and Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E
5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> at {{the front end of}} the car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out and hitting the road, but without compromising the performance of the car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the rear wheels to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Frank Williams led an {{abortive}} {{protest against}} the car at the Argentine Grand Prix, objecting to {{the flexibility of the}} fixed skirts used to seal the underside of the car, which allowed them to replicate the effect of a sliding skirt. At the following race, the scrutineers rejected the flexible skirts. Brabham replaced them with stiffer material from one of the other teams for the race, which Piquet won. As the season progressed, other teams developed their own lowering systems—a front spring and cylinder were stolen from the Brabham garage in Argentina— but after a rule clarification from FISA many cars were lowered by the driver pressing a switch, a development that Murray found frustrating in light of Brabham's efforts to develop a system that he considered legal. The cars ran on Goodyear tyres again from the sixth round of the championship; motorsport author Doug Nye believes this cost the BT49s good results at several races while the American company adapted to the latest Formula One developments. Despite the virtually solid suspension now required to maintain a consistent <b>ride</b> <b>height,</b> which put components under greater strain, Piquet built a championship challenge on the back of consistent reliability: {{by the end of the}} season, his BT49Cs had finished 10 of 15 races, with only one mechanical failure. Piquet finished fifth at the final race of the season—the Caesars Palace Grand Prix—to take the title from Carlos Reutemann in a Williams FW07 by one point.|$|E

5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The qualifying session was held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his fourth pole position of the season, his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:15.632. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard with his fastest time was 0.102 seconds slower and used his team's spare monocoque while the McLaren mechanics fitted his race car with a new fuel pump. Barrichello secured third having changed his car's set-up during the session which garnered confusion over changes in the <b>ride</b> <b>height.</b> Häkkinen took fourth and was pushed down to his position by Barrichello with the Finn struggling in the slow speed corners. Ralf Schumacher qualified fifth and was happy with his starting position. Irvine was pushed down by Ralf Schumacher to sixth in the closing stages of qualifying. BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve managed seventh. The Jordan drivers of Trulli and Frentzen took seventh and eighth positions respectively although both drivers were disappointed with their performance. Button rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Herbert, who took eleventh, missed out in qualifying in the top ten by nearly three-tenths of a second. Salo captured twelfth on the grid with his fastest time set when air and track temperatures were lowered by cloud cover. He was ahead of de la Rosa in the faster of the two Arrows. Fisichella started from 14th position, nearly one-tenth of a second in front of Benetton teammate Alexander Wurz; both drivers complained that their cars had balance and grip issues. The two were split by Pedro Diniz in the other Sauber and Heidfeld. Alesi followed up in 18th. Ricardo Zonta set the 19th fastest time and used BAR's spare car when an engine failure on his race car occurred. Verstappen and the two Minardi drivers Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid, covering positions 20 to 22. After the qualifying session, but before the warm-up period, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety delegate, Charlie Whiting announced that he had banned practice starts at the pit lane exit after observing the drivers' behaviour in the area during the Saturday free practice sessions.|$|E
25|$|Front {{suspension}} uses {{a separate}} spring and damper {{with a rubber}} top mount. The rear suspension of the W124 features the Mercedes multi-link axle introduced in 1982 with the Mercedes 190 and which is now standard on many modern cars. Estate cars (and optionally, saloons and coupés) had Citroen-like rear self-leveling suspension with suspension struts rather than shock absorbers, gas-filled suspension spheres to provide damping and an under bonnet pressurizing pump. Unlike the traditional Citroën application Mercedes opted for a fixed <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> and employed rear coil springs to maintain the static <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> when parked.|$|E
25|$|However, {{another problem}} arose in {{qualifying}} when manhole covers {{on the roads}} were coming undone due to the racing cars' high downforce and low <b>ride</b> <b>height.</b> Grid positions were decided based on practice times.

50|$|The {{corporate}} average {{fuel economy}} (CAFE) standard was ratified in the 1970s to regulate the fuel economy of passenger vehicles. Car manufacturers evaded the regulation by selling SUVs as work vehicles. The popularity of SUV increased among urban drivers in the last 25 years, and particularly in the last decade. Consequently, modern SUVs are available with luxury vehicle features, and some crossover models adopt lower <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> to accommodate on-road driving.|$|R

25|$|Components of the {{bodywork}} {{were replaced}} with slightly revised carbon fibre and kevlar panels. The under tray {{was replaced with}} a flat version for better stability at high speeds.

25|$|The {{design has}} a {{monocoque}} (unibody) construction with four-wheel independent air suspension. Air suspension allowed variable <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> and achieved similar axle articulation {{to the previous}} live axle design. This retained off-road abilities while improving on-road performance. The new Range Rover's introduction in late 2002 as a 2003 model for the North American market resulted in the Range Rover and Ford Expedition (also new for 2003) being the only two SUVs in the full-size sport utility class with four-wheel independent suspension systems at that time.|$|E
25|$|In {{the week}} {{following}} the British Grand Prix, the FIA announced a total {{ban on the}} Front-and-Rear Interconnected suspension system (commonly abbreviated as FRIC) starting with immediate effect {{on the grounds that}} it was a movable aerodynamic device under Article 3.15 of the technical regulations. The FRIC system linked the front and rear suspension arrays together, using inertia to transfer hydraulic fluid across the car to offset the effects of weight transfer on the car under braking, acceleration and cornering, thereby creating a static <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> and improving stability.|$|E
50|$|A powered {{roller coaster}} is a railed {{amusement}} ride {{similar to a}} roller coaster. Unlike a true roller coaster, the train is powered through the entire course, rather than being allowed to coast after an initial lift or launch. This allows for both compact layouts that start out with curving hills, or long, extended layouts that would need too many lifts to be feasible. The most common manufacturers of powered coasters are Mack, Wisdom Rides, and Zamperla.

25|$|To be {{eligible}} {{to appear on the}} Power Lap Times board, a vehicle must be a road-legal production car and must have sufficient <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> to clear a standard speed bump (referred to by the presenters as a sleeping policeman), although occasionally vehicles that cannot appear on the list are still timed. Whenever a non-qualifying vehicle is raced, the time is compared to the official Power Laps but then removed from the board, for example - the Ferrari FXX owned by Michael Schumacher (1:10.7) was taken off the board after because it both failed to meet road legal standards and used slick tyres.|$|E
25|$|The V70 XC, also {{referred}} to as V70 AWD Cross Country, was introduced in September 1997 on the Frankfurt Auto Show for the 1998 model year as a crossover version of the V70. It featured standard all-wheel drive and was available with only two engine and gearbox choices. In the US only the 2.4L turbo engine together with an automatic gearbox was available. A 2.0L version of the V70 XC was available only for markets with high taxes on cars with more than 2000cc engine capacity. Standard <b>ride</b> <b>height</b> was increased by 2.6cm over the regular AWD model.|$|E
25|$|Aerodynamic {{downforce}} slowly gained {{importance in}} car design from {{the appearance of}} aerofoils during the late 1960s. During the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics (previously used on Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J during 1970) that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. So great were the aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track (up to five times the car's weight), extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant <b>ride</b> <b>height,</b> leaving the suspension virtually solid, depending entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning {{of the car and}} driver from irregularities of the road surface.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{intends to}} provide new {{insight into the}} aerodynamics of wings in ground effect under dynamic motion. This work represents a new step forward {{in the field of}} race car aerodynamics, in which steady aerodynamics are well understood. As the first comprehensive study on oscillating wings in ground effect, several modes of oscillation were studied numerically, including heaving, pitching and combined motion of an airfoil and heaving of a wing fitted with endplates. A wide range of reduced frequencies were tested for the simulations at different <b>ride</b> <b>heights,</b> which showed appreciable differences with respect to a stationary wing. The flowfield around the airfoil was obtained by solving the Reynolds-Averaged Navier- Stokes equations, while Detached Eddy Simulation was used for the wing. A dynamic mesh model was implemented to adapt the grid to the wing motion. The results showed other aerodynamic mechanisms in addition to the ground effect, namely the effective incidence and added mass. Stall can be postponed to lower <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> by increasing the frequency of heaving, while a pitching airfoil can stall below the static stall incidence when placed close to the ground. A stability analysis showed that flutter can occur at low frequencies in heaving motion but increasing the frequency always stabilises the motion. The behaviour of the vortex formed on the inboard face of the endplate is altered by the heaving motion and has an important effect on the downforce generation. Vortex breakdown can be induced or suppressed depending on the frequency and effective incidence. At high frequencies, these vortices interact with counter-rotating trailing edge vortices to form vortex loops that transform into omega vortices in the wake. Additional experiments for a stationary wing serve to qualitatively validate and complement the reference cases. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|A {{handful of}} GTRs {{were not only}} bought by private owners, but also {{extensively}} modified by McLaren to make them street-legal machines. In order to meet regulations, the cars were required to have their <b>ride</b> <b>heights</b> increased, {{as well as a}} change from a racing fuel tank and inlet to a more traditional tank and fuel cap. The air restrictor on the engine was also removed, allowing the BMW engines to produce their full potential power. Comforts such as the production car's sound deadening system, and even sometimes the two passenger seats, were left out of the car. These modified McLaren F1 GTRs are considered the ultimate versions of the road car, since they weigh considerably less {{than any of the other}} street cars. Several F1 GTRs in this form are still driven today.|$|R
