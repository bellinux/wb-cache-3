50|$|The main {{advantage}} of carton flow rack over static <b>rack</b> or <b>shelving</b> systems is that merchandise remains better organized {{and easier to}} find or pick. With carton flow rack, the product is automatically rotated on a first-in, first-out basis. Merchandise is stocked {{in the rear of}} the carton flow rack and moves toward the picking station in front on an inclined shelf equipped with specially designed roller track. When a carton is removed from the picking station, the next one in line rolls to the front. Carton flow always keeps items within reach. Inventory is easier to monitor and control since products are fully visible at all times.|$|R
5000|$|Dematic {{began in}} 1819 in Wetter, Germany with the {{founding}} of , which was incorporated 1910 by [...] (Demag) and 1973 by Mannesmann. After the acquisition of U.S. Rapistan (specialised in conveyor systems), Mannesmann DEMAG FÃ¶rdertechnik AG was established. In 1993, Australian <b>racking</b> and <b>shelving</b> manufacturer Colby was added, and in 1997 the company was renamed to Mannesmann Dematic AG. Four years later, Siemens bought the company and merged it with its own logistics activities to form Siemens Dematic AG. In 2006 Siemens carved out the industrial and distribution logistics portion as Dematic GmbH & Co. KG. In the same year, the investment firm Triton acquired the majority of shares.|$|R
50|$|By {{reducing}} {{the need for}} equipment and additional labor, disposable foodservice packaging is an economical alternative to multiuse items and {{eliminates the need for}} dishwashers and other support equipment (<b>racks,</b> carts, dollies, <b>shelving,</b> bins) It can also save money on water and energy used by dishwashers and can eliminates the need to replace reusables that are broken, damaged, stolen or accidentally discarded.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of {{damage on the}} load-carrying capacity of thin-walled steel columns with channel sections is investigated. The axial load-carrying capacity is evaluated for different profiles, and different damage magnitudes are dealt with. The profiles selected for the analysis are commonly used as upright members in <b>rack</b> and <b>shelving</b> systems in industry. The type of damage corresponds primarily to truck impacts. The strategy presented, however, is generally applicable to different types of profiles, and suitable for parameter studies {{of different types of}} damage, load cases, and boundary conditions. The main part of the analysis consists of numerical simulations using the finite-element method, but a verifying laboratory test series is also presented. The results of the numerical simulations are in good agreement with the laboratory tests, and show that even very small defects in the thin-walled columns significantly reduce the axial load-carrying capacity...|$|R
50|$|The {{seeds are}} stored in sealed three-ply foil packages, then placed into plastic tote {{containers}} on metal <b>shelving</b> <b>racks.</b> The storage rooms are kept at -18 C. The low temperature and limited access to oxygen will ensure low metabolic activity and delay seed aging. The permafrost surrounding the facility will help maintain the low temperature of the seeds should the electricity supply fail. In the years since its opening, the vault saw minor water intrusion at its entrance during the annual spring permafrost thawing; warmer temperatures and heavy rainfall in October 2016 caused significantly greater amounts of water to inundate the entrance, but the facility's design ensured that the water froze after several meters and the seeds were not endangered.|$|R
50|$|Professional sheet pans used in {{commercial}} kitchens typically {{are made of}} aluminum, with a 1 in raised lip around the edge, and in the United States come in standard sizes. The full-size sheet pan is 26 by 18 in, which is too large for most home ovens. A two thirds sheet pan (also {{referred to as a}} three quarter size sheet pan) is 21 by 15 in. A half sheet pan is 18 by 13 in; quarter sheets are 9 by 13 in. The half sheet is approximately the same size as mass-market baking sheets found in supermarkets, and the quarter sheet is a common size for rectangular, single-layer cakes. Other commercial kitchen equipment, such as cooling <b>racks,</b> ovens, and <b>shelving,</b> is made to fit these standard pans.|$|R
40|$|RATU PIRAKAS" The Paralon Pipe Shoe Shelf is {{the latest}} {{innovation}} that utilizes used paralon pipes as thebasic material for making shoe <b>racks.</b> Shoe <b>shelving</b> can reduce waste or be environmentally friendly and canincrease income for students. "RATU PIRAKAS" The Paralon Pipe Shoe Shelf was developed as a brilliantstudent idea, to reduce waste from households that are widely available in Semarang. So with the productcreativity {{of students in the}} form of "RATU PIRAKAS" this can recycle paralon pipe waste into goods that areready to use, high selling value and environmentally friendly. The method used to make used parallel pipes is tomake a shoe rack design, collect used paralon pipes, cut paralon pipes, wash and sandpipe paralon pipes, rack updesigns, paint shelves, and pack. So far the resulting product has been good, but no one has been sold due to themarketing process that has not been widespread, especially among the general public. Some problems encountered in the process of making "RATU PIRAKAS" this is the lack of manpower for the work, lack of coordination between members and the timing of unscheduled work. Our hope, student creativity products in the form: "RATU PIRAKAS" Pallet Shoe Shelf Paralon Used, acceptable to the community, and can increase student income. In addition creativity made from paralon pipes used to contribute to save the world from environmental pollution by using household waste that now generates a lot of waste in the form of used paralon pipes...|$|R
30|$|The system {{boundaries}} of an LCA determine which components and processes {{are to be}} included in the assessment. In this case, this includes components of the storage medium, the built structure, and technical components up to the point of hand over to the grid. For the pumped hydropower store, this includes the reservoirs and the water contained within them as storage medium, other built structures such as the underground turbine hall, all necessary services for the turbine hall such as lighting, ventilation, etc., the tunnel penstock and the surge tank. Furthermore, the technical components of the pumps, turbines, cabling, management system, and switchgear and transformers are included. For the utility-scale battery, the battery cells and battery casing make up the storage medium. The built structures include the industrial hall with <b>shelving</b> <b>racks</b> and trays, which house the battery units, as well as building services for heating, cooling, ventilation, and lighting.

40|$|Among {{the various}} types of {{industrial}} solutions used to store goods and products, the light duty hand loaded <b>shelving</b> <b>rack</b> (SR) typology represents a very popular solution for domestic applications, libraries and for superstores/markets open to the public. Despite the limited cost, an eventual collapse could result in significant damage of stored goods, injuries, and potentially the loss of human life, with the possible consequence of a long suspension of commercial activities. This reflects directly on the great importance of a correct design that, despite the large use of SRs, is nowadays developed with approaches characterized by inadequate levels of reliability. A research program on SRs is currently in progress in Italy, with the aim of improving the rules for both static and seismic design and this article presents a combined experimental-numerical study. Both component and pushover tests have been carried out, that are shortly summarized. Overall frame response has been simulated by means of advanced finite element software able to capture key features of the nonlinear response of slender frames with mono-symmetric cross-section members...|$|R
