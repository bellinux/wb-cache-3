25|$|In Bahrain {{uprising}} {{which started}} on February 14, 2011, Facebook was utilized by the Bahraini regime {{as well as}} <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists</b> to identify, capture and prosecute citizens involved in the protests. A 20-year-old woman named Ayat Al Qurmezi {{was identified as a}} protester using Facebook, taken from her home by masked commandos and put in prison.|$|R
50|$|The {{events of}} February 2 {{also led to}} {{allegations}} {{that members of the}} NDP funded and coordinated the activities of the <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists</b> who attacked demonstrators in Tahrir. The investigations of the fact-finding panel confirmed that two MPs from the NDP were involved. Both were named by Al-Ahram as Youssef Khatab and Abdulnasser el-Gabri and they were arrested on March 10.|$|R
50|$|During the Libyan Civil War, both <b>regime</b> <b>loyalist</b> {{forces as}} well as the anti-Gaddafi forces used {{technicals}} extensively. The type of warfare that had been carried out in the conflict—wherein highly mobile groups of soldiers and rebels continued to move to and from on the desert terrain, retreating at a time and then suddenly attacking to regain control of small towns and villages in the Eastern rebel held parts of Libya—had led to the technical becoming a vehicle of choice for both sides.|$|E
50|$|Operation Ivy Blizzard is a comprehensive, coordinated and {{offensive}} regiment of isolation of insurgents and extremists. The {{purpose of this}} objective is to deny anti-Coalition elements freedom of movement, communication and organization while providing innocent citizens a stable environment free from reprisals and indiscriminate violence of former <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists.</b> Swift, decisive action will be taken against those who flagrantly disregard {{the rule of law}} and commit crimes against the Coalition and their fellow Iraqis.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2003, 2-319 {{deployed}} {{in support of}} the 2nd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division, to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) I.

5000|$|Tens of {{thousands}} {{took part in}} a protest that stretched for over five kilometers (three miles) along Budaiya highway against union plans with Saudi Arabia. Protesters chanted slogans such as [...] "Bahrain is not for sale", [...] "No unity, no unity" [...] and held signs demanding self-determination. They also expressed their solidarity with Isa Qassim, Bahrain's Shia top religious leader who was recently attacked by <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists</b> in newspapers. Al Wefaq estimated the number of participants at 300,000 - more than 50% of Bahraini citizens.|$|R
50|$|The {{division}} did not deploy in time {{to start}} the invasion but joined it as a follow-on force in April 2003, attacking toward Tikrit and Mosul, and later {{played a major role}} during in the occupation. Following the invasion and conclusion of major combat operations, the division was then headquartered in Tikrit, an especially dangerous location due to a higher population of <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists.</b> In July 2003, the 4th Infantry Division was involved in the so-called Hood event. In a major accomplishment late in the deployment, Odierno's troops captured Saddam Hussein in December 2003.|$|R
5000|$|Anti-Gaddafi forces {{surrounded}} the city during September 2011 {{and began a}} long, difficult battle there, hoping to bring the war to an end. On 20 October, after suffering massive casualties during a siege that lasted over a month, NTC fighters mounted a major offensive and {{took control of the}} last remaining district of Sirte, [...] "Number Two", that was in the hands of <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists.</b> Muammar Gaddafi attempted to flee the city, but he was injured and captured by fighters. He was killed in custody less than an hour later.|$|R
50|$|TF Rifles {{successfully}} performed many missions {{ranging from}} offensive operations to civil affairs operations. Daily activities include reconnaissance, security patrols, escort duty, static security, and presence patrols. Killing or capturing former <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists,</b> securing mass grave sites, {{as well as}} restoring law and order by assisting Iraqi National Police was also accomplished by TF Rifles. The 3rd ACR was focused on securing weapons caches between Lake Tharthar and the Euphrates River, and managed to detain several high-value-targets on the Defense Intelligence Agency blacklist. TF Rifles also assisted in training the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (ICDC), and managed to train over 3,000 recruits.|$|R
5|$|The rebels {{launched}} the coup {{in response to}} Diệm's autocratic rule and the negative political influence of his brother Ngô Đình Nhu and his sister-in-law Madame Nhu. They also bemoaned the politicisation of the military, whereby <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists</b> {{who were members of}} the Ngô family's covert Cần Lao Party were readily promoted ahead of more competent officers who were not insiders. Đông was supported in the conspiracy by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, whose uncle was a prominent official in a minor opposition party. The main link in the coup was Đông's commanding officer Thi, whom he persuaded to join the plot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{situation}} however quickly deteriorated into a widescale uprising, {{with various}} insurgency campaigns consolidating into an armed tribal struggles, both between the armed opposition and terror groups vs. {{the government and}} among themselves. Eventually a Saudi-brokered agreement on Saleh's resignation and 2012 Presidential election saw the installation of Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi as an interim President. Hadi has been presiding over political reform and national reconciliation and was supposed to serve only {{two years in the}} post. On November 2013 U.N. envoy Jamal Benomar told The Associated Press Hadi will remain president after February 2014 because the transition {{is not likely to be}} completed earlier due to [...] "obstruction" [...] from former <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "In April of 2003, the National Library and Archives (Dar al-Kutub wa al-Watha’Iq), {{which was}} located {{directly}} across from the Ministry of Defense, had been burned and looted". The burning and looting appeared {{to have taken place}} on two occasions: April 10 and April 12-13. These fires were set professionally with accelerants. A report was later given by Saad Eskander, the director-general of the National Library and Archive, regarding the destruction. He noted that three days before the invasion, library staff were told to destroy all archival material related to the Ba'athist rule. Eskander also reported that the destruction was performed by “a mix of poor people looking for a quick profit, along with <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists</b> intent on destroying evidence of atrocities”.|$|R
50|$|The {{prosecution}} reported that, upon {{examining the}} sites where demonstrators were shot at, empty bullet-casings {{were found on}} the rooftops of buildings surrounding Tahrir Square, including the American University of Cairo (AUC). The AUC was closed at that time and it is believed that armed officers and <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists</b> had stormed the buildings and shot at the demonstrators. A similar scenario was reported in the area surrounding the Ministry of Interior in Cairo, where demonstrators were shot at from its roof. On March 10 Ismail el-Shaer, the former security chief of Cairo, was interviewed by prosecutors regarding these incidents. This was followed by the arrest of former Egyptian deputy interior minister Adly Fayed, chief of state security Hassan Abdulrahman, and chief of central security Ahmed Ramzy. All three were placed in custody for 15 days beginning on March 11.|$|R
5000|$|Theology {{departments}} {{continued to}} operate under strict admission quotas, and staffing problems grew throughout the 1970s. Chief Rabbi Richard Feder died in 1970, leaving the Czech Jewish communities without rabbinical direction until 1984. (Slovakia's rabbi was Samuel Grossman.) The new chief rabbi for the country, Daniel Mayer, studied for the rabbinate in Budapest. In 1972 {{the death of}} three Roman Catholic bishops and the revocation of state approval of a fourth exacerbated the already acute shortage of Roman Catholic leaders. Talks between the Vatican and the regime were sporadic through the 1970s and produced few material gains for Czechoslovak Roman Catholics. The perennial conflict remained: the appointment of <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists</b> in opposition to choices for parish and diocesan posts. In 1986, out of thirteen church offices, nine bishoprics were vacant and two archbishoprics (Olomouc and Trnava) had only bishops holding office.|$|R
5000|$|On 19 October 2011, Libya's unelected prime {{minister}} Mahmoud Jibril {{said that the}} former leader {{was believed to be}} in the southern desert, reestablishing his government among pro-Gaddafi tribes in the region. By that point the NTC had just taken control of the pro-Gaddafi town of Bani Walid and were close to taking control of Gaddafi's home town, the tribal heartland of Sirte east of Tripoli. According to most accounts, Gaddafi had been with heavily armed <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists</b> in several buildings in Sirte for several months as NTC forces took the city. Mansour Dhao, a member of Gaddafi's inner circle and leader of the regime's People's Guard, said that Gaddafi was [...] "very delusional" [...] and complained about the lack of electricity and water. Attempts to persuade him to flee the country and give up power were ignored. As the last loyalist district of Sirte fell, Gaddafi {{and other members of the}} government attempted to flee.|$|R

2500|$|The King disliked paperwork, {{and had no}} solid {{view for}} the economy. He was dubbed the [...] "fundraiser-in-chief": {{throughout}} his reign he managed to obtain foreign aid from different sources, leaving a legacy of a foreign aid-dependent Jordan. British aid in the early 1950s, American aid from 1957 onwards, Gulf aid in the 1960s and 1970s, Arab League and Iraqi aid in the early 1980s, and, after formalizing peace with Israel, American aid in the 1990s. He was also seen as too lenient toward some ministers who were alleged to be corrupt. The price of establishing peace with Israel he had to pay domestically, with mounting Jordanian opposition to Israel concentrating its criticism on the King. The King reacted by introducing restrictions on freedom of speech, and changing the electoral law into the one-man, one-vote system {{in a bid to}} increase representation from independent <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists</b> and tribal groups at the expense of Islamist and partisan candidates. The moves impeded Jordan's path towards democracy that had started in 1956 and resumed in 1989.|$|R

40|$|The stakes for the United States in the Iraq {{insurgency}} {{have grown}} {{since the end}} of major combat operations was declared more than a year ago, and it becomes steadily more difficult to maintain that it is fighting a few disaffected criminals, former <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists</b> and terrorists. While each of these groups may be included in the various insurgent groups, the United States is now dealing with an insurgency that appears entrenched and increasingly well organized amidst what is an at best ambivalent population that likes the fact that Saddam is gone but also now increasingly views the United States as an occupying force and wants it gone. The United States now faces a daunting task in trying to regain the strategic initiative [...] indeed it may be impossible at this point. But as a critical first step, planners must come to a realistic appraisal {{of the nature of the}} security environment inside Iraq at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. After this appraisal, policy and military options can be realistically evaluated and measured in the context of available resources...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the protests were {{triggered}} by a troubling economic situation, the crowds' demands became political. Protesters accused Zaid Al-Rifai's government of rampant corruption and demanded that the martial law in place since 1957 be lifted and parliamentary elections be resumed. The last parliamentary election had taken place in 1967, just before Jordan lost the West Bank, and when the parliament's tenure ended in 1971, no elections could be held due to {{the fact that}} the West Bank was under Israeli occupation, but the West Bank's status became irrelevant after Jordan's disengagement in 1988. Hussein relented to the demands by dismissing Al-Rifai, and appointed Zaid ibn Shaker to form a new government. In 1986 a new electoral law was passed, which allowed the reintroduction of parliamentary elections to proceed smoothly. The cabinet passed amendments to the electoral law that removed articles dealing with West Bank representation. In May 1989, just before the elections, Hussein announced his intention to appoint a 60-person royal commission to draft a reformist document named the National Charter. The National Charter sought to set a timetable for democratization acts. Although most members of the commission were <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists,</b> it included a number of opposition figures and critics. Parliamentary elections were held on 8November 1989, the first in 22 years. The National Charter was drafted and ratified by parliament in 1991.|$|R

Military and civil authorities in the province fractured into [...] "New Kirin" [...] adherents of the Xi Qia <b>regime</b> and <b>loyalist</b> [...] "Old Kirin" [...] elements in opposition to it; the former predominated near the capital and the latter predominating in Harbin and the rugged hinterland {{to the north and}} east.|$|R
5000|$|Soon, <b>regime</b> <b>loyalists</b> regrouped {{and went}} on an {{offensive}} to reclaim the cities. They were helped {{by the fact that}} about half of tanks of the elite and politically reliable Republican Guard managed to escape from the Saddam-proclaimed [...] "mother of all battles" [...] in Kuwait and that the Guard headquarters units also survived the war. In addition, the Gulf War ceasefire agreement of March 3 prohibited the Iraqi military's use of fixed-wing aircraft over the country, but allowed them to fly helicopters because most bridges had been destroyed. This was because General Norman Schwarzkopf accepted the request of an Iraqi general to fly helicopters, including armed gunships, to transport government officials because of destroyed transport infrastructure, acting without Pentagon or White House instructions; almost immediately, the Iraqis began using the helicopters as gunships to put down the uprisings. The outgunned rebels had few heavy weapons and few surface-to-air missiles, which made them almost defenseless against helicopter gunships and indiscriminate artillery barrages when the Ba'athists responded to the uprisings with crushing force. According to Human Rights Watch, [...] "in their attempts to retake cities, and after consolidating control, loyalist forces killed thousands of anyone who opposes them whether a rebel or a civilian by firing indiscriminately into the opposing areas; executing them on the streets, in homes and in hospitals; rounding up suspects, especially young men, during house-to-house searches, and arresting them with or without charge or shooting them en masse; and using helicopters to attack those who try to flee the cities." ...|$|R
50|$|The group sent a {{man named}} Russel Blackwell (using the {{pseudonym}} Rosalio Negrete) to Spain during {{the early part of}} the Spanish Civil War, who made contacts to the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) left wing. Later they sent Oehler, who was present during the May 1937 suppression of the anti-Stalinist Left. Oehler and Negrete were both imprisoned by the <b>Loyalist</b> <b>regime,</b> and only returned to the US after the intervention of the US embassy.|$|R
50|$|Even as Jesuits in {{northern}} and central China were successfully switching their loyalties from the fallen Ming Dynasty {{to the newly}} established Qing, the Jesuits {{in the south of}} the country continued to work with the Ming <b>loyalist</b> <b>regimes</b> still controlling some of the region. Accordingly, in 1649 Boym was sent by the Canton-based Vice-Provincial of the China Mission Alvaro Semedo with a diplomatic mission to the court of the Yongli Emperor, the last Chinese ruler of the Ming Dynasty, still controlling parts of the Southwestern China.|$|R
50|$|Georgia had two rival governments {{during the}} American Revolutionary War: the {{appointed}} <b>Loyalist</b> <b>regime</b> of James Wright and the Patriot administration, initially led by planter Archibald Bulloch. After escaping revolutionary forces, Wright fled the colony in 1776 but organized a return in 1778 backed by British military force. After the war, he left again in 1782, evacuating with British forces following {{the end of}} hostilities and victory by the rebels. The British also evacuated thousands of slaves to whom they had promised freedom if they left rebel masters. They were resettled in the Caribbean and London.|$|R
50|$|After {{his return}} to China, Semedo served in Guangzhou (Canton) as the Vice-Provincial of the Jesuit China Mission. During several years {{after the fall of}} Beijing to the Manchus in 1644, he {{continued}} to work with the Ming <b>loyalist</b> <b>regimes</b> in the Southern China (notably, sending Michał Boym to the court of the Southern Ming Yongli Emperor), even as most of Jesuits elsewhere in China were switching their loyalty to the recently established Qing Dynasty. Once the Qing took Canton, Semedo was detained, but was freed a few months later, reportedly due to the interference of Beijing-based Johann Adam Schall von Bell. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in Guangzhou, where he died.|$|R
500|$|During Hu's lifetime, the Ming dynasty, {{which had}} ruled China for over 250 years, was overthrown and {{replaced}} by China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing. Following {{the fall of the}} capital Beijing in 1644, remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a Ming <b>loyalist</b> <b>regime</b> in Nanjing with Zhu Yousong on the throne as the Hongguang Emperor. Hu, who was noted for his seal-carving and facility with seal script, [...] created a seal for the new Emperor. The court offered him the position of Drafter for the Secretariat (zhongshu sheren, [...] ) as a reward, but he did not accept the role (although he did accord himself the title of zhongshu sheren in some of his subsequent personal seals).|$|R
25|$|The Armistice with Germany on the Western Front {{revolutionized}} Romania's positioning {{and brought}} Marghiloman's administration to a standstill. On {{the very day}} of the Armistice, Bassarabescu handed in his resignation. The <b>loyalist</b> <b>regime</b> which took over suspended Bassarabescu from his teaching post, and subjected him to a military inquiry. He was eventually cleared, even praised for his efforts as Prefect, and allowed to resume his work in education. He also resumed his literary activity, {{which resulted in the}} 1919 volume Un dor împlinit ("A Satisfied Longing", Steinberg Publishers), followed in 1923 by another Socec edition of Nuvele and Moș Stan ("Old Man Stan", Editura Cultura Națională).

It is the last standing home place in North Carolina for which a county was named. In addition to fighting at the Battle of Kings Mountain, Colonel McDowell served in the 3rd U.S. Congress of 1793-95. He was a son of [...] "Hunting" [...] John McDowell, who received a Royal Land Grant from Governor Tryon on December 22, 1767 for 640 acre on the Catawba River, a portion of which is the site of this home.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, the Southern Ming had {{not been}} eliminated. When Hangzhou fell to the Qing on 6 July 1645, the Prince of Tang Zhu Yujian, a ninth-generation {{descendant}} of Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang, managed to escape by land to the southeastern province of Fujian. Crowned as the Longwu Emperor in the coastal city of Fuzhou on 18 August, he depended on the protection of talented seafarer Zheng Zhilong (also known as [...] "Nicholas Iquan"). The childless emperor adopted Zheng's eldest son and granted him the imperial surname. [...] "Koxinga," [...] as this son is known to Westerners, is a distortion of the title [...] "Lord of the Imperial Surname" [...] (Guoxingye 國姓爺). In the mean time another Ming claimant, the Prince of Lu Zhu Yihai, had named himself regent in Zhejiang, but the two <b>loyalist</b> <b>regimes</b> failed to cooperate, making their chances of success even lower than they already were.|$|R
500|$|From 1643 to 1650, {{political}} power lay {{mostly in the}} hands of Dorgon. Under his leadership, the Qing Empire conquered most of the territory of the fallen Ming dynasty (1368–1644), chased Ming <b>loyalist</b> <b>regimes</b> deep into the southwestern provinces, and established the basis of Qing rule over China despite highly unpopular policies such as the [...] "hair cutting command" [...] of 1645, which forced Qing subjects to shave their forehead and braid their remaining hair into a queue resembling that of the Manchus. After Dorgon's death {{on the last day of}} 1650, the young Shunzhi Emperor started to rule personally. He tried, with mixed success, to fight corruption and to reduce the political influence of the Manchu nobility. In the 1650s, he faced a resurgence of Ming loyalist resistance, but by 1661 his armies had defeated the Qing Empire's last enemies, seafarer Koxinga (1624–1662) and the Prince of Gui (1623–1662) of the Southern Ming dynasty, both of whom would succumb the following year. The Shunzhi Emperor died at the age of 22 of smallpox, a highly contagious disease that was endemic in China, but against which the Manchus had no immunity. He was succeeded by his third son Xuanye, who had already survived smallpox, and who reigned for sixty years under the era name [...] "Kangxi" [...] (hence he was known as the Kangxi Emperor). Because fewer documents have survived from the Shunzhi era than from later eras of the Qing dynasty, the Shunzhi era is a relatively little-known period of Qing history.|$|R
