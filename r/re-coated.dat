The timber will have been treated in one of two ways: dip treatment and pressure treatment. Dip-treated sheds are made from components that are lowered into a tank of preservative before the panels are assembled. This is a quick and simple process which keeps costs down and encourages manufacturers to produce a wide variety, making dip-treated sheds the most popular and affordable type on the market. They are easily recognisable by their golden brown colour, which is due to a dye added to the preservative.

40|$|Sol-gel {{coatings}} {{are used}} on the OMEGA laser optics as anti-reflection (AR) coatings to maximize their transmittance. Over time, trace organic compounds in the laser bay contaminate these sol-gel coatings, reducing their efficiency as AR coatings. Consequently, the optics must be removed, cleaned and <b>re-coated</b> with the sol-gel AR approximately every three months. In April of 2005 Y. Xu et al 1 demonstrated that changing the chemical composition of the sol-gel would reduce its susceptibility to contamination. In the work reported here, dimethyldiethoxysilane (DDS) and methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) were used to modify standard sol-gel solutions based on tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) {{in order to increase}} its resistance to contamination by volatile and semi-volatile contaminants. The methyl groups in the added components reduce the number of active OH groups available for hydrogen bond formation with contaminants in the air.

40|$|The use of dark roofs affects cooling {{and heating}} energy use in {{buildings}} and the urban climate. At the building scale, dark roofs are heated by the summer sun and thus raise the summertime air-conditioning (a/c) demand. For highly-absorptive (low-albedo) roofs {{the difference between the}} surface and ambient air temperatures may be as high as 90 F on a summer afternoon. While for less absorptive (high-albedo) surfaces with similar insulative properties, such as roofs covered with a white coating, the difference is only about 20 F. For this reason, cool roofs (which absorb little insolation) can be effective in reducing cooling energy use. Earlier studies have suggested that cool roofs incur no additional cost if color changes are incorporated into routine re-roofing and re-surfacing schedules. There is a sizable body of measured data (primarily collected for residential sector) documenting energy-saving effects of cool roofs as shown. Both measured data and simulations clearly demonstrate that increasing the albedo of roofs is an attractive (and cost-effective) way of reducing the net radiative heat gains through the roof and hence, reducing building cooling loads. To change the albedo, the rooftops of buildings may be painted with reflective coatings or covered with a new light-colored material. Since most roofs have regular maintenance schedules or need to be re-roofed or <b>re-coated</b> periodically, the change of the albedo should be done then. In that case, the cost would be limited to the incremental cost associated with the high-albedo material. In buildings and climates with significant air-conditioning use, increasing the albedo of roofs will reduce energy use and produce a stream of savings immediately...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two basic}} areas of {{interest}} for diffractive optics. In the first, the property of wavefront division is exploited for achieving optical fanout, analogous to the more familiar electrical fanout of electronic circuitry. The basic {{problem here is that}} when using a simple uniform diffraction grating the energy input is divided unevenly among the output beams. The other area of interest is the use of diffractive elements to replace or supplement standard refractive elements such as lenses. Again, local grating variations can be used to control the amount of bending imparted to optical rays, and the efficiency of the diffractive element will depend on how closely the element can be matched to the design requirements. In general, production restrictions limit how closely the element approaches the design, and for the common case of photolithographic production, a series of binary masks is required to achieve high efficiency. The actual design process is much more involved than in the case of elements for optical fanout, as the desired phase of the optical wavefront over some reference plane must be specified and the phase alteration to be introduced at each point by the diffraction element must be known. This generally requires the utilization of a standard optical design program. Two approaches are possible. In the first approach, the diffractive element is treated as a special type of lens and the ordinary optical design equations are used. Optical design programs tend to follow a second approach, namely, using the equations of optical interference derived from holographic theory and then allowing the introduction of phase front corrections in the form of polynomial equations. By using either of these two methods, diffractive elements can be used not only to compensate for distortions such as chromatic or spherical aberration, but also to perform the work of a variety of other optical elements such as null correctors, beam shapers, etc. The main focus of the project described in this report is how the design information from the lens design program is incorporated into the photolithographic process. It is shown that the MANN program, a photolithographic mask generator, fills the need for a link between lens design programs and mask generation controllers. The generated masks can be used to expose a resist-coated substrate which is etched and then must be <b>re-coated,</b> re-exposed, and re-etched for making copies, just as in the electronics industry...|$|E
40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cells}} (PEFCs) {{have long been}} {{thought of as a}} promising clean alternative energy electrochemical device. They are lightweight, highly efficient, modular and scalable devices. A fuel such as H 2 or methanol that can be readily produced {{from a variety of sources}} can be utilized in PEFCs to generate electricity with low or no emissions. Despite these advantages, fuel cell technologies have failed to reach mass commercialization mainly due to short operational lifetimes and the high cost of materials. In particular, the polymer membrane and the catalyst layer have been problematic in reducing the material cost. Currently, platinum is the dominant material used to catalyze fuel cell reactions. However platinum is very expensive and scarce. In order to pursue the mass commercialization of fuel cells, two methods have been proposed: 1) increasing the utilization of platinum to lower the loading required, and 2) replacing platinum completely with a non-precious material. The latter has been suggested to be the long term solution due to the increasing cost of platinum. This thesis explores the elimination of platinum through the use of nanostructured non-precious metal catalysts for polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Several catalysts have been synthesized without the use of platinum that are active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which occurs at the cathode. Three different synthetic techniques were utilized using different nitrogen precursors. Aside from the different nitrogen precursors, each set of experiments utilize a different approach to optimize the oxygen reduction performance. Different characterization techniques are used to learn more about the ORR on non-precious metal fuel cells. The first experiment utilizes ethylenediamine, a well-known nitrogen precursor for non-precious metal fuel cell catalysts. Ethylenediamine is deposited onto two different porous carbon black substrates to determine the effectiveness of different porosities in creating active sites for the ORR. Of the two carbon black species, Ketjenblack EC- 600 JD and Ketjenblack ED- 300 J, the former was found to be more porous and effective. This result was mainly attributed to the increased surface area of the carbon black which allowed for better dispersion and a greater active site density. In this experiment, the coating of ethylenediamine on carbon black was also refluxed for 3 hours prior to the pyrolysis. It was found that refluxed catalyst samples showed much improved performance than catalyst samples without this procedural modification. The next experiment utilized cyanamide as a nitrogen precursor. Cyanamide was chosen due to its ability to form larger amounts of pyridinic nitrogen on the surface of the catalyst after a high temperature pyrolysis stage. The catalysts were heat-treated at 1000 oC and the performance was measured. NH 3 was introduced during the pyrolysis, which could remove the excess coating from the carbon surface, and increase the surface area of the catalyst by unblocking the carbon pores. A third modification to the procedure was carried out, where the heat-treated sample was ball-milled, <b>re-coated,</b> and heat-treated again in ammonia conditions to increase the nitrogen functionalities and increase the active site density. The performance was slightly increased from the original heat-treated sample. However due to the decreased surface area, the limiting current density also decreased. It was believed that ball-milling the sample crushed the pores within the catalyst sample, thereby lowering the active surface area and thus the current density. Therefore, the last sample was prepared similarly to the procedure for the third sample, but without ball-milling. This sample had restored surface area and improved ORR performance over all the synthesized catalyst samples – these experiments allowed for important realizations regarding the nature of the Fe-cyanamide-KJ 600 catalysts and allowed for a drastic improvement in onset and half-wave potentials from the first catalyst. The final experiment discussed in this thesis describes the work done with 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetracyanobenzene and tetracyanoethylene as phthalcyanine precursors for non-precious metal catalysts (NPMCs). Iron(II) acetate was mixed with these phthalocyanine precursors to form polymer sheets of iron phthalocyanine or its monomeric units. By the creation of these polymer sheets of iron phthalocyanine, it allowed for a uniform distribution of iron centres on the surface of the carbon after a heat-treatment step. This allowed for high active site density through the design of these sheet polymers and prevented agglomeration or blockage of active sites which is thought to be a common problem in the synthesis of many NPMCs. Both tetracyanobenzene and tetracyanoethylene as precursors were tested. The tetracyanobenzene catalyst was heat-treated at different temperature ranging from 700 - 1100 oC and characterized through electrochemical tests for the ORR. As an overall conclusion to this work, several catalyst samples were made and different approaches were successfully employed to improve the ORR performance. Of the synthesis treatments utilized to improve performance, each specific catalyst had different parameters to tweak in order to improve ORR performance. With X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, conclusions were also specific to the catalysts structure and synthesis procedure, however quaternary and pyrrolic nitrogen groups seemed to play an influential role to the ORR final performance. Although relative amount of pyridinic nitrogen was not seen to increase with increasing catalyst performance during the studies; it may still play an essential role in the reduction of oxygen on the catalyst surface. The author of this work has not ruled out that possibility. Several recommendations for future work were suggested to broaden the knowledge and understanding of nanostructure non-precious metal catalysts to design a high performing, durable, and low-cost alternative to platinum based catalysts...|$|E
