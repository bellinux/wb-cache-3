40|$|Does the Charter of Rights and Freedoms {{apply to}} private action? Does it {{apply to the}} courts? Does it apply to the common law? The Supreme Court of Canada in Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union v. Dolphin Delivery (1986) 1 has {{addressed}} {{each of these three}} fundamental questions. The facts of the case were these. Dolphin Delivery was a courier company. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represented the employees of another courier company, Purolator Courier, threatened to picket the premises of Dolphin Delivery. The purpose of the picketing was to publicize an industrial dispute between the union and Purolator. Dolphin Delivery was not a party to that dispute, thus the picketing of Dolphin Delivery 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premises</b> would have been 2 ̆ 2 secondary picketing. 2 ̆ 2 Dolphin Delivery sought and obtained from the courts of British Columbia an injunction to restrain the union from picketing Dolphin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premises.</b> The ground upon which the injunction was granted was that secondary picketing in the circumstances of this case would constitute the common law tort of inducing a breach of contract. There was a prohibition on secondary picketing in the B. C. Labour Code, but this statutory prohibition did not apply, because the applicable labour law was federal (in view of Purolator 2 ̆ 7 s interprovincial operations), and the Canada Labour Code was silent on secondary picketing, leaving it to be regulated by the common law. In the Supreme Court of Canada, the union argued that the injunction ought to be set aside on the ground that it limited freedom of expression, guaranteed under s. 2 (b) of the Charter. The Supreme Court of Canada, sitting as a seven-judge bench, held unanimously that the injunction should stand. McIntyre J., with the concurrence of Dickson C. J., Estey, Chouinard and Le Dain JJ., wrote the principal opinion, holding that the Charter did not apply to private action of the kind involved in this case.

40|$|Significant {{discussion}} has recently {{centered on the}} revolutionary performance capabilities of GaN based power devices compared to the incumbent silicon-based alternatives. It has been frequently demonstrated that such GaN based HEMTs provide remarkably improved performance of essentially any power conversion circuit in terms of density and efficiency. The development of thick, crack-free GaN epitaxy on standard thickness Si substrates, together with device fabrication in high volume silicon CMOS factories, has opened the potential for highly cost-competitive high voltage devices as well. The simultaneous combination of advantages in efficiency, density, and cost over silicon based devices presents an apparently overwhelming compelling competitive advantage, which should drive rapid and widespread adoption throughout the power electronics industry. However, little {{discussion has}} occurred regarding the quality, robustness and reliability of these 600 V rated GaN-on-Si based devices. Some proponents of SiC devices have suggested that such GaN devices cannot be reliable, due to the 10 9 cm- 2 threading dislocations present, caused by the significant lattice mismatch between the epitaxial film and substrate. Others have shown catastrophic failure mechanisms thought {{to be caused by}} reverse piezoelectric phenomenon. To date, the simultaneous achievement of long-term robustness under applied fields and stability of device on-resistance under fast switching conditions has not been presented.

Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985). In other words, the tensions surrounding political, economic, and social upheaval send individuals scurrying to categorize and explain the new world confronting them. Certainly, the boom-and-bust economy of nineteenth-century France generated such anxieties. Interestingly, many of those fears focused on female sexuality, a topic that might seem remote from the debates over living wages for working-class men or the appearance of new credit mechanisms. The problem that interests Thompson is twofold. First, how did French society cope with the potentially destructive power of early capitalism, a power that could dissolve familial bonds and up-end social hierarchies? Second, how did new gender norms work within the new market framework?

40|$|No doubt some {{reform of}} the federal courts is {{essential}} {{if they are to}} cope with the proliferation of litigation over the past thirty years and the resulting 2 ̆ 2 congestion, delay, expense, and expansion 2 ̆ 2 in the federal courts. While the problem may not amount to an 2 ̆ 2 impending crisis 2 ̆ 2, the burgeoning caseload surely poses a threat, at least in the long run, to the ability of the federal courts to function effectively. The hard question is not whether something should be done, but what to do about it. There is no shortage of interesting ideas. Some of the ideas that clamor for attention are proposals for specialized courts, new layers of federal appellate review, rethinking the scope of federal jurisdiction, an expanded role for United State Magistrates, and alternative dispute resolution techniques. The pros and cons of these and other innovations turn largely on our response to a more fundamental question: Is it better to expand the federal judiciary or to cut its workload? Of these two broad alternatives, the Federal Courts Study Committee squarely prefers limits on federal jurisdiction over large increases in the number of federal judges. I believe the Committee has made the wrong choice. While neither route is an altogether satisfactory solution to the caseload problem, an expanded federal court system is less objectionable than fencing claims out of the federal courts. This article raises three objections to the Committee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premise</b> {{that it is necessary to}} maintain an elite federal judiciary. First, the Committee defines the problem of setting the scope of federal jurisdiction too narrowly, focusing almost exclusively on the congestion in the federal courts and ignoring the impact of its solution on other worthy goals. The issue that should be posed is not whether the current system is wholly satisfactory, but whether the costs of reform are worth the benefits, all things considered. Second, an analysis of the costs and benefits of maintaining a federal judicial elite casts substantial doubt on the Committee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premise</b> that greatly enlarging the federal judiciary is an unacceptable alternative. Third, the Committee altogether ignores the substantive dimension of jurisdictional reform. The principles underlying the Committee 2 ̆ 7 s proposals, if not the current proposals themselves, may have far-ranging impact on substantive rights and obligations. Some groups of litigants will lose litigating advantages they now hold, and the desirability of the recommendations depends, at least in part, on whether we think the substantive burdens of reform are fairly distributed...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of essays whose ultimate aim is to challenge the standard view of: The Neo-Moorean Argument (NMA) : (1) I have a hand; (2) If I have a hand, then I am not a brain-in-a-vat; (3) Therefore, I am not a brain-in-a-vat. In this literature, philosophers debate whether NMA transmits justification to its conclusion. The transmission of justification is tightly connected with inferential justification: an argument inferentially justifies its conclusion by transmitting justification from its premises to its conclusion. Hence, these philosophers are really concerned with whether NMA inferentially justifies its conclusion. The standard view is that NMA is an instance of complete transmission failure. In other words, many philosophers maintain that, even if NMA 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premises</b> are justified, NMA fails to (inferentially) justify its conclusion to any degree at all. I challenge this standard view and argue that NMA is quite capable of justifying its conclusion. ^ This dissertation is divided into three parts. The first part is composed of three chapters and addresses two foundational issues for any theory of inferential justification (or transmission failure), namely evidential support and higher-level requirements. The second part is the heart of my dissertation and is composed of one chapter. Drawing on the conclusions from the first three chapters, I present an account of inferential justification which entails that NMA transmits justification to its conclusion. This account is most plausible given the denial of a certain theory of perceptual justification. The third part of my dissertation is two chapters and defends my conditions by arguing against that theory of perceptual justification and providing an alternative. ...|$|R

Indeed, the first goal {{of this paper is to}} expand on Keohane 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premise</b> and to address how France and the United States understand sovereignty. The second goal is to argue that the current conflicting perspectives on sovereignty displayed by France and the United States are a departure from a historical pattern whereby, at each key time period, challenges to the shared definition of sovereignty and of the world order it symbolized, came from nondominant actors within or without the system in question.

40|$|Within the American Federal system, {{according}} to Peterson (1995), {{the national government}} undertakes redistributive policy (and related activities) while the state governments perform distributive policy (and related activities). The premise to be critiqued is related: That a state when given the opportunity will elect to pursue action that does not resemble a redistributive, domestic public policy (Peterson 1995). With Medicaid, the national approach is to redistribute specific goods and services to mandatory beneficiary groups. In the reform of Medicaid for primary medical services, what do the states do? Peterson predicts that the states when given the option would not elect to spread out {{the goods and services}} [...] for example, will not provide for eligibility groups or services beyond those mandatorily required. ^ Fant challenges this by evaluating the veracity of the model 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premise</b> as posited by Peterson.

This conclusion is reached after calculating (1) the proportion of policy options that are distributive and redistributive policy actions and (2) the Chi-square statistic for the collected observations.

Commenting on the debate, this paper argues that dynamic equivalence does not necessarily mean making it easy for the reader, but it should not be the only proper method of translation, that the importance of 2 ̆ 2 actual facts 2 ̆ 2 is not always paramount, and that cultural adaptations are legitimate to a greater extent than Nida would allow. In an attempt to develop a more sophisticated, more open-minded and more descriptive general theory of equivalent effect, it is suggested that there should be different emphases for different types of texts, that the purposes of translation should be taken into account, and that the translator should have the freedom to choose a certain degree of dynamic equivalence, and to decide for himself on some important questions, such as whether to bring his personality traits into play and whether to improve upon the original...|$|R
40|$|An {{in-depth}} survey of ethylene oxide (EtO) {{health and safety}} was conducted in Massachusetts hospitals (n = 92) to investigate the determinants of the provision of medical surveillance for EtO exposure. We have evaluated the relationships between provision of EtO medical surveillance and (1) activating OSHA-specified triggers for providing EtO medical surveillance, (2) worker training on EtO health and safety, and (3) various public policy, organizational, group, and individual characteristics. Among the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 2 ̆ 7 s (OSHA) five specified triggers for provision of EtO medical surveillance, only accidental worker exposures were related to provision of surveillance (RR = 2. 56, P < 0. 001). Exceeding the Action Level for 30 or more days, one of OSHA 2 ̆ 7 s EtO triggers that is also used {{in a number of}} other standards, was not related to provision of surveillance (RR = 0. 84, P = 0. 714). Reports of coverage of EtO medical surveillance issues in worker training were also correlated with the provision of EtO medical surveillance (RR = 3. 68, P < 0. 001), supporting OSHA 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>premise</b> that worker training plays an important role in medical surveillance implementation. The presence of detailed written EtO medical surveillance policies was positively related to the provision of EtO medical surveillance (RR = 1. 81, P < 0. 001). The relationships between these potential determinants and provision of medical surveillance were also validated in multivariate analyses. Implications for improvement of OSHA medical surveillance implementation through revised trigger schemes, improved worker training efforts, and other measures are discussed. Findings are relevant to the future development of medical surveillance and exposure monitoring policies and practices in both substance-specific and generic contexts...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{explore the}} shift in film spectatorship from models {{developed}} in the 1970 <b>s</b> <b>premised</b> on distance and critical awareness to models developed more recently by film theorists such as Laura U. Marks and Vivian Sobchack where the dynamic of screen and spectator is considered interrelational and immersive. In my text, I develop a model of spectatorship based on a hybrid of philosophers who do not normally go together, Gilles Deleuze and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. The purpose of this hybrid is to articulate a scene of spectatorship whereby a viewer is both immersed {{in the flow of}} images (Deleuze), yet simultaneously aware of shifts in bodily co-ordinates that occur in relation to that flow (Merleau-Ponty). My rationale for this hybrid is twofold: on the one hand, it counter the emphasis on disembodiment in discussions of the digital image; on the other hand, it counters the emphasis in cineanalysis on distanciation. I argue that these approaches reduce the spectator to the medium rather than attending to how sensory engagement transcends medium specificity. As a subtext, my paper also critiques the ubiquitous embrace of Deleuze in certain branches of film studies. My reading of Deleuze through the historical lens of phenomenology in 1970 s film theory exposes the inadvertent resurgence in Deleuze's own thinking of a disembodied transcendental subject. Given my feminist ethos, I found it necessary to balance Deleuze's evacuation of the body from perception with Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of embodiment. I demonstrated that, contrary to dominant readings, these two philosophers have much in common and are conducive to rethinking the embodied interrelation between viewer and screen. The outcome of this hybrid configures spectatorship as an immersive mode of temporalized spacing whereby the perceiving body both loses itself and continuously refinds itself transformed in relation to the time frame of the image...|$|R
