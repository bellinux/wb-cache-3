40|$|Abstract Background To {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} risk-benefit analysis for comparing multiple competing interventions {{in the absence of}} randomized trials, we applied this approach to the evaluation of five anticoagulants to prevent thrombosis in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Methods Using a cost-effectiveness approach from a clinical perspective (i. e. <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>analysis)</b> we compared thromboprophylaxis with warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, fondaparinux or ximelagatran in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, with sub-analyses according to surgery type. Proportions and variances of events defining risk (major bleeding) and benefit (thrombosis averted) were obtained through a meta-analysis and used to define beta distributions. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted and used to calculate incremental risks, benefits, and risk-benefit ratios. Finally, net clinical benefit was calculated for all replications across a range of risk-benefit acceptability thresholds, with a reference range obtained by estimating the case fatality rate - ratio of thrombosis to bleeding. Results The analysis showed that compared to placebo ximelagatran was superior to other options but final results were influenced by type of surgery, since ximelagatran was superior in total knee replacement but not in total hip replacement. Conclusions Using simulation and economic techniques we demonstrate a method that allows comparing multiple competing interventions in the absence of randomized trials with multiple arms by determining the option with the best risk-benefit profile. It can be helpful in clinical decision making since it incorporates risk, benefit, and personal risk acceptance. </p...|$|E

A computational study indicates that the effect of systematic risk is typically negligible (as for the single-period problem).

40|$|Standardisation of {{operating}} procedures {{has been used}} in variety of different sectors with the aim of achieving more reliable operations hence operational safety. Likewise, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been adopted by the maritime sector and enforced through the regulatory framework in an attempt to achieve safer shipping operations. Despite the fact that regulations enforce the SOPs, it is often observed that during shipping operations these procedures are not followed due to various reasons. One of the most common reasons for not following the SOPs is because shipping companies suffer from poorly designed procedures, which are impractical, unclear or sometimes factually wrong. These poorly designed procedures are disregarded by crew members, which prevent the practical implementation of these SOP's during shipping operations. Therefore, it is of key importance that a systematic approach is needed to identify and improve the current SOP's as well as preventing potentially harmful workarounds. The EU FP 7 SEAHORSE project is developing a "Procedure Improvement System" which will be actively used by the crew members any time anonymously. In order to achieve this, over 400 questionnaires have been collected from seafarers across Europe where they were asked to report on impractical SOPs and common workarounds conducted on board ships.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A model containing sixteen anterior teeth was used to simulate a patient undergoing fixed appliance treatment. PRs were taken at standardized vertical angulations to the occlusal plane (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 °) using conventional and digital techniques. DPT and CBCT images were also taken. Measurements of radiation dosages were used to estimate a <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> {{for each of the}} techniques. RESULTS: DPT consistently overestimated tooth lengths by 2 mm or more [mean: 2 · 34 mm; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1 · 4 - 3 · 3 mm]. CBCT consistently underestimated tooth length (mean: - 0 · 89 mm; 95 % CI: - 0 · 44 to - 1 · 33 mm). PRs taken at 90 ° angulation closely resembled the actual tooth length (mean: - 0 · 14 mm; 95 % CI: - 0 · 64 to 0 · 37 mm), but overestimation occurred with increasing PR film angulation. The radiation dosages ranged widely: DPT plus eight PRs that would be necessary to assess all teeth and root length of the upper and lower labial segments amounted to 23 μSv.

These elevators stored approximately 31 million bushels of wheat, which is approximately 1. 2 % of the annual national production. Stored wheat was followed as it moved from farm to the country elevator and finally to the terminal elevator. During this study, thousands of grain samples were taken in concrete elevator silos. Wheat stored at elevators was frequently infested by several insect species, which sometimes reached high numbers and damaged the grain. Fumigation using aluminum phosphide pellets was the main method for managing these insect pests in elevators in the USA. Fumigation decisions tended to be based on past experience with controlling stored-grain insects, or were calendar based.

In perinatal stroke where potential applications are promising, rational adaptation of dosage for children remains under investigation. Objective - Construct child-specific tDCS dosing parameters through case study within a perinatal stroke tDCS safety and feasibility trial. Methods- 10 -year-old subject with a diagnosis of presumed perinatal ischemic stroke and hemiparesis was identified. T 1 MRI scans used to derive computerized model for current flow and electrode positions. Workflow using modeling results and consideration of dosage in previous clinical trials was incorporated. Prior Ad hoc adult montages versus de novo optimized montages provided distinct <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>analysis.</b> Approximating adult dose required consideration of changes in both peak brain current flow and distribution which further tradeoff between maximizing efficacy and adding safety factors. Electrode size, position, current intensity, compliance voltage, and duration were controlled independently in this process. Results- Brain electric fields modeled and compared to values previously predicted models. Approximating conservative brain current flow patterns and intensities used in previous adult trials for comparable indications, the optimal current intensity established was 0. 7 mA for 10 minutes with a tDCS C 3 /C 4 montage. Specifically 0. 7 mA produced comparable peak brain current intensity of an average adult receiving 1. 0 mA. Electrode size of 5 x 7 cm 2 with 1. 0 mA and low-voltage tDCS was employed to maximize tolerability. Safety and feasibility confirmed with subject tolerating the session well and no serious adverse events.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether the benefits of eating Baltic Sea herring exceed the risks in Finland, and what the situation is in different age groups. Omega- 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin D were analysed in the report as beneficial nutrients. As far as environmental toxins harmful to health are concerned, Baltic herring were analysed for compounds classified as dioxins, which include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, as well dioxin-like biphenyls (PCB). According to the results, in Finland eating herring causes ca. 11 (95 % confidence interval, CI 0 - 54) Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) resulting from developmental disorders (dental damage); these affect children via the mother during pregnancy and breastfeeding. In addition, eating herring causes a ca. 12 (95 %, CI 1, 7 - 56) DALY cancer risk due to dioxins in the entire population. The health benefits of eating herring clearly exceed risks to health for women and particularly men after the age of 50 years. The greatest health benefits result from the reduction in heart disease and heart-related fatality, ca. – 688 (95 %, CI - 2126 - - 41) DALY/year.

Data regarding risks {{of this procedure}} are not available in Pakistan and therefore {{it is difficult to}} make accurate <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> for individual patients. Our objective was to determine safety of carotid endarterectomy at an academic tertiary care center in Pakistan. Methods: Patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) at our hospital during a ten-year period were identified through ICD- 9 coding system of the hospital medical records. Demographic features. associated medical problems and immediate postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. Results: Sixty-three carotid endarterectomies were performed on 59 patients. Ages range from 43 to 80 (mean 61 ± 8) years; 53 were male and 10 were female. Common associated diseases among these patients were hypertension; 38 (64. 4 °/x), ischemic heart disease; 26 (44 %), diabetes mellitus: 24 (40. 7 %); dyslipidemia; 19 (32. 2 %) and renal insufficiency; 13 (22 %). Most common complication was neuropraxia (transient neuropathy) 5 (7. 9 %), followed by pneumonia and stroke; each in 3 (4. 8 %) patients. None of the strokes related to the surgical procedure were disabling. Two of the patients who had stroke, recovered fully within 17 weeks and one recovered partly but was independent in all daily activities of living (ADLs). One patient died following simultaneous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and CEA. The risk of stroke or death for patients undergoing CEA was high with simultaneous CABG (3 / 11, 27 %) and low for patients undergoing CEA alone (1 / 52, 2 %).

If those more at risk could be identified prior to treatment, treatment <b>risk</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> and patient risk management could be assisted. Aims: This study investigated the role {{of child abuse and}} ongoing emotional impact from abuse on the risk of suicidality {{during the first week of}} treatment with an antidepressant. The patient sample for this study was drawn from one site of a larger pharmacogenetic study. The hypothesis was that subjects with high impact child abuse would have greater elevation of suicidality during the first week of antidepressant treatment. Methods: Fifty-one subjects were initiated on either venlafaxine (VEN) or escitalopram (ESC) for major depressive disorder (MDD) and had pre-treatment suicidality assayed with the reasons for living scale (RFLS), which was repeated after one week of treatment. Several clinical, demographic and genotype variables were controlled for. The 15 -item Impact of Event Scale (IES- 15) was administered to subjects reporting abuse to dichotomise the abuse group into low and high (IES- 15 &# 8805; 26) impact groups for sub-analysis as per the scales validated rating guidelines. Results: Subjects reporting no child abuse exposure were less likely to have increased suicidality during the first week of antidepressant treatment (7. 6 %) compared to subjects with low impact abuse (38. 5 %, p = 0. 041) and high impact abuse (58. 3 %, p = 0. 009). Only high impact abuse predicted increased suicidality after adjustment for potential confounders such as depression severity (OR = 31. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 3 to 748. 7, p = 0. 03). Conclusions: If these findings are replicated in larger samples, child abuse history could become an important element of assessing risk benefit balance when initiating antidepressants and may help guide the level of patient review needed during antidepressant initiation...|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of <b>risks</b> versus <b>benefits</b> from new products should be encouraged, even {{when dealing with}} agents which may cause cancer or malformations in laboratory animals, because {{there is evidence that}} safety thresholds exist even for such exposures. However, {{it is not easy to}} describe <b>risk</b> and <b>benefit</b> in comparable terms when they may involve generations to come and events in the future. <b>Risk</b> versus <b>benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> regarding the exposure of man and his environment to new chemical, physical, or. biological agents resulting from altered or new technological developments, has become a familiar phrase. It has been on the minds of scientists, public health officials or administrators, but has not resulted in technical or conceptual clarification regarding the requirements for satisfactory analysis. Different points of view on benefits to society and on willingness to take calculated risks can be heard. Individuals may be willing to take risks and enjoy the realization of having taken risks-in driving cars, flying planes, participating in certain sports, or by sticking to their pack of cigarettes a day. Taking risks with the health of the unsuspecting public, however, is quite a different matter. The risks we shall deal with here are of the latter type, and it is up to those entrusted with safeguarding the public health to make risk/ benefit evaluations for society and the environment on the basis of information available to them. Usually such information on potential hazards of newly developed products or substances is fragmentary and woefully inadequate. It is not only a matter of research funds or time until "complete safety evaluations " will be forthcoming but a profound question of how far such safety determinations can be attempted even with all the ingenuity of science at its disposal...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the evaluation of}} a waste management project's alternatives through a quantitative <b>risk</b> <b>analysis.</b> Cost <b>benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> is a widely used method, in which the investments are mainly assessed through the calculation of their evaluation indicators, namely benefit/cost (B/C) ratios, {{as well as the}} quantification of their financial, technical, environmental and social risks. Herein, a novel approach in the form of risk-based multi-criteria assessment (RBMCA) is introduced, which can be used by decision makers, in order to select the optimum alternative of a waste management project. Specifically, decision makers use multiple criteria, which are based on the cumulative probability distribution functions of the alternatives' B/C ratios. The RBMCA system is used for the evaluation of a waste incineration project's alternatives, where the correlation between the criteria weight values and the decision makers' risk preferences is analyzed and useful conclusions are discussed.
