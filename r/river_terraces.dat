5|$|The {{district}} of Faisalabad {{is part of}} the alluvial plains between the Himalayan foothills and the central core of the Indian subcontinent. The alluvial deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick. The interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature <b>river</b> <b>terraces.</b> These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the Ravi River on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers.|$|E
5|$|Lakes also formed (or expanded) in the Atacama at that time; highstands in Lejía Lake began rising after 11,480 ± 70 BP, and in Salar Aguas Calientes high-water levels {{lasted until}} 8,430 ± 75 BP. Highstands in Laguna Khota {{occurred}} around 12,500 and 11,000 BP. Some Salar de Atacama highstands {{are associated with}} Lake Tauca and the Coipasa highstand. Traces of the Tauca humid episode have been found at Salar Pedernales, past 26° south latitude. Lake Tauca's highstand correlates with <b>river</b> <b>terraces</b> in Peru's Pisco River; terraces dated 24,000–16,000 BP in its tributary, the Quebrada Veladera; enlarged drainage systems in the Quebrada Veladera; a humid period at Lake Junin, and new soil formation in the pampas south of the Quinto River in Argentina.|$|E
25|$|The {{terraces}} of the Trabancos River only {{occur on}} the left hand side of the valley. Their sediments overlie Miocene sediments.

25|$|Of the {{previously}} mentioned <b>river</b> <b>terraces,</b> the one known as TT-4 is only visible near Narros del Castillo (Ávila). Terrace TT-3 {{is the best}} preserved of the lot; although its height on {{the bed of the}} stream is not constant, it clearly stands out on the floodplain. Terrace TT-2 is quite well preserved as well, although it has been more heavily sculptured by other small tributaries of the Trabancos River. By contrast, terrace TT-1 is greatly eroded; although some sections survive to the south of the municipality of Alaejos (Valladolid), they are very difficult to differentiate from the colluvium floor that covers the Superficie de Alaejos. Entering into land in the municipality of Pollos, the stream stops to form <b>river</b> <b>terraces,</b> cutting traversely and lowering enough (between 40 and 60 meters) to meet the terrace deposits of the Duero River.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of known settlements also remains elusive with few settlements {{found in the}} West Midlands or North-West. Even in Kent, an area of rich early Anglo-Saxon archaeology, the number of excavated settlements is fewer than expected. However, in contrast the counties of Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire are relative rich in early settlements. These have revealed a tendency for early Anglo-Saxon settlements {{to be on the}} light soils associated with <b>river</b> <b>terraces.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Hope River segment {{runs about}} 30km from the {{confluence}} of the Boyle and Hope rivers as far as the Hanmer Basin. From the offset of dated <b>river</b> <b>terraces,</b> a late Holocene horizontal slip-rate of about 10mm/yr and a vertical slip-rate of about 0.6mm/yr have been calculated for this segment. The displacement is thought to have occurred by repeated slips which, if similar to that which caused the 1888 earthquake, indicate a return period of about 140 years.|$|E

25|$|Later, Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes, working between 1836 and 1846, {{collected}} further {{examples of}} hand-axes and fossilised animal bone from the gravel <b>river</b> <b>terraces</b> of the Somme near Abbeville in northern France. Again, his theories attributing great antiquity to the finds were spurned by his colleagues, {{until one of}} de Perthe's main opponents, Dr Marcel Jérôme Rigollot, began finding more tools near Saint Acheul.

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of the South Fork watershed is mountains, with the only level land found in the Hyampom Valley at the confluence of the river and Hayfork Creek, along the Hayfork valley, and along narrow <b>river</b> <b>terraces.</b> There are large parts of the watershed where the ground is composed of stable bedrock, while large portions of hillsides are composed of loose soil and rock. Historically, riverbeds in the watershed were narrow and rocky, but due to vast amounts of silt washed down by poor logging practices, streambeds have become wide, braided, elevated and shallow.|$|E
25|$|Archeological {{research}} {{in areas that}} surround the Trabancos River, between the villages of Castrejón and Pollos (Valladolid province) have been compared with the specialized bibliography and the published geological charts (infra).

40|$|This {{special edition}} {{presents}} a thematic set of eight papers examining field survey, remote sensing, and dating techniques used to analyse and interpret <b>river</b> <b>terrace</b> sequences. Most <b>river</b> systems {{from around the}} world have terrace landforms preserved at different altitudes along their valley sides. These landform sequences commonly span the Late Cenozoic encompassing hundreds of thousands to millions of years, providing an archive of long term fluvial landscape development and its driving mechanisms (Bridgland and Westaway, 2008 a; Gibbard and Lewin, 2009; Westaway et al., 2009). <b>River</b> <b>terrace</b> sequences are an increasingly popular focus of earth science research (Vandenberghe et al., 2010). Whilst many collections of <b>river</b> <b>terrace</b> sequence research papers have primarily considered the environmental significance of such records (e. g. Vandenberghe and Maddy, 2000; 2001) less {{attention has been paid to}} the techniques used to collect the data. Thus, the purpose of this special issue is to bring together a set of research papers that demonstrate the multidisciplinary nature of <b>river</b> <b>terrace</b> sequence research. The special edition is also linked to two other research papers (Stokes et al., 2012; Veldkamp et al., 2012) that were incorrectly published as part of the normal research paper editions of Geomorphology. This editorial firstly provides an overview of <b>river</b> <b>terrace</b> sequence research providing definitions and explanations of key aspects of <b>river</b> <b>terrace</b> sequence formation. An overview of the key research groups that have been studying <b>river</b> <b>terrace</b> sequences in recent years is then provided. Finally, an introduction to the principal techniques used for <b>river</b> <b>terrace</b> sequence research is given, with brief overviews of the papers that form and are linked to this special issue...|$|R

30|$|On {{the east}} riverbank, the <b>river</b> <b>terrace</b> {{deformed}} westward and subsided significantly. However, on the southernmost measurement {{lines and the}} second-southernmost measurement lines, the <b>river</b> <b>terrace</b> also deformed westward and uplifted to the river; however, the magnitude of deformation was smaller than those along other lines. In short, the <b>river</b> <b>terrace</b> sloping down to the Bishnumati River deformed toward the river. This deformation cannot be explained by simple land subsidence; the lateral spread that caused the landslide surface deformation along the Bishnumati River {{was the same as}} that in the SE area of TIA.|$|R
25|$|The Cucuteni-Trypillia {{settlements}} {{were usually}} {{located on a}} place where the geomorphology provided natural barriers to protect the site: most notably using high <b>river</b> <b>terraces</b> or canyon edges. The natural barriers were supplemented with fences, earthworks and ditches, or even more elaborate wooden and clay ramparts. The role of the fortifications found at these settlements was probably to protect the tribe's domestic animal herd from wild predators. Other hypotheses are that the fortifications were for protection against enemy attacks, or as a means to gather the community. The role of these fortifications, however, is still debated among scholars.|$|E
25|$|The DST fault {{system is}} {{generally}} considered to be a transform fault that has accommodated a 105km northwards displacement of the Arabian Plate. This interpretation is based on observation of offset markers, such as <b>river</b> <b>terraces,</b> gullies and archaeological features, giving horizontal slip rates of several mm per year over the last few million years. GPS data give similar rates of present-day movement of the Arabian Plate relative to the Africa Plate. It has also been proposed that the fault zone is a rift system that is an incipient oceanic spreading center, the northern extension of the Red Sea Rift.|$|E
25|$|The {{vineyards}} are {{shielded from}} the elements by steep mountains, while the growing season from flowering to harvest is amongst the longest in New Zealand. Naturally breezy conditions control vine vigour, creating lower yields of grapes with greater intensity. A genuine cool climate, with a long, dry autumn in NZ, provides an ideal ripening conditions for Pinot noir and other varietals, such as Riesling, Syrah and Pinot gris. A small number of wineries are producing Cabernet Franc of a high standard.

25|$|Beirut IV, or Furn esh Shebbak, river banks, {{was also}} on the left {{bank of the river}} and {{on either side of the}} road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red sand that {{represented}} Quaternary <b>river</b> <b>terraces.</b> The site was found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen, Raoul Describes and Auguste Bergy. Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, Paul Bovier-Lapierre. A large number of Middle Paleolithic flint tools were found on the surface and in side gullies that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied bifaces accredited to the Acheulean period, some with a lustrous sheen, now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Henri Fleisch also found an Emireh point amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.|$|E
25|$|The Cors Caron {{sequence}} of peat domes (also known as Tregaron Bog) developed on the floodplain of the Afon (River) Teifi in mid-Wales now represents the most intact surviving {{example in the}} UK of a raised bog landscape (macrotope). The three main extant domes are hydrologically isolated by the River Teifi and associated surface drainage features, and all three have suffered extensive damage as a con{{sequence of}} past drainage and peat-cutting. The <b>river</b> <b>terraces</b> associated with the component bog mesotopes are regularly flooded and support vegetation that includes reed canary-grass Phalaris arundinacea, soft rush Juncus effusus, purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea and, more rarely, water sedge Carex aquatilis. Substantial areas of the surface of each of the three component bogs still retain good quality active raised bog vegetation mainly referable to NVC type M18 Sphagnum papillosum – Erica tetralix community, with frequent bog-rosemary Andromeda polifolia and white beak-sedge Rhynchospora alba and, more locally, the bog-mosses Sphagnum magellanicum and S. pulchrum. Extensive areas with a high cover of heather Calluna vulgaris and deergrass Trichophorum cespitosum are also present, while purple moor-grass M. caerulea is particularly prominent on the more modified bog margins. Although present as an important peat-former until as recently as the 18th century, Sphagnum imbricatum is absent from the contemporary bog flora.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{settlers}} {{in the area of}} modern Nashville were Native Americans who arrived in the region by at least 13,000 BC during the Paleoindian period of regional prehistory. For millennia the descendants of these first Tennesseans continued to live along the <b>river</b> <b>terraces</b> and uplands overlooking the Cumberland River, leaving behind a dense archaeological record spanning the Paleoindian, Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian periods. The final prehistoric Native American culture to inhabit what would become Nashville was a regional manifestation of the Mississippian Culture known as Middle Cumberland Mississippian, identified by archaeologists based on the specific combination of burial practices, artistic style, and ceramic typology. Recent studies suggest that Middle Cumberland Mississippian culture {{may be the result of}} interactions between local populations and outsiders from the American Bottom who moved into the western portion of the Nashville Basin around AD 1000, settling at the site of Mound Bottom. The archaeological footprint of the Middle Cumberland Mississippian culture appears throughout Nashville as the many earthen mounds, extensive stone box cemeteries, palisaded villages, and small prehistoric farmsteads that have been destroyed by antiquarian scholars, relic hunters, and urban development. All archaeological evidence for Mississippian culture appears to vanish from the Nashville area by around AD 1475–1500. Archaeologists believe this regional collapse may have been the result of extreme pressures brought on by rapid population growth and dwindling resource availability following prolonged droughts leading to increased occurrences of disease, nutritional deficiencies, and warfare.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fact that}} the <b>river</b> <b>{{terraces}}</b> of the Trabancos River cut and cross some terraces of the Duero River indicates the affected Duero <b>River</b> <b>terraces</b> are younger than those not formed from activity of the waters of this river. The [...] "superficie de Alaejos" [...] carve-out intrudes 4 to 6 meters into the Duero River terrace designated TD-7 (+74/80 m) to the northwest of Siete Iglesias de Trabancos village. Likewise, the TT-2 fluvial terrace of Trabancos cuts some Duero <b>River</b> <b>terraces.</b> Since the previously mentioned Duero River terrace named TD-7 has been dated by Alfredo Pérez-González (op.cit.) {{to the beginning of}} the Middle Pleistocene, meaning the <b>river</b> <b>terraces</b> of Trabancos River are younger than the [...] "Superficie de Alaejos", it appears plausible that this postdates the creation of Trabancos valley: the proposed date could, thus, be halfway through the Middle Pleistocene or later.|$|E
