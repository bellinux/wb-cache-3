40|$|Three {{inoculation}} {{methods for}} screening olive germplasm for resistance to Verticillium dahliae Kleb. were compared: (i) dipping soil-free washed roots into inoculum (WRI); (ii) dipping <b>root</b> <b>balls</b> with soil into inoculum (RBI); (iii) direct {{introduction of the}} inoculum into a stem incision (SII). The effectiveness of the methods was compared in their capacity to differentiate levels of resistance/susceptibility to Verticillium wilt in olive germplasm. Genetically homogeneous clones of the olive cvs Frantoio, Coratina and Leccino, which have different degrees of resistance/susceptibility to wilt, were inoculated with one defoliating and two nondefoliating V. dahliae pathotypes. Results indicate that the three screening methods had different sensitivity in identifying variable levels of olive resistance to Verticillium wilt. Inoculation of washed roots (WRI) was the most drastic and {{may be used to}} identify higher levels of resistance (such as that of cv. Frantoio), but was not sensitive enough to detect lower levels of resistance. Inoculation of <b>root</b> <b>balls</b> with soil (RBI) was less destructive and allowed detection of lower resistance expression (such as that of cv. Coratina), not detected by WRI. Stem incision inoculation (SII) failed to discriminate between resistant (cvs Frantoio and Coratina) and susceptible (cv. Leccino) germplasm...|$|R
5000|$|A typical machine {{consists}} {{of a number of}} blades (generally 3 or 4, but single or dual blade designs also exist) that encircle the tree, digging into the ground and then lifting the entire tree, including its roots and soil (in what is termed a [...] "root ball"), out of the ground and replanting or transplanting the whole tree in the designated area. Similar machines can also be used for placing trees in pots or baskets for commercial tree nursery operations.

50|$|The canopy {{circumference}} {{is comparable}} to the <b>root</b> <b>ball.</b> It is estimated that the depth of the <b>root</b> <b>ball</b> extends at least 18 metres {{below the surface of the}} road reserve and quite possibly interlinks at many points at the tips. Their size and height is not only due to their age but also due to the availability of the water table which is approximately 2 metres below the surface. The tree roots provide an excellent structure to bind the soil and decrease erosion, a major problem in a wet area like the Herbert. The surrounding road surface, which extends right up to the base of the trees, is sealed with bitumen.|$|E

50|$|RIFAs {{were still}} on the move in the US in the early 21st century, often {{traveling}} from one area to another in turf, <b>root</b> <b>balls</b> of nursery plants, and other agricultural products. They could be controlled, but not eradicated. A number of products are available, which can be used on a mound-by-mound basis to destroy ant colonies when they appear. With all such efforts, it is important to reach and kill the queens, which may be as far as six feet (2 m) underground; otherwise, some queens may simply move a short distance away and quickly re-establish the colony. However, during the past few years, even this technique resulted in failure to control colony growth. Scientists then discovered that an adaptation in RIFAs had resulted in many populations having multiple queens in mounds over a large area.|$|R

50|$|Using {{trees on}} {{vigorous}} rootstocks {{which will have}} a better chance of competing with the pathogens, or plants grown in large containers with a large <b>root</b> <b>ball</b> may also {{have a better chance of}} resisting replant disease. The extra time to cropping may be offset if new trees are planted a few years in advance of old trees finally falling over, furthermore, if the old orchard was grubbed - i.e. trees were healthy when removed, it is unlikely that replant disease would be a problem as pathogen levels may never have been high. The malady is worse where trees have died in situ - pathogens are likely to have contributed to the death and therefore be at a higher level in the soil.|$|E
40|$|Pleistocene carbonates {{along the}} {{northern}} coasts of Futaysi Island and Al Dabb'iya tombolo, Abu Dhabi, U. A. E., contain unusual calcirudite-filled structures which are bowl- and funnel-shaped in vertical section; roughly circular in plan view; up to 1 m in diameter and 1 m deep. The calcirudite infill is dominated by clasts of reworked lithified smaller burrows and {{what appear to be}} fragments of beach rock or hardground. These structures were previously interpreted as marking the sites of former trees with holes, left behind by their <b>root</b> <b>balls,</b> infilled by a storm deposit and were considered to indicate an emergent event marking the boundary between two Pleistocene sedimentary sequences represented by the Futaisi (Futaysi) and Dabb’iya Members of the Fuwayrit Formation. However, they are here re-interpreted as giant burrows formed by some, as yet, unknown marine animal probably foraging for food or using them as dwelling sites which contained storm deposits emplaced in shallow water. Thin crusts on top of some giant burrow infills possibly suggest emergence and this would require a repositioning of the sequence boundary between the Futaysi and Dabb’iya Members. The burrows are believed to have been formed at approximately 75 – 125 Ka. <br/...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the use of}} mycorrhizal fungi in nursery production. In the literature review there is summarized current knowledge regarding mycorrhiza and nursery production of ornamental plants. As a model plant for the experiment was used Spiraea bumalda "Anthony Waterer" and the experiment was conducted in the grounds of The Department of Breeding and Propagation in Lednice. There was applied mycorrhizal product Symbivit when planting in batch 6 g, 3 g, 1, 5 g and 0 g. The plants were evaluated by parameters as plant height, diameter of root collar, the number of shoots. Then there were evaluated mycorrhizal colonization and volumes of <b>roots</b> <b>balls</b> in the laboratory. The experiment was described and evaluated statistically. The experiment resulted in the fact, that the more mycorrhizal product Symbivit is applied, the greater was the colonization. The mycorrhizal product had a positive effect on plant growth. The plants treated with product Symbivit in batch greater than 3 g proved a statistically {{significant difference in the}} monitored parameters compared to the control. There is also a economic viewpoint, the price of plants increases after the application of mycorrhizal product Simbivit...|$|R
40|$|Oreochrimis niloticus (L.) was {{introduced}} to Lake victoria in the 1950 s. It remained relatively uncommon in catches until 1965, when the numbers began to increase dramatically. It is now the third most important commercial fish species after the Nile perch, Lates niloticus (L.) and Rastrineobola argentea (Pellegrin). Oreochromis niloticus is considered a herbivore, feeding mostly on algae and plant material. The diet {{now appears to be}} more diversified, with insects, fish, algae and plant materials all being important food items. Fish smaller than 5 cm TL have a diverse diet but there is a decline in the importance of zooplankton, the preferred food item of small fish, as fish get larger. The shift in diet could be due to changes which have occurred in the lake. Water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, which harbours numerous insects in its <b>root</b> <b>balls,</b> now has extensively coverage over the lake. The native fish species which preyed on these insects (e. g. haplochromines) have largely been eliminated and O. niloticus could be filling niches previously occupied by these cichlids and non cichlid fishes. The change in diet could also be related to food availability and abundance where the fish is feeding on the most readily available food items...|$|R
50|$|Transplanting juveniles is {{generally}} successful if the main root is left intact. The nīkau {{does not have}} a true tap root. Once the main root has been established to a fairly shallow depth of about 400 mm, its roots take on form consistent with other palms. Successful transplanting is possible, but nīkau is very fickle if any trunk is present. It is best done in summer, but a substantial <b>root</b> <b>ball</b> should be preserved, and shade should be provided at the new location - at the very least by tying the outer fronds closer to the centre. Ground watering is recommended because crown watering can induce terminal rot at the very slow-growing new spike. Delays should be avoided in getting the nīkau into its new ground, and substantial die-back of all but the central spike can be expected.|$|E
5000|$|Older sewer {{lines of}} small diameter, {{typically}} 6 in, {{are made by}} the union {{of a number of}} short 3 ft sections. The pipe segments may be made of cast iron, with 12 ft to 20 ft sections, but are more often made of vitrified clay pipe (VCP), a ceramic material, in 3 ft, 4 ft & 6 ft sections. Each iron or clay segment will have an enlargement (a [...] "bell") on one end to receive the end of the adjacent segment. Roots from trees and vegetation may work into the joins between segments and can be forceful enough to break open a larger opening in terra cotta or corroded cast iron. Eventually a <b>root</b> <b>ball</b> will form that will impede the flow and this may cleaned out by a cutter mechanism and subsequently inhibited by use of a chemical foam - a rooticide.|$|E
50|$|Her first book, L'Origine des animaux (1883), {{was written}} in {{response}} to Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, which had been published in France in an 1862 translation by Clémence Royer. Renooz described Darwin's theory as unscientific, arguing instead for an evolutionary theory based on embryology. Renooz concluded that humanity's ancestors could {{be traced to the}} plant kingdom and specifically to the bean family, a concept possibly influenced by Ernst Haeckel's recapitulation theory. In Renooz's theory, the human head corresponded to the <b>root</b> <b>ball</b> of a plant, and the body to the stem and branches. Renooz rejected the idea of natural selection in human evolution, saying that humans were inherently cooperative (as she believed plants to be), rather than competitive like other animals. In an article, Renooz reported that her plant-based theory was not derived from research, but had come to her in a flash of intuition as she was leaving the Bibliothèque nationale de France after reading Claude Adrien Helvétius's De l'homme. She later attributed her other theories to the same intuitive power manifesting itself on other occasions.|$|E
40|$|Issue: During {{community}} growth, adjacent forests become {{candidates for}} purchase and development; otherwise, they typically do not generate profit. To accommodate developments, developers remove trees, soil, {{and other materials}} from construction sites. In some regions, they use crawling bulldozers to knock down trees and pull up <b>root</b> <b>balls</b> for on-site burning. However, a sufficient quantity of wood upon a site makes it practicable to cut tree stems and ship logs to local markets. The roots and branches usually remain as landclearing waste. Traditionally, developers burned or buried this wood waste on-site. Wood waste could also be shipped off-site, either for disposal or, increasingly, for centralized wood processing. Furthermore, on-site processing is increasingly being used to recycle wood waste, often using a mobile tub grinder. Most professional development and landclearing contractors know the options available in their region for the wood waste they generate. Some may not, however, and {{it is wise to}} check with trade associations, recycling organizataions, and local solid waste utilities to get a list of wood recyclers that can provide wood waste services.
