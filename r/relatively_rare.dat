5000|$|Carter Sans is a {{typeface}} by Matthew Carter, {{in collaboration}} with Dan Reynolds. In style, it {{is described as a}} [...] "hybrid sans-serif" [...] or [...] "humanist stressed sans" [...] ("flare serif", [...] "glyphic serif"), as it does not have serifs, but letters do flare slightly near the ends of strokes, which is particularly notable in the capitals. This is a <b>relatively</b> <b>rarer</b> style, and Carter states that he was particularly influenced by Albertus (1932-40) by Berthold Wolpe, also of Monotype.|$|R
5|$|Pulmonary oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{an entirely}} avoidable event while diving. The limited duration and naturally intermittent nature of most diving makes this a <b>relatively</b> <b>rare</b> (and even then, reversible) complication for divers. Established guidelines enable divers to calculate when they {{are at risk of}} pulmonary toxicity.|$|E

40|$|Throughout the Victorian period, {{publishing}} {{novels in}} multiple volumes {{was a common}} format for new fiction. Overwhelmingly, fiction appeared in one-, two-, or three-volume editions but nineteen novels {{were published in the}} <b>relatively</b> <b>rarer</b> four-volume edition. Publishers used the four-volume format over the century primarily for long historical novels and novels written by well-established authors, including a brief resurgence in the 1870 s instigated by George Eliot’s novel Middlemarch (1872). The article examines the use of the format by authors and publishers and gives a list of the four-volume novels published during the Victorian period...|$|R
40|$|Mucosa-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (MALT) lymphomas are {{characterized}} by lymphoepithelial lesions pathologically. Colonic MALT lymphomas are <b>relatively</b> <b>rarer</b> than lymphomas of the stomach or small intestine. Endoscopically, colonic MALT lymphoma frequently appears as a nonpedunculated protruding polypoid mass and/or an ulceration in the cecum and/or rectum. We report a unique case of a colonic MALT lymphoma presenting as a semipedunculated polyp. A 54 -year-old man {{was found to have}} a 2 -cm semipedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon during screening colonoscopy. The polyp was removed by endoscopic mucosal resection. Histologic exami-nation of the resected polyp revealed diffuse epithelial infiltration by discrete aggregates of lymphoma cells. We diagnosed the tumor as low-grade B-cell MALT lymphoma by immunohistochemical staining. Key Words: Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma; Sigmoid colon; Colonic polyp...|$|R

40|$|As a {{clinical}} entity, {{sickle cell anemia}} (SCA) {{is known to be}} <b>relatively</b> <b>rarer</b> in Africans than in the African-American population of the United States. Paradoxically, sickle cell trait (SCT), the non-anemic, heterozygous condition, is about three times more common among indigenous Africans than in African-Americans. The ratio of SCA to SCT is 1 : 50 for African-Americans, and less than 1 : 1, 000 for tropical Africans. This etiological disparity is attributed to an anti-sickling agent, thiocyanate, (SCN-) found abundantly in staple African foods, such as the African yam (Dioscorea sp) and cassava (Manihot utilissima). Staple American foods have negligible SCN-concentrations. Nonstaple foods in the American diet, such as carrots, cabbage, and radishes, have SCN- levels far below the African yam and cassava. This finding explains the high incidence of SCA among African-Americans and its rarity in Africans...|$|R

5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} also noted, however, that bone {{puncture}} marks from Deinonychus are <b>relatively</b> <b>rare,</b> and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus {{probably did not}} frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they probably used their high bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontosauridae is {{a family}} of early ornithischian dinosaurs that were likely among the most basal (primitive) members of the group.

40|$|Neurocognitive {{function}} {{is influenced by}} a number of systemic biological processes that are susceptible to dietary intervention. It is known, for example, that cardiovascular dysfunction and concomitant inflammatory and oxidative stress processes can negatively effect cognitive function, especially during aging. Indeed, these represent significant risk factors for disorders such as mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that adherence to the Mediterranean diet may reduce these pathological processes. It follows that the Mediterranean diet may also positively affect cognitive functioning. This chapter reviews epidemiological studies indicating that the Mediterranean diet supports healthy cognitive aging. Such studies are supported by (<b>relatively</b> <b>rarer)</b> controlled trials, which indicate that switching to the Mediterranean diet may even enhance mood and cognition in younger individuals. Possible mechanisms underlying the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and protection against age-related cognitive decline are considered...|$|R
5|$|Sebaceous cyst is a {{term used}} to refer to both an epidermoid cyst and a pilar cyst, though neither of these contain sebum, only keratin and do not {{originate}} in the sebaceous gland and so are not true sebaceous cysts.

5|$|The first metal cannon was the pot-de-fer. Loaded with an arrow-like bolt {{that was}} {{probably}} wrapped in leather to allow greater thrusting power, it was set off through a touch hole with a heated wire. This weapon, and others similar, were used by both the French and English, during the Hundred Years' War, when cannon saw their first real use on the European battlefield. Even then, cannon were still a <b>relatively</b> <b>rare</b> weapon.|$|E

40|$|Presentation {{of study}} that found women with with {{intellectual}} and developmental disabilities (IDD) had longer hospital stays and {{were less likely}} to have Caesarean section deliveries in contrast to women without these conditions. Rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes were elevated among the women with IDD, across a range of measures.

There were no differences between the two groups of women in maternal death rates, which is <b>relatively</b> <b>rarer</b> in the US. Women comprise fewer than 1 % of deliveries in the United States, but they and their infants are at significantly elevated risk of adverse outcomes. The public health costs of these outcomes are likely to be substantial. Further research is needed to understand the determinants of these adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, pending further evidence, health care providers are advised that their patients with IDD are at elevated risk of serious pregnancy complications. Intervention to improve these outcomes are needed...|$|R
