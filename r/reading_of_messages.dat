2500|$|By late 1941 {{a change}} in German Navy {{fortunes}} in the Battle of the Atlantic, combined with intelligence reports, convinced Admiral Karl Dönitz that the Allies could read German Navy coded communications, and a fourth rotor with unknown wiring was added to German Navy Enigmas used for U-boat communications, producing the Triton system, known at Bletchley Park as Shark. [...] This was coupled with a thinner reflector design {{to make room for}} the extra rotor. [...] The Triton was designed in such a way that it remained compatible with three-rotor machines when necessary. [...] One of the extra 'fourth' rotors, the 'beta', was designed so that when it was paired with the thin 'B' reflector and rotor and ring were set to 'A', the pair acted as a standard three-rotor wide 'B' reflector. [...] As before, the unknown wiring would prevent unauthorized <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages.</b> Fortunately for the Allies, in December 1941, before the machine went into official service, a submarine accidentally sent a message with the fourth rotor in the wrong position. It then retransmitted the message with the rotor in the correct (three-rotor emulating) position. [...] In February 1942 the change in the number of rotors used became official, and the Allies' ability to read German submarines' messages ceased until a snatch from a captured U-boat revealed not only the four-rotor machine's ability to emulate a three-rotor machine, but also that the fourth rotor did not move during a message. [...] This along with the aforementioned mistake allowed the code breakers to eventually figure out the wiring of both the 'beta' and 'gamma' fourth rotors.|$|E

In 1968, he {{published}} Breach of Security, {{an account of}} German <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> {{to and from the}} British Embassy in Berlin before 1939 with an introduction by the British historian Donald Cameron Watt. As a result of Irving's success with Dresden, members of Germany's extreme right wing assisted him in contacting surviving members of Hitler's inner circle. In an interview with the American journalist Ron Rosenbaum, Irving claimed to have developed sympathies towards them. Many ageing former mid- and high-ranked Nazis saw a potential friend in Irving and donated diaries and other material. Irving described his historical work to Rosenbaum as an act of [...] "stone-cleaning" [...] of Hitler, in which he cleared off the [...] "slime" [...] that he felt had been unjustly applied to Hitler's reputation.|$|E

50|$|The Siemens & Halske T43 T-43 (German:Schlüssel-Fernschreibmaschine) was a cipher teleprinter, {{which used}} a {{one-time}} key tape to supply {{a sequence of}} keying characters instead of mechanical rotor wheels as in other T-series models. The teleprinter was developed in 1943 and introduced in 1944. A serious defect was discovered in the T-43 by Section IVa head Dr Stein in early 1944, but this was corrected. The defect enabled the <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> T-43 <b>messages.</b> Later when TICOM found the device, it was tested {{and found that the}} key tape was only pseudo-random.

50|$|The {{performance}} of MH {{is very much}} dependent on the file system and other features of the operating system that it runs on. Every <b>read</b> <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> will require starting a separate program, a directory scan in a large directory and a file open before the data can even be accessed. On the other hand, mailbox formats such as mbox which use a single file often require insertion or removal of data {{in the middle of}} the file when messages are read or altered and this can be a very slow procedure. In these cases MH will be much faster.|$|R

50|$|From this beginning, the British Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park {{built up}} an {{extensive}} cryptanalytic facility. Initially, the decryption was mainly of Luftwaffe {{and a few}} Army messages, as the Kriegsmarine (German navy) employed much more secure procedures for using Enigma. Alan Turing, a Cambridge University mathematician and logician, provided much of the original thinking {{that led to the}} design of the cryptanalytical Bombe machines and the eventual breaking of naval Enigma. However, the German Navy introduced an Enigma version with a fourth rotor for its U-boats resulting in a prolonged period when these messages could not be decrypted. With the capture of relevant cipher keys and the use of much faster US Navy Bombes, regular, rapid <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> U-boat <b>messages</b> resumed.|$|R

However, on the next page he stated that if the British Navy had captured the submarine with the Enigma undisturbed, a current reading was possible. The last signal from U-570, he said, had probably been the attempt to notify the BdU that the crucial cipher documents had been destroyed. They could attribute all the suspicious losses of the autumn to the capabilities of British Huff-Duff. Dönitz received additional reassurance in December from a coded letter from a U-570 POW reporting proper destruction of all secret material.|$|R
