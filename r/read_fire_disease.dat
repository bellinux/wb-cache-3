50|$|In {{silviculture}} {{the activity}} is known as reforestation, or afforestation, {{depending on whether the}} area being planted has or has not recently been forested. It involves planting seedlings over an area of land where the forest has been harvested or damaged by <b>fire,</b> <b>disease</b> or human activity.Tree planting is carried out in many different parts of the world, and strategies may differ widely across nations and regions and among individual reforestation companies. Tree planting is grounded in forest science, and if performed properly can result in the successful regeneration of a deforested area. Reforestation is the commercial logging industry's answer to the large-scale destruction of old growth forests, but a planted forest rarely replicates the biodiversity and complexity of a natural forest.|$|R

40|$|The presentations at this {{symposium}} discussed {{concepts of}} ecosystem management and sustainability as viewed by {{various levels of}} government and private land managers. The theme was to integrate ecology, silviculture, forest operations, wood products, and economics {{to find ways to}} develop healthy sustainable ecosystems under financially sound management practices. Speakers discussed ways to manage disturbance to create landscapes with the desired level of diversity and resilience to <b>fire,</b> <b>disease,</b> and insects. Others identified technical aspects of improving the options for producing wood and promoting healthy ecosystems. The feasibility of the various modes of forest operation were considered along with methods to evaluate the financial aspects of activities in different stand types. Lastly, the concept of sustainability was discussed, both in theory and through case studies. A full paper is presented for the majority of presentations; an abstract is included for others...|$|R
40|$|The {{firefighter}} {{problem is}} a discrete-time game on graphs introduced by Hartnell {{in an attempt to}} model the spread of <b>fire,</b> <b>diseases,</b> computer viruses and suchlike in a macro-control level. The average percentage of vertices that can be saved when a fire starts randomly at one vertex of G, which we call surviving rate following a previous paper by Cai and Wang, {{is a measure of the}} defence ability of a graph as a whole and has been studied in several previous papers. In this paper, we study the surviving rate of trees. Then we generalize the concept of surviving rate to that in each round more than one firefighter is available. We prove that if k firefighters are available in each round, the surviving rate of a graph with treewidth no more than k is at least k 2 log...|$|R

40|$|Elements {{levels and}} glucose- 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} activity in blood {{of patients with}} schizophrenia Objectives: Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) is the rate limiting enzyme of the hexose monophosphate cascade which plays role in the synthesis of nucleotide, reduced glutathion, fatty acid and cholesterol precursors. At the same time, {{it is an important}} enzyme for neuronal development during and after fetal life and for neurotransmitters. Serum elements are necessary for neuronal development and synthesis and activity of enzymes and hormones. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare serum levels of some elements and G 6 PD enzyme activity in schizophrenic patients with those in healthy individuals. Methods: This study involved blood serum analysis of 32 schizophrenia patients and 32 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Copper, zinc, iron, magnesium levels were determined with a double lighted, deuterium sourced, background proof <b>reading</b> <b>fire</b> atomic spectrophotometer and in order to determine aluminum and manganese levels, a graphite tube atomizer spectroscope was used.

40|$|Abstract. The {{firefighter}} {{problem is}} defined as follows. Initially, a fire breaks out at a vertex r of a graph G. In each subsequent time unit, a firefighter chooses a vertex not yet on fire and protects it, and the fire spreads to all unprotected neighbors of the vertices on fire. The objective is to choose a sequence of vertices for the firefighter to protect so as to save {{the maximum number of}} vertices. The firefighter problem can be used to model the spread of <b>fire,</b> <b>diseases,</b> computer viruses and suchlike in a macro-control level. In this paper, we study algorithmic aspects of the firefighter problem on trees, which is NP-hard even for trees of maximum degree 3. We present a (1 − 1 /e) -approximation algorithm based on LP relaxation and randomized rounding, and give several FPT algorithms using a random separation technique of Cai, Chan and Chan. Furthermore, we obtain a...|$|R
50|$|The Upper West Region {{is one of}} the ten {{regions of}} Ghana. It is located at the North Western corner of Ghana with {{latitude}} 9.8°- 11.O° North and longitude 1.6°- 3.0 West, bounded to Burkina Faso to the North.It covers a geographical area of 18,476 square kilometres which represents 12.7% of the total land area of Ghana. The northern Ghana-Burkina Faso border, on the east by the Upper East region and Northern region, on the south by the Northern region, and on the west by the western Ghana-Burkina Faso border borders the Upper West region on the north. It is the seventh largest region in Ghana in total area, and it is made up of eleven (11) districts.By virtue of its location, it has the potential for international and inter-regional trade and other bi-lateral relations, but the overspill of criminal activities and disaster, such as bush <b>fires,</b> <b>diseases</b> and pestilence, armed robbery etc., from our neighbours also pose a threat to the region.|$|R
