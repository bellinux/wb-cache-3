40|$|Investment in {{inventory}} absorbs a {{large portion}} of the working capital of a company and often it represents {{a large portion}} of the total assets of a business. By improving return on investment by increasing the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> <b>turnover,</b> management often wants to ensure economic efficiency. Effective inventory management enables a firm to provide lower costs, rapid response and flexibility for its customers. Just-in-time (JIT) philosophy is most widely adopted and practices in the recent years worldwide. It aims at reducing total production costs by producing only what is immediately needed and eliminates wastes. It is based on a radically different concept, deviating substantially from the existing manufacturing practices in many respects. It is a very effective tool to reduce the wastage of inventory and manage it effectively. It has the potential to bring substantial changes in the existing setup of a company; can give it a new face, broaden its acceptability and ensure a longer life. It can strategically change the atmosphere needed for longer survival. JIT is radically different from MRP and goes beyond materials management. The new outlook acquired by the company can meet global expectations of the customers. JIT happens to provide global markets. The present paper examines the strategic role of JIT in inventory management. Information technology helps JIT in managing inventory effectively, as it helps in integrating the components of supply chain network. Quality aspect of inventory management has also been discussed...|$|E

The study finds that the corporations who introduce the ERP system are gen-erally better in performance than non-ERP users. The study also finds that the total assets of the ERP users in tested group are increased and the asset-liability ration is stable after introducing ERP and, meanwhile, the total assets of the non-ERP users in controlled group are not increased and the asset-liability ration is decreased.

An unanticipated slowing in demand generally leads to an unintended buildup of inventories: only with a lag do firms adjust production and their actual holding <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> relative to the desired level. A possible explanation for this accumulation is that the costs <b>of</b> adjusting <b>inventory</b> holdings outweigh the disequilibrium costs, i. e., the cost of temporarily deviating from the equilibrium level <b>of</b> <b>inventories.</b> In this paper, the relative importance of the disequilibrium costs to adjustment costs <b>of</b> <b>inventories</b> is evaluated. An estimate <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> adjustment towards its long-run equilibrium level is provided in the United States by means of a linear-quadratic model with integrated processes. A limited-information approach allows the time-series properties of the data to be exploited and consistent estimates of the struc [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{market place}} in which Rolls-Royce Energy {{currently}} operates in is highly competitive. This means that the management <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> is becoming ever more important, especially when {{the life cycle of}} Energy gas turbine engines can be as long as thirty years which are supported by Rolls-Royce’s aftermarket business. The purpose of this dissertation is to review and evaluate the management <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> in Rolls-Royce’s Energy business to determine methods that can be introduced to improve the <b>inventory</b> <b>turnover</b> rate bearing in mind that the company operates an Enterprise Resource Planning system which has standard measures applied that may not necessarily suit all areas of the Rolls-Royce business. The following practical recommendations to improve <b>inventory</b> <b>turnover</b> within the Rolls-Royce Energy business have been drawn from the research findings and literature review: • Implement the ABC inventory classification technique to ensure more focus on the parts that generate revenue for the business. • Implement systems to better manage order quantities in the supply chain to ensure costings are transparent across the whole supply chain. Also ensure that capital is not tied up in inventory {{that is not going to}} be utilised. • Materials that are held for insurance type purposes, which although critical for maintaining customer service levels through speed <b>of</b> delivery, impacts <b>inventory</b> <b>turnover,</b> so assess whether these parts could be better managed by being outsourced. This enables parts to be available at short notice but without the inventory sitting on the books...|$|R

40|$|Best {{business}} practices could improve efficiency, effectiveness and productivity of an organization. In {{order to achieve}} this goal, companies would conduct certain innovation {{in the form of}} projects which could be implemented. Recently, companies implemented projects which applied on companies’ overall system. These recent best practices of pursuing companies’ effectiveness and efficiency would be implementation of ISO 9000 and ERP. Previous research showed that these two projects could bring benefits for these companies which implemented it. However, it has not been compared which project would brings more benefits to these companies. This research observed 35 companies which consist of 15 companies in food and beverages industry, 9 companies in pharmaceutical industry, 4 companies in cigarettes industry, 4 companies in cosmetics industry, and 3 companies in household appliances industry. The data are taken by observing and recording the values which related with COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), total inventory, net income, gross income, operating income, pretax income, cash flow operation, total liabilities, and total asset after ISO and ERP implementation. The results show that there is no significant difference of the ISO and ERP implementation on the factors <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> <b>turnover,</b> and weeks <b>of</b> supply. While the other factors, show significant differences between the implementation of ERP and ISO. Net profit margin, gross profit margin, and operating profit margin show better result on ERP launching. On the other hand, pretax margin shows better comes from ISO 9000 implementation. Overall, ERP implementation shows better results compare with ISO 9000. ...|$|R
