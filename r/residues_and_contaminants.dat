40|$|The National Residue Control Plan (NRCP) is a {{programme}} {{to monitor}} food {{of animal origin}} such as meat, milk and honey for residues of undesirable substances. Additionally, {{on the basis of the}} Import Control Plan (ICP), {{food of animal origin}} from countries outside of the EU is monitored. For residues of pharmacologically active substances and environmental contaminants such as heavy metals or dioxins, Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) and Maximum Levels are set, which must not be exceeded in food of animal origin. The aim of food control as part of the NRCP and the ICP is, to check that these MRLs and Maxiumum Levels are complied with, to detect non-compliant use of substances (e. g. prohibited or non-allowed pharmacologically active substances) and to investigate the causes of increased levels of <b>residues</b> <b>and</b> <b>contaminants.</b> The Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) has presented the findings from the 58998 samples which were monitored by the official control laboratories of the federal states as part of the NRCP 2012 and from the 1338 samples of the ICP in 2012. In 350 findings (0. 59 %) of the NRCP samples, <b>residues</b> <b>and</b> <b>contaminants</b> were noncompliant. The rate is thus lower than the findings of the year 2011 (0, 73 %). In 8 findings of the 1338 samples of the ICP the limit values for <b>residues</b> <b>and</b> <b>contaminants</b> were exceeded. Nevertheless, the rate of exceeded limit values decreased slightly for food of animal origin imported from countries outside of the EU. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has assessed the risk of findings (NRCP, ICP) for human health in 2012. In order to estimate exposure levels for the various consumer groups, data of the National Nutrition Survey II were used. The BfR concludes that single or occasional consumption of monitored food (NRCP, ICP) in 2012 with non-compliant levels of residues of pharmacologically active substances and contaminants do not imply a risk to consumers...|$|E

For consistent and reliable mass assignment ( or = 50, 000) was found to be required. At lower resolving power settings, the error in the assignment of mass increased due to the coelution of analytes with interferences at the same nominal mass. This negatively affected selectivity and quantitative performance due to the inability to use the required narrow mass-extraction windows. In the case of the less complex honey matrix, a resolving power of 25, 000 was generally sufficient to obtain a mass assignment error close to the typical instrument mass accuracy (<or = 2 ppm) down to low concentration levels of 10 ng/...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] determination of trace <b>residues</b> <b>and</b> <b>contaminants</b> in complex matrices, such as food, often requires extensive sample extraction and preparation prior to instrumental analysis. Sample preparation is often the bottleneck in analysis and {{there is a need to}} minimise the number of steps to reduce both time and sources of error.

Smaller sample size becomes important when dealing with real life problems, such as consumer complaints and alleged chemical contamination. Optimal sample preparation can reduce analysis time, sources of error, enhance sensitivity and enable unequivocal identification, confirmation and quantification. This review considers all aspects of sample preparation, covering general extraction techniques, such as Soxhlet and pressurised liquid extraction, microextraction techniques such as liquid phase microextraction (LPME) and more selective techniques, such as solid phase extraction (SPE), solid phase microextraction (SPME) and stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the quality and applications of liquid oil produced by thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) plastic waste by using a small pilot scale pyrolysis reactor. Thermal pyrolysis produced maximum liquid oil (80. 8 %) with gases (13 %) and char (6. 2 %), while catalytic pyrolysis using synthetic and natural zeolite decreased the liquid oil yield (52 %) with an increase in gases (17. 7 %) and char (30. 1 %) production. The lower yield but improved quality of liquid oil through catalytic pyrolysis are due to catalytic features of zeolites such as microporous structure and high BET surface area. The liquid oils, both from thermal and catalytic pyrolysis consist of around 99 % aromatic hydrocarbons, as further confirmed by GC-MS results. FT-IR analysis further showed chemical bonding and functional groups of mostly aromatic hydrocarbons, which is consistent with GC-MS results.

Potential contaminant {{sources such as}} urban and agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, mine drainage, and irrigation varied among the sampling sites. Our objectives were to provide summary statistics for chemical <b>contaminants</b> <b>and</b> to determine if contaminant concentrations in the fish were a risk to wildlife that forage at these sites. Concentrations of dieldrin, total DDT, total PCBs, toxaphene, TCDDEQ, cadmium, chromium, mercury, lead, selenium, and zinc exceeded toxicity thresholds to protect fish and piscivorous wildlife in samples from at least one site; most exceedences were for total PCBs, mercury, and zinc. Chemical concentrations in fish from the Mississippi River Basin exceeded {{the greatest number of}} toxicity thresholds. Screening level wildlife risk analysis models were developed for bald eagle and mink using no adverse effect levels (NOAELs), which were derived from adult dietary exposure or tissue concentration studies and based primarily on reproductive endpoints. No effect hazard concentrations (NEHC) were calculated by comparing the NOAEL to the food ingestion rate (dietary-based NOAEL) or biomagnification factor (tissue-based NOAEL) of each receptor. Piscivorous wildlife may be at risk from a contaminant if the measured concentration in fish exceeds the NEHC. Concentrations of most organochlorine <b>residues</b> <b>and</b> elemental <b>contaminants</b> represented no to low risk to bald eagle and mink at most sites. The risk associated with pentachloroanisole, aldrin, Dacthal, methoxychlor, mirex, and toxaphene was unknown because NOAELs for these contaminants were not available for bald eagle or mink. Risk differed among modeled species and sites. Our screening level analysis indicates that the greatest risk to piscivorous wildlife was from total DDT, total PCBs, TCDD-EQ, mercury, and selenium.

40|$|Excerpt] 2 ̆ 2 In general, {{people in}} the {{developed}} world have access to a safe and varied supply of food. Instead of systemic hunger, many developed countries have problems with obesity and other kinds of eating disorders among their citizenry. It is within this context that some find public concerns about the safety of food both paradoxical and misplaced. Nevertheless, understanding how people perceive the risk associated with food is an important exercise in demonstrating accountability and in setting priorities for regulation. With the advent of technologies for producing genetically modified foods, and the development of fat blockers like Olestra, the public is increasingly being asked to judge the social acceptability of various kinds of food modifications. In addition to interpreting the risks and benefits associated with these newer innovations, the public is also balancing the risks and benefits of more familiar food interventions. Not only must consumers of food assess the merits of genetic modification and food irradiation, they still must consider exposure to pesticide <b>residues</b> <b>and</b> microbiological <b>contaminants</b> like Salmonella, Listeria, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter. Additionally, with high rates of cardiovascular disease and elevated concerns about developing diseases like diabetes, many people seriously consider the fat and sugar content of the foods they consume. This exploratory study examines how the public perceives food risks by employing a ranking exercise, a scale for assessing food safety practices, a scale for combining elements from the psychometric paradigm (e. g., voluntary exposure, perceived benefit, and perceived risk) across five potential food hazards, and demographic variables (sex, age, and level of education) most commonly linked to the perception of food risks. 2 ̆...|$|R

Therefore, to ensure food safety EU and USA regulatory agencies have established lists of forbidden or banned substances and tolerance levels for authorized veterinary drugs (e. g. antibacterials). In addition, the EU Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC has set requirements about the performance of analytical methods for the {{determination of}} veterinary drug residues in food and feedstuffs.

40|$|This project fits {{well within}} the overall {{objectives}} established by the Environmental Management and Science Program to promote long-term basic research that will provide the tools for more effective and lower cost remediation efforts at DOE sites where hazardous and radioactive wastes or contamination zones are present. In order to develop the necessary remediation technology it has been recognized that a fundamental understanding of the various chemical and physical factors associated with waste treatment <b>and</b> <b>contaminant</b> transport must be established. Some of the specific topics include waste pretreatment, volume reduction, immobilization, separation methods, the interactions of actinides and heavy metals with surfaces {{in the presence of}} organic <b>residues</b> <b>and</b> co-contaminants, <b>contaminant</b> transport in the environment, and long-term storage site assessment. This project has direct and potential application in all these areas. The interaction <b>and</b> partitioning of <b>contaminant</b> metals <b>and</b> radionuclides between solution and solid- surface phases is a fundamental issue for waste treatment <b>and</b> predicting <b>contaminant</b> transport in the environment. Many factors are involved in the functional relationships describing chemical reactivity and physical distribution of chemical species. These include modification of chemical behavior by the suite of chemical co-contaminants in a system. Organic complexing agents are common components of waste mixtures and include both synthetic components specifically introduced as part of processing methods, and poorly characterized compounds that were introduced separately or evolved within the highly reactive wastes. Natural organic complexing agents such as citric acid and siderophores are common in nature and represent factors that will further influence contaminant transport in soils and aquatic systems. Knowledge of the existence of a metal-organic complex cannot automatically be used to predict changes in solid-solution partitioning of the metal or the rates of changes in partitioning as a consequence of ligand or metal exchange. Formation of metal ion-ligand-oxide surface ternary complexes can enhance sorption in some cases while highly stable metal-organic complexes in solution will decrease sorption. The preference for these two cases depends on the relative chemical properties of each component as well as system parameters such as pH and ionic strength and the relative reaction rates. In general, there is a fundamental absence of the experimental observations needed to establish the trends needed for predictive modeling and technological developments. If the authors can understand both the equilibrium partitioning in these ternary systems (i. e., metal-ligand-solid) and the types of complexes that form as functions of a set of measurable parameters that characterize the system, the authors should significantly improve the ability to estimate the mass transport rates of <b>contaminants</b> <b>and</b> natural solutes in aquifers and water columns where organic ligands are significant species. The authors will also be better prepared to devise remediation strategies where introduction of organic ligands can bring about either mobilization of contaminants or enhanced retardation. The ligands are likely to prove useful in the direct treatment and remediation of contaminated sites (Francis and Dodge, 1992; Tuin and Tels, 1990) and can be chosen for their long term stability or their ability to degrade by natural biotic processes. ...|$|R

In its assessment of residue levels, BfR comes to the conclusion that even if maximum levels are exceeded, one-time or occasional intake did not constitute a consumers health risk. It was once again determined that the kidneys and livers of sheep are the foodstuffs most affected by heavy metals. BfR thus maintains its recommendation to principally abstain from the consumption of these...|$|E
40|$|The {{intake of}} known dietary {{carcinogens}} was compiled and the cancer risk was estimated {{on the basis}} of carcinogenic potencies in animals as derived from the Carcinogenic Potency Database by Gold and co-workers. The total cancer risk was compared with the number of cancer cases attributed by epidemiologists to dietary factors (one-third of all cancer cases, i. e. ∼ 80 000 per one million lives). Except for alcohol, the known dietary carcinogens could not account {{for more than a few}} hundred cancer cases. This was seen both with the DNA-reactive carcinogens (heterocyclic aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, N-nitroso compounds, estragole, aflatoxin B 1, ethyl carbamate, to name the most important factors) as well as with those carcinogens which have not been shown to react with DNA (e. g. caffeic acid and the carcinogenic metals arsenic and cadmium). <b>Residues</b> <b>and</b> <b>contaminants</b> turned out to be negligible. Among the various possibilities to explain the discrepancy we investigated the role of overnutrition. Dietary restriction in animals is well known for its strong reducing effect on spontaneous tumor formation. These data can be used to derive a carcinogenic potency for excess macronutrients: the tumor incidence seen with the restricted animals is taken as a control value and the increased tumor incidence in the animals fed ad libitum is attributed to the additional feed intake. For excess standard diet in rats, a carcinogenic potency TD 50 of 16 g/kg/day was deduced from a recent study. Overnutrition in Switzerland, estimated to be 5. 5 kcal/kg/day, was converted to excess food (1. 9 g/kg/day) and the cancer incidence was calculated. The result, 60 000 cancer cases per one million lives, is provocatively close to the number of cases not explained by the known dietary chemical carcinogens. Mechanistic studies will be required to test our hypothesis and investigate the role of different types of macronutrients in overnutritio...|$|E
40|$|Oat for cereal {{production}} needs to fulfil several requirements including the processing properties and permissible amounts of <b>residues</b> <b>and</b> <b>contaminants.</b> Recently, requirements regarding {{the content of}} nutrients have been added. This study gives an overview over the variation {{of the content of}} nutrients in oat and their relevance on the manufacturing of oat products. Representative samples of commercial oat lots from Germany, Finland, Sweden, Great Britain and Australia harvested between 1995 and 2002 have been investigated. Furthermore, oat samples of variety trials performed by the Agricultural Board of Schleswig-Holstein and Niedersachsen were included. Among others, the content of oat kernels in protein, fat, beta-glucan, vitamin E and thiamine were determined. The protein content of oat varies between 12 and 17 per cent/dm. In some cases a minimum protein content of oat products of 12 per cent is required. The fat content ranges from 6 to 10 per cent/dm. For the production of rolled oats larger contents are particularly suitable while lower values are advantageous for the production of extruded oat products. The amounts of free fatty acids and peroxides should be low to improve storage life of the oat products. The beta-glucan content of oat is 3, 6 to 5, 1 per cent/dm. For the production of oat products with cholesterol reducing activity larger concentrations of beta-glucan are to be prefered. The vitamin E content of the oat samples also varies significantly. The ratio mg alpha-tocopherol-equivalents/g diene acid equivalents is of major relevance in terms of nutritional quality. Low vitamin E contents indicate an exceeding storage time or inappropriate storage conditions (Hampshire 2003). The content of oat in thiamine is influenced by the farming system (conventional or organic farming) used and also by the oat variety and the growing site. For the production of certain dietary foods minimum levels of thiamine have been defined. Hampshire, J. 2003. Deutsche Lebensmittel-Rundschau 99 : 222 - 231. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{reclaimed}} wastewater (RWW) for {{the irrigation}} of crops {{may result in}} the continuous exposure of the agricultural environment to antibiotics, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In recent years, certain evidence indicate that antibiotics and resistance genes may become disseminated in agricultural soils {{as a result of}} the amendment with manure and biosolids and irrigation with RWW. Antibiotic <b>residues</b> <b>and</b> other <b>contaminants</b> may undergo sorption/desorption and transformation processes (both biotic and abiotic), and have the potential to affect the soil microbiota. Antibiotics found in the soil pore water (bioavailable fraction) as a result of RWW irrigation may be taken up by crop plants, bioaccumulate within plant tissues and subsequently enter the food webs; potentially resulting in detrimental public health implications. It can be also hypothesized that ARGs can spread among soil and plant-associated bacteria, a fact that may have serious human health implications. The majority of studies dealing with these environmental and social challenges related with the use of RWW for irrigation were conducted under laboratory or using, somehow, controlled conditions. This critical review discusses the state of the art on the fate of antibiotics, ARB and ARGs in agricultural environment where RWW is applied for irrigation. The implications associated with the uptake of antibiotics by plants (uptake mechanisms) and the potential risks to public health are highlighted. Additionally, knowledge gaps as well as challenges and opportunities are addressed, with the aim of boosting future research towards an enhanced understanding of the fate and implications of these contaminants of emerging concern in the agricultural environment. These are key issues in a world where the increasing water scarcity and the continuous appeal of circular economy demand answers for a long-term safe use of RWW for irrigation. “The authors would like to acknowledge the COST Action ES 1403 NEREUS “New and emerging challenges and opportunities in wastewater reuse”, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology, www. cost. eu). ”info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
