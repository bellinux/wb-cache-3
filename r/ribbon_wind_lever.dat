5000|$|The Iloca was a 35mm {{rangefinder}} camera {{produced from}} 1952 to 1959 by Wilhelm Witt of Hamburg. Models designated [...] "Rapid" [...] had a rapid <b>winding</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Contaflex Rapid was {{introduced}} in 1958 and had a slightly longer body, a built-in accessory shoe, a <b>winding</b> <b>lever</b> and a rewind crank. It was the meterless version.|$|R
5000|$|The Zorki 4 came in 2 {{variants}} {{the original}} {{which uses a}} thumb wheel to advance to film and cock the shutter. The Zorki 4k included a <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> for easier operation.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature to}} {{note on the}} R-D1 {{is that it is}} a digital camera that has a {{manually}} wound shutter with a rapid <b>wind</b> <b>lever.</b> The controls operate in the same way as film-based rangefinder cameras.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid <b>wind</b> <b>lever,</b> the bottom right mounted rewind release, and film speed reminder around the film rewind crank.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{adopted and}} further {{developed}} the SLR. In 1952, Asahi developed the Asahiflex and in 1954, the Asahiflex IIB. In 1957, the Asahi Pentax combined the fixed pentaprism and the right-hand thumb <b>wind</b> <b>lever.</b> Nikon, Canon and Yashica introduced their first SLRs in 1959 (the F, Canonflex, and Pentamatic, respectively).|$|R
50|$|The SR-T 101 {{was also}} made {{available}} in black. The top cover and the base plate are finished in black enamel while most metal parts are black chromed, but the <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> is black anodised. The parts still chromed, {{to name the}} most obvious ones, include the shutter-release button, the mirror lock-up knob, the depth-of-field preview button and the lens-release button.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid <b>wind</b> <b>lever,</b> the bottom right mounted rewind release. It also had a film speed reminder around the film rewind crank, a location that remained standard until the dial went from being merely a reminder to the photographer to actually controlling the light meter built into later SLRs.|$|R

50|$|One {{of the few}} cameras ever {{produced}} for left-handers was the half-frame Yashica Samurai. Cameras predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> and commonly used selection buttons, switches and dials controlled by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972 Canon made {{a special}} Modification of the F-1 called the [...] "High Speed Motor Drive Camera". It had a fixed {{pellicle}} (semi transparent) mirror, the motor drive motors were a permanent attachment (the camera's <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> was removed - {{making it impossible}} to use without the motor drive) and was powered by 20 AA batteries! Maximum speed was 9 frame/sec - the fastest available at the time. Its use at the 1972 Olympics in Japan produced fantastic sequential shots that were previously impossible to achieve.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "guilloche" [...] is {{also used}} more {{generally}} for repetitive architectural patterns of intersecting or overlapping spirals or other shapes, as used in the Ancient Near East, classical Greece and Rome and neo-classical architecture, and Early Medieval interlace decoration in Anglo-Saxon art and elsewhere. Medieval Cosmatesque stone inlay designs with two <b>ribbons</b> <b>winding</b> around a series of regular central points are very often called guilloche. These central points are often blank, but may contain a figure, such as a rose. [...] These senses are a back-formation from the engraving guilloché, so called because the architectural motifs resemble the designs produced by later guilloché techniques.|$|R
5000|$|Patterned by Nature was {{commissioned}} by the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, North Carolina. This piece was a collaboration between Hypersonic, Sosolimited, and Plebian Design. 10 feet wide and 90 feet in length, this sculptural <b>ribbon</b> <b>winds</b> through a five story atrium of the newly built Nature Research Center museum expansion. [...] "The exhibit celebrates the abstraction of natures infinite complexity into patterns through the scientific process. It brings to light the similarity of patterns in our universe, across all scales of space and time.", says Bill Washabaugh, one of the project designers. The ribbon is made of 3,600 tiles of individually dimmable LCD glass, and runs on {{a total of about}} 75 watts of power.|$|R
5000|$|The FT's {{exposure}} control system was a [...] "center-the-needle" [...] system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving vertically {{at the lower}} {{right side of the}} viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in, open aperture, TTL, full-scene averaging, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the actual camera settings. The photographer would adjust the shutter speed to freeze or blur motion and/or the lens aperture f-stop to control depth of field (focus) until the needle was centered between two pincer-like brackets. The needle array was duplicated in a window next the top-mounted film rewind crank to allow {{exposure control}} without looking through the viewfinder. The meter was turned on by pulling the film <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> out to the standby ready position and turned off by pushing it back flush against the camera.|$|R

5000|$|Early Kine Exaktas had a fixed waist-level viewfinder, {{but later}} models, {{starting}} with the Exakta Varex, had an interchangeable waist- or eye-level finder. Examat and Travemat Through-the-lens metering prisms were introduced in the mid-1960s. Most controls—including the shutter release and the film <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> - are on the left-hand side, unlike most other cameras. The film is transported {{in the opposite direction}} to other 35mm SLRs. In classic Exaktas—made between 1936 and 1969—two film canisters can be used, one containing unexposed film and a second into which is wound the exposed film. A sliding knife built {{into the bottom of the}} camera can be used to slice the film so that the canister containing the exposed film can be removed while preserving the unexposed film in the main canister. The knife was omitted in the Exakta VX500, one of the last [...] "official" [...] Exakta cameras.|$|R

40|$|Radial {{symmetry}} {{is essential}} for the conventional view of the polymer spherulite microstructure. Typically it is assumed that, {{in the course of the}} spherulite morphogenesis, the lamellar crystals grow radially. Using submicron X-ray diffraction, it is shown that in banded spherulites of poly(propylene adipate) the crystals have the shape of a helix with fl at-on crystals winding around a virtual cylinder of about 6 ¿m in diameter. The helix angle of 30 °?implies that the crystal growth direction is tilted away from the spherulite radius by this angle. The implications of the helical crystal shape contradict the paradigm of the spherulitic microstructure. The radial growth rate of such spherulites does not correspond to the crystal growth rate, but to the propagation rate of the virtual cylinder the <b>ribbons</b> <b>wind</b> around. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

60|$|Richard {{begged to}} be shown how to perform the exploit, and Alberic {{repeated}} it; then Richard wanted to try, but the pony's patience would not endure any longer, and Alberic said he had learnt on a block of wood, and practised on the great wolf-hound. They wandered about a little longer in the court, and then climbed up the spiral stone stairs to the battlements {{at the top of}} the tower, where they looked at the house-tops of Rouen close beneath, and the river Seine, broadening and glittering on one side in its course to the sea, and on the other narrowing to a blue <b>ribbon,</b> <b>winding</b> through the green expanse of fertile Normandy. They threw the pebbles and bits of mortar down that they might hear them fall, and tried which could stand nearest to the edge of the battlement without being giddy. Richard was pleased to find that he could go the nearest, and began to tell some of Fru Astrida's stories about the precipices of Norway, among which when she was a young girl she used to climb about and tend the cattle in the long light summer time. When the two boys came down again into the hall to dinner, they felt as if they had known each other all their lives. The dinner was laid out in full state, and Richard had, as before, to sit in the great throne-like chair with the old Count of Harcourt on one side, but, to his comfort, Fru Astrida was on the other.|$|R
5000|$|The R9 was an {{evolutionary}} step from the R8 and appears superficially very similar; {{enough so that}} some have opined {{that it should have}} been simply a Mark II of the R8, or in Leica nomenclature, an [...] "R8.2".2 The silver top-plate color available on the R8 was replaced by an 'Anthracite' color on the R9; black remained available. Another external change was the addition of an LCD frame counter on the top plate between the <b>wind</b> <b>lever</b> and the shutter-speed dial. The mode selector dial gained a lock, after many R8 user complaints that it was too easily moved from the desired setting when handling the camera. The rear LCD display gained a backlight so it could be viewed in dim lighting. The mass of the R9 was reduced by 100g (to 790g) from the R8, achieved by switching to a magnesium casting for the top plate (formerly zinc alloy) and substituting aluminum for steel at the bottom plate's frame. Electronic changes included the ability to tune the sensitivity of matrix metering in steps of 0.1 EV independently of the other metering modes, and several improvements to the flash support. Metz's HSS (High Speed Sync) flash mode was now supported, allowing fill flash at shutter speeds greater than the X-sync speed by the use of many repeated small flashes of the electronic flashgun. This mode could be used from 1/360 to the camera's shortest 1/8000 of a second shutter speed. Also improved was the use of fill-flash at slower shutter speeds and wider apertures, by enabling lower-power illumination modes on modern Metz equipment. The manual flash exposure compensation ability in Program mode was improved, and AE lock was now possible in all automated modes.|$|R
50|$|Woven {{typewriter}} ribbons were the earlier variant. With them, the pigment is an ink that dries on typing paper {{but not on}} the ribbon, and the ribbon is mounted at each end to a flanged reel whose hub engages with one of the axles. Only the axle onto which the <b>ribbon</b> is <b>winding</b> is driven, and the ribbon module is intended to work with an axle-driving mechanism that reverses the direction of rotation when the undriven axle reaches the point where there is no ribbon left wound around it. Thus the full length of the ribbon shuttles back and forth between reels, and each position along it is struck twice in each cycle of the ribbon's motion (once in the right-to-left phase and once in the left-to-right).|$|R
