50|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of speed generally demanded by a computer game, files are indexed in a hash table using a quick, low-collision hashing algorithm. The index of a specific file within the hash table is the hash of the lowercased filename modulo the size of the hash table, allowing for quick verification of a file's existence within the archive. If multiple files within the archive have the same hash, colliding entries will follow each other in increasing <b>index</b> <b>order</b> (<b>forming</b> a colliding hash cluster). In order to identify the exact entry for the requested file within a colliding hash cluster, each hash table entry stores 2 additional hashes of the lowercased filename, each using the same hashing algorithm but with a different seed value, as well as a locale code and platform code. The end of a colliding hash cluster is detected either by encountering an empty hash table entry or by traversing the entire hash table (including the modulo loopback) back to the initial hash table index.|$|R
40|$|Probabilistic and Risk-based {{methods are}} raising {{more and more}} {{interest}} {{in the context of}} power systems operation because they represent a new approach to Security Assessment (SA) in deregulated electricity markets.

Osteoporosis rate was found to be high in high-risk groups of all indexes. The most effective indices were observed to be OST, SCORE and FRAX-H, in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, positive and negative predicting value. However, in the lumbar region, ratio of patients that can be missed using indexes was not found low enough. Conclusion: In this study, the most effective indices were observed to be OST, SCORE and FRAX-H. The rate of overlooked patients was not low enough in the lumbar area.

40|$|Background—Neither {{clinical}} prediction models nor noninvasive imaging {{tests that}} detect coronary artery calcification identify all patients who experience acute coronary events. Variations in culprit plaque morphology {{may account for}} these inaccuracies. Methods and Results—We compared the 10 -year Framingham <b>risk</b> <b>index,</b> histologic coronary calcification, and culprit plaque morphology in 79 consecutive adults with sudden cardiac death. There was a modest relationship between the Framingham <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> {{and the extent of}} histologic coronary calcification (r 50. 35, P 50. 002). Agreement in risk classification between the histologic calcification score and the Framingham <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> occurred in 50 of 79 cases (63. 3 %, P 50. 039). Either a focus of coronary artery calcification $ 40 mmol/L (62 % of cases) or a Framingham <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> score $ average risk for age (62 % of cases) were present in 66 of 79 (83. 5 %) cases. Cases with plaque erosion (n 522) had significantly less coronary calcification (P 50. 003) and lower Framingham <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> (P 50. 001) scores than stable (n 527) or ruptured (n 530) plaques.

40|$|By {{adjusting}} the maintenance approach towards the significant components of ship’s engines and equipment, {{through the use}} of operational data from the ship machinery’s daily reports, higher operability and navigation safety can be achieved. The proposed maintenance adjustment model consists of an operation data analysis and risk analysis. The risk analysis comprises the definition of the upper and the lower risk criterion, as well as the definition of a <b>risk</b> <b>index.</b> If the <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> is higher than the lower risk criterion, the component is significant, while it is not significant and has an acceptable <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> if the <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> is lower than the lower risk criterion. For each significant component with a <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> found to be “unacceptable” or “undesirable”, an efficient maintenance policy needs to be adopted. The assessment of the proposed model is based on data regarding the power engine original operation throughout a 13 -year period. The results of engine failure examinations reveal that the exhaust valve is the most vulnerable component with the highest rate of failure. For this reason the proposed model of {{adjusting the}} maintenance approach has been tested on the exhaust valve sample.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} a simple <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> based on age and vital signs in a community sample of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). BackgroundA simple <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> based on age and vital signs (heart rate × [age/ 10] 2 /systolic blood pressure) developed from patients with STEMI accurately predicts mortality in clinical trials of fibrinolysis. The application of such a tool in an unselected population is necessary to evaluate its utility in clinical practice. MethodsTo evaluate the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> for routine practice, we tested it in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI) - 3 and - 4. The <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> was evaluated as a continuous variable in patients with STEMI from NRMI and in subgroups based on age and reperfusion status. ResultsA total of 153, 486 patients with STEMI were eligible. As anticipated, STEMI patients in NRMI had a higher <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> profile, as compared {{with those in the}} clinical trial (median 26. 9 vs. 20, p < 0. 0001). Classification of NRMI patients with STEMI into risk groups revealed a significant graded relationship with mortality (0. 9 % to 53. 2 %, ptrend< 0. 0001, cstatistic 0. 79). The discriminatory capacity of the <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> was particularly strong in the 81, 679 patients receiving reperfusion therapy (0. 6 % to 60 %, ptrend< 0. 0001, cstatistic 0. 81). For the 71, 807 patients not receiving reperfusion therapy, a strong graded relationship remained (1. 9 % to 52. 2 %, ptrend< 0. 0001, cstatistic 0. 71). Among the elderly, although the distribution of scores was shifted toward higher risk, the performance remained (0 % to 53. 1 %, ptrend< 0. 0001, cstatistic 0. 71). ConclusionsA simple <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> from baseline clinical variables routinely obtained at the first patient encounter predicted mortality in a large unselected heterogeneous group of patients with STEMI...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Risk</b> <b>indices</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} to identify women at risk of low bone mineral density (BMD) who should undergo BMD testing. Aim: To compare the performance of four <b>risk</b> <b>indices</b> in White ambulatory women in Belgium. DESIGN: Epidemiological cross-sectional study. METHODS: Records were analysed for 4035 postmenopausal White women without Paget's disease or advanced osteoarthritis, seen at an out-patient osteoporosis centre between January 1996 and September 1999. Osteoporosis <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> scores were compared to bone density T-scores. The ability of each <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> to identify women with low BMD (T-score < - 2. 0) or osteoporosis (T < - 2. 5) was evaluated. RESULTS: Using an Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OST) score < 2 to recommend DXA referral, sensitivity ranged from 85 % at the lumbar spine to 97 % at the total hip to detect BMD T-scores of <or= - 2. 5, and specificity ranged from 34 % at the total hip to 37 % at the femoral neck and lumbar spine. The negative predictive value was high at all skeletal sites (89 - 99 %), demonstrating the usefulness of the OST to identify patients who have normal BMD and should not receive DXA testing. All <b>risk</b> <b>indices</b> performed similarly, although the OST had somewhat better sensitivity and somewhat lower specificity than the other indices at the cut-offs evaluated. Among the 11 - 12 % of women who were classified as highest risk using OST or the Osteoporosis <b>Index</b> of <b>Risk</b> (OSIRIS), 81 - 85 % had low bone mass and 68 - 74 % had osteoporosis. DISCUSSION: The performance of these <b>risk</b> <b>indices</b> among women in Belgium was similar to that reported earlier for other samples in Asian countries, the US, and the Netherlands. The OST and other <b>risk</b> <b>indices</b> are effective and efficient tools to help target high-risk women for DXA testing. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionRheumatoid {{arthritis}} is an {{autoimmune disease}} that causes systemic involvement and {{is associated with}} increased risk of cardiovascular disease. ObjectiveTo analyze the prediction index of 10 -year risk of a fatal cardiovascular disease event in female RA patients versus controls. MethodsCase–control study with analysis of 100 female patients matched for age and gender versus 100 patients in the control group. For the prediction of 10 -year risk of a fatal cardiovascular disease event, the SCORE and modified SCORE (mSCORE) <b>risk</b> <b>indexes</b> were used, as suggested by EULAR, in the subgroup with {{two or more of}} the following: duration of disease ≥ 10 years, RF and/or anti-CCP positivity, and extra-articular manifestations. ResultsThe prevalence of analyzed comorbidities was similar in RA patients compared with the control group (p> 0. 05). The means of the SCORE <b>risk</b> <b>index</b> in RA patients and in the control group were 1. 99 (SD: 1. 89) and 1. 56 (SD: 1. 87) (p= 0. 06), respectively. The means of mSCORE index in RA patients and in the control group were 2. 84 (SD= 2. 86) and 1. 56 (SD= 1. 87) (p= 0. 001), respectively. By using the SCORE <b>risk</b> <b>index,</b> 11 % of RA patients were classified as of high risk, and with the use of mSCORE <b>risk</b> <b>index,</b> 36 % were at high risk (p< 0. 001).
