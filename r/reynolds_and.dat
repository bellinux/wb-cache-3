40|$|Laminar {{interference}} heating correlations {{have been}} developed based on recent experimental data obtained with wedge/flat plate models for wide ranges of <b>Reynolds</b> number <b>and</b> shock strength. Two correlation techniques were developed using the Eckert reference method.

The second approach was made by correlating peak interference Stanton number with only <b>Reynolds</b> number <b>and</b> Prandtl number based on downstream flow conditions. The laminar boundary layer remains laminar when both <b>Reynolds</b> number <b>and</b> shock strength are low but becomes transitional or turbulent when Reynolds number or/and shock strength are increased...|$|R
