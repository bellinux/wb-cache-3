50|$|The Dresden codex {{contains}} {{another method}} for writing distance numbers. These are Ring Numbers. Specific dates within the Dresden codex are often given by calculations involving Ring Numbers. Förstemann identified these, but Wilson (1924:24-25) later clarified {{the way in}} which they operate. Ring Numbers are intervals of days between the Era Base date 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk’u and an earlier <b>Ring</b> <b>Base</b> date, where the place-holder for the numeral of days in the interval is circled by an image of a tied red band. Added to this earlier <b>Ring</b> <b>Base</b> date is another count of days forward, which Thompson refers to as a Long Round, leading to a final date within the Long Count that is given as an entry date to be used within a specific table in the codex.|$|E

5000|$|Besides coarse amphora {{used for}} storage and transport, {{high-quality}} painted amphorae were produced in Ancient Greece in significant numbers {{for a variety}} of social and ceremonial purposes. Their design differs significantly from the more functional versions; they are typified by wide mouth and a <b>ring</b> <b>base,</b> with a glazed surface and decorated with figures or geometric shapes. Such amphorae often were used as prizes. Some examples, bearing the inscription [...] "I am one of the prizes from Athens", have survived from the Panathenaic Festivals held between the 6th century BC to the 2nd century BC. Painted amphorae also were used for funerary purposes.|$|E
50|$|In Cuba, it {{is known}} as a cortadito, usually served in a special glass, often with a metal <b>ring</b> <b>base</b> and a metal wire handle. There are several variations, {{including}} cortado condensada, café con leche condensada or bombón (espresso with condensed milk), and leche y leche (with condensed milk and cream on top). Brought to the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami, Florida, by Cuban-Americans in the 1960s, the drink is now found throughout the city, and {{is an important part of}} everyday culture, particularly among Cubans. However, the cortadito is a drink distinct from Cuban-style coffee, which includes sugar in addition to milk, and has its own brewing method as espresso.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ring</b> <b>base</b> {{was almost}} unknown in Anatolia, flat and plano-convex bases were worked instead. Altogether, the {{appearance}} of the vessels is different. The earliest figurines' appearance is also completely different. The very rare pottery from levels XII and XI at Çatalhöyük closely resembles in shape the very coarse earthenware of Early Neolithic I from Sesklo, but the paste is quite different, having a partly vegetable temper, and this pottery is contemporaneous, not a predecessor of the better-made products in the Thessalonian material. On the whole, the artifactual data argues in favor of a largely independent indigenous development of the Greek Neolithic settlements. This indicates that the domestication of cattle was indigenous on the Greek mainland.|$|E

5000|$|The East Greek Bird Bowl {{developed}} around 700 BC, {{probably in}} northern Ionia, from the bird-kotyle. Although they are subgeometric in style, {{they belong to}} orientalising period of Ancient Greek vase-painting. On average, the cups have a diameter of 15 cm. Usually, they are decorated with three rectangular metope-like panels. The central, elongated one holds the depiction of a diagonally hatched bird. The side panels are decorated with hatched rhomboids. The earliest bird cups have a small ledge under the rim and additional row of dots under the decoration, below which the body is painted in solid black. Around 675 BC the ledge and dots were abandoned, from about 640 onwards, the originally black-painted bottom of the bowl was left in natural clay colour, but often decorated with a star or five rays. The hatched rhomboids were also replaced with small ray or tongue patterns. Around 615 BC, the separating lines between the metopes or panels disappeared. Around the same time, the <b>ring</b> <b>base</b> {{was replaced by a}} flat base with a concave centre. The production of bird cups ended after about a century, around 600 BC. They were succeeded by rosette cups. Apart from the East Greek bird bowl, during the orientalising period, there was also a Boeotian Bird Bowl.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Chuck Versus the Living Dead", Shaw is {{revealed}} to be alive, and downloads the Ring's Intersect prior {{to the end of}} the episode. In the next episode [...] "Chuck Versus the Subway", Shaw discredits the team by fooling them into storming a hearing between Beckman and a military panel over the fate of the Intersect project. Shaw claimed to have been acting as a double agent to infiltrate the Ring and compliments Chuck as a hero before exposing Dr. Dreyfus's analysis of Chuck's condition. Beckman attempts to defend Chuck by describing his successes. Chuck observes Shaw's flash on her mention of Alexis White, and throws a knife at Shaw in an effort to force him to reveal he had downloaded the Intersect; Shaw nevertheless resists, which discredits Operation Bartowski and Beckman. After Chuck's escape from custody, Shaw takes Sarah and Casey into custody as bait. However, Chuck and Stephen Bartowski instead locate the <b>Ring</b> <b>base</b> where Shaw downloads his Intersect. There it {{is revealed}} that Dr. Kowambe's research was used to save his life. Shaw intercepts them and steals Chuck's Governor, a device designed to protect the human Intersect from going insane, and fatally shoots Stephen. Shaw later attempts to execute the team, but is ambushed by Devon and Morgan, who rescue them with Casey's Crown Vic.|$|E
50|$|Known as El Mangal or “place of many mango trees” by the locals, {{this site}} has trees that were {{much larger than}} those at Caobal or Matamangos. The area also had a lagoon that was known on {{regional}} maps as “El Mangal” (showing {{a knowledge of the}} area by people other than the locals). The water in the lagoon is not good for drinking or cooking but it useful for washing and catching fish. A current family has made residence at El Mangal and has unearthed a whole machete, they also found pieces of thick, hard, brown pottery (traditional Lacandón ceramic). While digging a trash pit the family found more pottery, although it was not the traditional smooth bowls that had been found at El Caobal, they were still ethnographically Lacandón. The vessels were identified as incense burners. The shape was hemispherical with a <b>ring</b> <b>base</b> and a hole for venting the fire and releasing smoke. Unlike the smooth ceramics used for every day life these vessels were adorned with the modeled head of a deity on the rim, proving this object is used for religious rites. The modeled heads “closely resemble those made by the ethnographic Lacandon.” Other decorations include incised lines and holes down the front of the bowl and protruding spikes. These vessels were used in “God houses” for religious purposes. During the Lacandón incense burner renewal ceremony men isolated themselves from the community and crafted the burners in solitude. They were placed in the god house and the old burners were deposited at a sacred place in the forest. The presence of these incense burners points possibly to a religious god house, a manufacturing site or even a sacred place of disposal.|$|E

The tests were performed using hat-shaped samples with beforehand-determined direction of forced shear. Sizes of samples were thoroughly selected in order to minimize plastic deformation of the hat-shaped part and the <b>ring</b> <b>base,</b> which are in contact with the bar ends. Results of testing of copper M 1 and steel 09 G 2 S were obtained; “shear stress-displacement” diagrams were plotted. Values of amplitudes and durations of loading pulses were determined.

40|$|An {{interchange}} ring,(R,+,*) is an {{abelian group}} with a second binary operation defined so that the interchange law (x+y) *(u+v) =(x*u) +(y*v) holds. An interchange near ring is the same structure based on a group {{which may not be}} abelian. It is shown that given any group,G,each interchange(near) <b>ring</b> <b>based</b> on that group is formed from a pair of endomorphisms of G whose images commute, and that all interchange (near) <b>rings</b> <b>based</b> on G can be characterized in this manner. To obtain an associative interchange ring, the endomorphisms must be commuting idempotents in the endomorphism semigroup of G. When G is abelian we develop a group theoretic analogue of the simultaneous diagonalization of idempotent linear operators and show that pairs of endomorphisms which yield associative interchange rings can be diagonalized and then put into a canonical form. A best possible upper bound of 4 ^r can be given for the number of distinct isomorphism classes of associative interchange <b>rings</b> <b>based</b> on a finite abelian group A which is a direct sum of r cyclic groups of prime power order. If A is direct sum of r copies of the same cyclic group of prime power order, we show that there are exactly (r+ 1) (r+ 2) (r+ 3) / 6 distinct isomorphism classes of associative interchange <b>rings</b> <b>based</b> on A. Several examples are given and further comments are made about the general theory of interchange rings...|$|R

40|$|NMR {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} used to investigate the conformational effects of single and two consecutive 3 ′-S-phosphorothiolate modifications within a deoxythymidine trinucleotide. The presence of a single 3 ′-phosphorothioate modification shifts the conformation of the sugar ring it is attached to, from a mainly south to north pucker; this effect is also transmitted to the 3 ′-neighbour deoxyribose. This transmission is thought to be caused by favourable stacking of the heterocyclic bases. Similar observations have been made previously by this group. When two adjacent modifications are present, the conformations of the attached deoxyribose rings are again shifted almost completely to the north, however, there is no transmission to the 3 ′ deoxyribose <b>ring.</b> <b>Base</b> proton chemical shift analysis and molecular modelling have been used to aid elucidation of the origin of this feature. The observation for the dimodified sequence is consistent with our previously reported results for a related system in which spaced modifications are more thermodynamically stable than consecutive ones...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe 26 S {{proteasome}} is a chambered protease {{in which}} the majority of selective cellular protein degradation takes place. Throughout evolution, access of protein substrates to chambered proteases is restricted and depends on AAA-ATPases. Mechanical force generated through cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis is used to unfold substrates, open the gated proteolytic chamber and translocate the substrate into the active proteases within the cavity. Six distinct AAA-ATPases (Rpt 1 – 6) at the <b>ring</b> <b>base</b> of the 19 S regulatory particle of the proteasome are responsible for these three functions while interacting with the 20 S catalytic chamber. Although high resolution structures of the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome are not yet available, exciting recent studies {{shed light on the}} assembly of the hetero-hexameric Rpt ring and its consequent spatial arrangement, on the role of Rpt C-termini in opening the 20 S ‘gate’, and on the contribution of each individual Rpt subunit to various cellular processes. These studies are illuminated by paradigms generated through studying PAN, the simpler homo-hexameric AAA-ATPase of the archaeal proteasome. The similarities between PAN and Rpts highlight the evolutionary conserved role of AAA-ATPase in protein degradation, whereas unique properties of divergent Rpts reflect the increased complexity and tighter regulation attributed to the eukaryotic proteasome.

The results of {{the first stage of}} a monitoring BR have shown high informativity of the given instrumental- methodical means. The basic radiants of cyclical thermoelastic alternating strains are detected; the amplitudes of angular and linear displacements of magnets from different internal factors evaluated during {{operation of}} the accelerator. Is established, that the maximum radial angular and linear displacements of magnets are watched in 3, 5 - 4 day after switching on of installation and achieve in max 30 - 35 seconds of an arc or 120 - 150 microns in linear expression. The longitudinal angles of displacement thus do not exceed 4 - 5 seconds of an arc. Detected also shortperiodically (up to ten minutes) radial oscillations of a magnet, bound. Probably, with a variation of common temperature in a cooling system.
