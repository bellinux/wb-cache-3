50|$|The {{diagonal}} butterflyfish (Chaetodon fasciatus), {{also known}} as the Red Sea <b>raccoon</b> <b>butterflyfish,</b> is a species of butterflyfish (family Chaetodontidae). It is found in the Red Sea only.|$|E
50|$|The <b>raccoon</b> <b>{{butterflyfish}}</b> (Chaetodon lunula), {{also known}} as the crescent-masked butterflyfish, lunule butterflyfish, halfmoon butterflyfish, moon butterflyfish, raccoon butterfly, raccoon, raccoon coralfish, and redstriped butterflyfish, is a species of butterflyfish (family Chaetodontidae).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>raccoon</b> <b>butterflyfish</b> is {{generally}} not aggressive towards other fish, {{with the exception of}} lionfish and triggerfish. In captivity, the typical lifespan of a <b>raccoon</b> <b>butterflyfish</b> is five to seven years. It has been observed as a beneficial predator of Aiptasia and Majano sea anemones. They will eliminate this nuisance pest within a two- to six-week period depending on the anemone population and size of the tank; however, they will eagerly feed on any soft corals and may cause more harm than good to the decoration. In a confined environment, this species is prone to succumbing to [...] "marine ich", infection by the ciliate Cryptocaryon irritans.|$|E
50|$|Although {{common in}} the wild, it is rarely {{imported}} by the aquarium trade. In aquarist terms, it is considered a hardy Chaetodon and beneficial for the control of nuisance pests. The Pacific Double-saddle Butterflyfish has been observed as a beneficial predator of Aiptasia and Majano sea anemones. Like most <b>Raccoon</b> <b>Butterflyfish</b> (C. lunula), C. ulietensis will eliminate this nuisance within a 2- to 6-week period depending on the anemone population {{and size of the}} tank. And unlike most <b>raccoon</b> <b>butterflyfish,</b> this species rarely feeds on ornamental corals. The Pacific Double-saddle Butterflyfish readily accepts most prepared frozen and dry foods, thus it can easily make the transition to aquarium life, unlike the Copperband Butterflyfish (Chelmon rostratus) or other less hardy Chaetodon species.|$|E
50|$|Chaetodon lunula {{belongs to}} the large {{subgenus}} Rabdophorus which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, its closest relative is probably the very similar Red Sea <b>raccoon</b> <b>butterflyfish</b> or diagonal butterflyfish, C. fasciatus. Other close relatives {{appear to be the}} black butterflyfish, C. flavirostris), Philippine butterflyfish, C. adiergastos, and perhaps also the unusual redtail butterflyfish, C. collare.|$|E
5000|$|It {{belongs to}} the large {{subgenus}} Rabdophorus which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, its relationships are doubtful; it seems related to the [...] "raccoon-masked" [...] group including the black butterflyfish (C. flavirostris), diagonal butterflyfish (C. fasciatus), Philippine butterflyfish (C. adiergastos) and the <b>raccoon</b> <b>butterflyfish</b> (C. lunula). Its color and pattern is entirely different from these, but it shares the robust habitus and bold habits.|$|E
50|$|Molokini crater {{is home to}} {{approximately}} 250 to 260 marine species. Most commonly observed among these are the black triggerfish, yellow tang, Moorish idol, parrotfish, <b>raccoon</b> <b>butterflyfish</b> and bluefin trevally. Due to constant exposure to park visitors and the long history as a conservation district, the fish of Molokini are extremely comfortable {{with the presence of}} nearby divers. Small whitetip reef sharks and moray eels are occasionally seen in the crater. In addition, Red pencil urchins can be seen quite frequently.|$|E
5000|$|It {{belongs to}} the large {{subgenus}} Rabdophorus which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, it appears {{to belong to a}} loose group including such species as the black butterflyfish (C. flavirostris), diagonal butterflyfish (C. fasciatus), <b>raccoon</b> <b>butterflyfish</b> (C. lunula) and perhaps also the unusual red-tailed butterflyfish (C. collare). Although the coloration of this group varies quite a lot, they are all largish butterflyfishes with an oval outline, and most have a pattern of ascending oblique stripes on the flanks. Except in the red-tailed butterflyfish, there is at least a vestigial form of the [...] "raccoon" [...] mask, with a white space between the dark crown and eye areas.|$|E
5000|$|... 2,000 fishes of over 400 {{species and}} has been renovated {{at a cost of}} Rs.22 crore (approx Rs 7.5 crore for aquariums and Rs. 16.5 crore for {{construction}} work done by Public Works department) [...] The exotic fish from overseas has been introduced at the new aquarium the number of new varieties of marine fish at 70. Helicopter,Arowana,Gruppen,yellow-striped tang, blue-spotted stingray, star, clown, hark, trigger, Grouper, Moorish idol, Azure Damsel, Blueline Demoiselle, Purple Firefish, Cloudy Damsel, Copperband Butterflyfish, Schooling Bannerfish, <b>Raccoon</b> <b>Butterflyfish,</b> White Tail Trigger, Clown Triggerfish and Blue Ribbon Eel. The 40 new varieties of freshwater fish would include Red Devil, Jaguar, Electric Blue Jack Dempsey,Frontosa and Catfish. These fishes will be housed in larger tanks than before with imported flexi glass for better visibility. It also has sharks, turtles, rays, moray eels, sea turtles, small starfish and stingrays.|$|E
