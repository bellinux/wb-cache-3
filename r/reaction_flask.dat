Similar to the <b>reaction</b> <b>flask,</b> the distillation flasks usually have only one narrow neck and a ground glass joint and are made of thinner glass than the <b>reaction</b> <b>flask,</b> so that it is easier to heat. They are sometimes spherical, test tube shaped, or pear-shaped, also known as a Kjeldahl Flask, due to its use with Kjeldahl bulbs.|$|E
50|$|The Dean-Stark {{apparatus}} typically {{consists of}} vertical cylindrical glass tube, {{often with a}} volumetric graduation along its full length and a precision stopcock at its lower end, {{very much like a}} burette. The lower end of a reflux condenser fits into the top of the cylinder. Immediately below the joint between the condenser and the cylinder is a sloping side-arm that joins the cylinder to a <b>reaction</b> <b>flask.</b> The lower end the side-arm turns sharply downward, so that the side-arm is connected to the <b>reaction</b> <b>flask</b> by a vertical tube.|$|E
50|$|Most {{laboratory}} glassware is currently mass-produced, but large laboratories may employ a glass blower to construct specialized pieces. This construction forms a specialized field of glassblowing requiring precise control of shape and dimension. In addition to repairing expensive or difficult-to-replace glassware, scientific glassblowing commonly involves fusing together various glass parts—such as glass joints and tubing, stopcocks, transition pieces, and/or other glassware {{or parts of}} them to form items of glassware, such as vacuum manifolds, special <b>reaction</b> <b>flasks,</b> etc.|$|R

50|$|The <b>reaction</b> <b>flask</b> is heated. Boiling chips {{within it}} {{assist with the}} calm {{formation}} of bubbles of vapor containing the reaction solvent and the component to be removed. This vapor travels out of <b>reaction</b> <b>flask</b> up into the condenser where water being circulated around it causes it to cool and drip into the distilling trap. Here, the immiscible liquids separate into layers (water below and solvent above it). When their combined volume reaches {{the level of the}} side-arm, the upper, less-dense layer will begin to flow back to the reactor while the water layer will remain in the trap. The trap will eventually reach capacity when the level of the water in it reaches the level of the side-arm. At this point, the trap must be drained into the receiving flask. The process of evaporation/ condensation/ collection may be continued until it ceases to produce additional amounts of water.|$|E

Enzyme cofactors such as Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) were procured from Sisco Research Laboratory chemicals. All set of experiments was performed using ultra pure MilliQ H 2 O (resistivity: 18.2  MΩ cm).

50|$|Liquids {{drawn up}} into a gas {{syringes}} can optionally be sparged with inert gas before dispensing into a reaction vessel such as a Schlenk flask. This is done by drawing the liquid into the syringe via a needle, inserting the needle into the septum sealing a flask under a positive pressure of an inert gas, removing the glass plunger, and allowing the gas to bubble through the liquid in the syringe for several minutes.

50|$|Cohobation has no {{corresponding}} {{process in}} modern chemistry, {{as it is}} not a useful process. Indeed, it is equivalent to performing the same distillation a number of times and does not increase the purity of the distillate or alter the residue any more than would be done by maintaining it at elevated temperature for the same period of time. The Dean-Stark trap does involve returning some distillate to the reaction flask: a solution is distilled and the condensed liquid is collected in a tube wherein water settles to the bottom and is drained out, while an organic solvent returns to the boiling solution. However, the process is not manual, most of the solvent does not leave the <b>reaction</b> <b>flask,</b> and the apparatus achieves a useful purpose (removing water from the reaction mixture). Circulation, on the other hand, is approximately the same as reflux, where a solution is maintained at its boiling point by condensing the distilling vapors and returning them directly to the reaction mixture.|$|E
40|$|A fully {{automated}} apparatus for the routine synthesis and formulation of short-lived 11 C (t 1 / 2 = 20 min) labelled radiopharmaceuticals for {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) has been developed.

The apparatus, MIASA (methyl iodide automated synthesis apparatus), was designed to operate as part of an automated labelling system in a shielded ‘hot’ laboratory. The apparatus was designed without the size constraints of typical instrumentation used in hot cells, although it is compact where necessary. Ample use of indicators and sensors, together with compact design of the <b>reaction</b> <b>flasks</b> for small dead space and efficient evaporation, led to good reliability and performance.

40|$|One of the {{original}} synthetic routes devised for the synthesis of U (III) N involved the entire reaction taking place in liquid ammonia. Several experimental reactions were conducted {{in an attempt to}} synthesize the UI 3 (NH 3) x and U(NH 2) 3 (NH 3) x precursors of U(III) N. Each attempt involved cleaning of the uranium metal to remove the oxide coating of the metal reagent with 3 washes of concentrated nitric acid, each followed by a rinse with liquid ammonia. Success of this cleaning procedure was varied, with a majority of cleaned metal oxidizing rapidly once in contact with the liquid ammonia, despite the precautions taken to eliminate oxygen contamination in the <b>reaction</b> <b>flasks.</b> Due to the continual presence of oxide coating of the uranium metal, it was decided to alter the proposed synthetic route to utilize the synthesis of the UI- 3 (THF) 4 precursor, as described in Inorganic Chemistry. This involves the purification of THF through distillation, cleaning of the metal uranium, and slow reaction of U and I 2. Equipment to perform this synthesis was not available for immediate use, but all necessary glassware was purchased. It was discovered that the uranium metal turnings being used for the synthesis had a possibility of containing niobium as well. Waste solutions were analyzed by ICP-AES, and no niobium was identified. Other reaction waste solutions were also analyzed {{in order to determine the}} reactivity of uranium in the liquid ammonia solution. These analyses determined that only a minimal amount of uranium became dissolved, indicating that either there was little reactivity in the liquid ammonia or the reaction was only taking place on the surface of the metal.
