5|$|Allen's men marched southward {{from the}} base, with the {{intention}} of entering the enemy base camp from a slightly different direction to the west. Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but {{by the time they were}} in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet. About 10–15 minutes later, the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and the <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> ammunition.|$|E

In the meantime, the relieving batteries on the Prussian side, which had arrived quite fresh from the rear, came into full play, as did also a reinforcement, on the French side, from the artillery of the Imperial Guard. The earth now trembled under the tremendous cannonade; and as the flames, issuing from the numerous burning houses, intermingled with dense volumes of smoke, shot directly upwards through the light grey mass which rendered visibility within village very difficult.|$|E

500|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{modification of the}} snake scale is the <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> rattlesnakes, {{such as those of}} the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus. The rattle is made up of a series of loosely linked, interlocking chambers that when shaken, vibrate against one another to create the warning signal of a rattlesnake. Only the bottom is firmly attached to the tip of the tail.|$|E
500|$|On stage, Mantle has {{appeared}} in plays such as Coming Clean, A Streetcar Named Desire, and Educating Rita, and has continued his successful stage career since departing from Holby City. [...] In 2003 he appeared in <b>Rattle</b> <b>of</b> a Simple Man; in 2006 he played the part of The Narrator in The Rocky Horror Show; and over the Christmas and New Year period of 2007–2008, he portrayed the villain Abanazer in a pantomime production of Aladdin at the Theatre Royal in Bath. In 2010 he portrayed comedian Tommy Cooper in the stage entertainment show Jus' Like That! A Night Out with Tommy Cooper; {{it was one of}} his most challenging roles, due to the various skills the performance required. More recently, Mantle has become known for his roles on television as Lord Greatjon Umber in HBO's Game of Thrones and as Tony Curry, Ollie's (Will Mellor's) father, in the BBC's White Van Man.|$|E
500|$|In 2008 Trygve Nordwall, {{the manager}} of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, invoked new EU rules forbidding more than 85 {{decibels}} in the workplace, as a reason for dropping the planned world premiere of Dror Feiler's composition Halat Hisar (State of Siege) because it was [...] "adverse to the health" [...] of the musicians. The twenty-minute composition [...] "starts with the <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> machine-gun fire and gets louder" [...] ("Das Stück beginnt mit Schüssen aus Maschinengewehren, die vom Band zugespielt werden, und das ist noch die leiseste Stelle.") Orchestra manager Trygve Nordwall reported that [...] "readings were taken during rehearsals and even when toned down, Halat Hisar measured about 130 decibels, equivalent to hearing a jet aircraft taking off", and one member of the orchestra reported suffering headaches and permanent tinnitis after sustained exposure for three hours during rehearsals ("Ein Orchestermusiker habe nach der Probe des Stückes drei Stunden lang permanente Ohrgeräusche (Tinnitus) gehabt"). Headphones for the musicians were suggested, but they objected they could not hear each other and the composer also rejected the idea, adding that his composition was [...] "no louder than anything by Shostakovich or Wagner".|$|E

500|$|Percussive {{effects in}} {{imitation}} of drumming had been introduced to bowed-string instruments by early in the 17th century. The earliest known use of col legno (tapping on the strings {{with the back of}} the bow) is found in Tobias Hume's First Part of Ayres for unaccompanied viola da gamba (1605), in a piece titled Harke, Harke. Carlo Farina, an Italian violinist active in Germany, also used col legno to mimic the sound of a drum in his Capriccio stravagante for four stringed instruments (1627), where he also used devices such as glissando, tremolo, pizzicato, and sul ponticello to imitate the noises of barnyard animals (cat, dog, chicken). Later in the century, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, in certain movements of Battalia (1673), added to these effects the device of placing a sheet of paper under the A string of the double bass, in order to imitate the dry <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> a snare drum, and in [...] "Die liederliche Gesellschaft von allerley Humor" [...] from the same programmatic battle piece, superimposed eight different melodies in different keys, producing in places dense orchestral clusters. He also uses the percussive snap of fortissimo pizzicato to represent gunshots.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Mantle played Maynard in Ben Bolt's TV movie, Second Nature, which starred Alec Baldwin in {{the leading}} role, and {{appeared}} in the first episode of the series Fortysomething. He portrayed Percy, described as a [...] "big, bashful Northern mill-worker who lives with his mum", in Patrick Sanford's stage production of <b>Rattle</b> <b>of</b> a Simple Man at the Clwyd Theatr Cymru in Mold, Flintshire. Gail Cooper of the Western Mail praised his performance and said: Mantle, better known as dishy and confident consultant Mike Barrett in Casualty, is cast completely against type as Percy, the 42-year-old virgin who admits to being only 35. His body language is superb: awkward, self-effacing, obsessively tidy – Coronation Street fans should think Roy Cropper {{if they want to}} imagine the sort of man Percy is. In 2003, Mantle began filming The Bingo Club, one of five specially commissioned one-hour plays which were screened in January 2004 on BBC1. Co-starring Paula Wilcox and John McArdle, The Bingo Tales relates the story of three women facing romantic hardship and growing old. During production, Mantle fell on his face while shooting a fencing scene and was rushed to Selly Oak Hospital with a ruptured ligament in his leg.|$|E
500|$|On 3 May Cunningham {{accounted}} for another Heinkel. Four nights later on 7 May 1941 Cunningham achieved a victory—his 12th—in front of King George VI. Sholto Douglas accompanied the King {{when he appeared}} at Danebury Hill, not far from Middle Wallop. The King met Cunningham and Rawnsley, [...] congratulated the airmen on their success and asked Cunningham to get another on that night. The King then was driven to the GCI station Sopley outside Bournemouth to tour the facility. Eager to impress the King, Cunningham drove to dispersal and prepared to go on patrol. The Luftwaffe began operations at 22:00 that night, attacking Liverpool which took their flight path over 604's patrol area. Cunningham took off and intercepted a He 111 north of Bournemouth. The controller asked the King to go outside as they may have the opportunity of witnessing the battle. Although they did not see it, the King heard the results; the roar of engines and <b>rattle</b> <b>of</b> cannon fire. The Heinkel, from 7./KG 27, Werknummer 1639 code IG+DR, eventually crashed near Andersea Farm south of RAF Weston Zoyland at 23:30. Pilot Oberfeldwebel Heinz Laschinski, Feldwebel Heinz Shier, Oberfeldwebel Otto Willrich all survived though the pilot was badly burned. Flight Engineer Feldwebel Fritz Klemm and Feldwebel Heinz Shier were killed by gunfire. On {{the night of the}} 31 May/1 June 1941 he {{accounted for}} another He 111 as the Luftwaffe completed its last major raid of the Blitz. It was one of 24 German bombers lost on that night. The following morning Cunningham was promoted to temporary squadron leader.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{initially}} operant {{behavior is}} emitted without an identified {{reference to a}} particular stimulus, during operant conditioning operants come {{under the control of}} stimuli that are present when behavior is reinforced.

That is, discriminative stimuli set the occasion for responses that produce reward or punishment.
