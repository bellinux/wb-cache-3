25|$|Also, as {{the heat}} pump takes heat {{out of the}} air, some {{moisture}} in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. The system must periodically melt this ice; this defrosting translates into an additional energy (electricity) expenditure. When it is extremely cold outside, it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source (such as an electric <b>resistance</b> <b>heater,</b> oil furnace, or gas furnace) rather than to run an air-source heat pump. Also, avoiding {{the use of the}} heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine's compressor.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} used to {{transfer}} heat because less high-grade energy is required than is released as heat. Most of the energy for heating comes from the external environment, {{only a fraction of}} which comes from electricity (or some other high-grade energy source required to run a compressor). In electrically-powered heat pumps, the heat transferred can be three or four times larger than the electrical power consumed, giving the system a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3 or 4, as opposed to a COP of 1 for a conventional electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>heater,</b> in which all heat is produced from input electrical energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrical}} contacts may control the power directly (as {{in a household}} iron) or indirectly, switching electrical power through a relay or the supply of natural gas or fuel oil through an electrically operated valve. In some natural gas heaters the power may be provided with a thermocouple that is heated by a pilot light (a small, continuously burning, flame). In devices without pilot lights for ignition (as in most modern gas clothes dryers and some natural gas heaters and decorative fireplaces) the power for the contacts is provided by reduced household electrical power that operates a relay controlling an electronic ignitor, either a <b>resistance</b> <b>heater</b> or an electrically powered spark generating device.|$|E
25|$|In heating mode, {{heat pumps}} are {{three to four}} times more {{effective}} at heating than simple electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>heaters</b> using the same amount of electricity. Typically installed cost for a heat pump is about 20 times greater than for <b>resistance</b> <b>heaters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Direct heat {{exchangers}} include those for gas-fired fuel-burning heaters or a refrigeration evaporator, placed {{directly in the}} air stream. Electric <b>resistance</b> <b>heaters</b> and heat pumps {{can be used as}} well. Evaporative cooling is possible in dry climates.|$|R
25|$|The {{operation}} of electric <b>resistance</b> <b>heaters</b> to heat an area {{for long periods}} is costly in many regions. However, intermittent or partial day use can be more cost efficient than whole building heating due to superior zonal control.|$|R
2500|$|When {{used for}} heating a {{building}} with an outside temperature of, for example, 10°C, a typical air-source heat pump (ASHP) has a COP of 3 to 4, whereas an electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>heater</b> has a COP of 1.0. That is, one joule of electrical energy {{will cause a}} <b>resistance</b> <b>heater</b> to produce only one joule of useful heat, while under ideal conditions, one joule of electrical energy can cause a heat pump to move three or four joules of heat from a cooler place to a warmer place. Note that an {{air source heat pump}} is more efficient in hotter climates than cooler ones, so when the weather is much warmer the unit will perform with a higher COP (as it has a smaller temperature gap to bridge). [...] When there is a wide temperature differential between the hot and cold reservoirs, the COP is lower (worse). In extreme cold weather the COP will go down to 1.0.|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} <b>resistance</b> <b>heater</b> has {{a thermal}} efficiency close to 100%. When comparing heating units, {{such as a}} highly efficient electric <b>resistance</b> <b>heater</b> to an 80% efficient natural gas-fueled furnace, an economic analysis {{is needed to determine}} the most cost-effective choice.|$|E

50|$|Storage heaters {{may also}} {{incorporate}} an electric <b>heater</b> (utilizing either <b>resistance</b> <b>heaters</b> or heat pumps), {{which can be}} used to increase heat output. Such added heating, if it is resistance heating, is expensive, as it occurs during the high-tariff time of day.|$|R
50|$|Some more {{expensive}} fixed window {{air conditioning units}} have a true heat pump function. However, a window unit may only have an electric <b>resistance</b> <b>heater.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{refrigeration}} cycle can be operated as a heat pump to move heat from outdoors into a warmer house. A heat pump {{with a higher}} SEER rating for cooling mode would also usually be more efficient in heating mode, rated using HSPF. When operated in heating mode, a heat pump is typically more efficient than an electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>heater.</b> This is because a space heater can convert only the input electrical energy directly to output heat energy, while a heat pump also transfers heat from outdoors. In heating mode, the coefficient of performance is the ratio of heat provided to the energy used by the unit. An ideal <b>resistance</b> <b>heater</b> converting 100% of its input electricity to output heat would have COP = 1, equivalent to a 3.4 EER. The heat pump becomes less efficient as the outside temperature decreases, and its performance may become comparable to a <b>resistance</b> <b>heater.</b> For a heat pump with the minimum 13 SEER cooling efficiency, this is typically below -10 F.|$|E
50|$|Heated {{glass is}} a <b>resistance</b> <b>heater</b> created when a transparent, {{electrically}} conductive coating {{is applied to}} float glass and then subjected to an electric current.

50|$|All {{electric}} <b>resistance</b> <b>heaters</b> are 100% efficient, with {{operating costs}} determined by their wattage {{and the length}} of operating time.

50|$|This is {{a popular}} {{arrangement}} where higher flow rates are required for limited periods, water is heated in a pressure vessel that can withstand a hydrostatic pressure close {{to that of the}} incoming mains supply.

40|$|Improved energy {{efficiency}} and greenhouse gas mitigation could be achieved by replacing <b>resistance</b> <b>heaters</b> with district heating system. In 2005, only about 8 % of the Swedish detached houses had district heating system. The expansion of such systems largely depends on homeowners' adoption decisions. And, to motivate homeowners to adopt district heating, {{it is essential to}} understand their decision-making process. In this context, in June 2005 we carried out a questionnaire survey of about 700 homeowners who lived in the city of Östersund in houses with <b>resistance</b> <b>heaters</b> (baseline survey). About 84 % of the respondents did not intend to install a new heating system. Since then these homeowners were influenced by (a) an investment subsidy by the Swedish government to replace <b>resistance</b> <b>heaters</b> with district heating, a brine/water-based heat pump, or a biomass-based heating system and (b) a marketing campaign by the municipality-owned district heating company. This paper analyses how these two measures influenced about 78 % of the homeowners to adopt the district heating system. For this purpose we carried out a follow-up survey of the same homeowners in December 2006 (resurvey). Results showed that the investment subsidy and the marketing campaign created a need among the homeowners to adopt a new heating system. The marketing campaign was successful in motivating them to adopt the district heating system. The marketing strategy by the district heating company corresponds to the results obtained in the baseline survey. Homeowner Perception District heating Marketing campaign Investment subsidy...|$|R

50|$|This {{implies that}} COPHP will {{be greater than}} one because COPR will be a {{positive}} quantity. In a worst-case scenario, the heat pump will supply {{as much energy as}} it consumes, making it act as a <b>resistance</b> <b>heater.</b> However, in reality, as in home heating, some of QH is lost to the outside air through piping, insulation, etc., thus making the COPHP drop below unity when the outside air temperature is too low. Therefore, the system used to heat houses uses fuel.|$|E

There are numerous heat pumps from the 1970s and 1980s in the United States that are still in service in 2012, even in places where winters are extremely cold. Few moving parts reduce maintenance requirements. However, the outdoor heat exchanger and fan must be kept free from leaves and debris. Heat pumps have more moving parts than an equivalent electric <b>resistance</b> <b>heater</b> or fuel burning heater.

50|$|Examples of {{physical}} deposition include:A thermal evaporator that uses an electric <b>resistance</b> <b>heater</b> to melt {{the material and}} raise its vapor pressure to a useful range. This is done in a high vacuum, both to allow the vapor to reach the substrate without reacting with or scattering against other gas-phase atoms in the chamber, and reduce the incorporation of impurities from the residual gas in the vacuum chamber. Obviously, only materials with a much higher vapor pressure than the heating element can be deposited without contamination of the film.

A single mounting connection at the potentiometer bushing not only mechanically mounts all of the elements but additionally provides a heat sink connection for the circuit. At the same time, the use of a printed circuit board in the combination permits automated assembly and soldering which substantially reduced the cost of the circuit.|$|E
