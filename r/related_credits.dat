[...] The largest of these by dollar volume is the federal foreign tax credit. [...] This credit is allowed to all taxpayers for income taxes paid to foreign countries. The credit is limited {{to that part of}} federal income tax before other credits generated by foreign source taxable income. The credit is intended to mitigate taxation of the same income to the same taxpayer by two or more countries, and has been a feature of the U.S. system since 1918. Other credits include credits for certain wage payments, credits for investments in certain types of assets including certain motor vehicles, credits for use of alternative fuels and off-highway vehicle use, natural resource <b>related</b> <b>credits,</b> and others.

40|$|Like many green {{building}} rating systems, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifies {{green building}}s as different grades {{according to the}} number of credit points the buildings have achieved. LEED project consultants often attempt to maximize the number of credit points to be achieved strategically with limited budgets and resources. For example, some green building technologies and features can be used to achieve multiple credits with little additional effort. Therefore, some applicants have studied the relationship and similarity in scope among the credits in green building rating systems, thereby finding ways to achieve multiple <b>related</b> <b>credits.</b> Some green building guides, such as the official LEED reference guide, also give suggestions on <b>related</b> <b>credits.</b> However, there has been a lack of study testing the strength of these suggestions. This paper aims to evaluate the strength of these suggested relationships by using data mining techniques. A database of certified green building projects was constructed based on the data from the USGBC website. The credits achieved by these projects were analyzed using association rule mining techniques. The strength of the suggested credit rules were identified according to the calculated outcomes. The results show that some suggested credit rules are related and commonly co-occur...|$|E

Of these, the Green Star-Office Interior rating tool is designed for building owners, tenants and interior designers to assess the environmental impact of an interior fitout. It covers a number of categories, including Management, Indoor Environment Quality, Energy, Transport, Water, Materials, Land Use and Ecology, Emissions, and Innovation. This paper reviews the usage of the Green Star system in Australian office tenancy fitouts and the potential challenges associated with Green Star-Office Interior implementation. This involves the analysis of score sheets of 66 office interior projects across Australia that achieved Green Star certification. The percentage of green star points obtained within each category and sub-categories (credits) for each project are investigated to illustrate the achievement of credits. The results show that Emission-related credits and Innovation <b>related</b> <b>credits</b> are the easiest and most difficult respectively to obtain. It is also found that 6 Green Star office interior projects perform especially better in the categories of Energy and Ecology than 4 and 5 Star projects.

40|$|The world’s first green {{building}} labeling system, the U. K. BREEAM, {{was announced in}} 1990. From 1990 to 2007, the development of global {{green building}} market was slow. One of the triggers {{of the formation of}} green market was the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, which was awarded to Al Gore and the IPCC scientists, in appreciation of their contribution to the debate on Global Warming. After 2007, the global green building market increased rapidly, and especially the globalization of the U. S. LEED system. China, as a developing country, announced the fist batch of certified green building, using the national GBL system in 2008. In 2010, the GBL system started to be promoted in Hong Kong. Under the free market system, the international (the U. S. LEED), national (China GBL) and local (Hong Kong BEAM) green building labeling systems are simultaneously used in Hong Kong. Thus, a green war among the three systems emerged. From the review of the green building development and market competitions, this research assumes that technical guideline is the core competitiveness of a green building labeling system, and the main research question is “What are the differentiations among the international, national and local green building labeling systems, and how to differentiate passive design strategies from the credits in the three systems for enhancing the architect’s responsibility in green building development?” To answer this question, three sub-questions are stated and the universalizing and individualizing comparative analysis methods are selected for this research. From the universalizing comparison, it compares the principles and framework among the three systems, and discovers that the fundamental framework of the three systems is the same. However, the assessment method, procedures, weighting of each aspect, and others is different due to the different targeting market of each system. From the individualizing comparison, it established a framework for a credit-by-credit comparison. It reveals that the transferability of credits among the three systems is low. Factors that lead to the low transferability are categorized and analyzed, and find that 1) the major reason of the low transferability is the inconsistent and imprecise establishment of the detailed requirements of credits in the GBL system; 2) the other reason is the lack of environmental and well being <b>related</b> <b>credits</b> in either LEED, GBL or BEAM system; and 3) local context is not a key difference among international, national and local systems. To further enhance the involvement of architects in green building developments, the design integration need to be emphasized in three different integration modes, 1) credits can be achieved by passive, active or both strategies, 2) credits can be achieved by several passive and active strategies, 3) credits with the same intent in a credit series. This can assist the design team to select the most appropriate strategy, to combine different strategies into a comprehensive design method, and to optimize design strategies for <b>related</b> <b>credits</b> with same intent. published_or_final_versionArchitectureDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the main}} aims of the green {{building}} movement has been a desire to create a healthy indoor environment for building occupants. In terms of improving or enhancing occupant well-being, a unique case emerges for healthcare facilities, whose main existence {{is based on the}} principles of improving the health of their patients. In the U. S., the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system has become the most widely recognized and used certification system for green buildings, including green hospital buildings. However, hospitals with high total scores may be green buildings but not necessarily the optimal green healthcare environment from a patient's wellbeing perspective. The goal {{of the study was to}} identify whether hospitals and healthcare facilities actually value the specific criteria that influence the health of patients and their recovery period. In-depth analysis of LEED healthcare specific credits revealed general tendencies and practices for green healthcare buildings. Based on a statistical analysis, the mean of percent healthcare specific scores were calculated as 48 % for those certified under LEED Healthcare, 62 % for hospitals certified under LEED New Construction v 3, and 52 % for hospitals certified under LEED New Construction v 2 rating systems. While hospitals included in the Healthcare category were initially expected to be the most successful ones in terms of achieving patient recovery and wellbeing <b>related</b> <b>credits,</b> they proved to earn the lowest percent of relevant points in this analysis. The result may be attributed to heightened restrictions and requirements of credits in the Healthcare scorecard, or hospitals may be valuing the level of certification more than those credits that were deemed relevant for patient wellbeing and rate of recovery, either due to lack of information or due to economic constraints. A high correlation coefficient was calculated among total scores and healthcare specific scores for the Healthcare dataset. On the other hand, correlation coefficients calculated for the other two datasets indicate a more random pattern among the two variables. For hospitals certified under the New Construction rating system, there seem to be weak support to claim that hospitals that receive high total scores and thus certification levels have high healthcare specific points as well...|$|E

40|$|Goal, Scope and Background. LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is a {{scoring system}} that evaluates the {{environmental}} friendliness of,buildings. It {{is composed of}} 69 credits, each one providing a score of one (i. e., one point) if implemented. However, since each credit does not always provide the same type and magnitude of benefits for the environment, a higher rating is not always synonymous with lower impacts. The goal {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the actual extent of the benefits and burdens of LEED, identify the critical credits and develop a new scale that will correct these miscorrelations. Methods. The various LEED credits are qualitatively analysed. It is possible to quantify the actual outcomes and thus perform a lifecycle assessment (LCA) on 45 credits applied to an actual California office building. This allows comparing the benefits of the different credits among each other. Commuting of the employees is included in the system. The LCA is performed with the help of SimaPro 7, combining the ecoinvent 1. 2 inventory database and the impact assessment methodology IMPACT 2002 + v 2. 1, adapted to North America. Impacts are evaluated for human health, ecosystems quality, climate change, and resource consumption. Impacts of the different credits are aggregated in one indicator to allow the design of a new scoring system that assigns to the different credits an amount of points (i. e., a score) that are related to the actual benefits. A school and a residential building are also modeled in order to perform a sensitivity study. Results and Discussion. Operation, especially employee commuting and electricity consumption, dominates the impacts associated with the building. It appears that waste generation have limited but not negligible impacts, whereas water consumption has small impacts. Since the building is situated in California, heating is not an important source of impacts. As a result, credits that provide the most environmental benefits are the ones geared toward increasing the fraction of green electricity, reducing energy consumption, reducing employee commuting, and increasing waste recycling, along with the ones favoring the reuse and recycling of the building structure. The ones targeting reduction of water and land use, and recycling content in the furniture appear to be less beneficial. The scores of the different LEED credits range from - 128 to 606. Negative credits are due to credits that lead to more burdens than benefits, for example, the one requiring the construction of a multifloor parking lot (with a score of - 128). The most beneficial credit (with a score of 606) is the one requiring that electricity comes from at least 50 % green power. Conclusions and Outlook. Comparing the new scale with the observations on site shows that the LEED credits actually implemented are not always the most beneficial for the environment. This issue should be addressed in order to make LEED more efficient. The proposed rating system should help correct these discrepancies. The amount of reduction in employee commuting that the <b>related</b> <b>credits</b> really achieve, actual impacts of land and water use, along with the benefits of improved indoor air quality are among the main future challenges of the present study...|$|E

Also we find that as stock prices increase, both bank capital and bank borrowing capacity increase that in turn decreases credit risk. Furthermore as banking sector liquidity increases banks tend to lend to less credit-worthy (subprime) borrowers that in turn increases credit risk in the banking sector.

It is argued that the lack of counterbalances and the excessive control rights in the hands of few large shareholders produce a rent extraction problem. Hence those stakeholders that potentially experience opportunistic behavior are reluctant to establish long-term relationships, with the corresponding negative consequences on the productivity of the firm.
