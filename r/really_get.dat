5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E
25|$|Southport grew {{quickly in}} the 19th century as it gained a {{reputation}} for being a more refined seaside resort than its neighbour-up-the-coast Blackpool. In fact Southport had a head start compared to all the other places on the Lancashire coast because it had easy access to the canal system. Other seaside bathing areas couldn't <b>really</b> <b>get</b> going until the railways were built some years later. The Leeds and Liverpool canal brought people from Liverpool, Manchester, Bolton and Wigan amongst others. By 1820 Southport had over 20,000 visitors per year.|$|E
25|$|Grüner Veltliner {{has been}} {{believed}} to {{date back to}} Roman times, with its name being derived from Veltlin (Valtellina) in northern Italy, though ampelographers and wine historians {{have yet to find}} a link between the grape and the Italian commune. The grape is likely indigenous to Austria. The current name appeared in a document {{for the first time in}} 1855; before that time it was known as Weißgipfler. Only by the 1930s was Grüner Veltliner established as the standard name of the grape. Until the Second World War it was regarded as just another Austrian grape. It took Lenz Moser's Hochkultur system of vine training to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> the best out of it, and it expanded quickly in plantation from the 1950s to later become Austria's most planted variety.|$|E

25|$|The USA faced Hungary in the quarterfinals. The USA {{started out}} slowly, {{with only a}} three-point lead on {{occasion}} in the first quarter. Wiese came in off the bench and hit a pair of three-pointers to help spark the US team, but they were only up by five {{at the end of}} the first quarter. The lead extended to double digits by the first half but the US a team <b>really</b> <b>get</b> going in the third quarter with both offense and defense. Hungary would only score 7 points in the third quarter, while the USA scored 16 consecutive points in five minutes. Jones was the leading scorer with 15 points, one of four USA players with double digit points. The team held Hungary to 27% field-goal shooting for the game. USA team won the game 84–43 to advance to the semifinal.|$|E
25|$|The team then {{posted a}} 10–6 record in 1994 after {{starting}} {{the regular season}} at 3–6, but were eliminated by the Cleveland Browns in their first playoff game. The Krafts had also eliminated the practice of TV blackouts (and courted and nailed deals with local affiliates), and the season resulted in a resurge {{of interest in the}} NFL game across the region. Nonetheless, New England then seemed to return to form and failed to make the playoffs in 1995, a year when many organizations were coming to grips with the new salary cap put in by the NFL to improve competition in the league. In the offseason, Parcells hired his old Giants defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick, in January 1996 as assistant head coach and receivers position coach. Part of the team's spotty performance might have been that the new coach and the new owner did not <b>really</b> <b>get</b> along well, and Belichick came to serve during the 1996 season as the head coach's interface with the Kraft family and the non-football operations side of the business.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

500|$|Alan Landsburg {{bought the}} rights to produce the film. He {{attempted}} to involve experimental filmmaker Murray Lerner in Jaws 3, telling him that people at the Marineland theme park in Florida had seen his 1978 3D film Sea Dream. Lerner said that his [...] "heart sank" [...] when he was sent the first script of Jaws 3-D, saying [...] "I can't <b>really</b> <b>get</b> involved in this". As the production already had an art director, Lerner, who didn't like the script, declined {{to be involved in}} the film.|$|E
500|$|Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict looked unfavorably on the episode, {{writing that}} it [...] "has a premise—Bart builds a soapbox racer—that frankly has very limited modern day appeal. We can't <b>really</b> <b>get</b> {{into the whole}} Martin/Nelson/Bart race dynamic and today, soapbox derby has been technologized all out of {{proportion}} to the point where very few, if any, practice it. With such a narrow target, many of the jokes just don't work." [...] Gibron preferred the subplot of Homer's attempts to become a better father.|$|E

500|$|... "The series, especially, {{has shown}} that it’s willing to stretch some of these {{emotional}} or philosophical moments out, to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> {{the most out of}} the actors’ performances and give them scenes where they can expand their characters beyond what’s on the page. In a finale that could have felt too scattered—we drop in on every major character of the season who’s still alive—that sense that cooler heads would rather prevent greater war but were thwarted by hotter, younger heads was what united the story".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rob LeDonne, Philip Lawrence from The Smeezingtons explained {{the inspiration for the}} song: [...] "Well, the thing we learned after touring with Doo Wops was how it is we like to feel on stage when performing. We’re fun, like to dance and party, and we didn't <b>really</b> <b>get</b> {{to do a lot of}} that on the first album. Even going to festivals and seeing big bands live, like Coldplay or Bruce Springsteen, we knew the second time around we wanted something fun. It’s the kind of song where the whole band can get up and jam and have this Earth, Wind and Fire kind of moment".|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers criticized Lone Survivor for {{focusing}} more on its action scenes than on characterization. In {{his review}} for The Star-Ledger, Stephen Whitty wrote, [...] "This {{is the sort}} of bare-bones story that well served plenty of World War II movies once, and it would work here, if Berg had the sense to develop these men as characters, first. But we don't <b>really</b> <b>get</b> to know any of them, or what they might bring personally to this life-or-death emergency." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, [...] "The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with telling us who these fallen heroes really were." ...|$|E

He {{appreciated}} the shows on {{the first leg of}} the tour, where they played the entire 20-song The River album in sequence, because [...] "when you play something night after night you <b>really</b> <b>get</b> to dig into the material, just as an instrumentalist." [...] He attributed his ability to keep playing during some of the longest shows in E Street Band history to his keeping in top physical condition, including exercise by swimming, and to his love of playing with Springsteen.|$|E
500|$|The episode, and {{the season}} itself has {{introduced}} Amanda Tapping as Samantha Carter {{for her first}} of 14 episode appearance, after finishing her appearances on all ten seasons of the sister series, Stargate SG-1. Carter would replace Elizabeth Weir {{as the leader of}} the Atlantis Expedition after the episode. However, Carter would only have a supporting role as opposed to a lead role on SG-1. The episode would also give the audience [...] "an opportunity to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> to know Dr. Jennifer Keller" [...] (Staite). Gero was reluctant to accept an updated opening title sequence, which mentioned the departure of Weir and the introduction of Carter, which would give the casual viewers a tip.|$|E
500|$|In late 1891 Edward's eldest son, Albert Victor, {{was engaged}} to Princess Victoria Mary of Teck. Just a few weeks later, in early 1892, Albert Victor died of pneumonia.

[...] He also praised the sympathetic portrayal of Cid Aulstyne, and stated that the game had [...] "so many great moments, [...] have to experience each little detail for [...] Heath Hindman, writing for PlayStation Lifestyle, called the characters [...] "pretty strong overall", although she cited some scenes where various characters' inclusion felt like a necessity rather than a useful element to be a fault.|$|E
500|$|Labyrinth {{was being}} seriously {{discussed}} {{as early as}} March 1983, when Henson held a meeting with Froud and children's author Dennis Lee. Lee was tasked with writing a novella on which a script could be based, submitting {{it at the end}} of 1983. Henson approached Terry Jones to write the film's script as [...] "his daughter Lisa had just read Erik the Viking and suggested that he try me as screen-writer." [...] Jones was given Dennis Lee's novella to use as a basis for his script, but later told Empire that Lee had produced an unfinished [...] "poetic novella" [...] that he [...] "didn't <b>really</b> <b>get</b> on with." [...] In light of this, Jones [...] "discarded it and sat down with Brian 's drawings and sifted through them and found the ones that I really liked, and started creating the story from them." ...|$|E
500|$|Later, CBS {{approached}} [...] writer Peter M. Lenkov {{to pitch}} a reimagined pilot of the show, as Lenkov {{himself was a}} fan of the original.

[...] All three developed the story of the pilot, though Lenkov was the one who wrote the script. On February 19, 2010, CBS ordered the production of the pilot, with Len Wiseman chosen to direct.
