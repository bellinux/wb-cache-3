40|$|This study {{reports the}} effects of <b>rebate</b> rules on {{voluntary}} contributions to a threshold public good. <b>Rebate</b> rules specify how excess contributions, over the threshold amount are distributed. We examine three <b>rebate</b> rules experimentally: a no <b>rebate</b> policy where excess contributions are discarded, a proportional <b>rebate</b> policy where excess contributions are <b>rebated</b> proportionally to an individual 2 ̆ 7 s contribution, and a utilization <b>rebate</b> policy where excess contributions provide some continuous public good. Significantly more Nash equilibrium outcomes are observed under the no <b>rebate</b> treatment than under either of the other two.

40|$|To contain {{expenditures}} {{in an increasingly}} demand driven health care system, in 2005 a no-claim <b>rebate</b> {{was introduced in the}} Dutch health insurance system. Since demand-side cost sharing is a very controversial issue, the no-claim <b>rebate</b> was launched as a consumer friendly bonus system to reward prudent utilization of health services. Internationally, the introduction of a mandatory no-claim <b>rebate</b> in a social health insurance scheme is unprecedented. Consumers were entitled to an annual <b>rebate</b> of 255 eruos if no claims were made. During the year, all health care expenses except for GP visits and maternity care were deducted from the <b>rebate</b> until the <b>rebate</b> became zero. In this article, we discuss the rationale of the no-claim <b>rebate</b> and the available evidence of its effect. Using a questionnaire in a convenience sample, we examined people's knowledge, attitudes, and sensitivity to the incentive scheme. We find that only 4 % of respondents stated that they would reduce consumption because of the no-claim <b>rebate.</b> Respondents also indicated that they were willing to accept a high loss of <b>rebate</b> in order to use a medical treatment. However, during the last month of the year many respondents seemed willing to postpone consumption until the next year {{in order to keep the}} <b>rebate</b> of the current year intact. A small majority of respondents considered the no-claim <b>rebate</b> to be unfair. Finally, we briefly discuss why in 2008 the no-claim <b>rebate</b> was replaced by a mandatory deductible...|$|R

40|$|Is a tax <b>rebate</b> {{safe and}} effective? Simulations with an empirically-tested macro-econometric model {{are used to}} {{estimate}} {{the impact of the}} actual 2001 tax <b>rebate</b> in the U. S. and of a <b>rebate</b> twice as large repeated in three additional quarters, and the results of the simulations are interpreted in light of two important recent empirical studies of the spending of the 2001 <b>rebate</b> by households. Our simulations show that as long as a tax <b>rebate</b> is temporary and detriggered when the recession ends, its use during a recession does not pose a significant debt or inflation problem. We find {{that at the end of}} one year the larger repeated <b>rebate</b> would have reduced the unemployment rate from 5. 9 % to at least 5. 2 %. Thus, a triggered tax <b>rebate</b> is a safe and effective anti-recession policy. 1 In June 2001 President Bush signed into law a tax cut containing a tax <b>rebate</b> of $ 600 per married couple ($ 300 per single person).

Continuing to apply {{his work ethic}} and efficiency, Rockefeller quickly expanded the company {{to be the most}} profitable refiner in Ohio. Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers. The cartel offered preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but <b>rebates</b> for the shipment of competing products.|$|E

During and after World War I, Landis presided over several high-profile trials of draft resisters and others whom he saw as opposing the war effort. He imposed heavy sentences on those who were convicted; some of the convictions were reversed on appeal, and other sentences were commuted.|$|E

5|$|With {{investment}} subsidies, {{the financial}} burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out {{as a function of}} the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer <b>rebates</b> to their customers, such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.|$|E
5|$|A similar issue again {{arose in}} 2009 when Burger King {{diverted}} {{several million dollars}} of advertising <b>rebates</b> paid to its American franchises by Coca Cola Corporation and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group to its own coffers. The company intended to utilize these funds to increase its advertising presence in the United States {{at a time when}} corporate advertising costs were falling, which would allow an increased media presence of approximately 25% from the previous year (2008). The NFA contended that Burger King Corporation improperly redirected 40% of restaurant operating funds (ROF) paid by the two beverage suppliers to franchises since 1990 into the corporate advertising budget. These funds were often used by the franchises to pay for beverage support systems such as filtration units and local marketing, and diversion of the funds would cost franchises at least $65 million (USD) between 2010-2012. These funds often helped the franchises' bottom lines, as they were often used to offset other costs imposed on the franchises by Burger King, such as the $1 (USD) Double Cheeseburger.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation <b>rebates.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{flexibility}} of the new broilers, the new equipment has several features intended to decrease operational costs. A more efficient design of the burners in the Nieco units produces a 30 percent reduction in energy consumption. The Duke units produce a $4,000 -$5,000 annual savings on energy compared to the original units, which ran approximately at full capacity all day. The units are so fuel-efficient that in many US states, the company and its franchises qualify for energy-efficiency <b>rebates.</b> However, and issue arose in September 2011 when the state of Washington department of health warned Burger King of issues with the Duke units. In multiple incidents in seven counties throughout the state, the Duke units were found to have cracked heat spreaders which resulted in under cooked products. Additionally, there was foreign material contamination caused by loose insulation resulting from the cracks as well as other issues. Upon notification, Burger King released a statement that the company has notified franchisees and corporate-owned stores operating the Duke units with orders to repair the problem immediately. Additional training for operators was also ordered.|$|E

Campbell Soup Company released six holographic miniature posters on the same number of SpaghettiOs cans; the posters were awarded in Converting in 1997. General Mills outfitted boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch with offers for T-shirts and other items. Over five thousand Pizza Hut restaurants held a two-month-long give-away of figurines with meals during the show's launch.
