In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the <b>recommended</b> <b>doses</b> of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{the effect}} of {{diniconazole}} {{which is used to}} control of rose rust (Phragmidium mucronatum) was investigated by reducing the application number and lowering the dose by addition of a spreader-sticker (Citowett).

25|$|Paracetamol, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} or APAP, is a medication used to treat pain and fever. It is typically used for mild to moderate pain. In combination with opioid pain medication, paracetamol is used for more severe pain such as cancer pain and after surgery. It is typically used either by mouth or rectally but is also available intravenously. Effects last between two and four hours. Paracetamol is classified as a mild analgesic.

25|$|From a dietary perspective, plant cells do not {{manufacture}} cholesterol, {{and it is}} {{not found}} in plant foods. Some plant foods, such as avocado, flax seeds and peanuts, contain phytosterols, which compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestines, reducing the absorption of both dietary and bile cholesterol. However, a typical diet contributes on the order of 0.2 grams of phytosterols, which is not enough to {{have a significant impact on}} blocking cholesterol absorption. Phytosterols intake can be supplemented through the use of phytosterol-containing functional foods or dietary supplements that are recognized as having potential to reduce levels of LDL-cholesterol. Some supplemental guidelines have <b>recommended</b> <b>doses</b> of phytosterols in the 1.6–3.0grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III, FDA).

25|$|The {{product is}} {{available}} in Africa under the name Green Muscle and in Australia as Green Guard. It is applied {{in the same way}} as chemical insecticides, but does not kill as quickly. At <b>recommended</b> <b>doses,</b> the fungus can take up two weeks to kill up to 90% of the locusts. For that reason, it is recommended for use mainly against hoppers, the wingless early stages of locusts. These are mostly found in the desert, far from cropping areas, where the delay in death does not result in damage. The advantage of the product is that it affects only grasshoppers and locusts, which makes it much safer than chemical insecticides. Specifically, it allows the natural enemies of locusts and grasshoppers to continue their beneficial work. These include birds, parasitoid and predatory wasps, parasitoid flies and certain species of beetles. Though natural enemies cannot prevent plagues, they can limit the frequency of outbreaks and contribute to their control. Biopesticides are also safer to use in environmentally sensitive areas such as national parks or near rivers and other water bodies.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{colistin}} {{was introduced}} into clinical practice over 50 years ago, {{it was never}} subject to the regulations that modern drugs are subject to, and therefore there is no standardised dosing of colistin and no detailed trials on pharmacology or pharmacokinetics: The optimal dosing of colistin for most infections is therefore unknown.
