The thesis discusses {{the marketing of}} residential <b>real</b> <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> the municipality of Gorizia and municipality of Nova Gorica in the time period from January 2013 to February 2013.

Based on this we think that it is worth to take advantage of the opportunity and buy a residential property located in the municipality of Gorizia. For potential customers in the municipality of Nova Gorica two and three-room apartments of higher quality class in the suburb of Gorizia, with a price between 900 EUR and 1. 200 EUR per square meter would be particularly interesting. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation Thesis {{describes}} general <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> characteristics <b>in</b> city Ljubljana, <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> valuation <b>in</b> Slovenia, {{and comparison}} with German <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> legislation. On {{the basis of}} obtained data from the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market record <b>in</b> the City Municipality of Ljubljana in year 2011, the value zones based on practice of German city Bonn were established. Presented value zones are suitable for the single <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> valuation of {{the market value of}} residential <b>real</b> <b>estates</b> based on direct sales comparison approach.
