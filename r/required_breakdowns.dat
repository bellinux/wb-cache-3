The most effective attractants, i. e., those that have thresholds near 10 − 5 M or below, are N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, 6 -deoxy-d-glucose, d-fructose, d-fucose, 1 -d-glycerol-β-d-galactoside, galactitol, d-galactose, d-glucosamine, d-glucose, α-d-glucose- 1 -phosphate, lactose, maltose, d-mannitol, d-mannose, methyl-β-d-galactoside, methyl-β-d-glucoside, d-ribose, d-sorbitol, and trehalose.

Nine different chemoreceptors are involved in detecting these various attractants.

40|$|We {{show that}} Weyl-invariant dilaton gravity {{provides}} {{a description of}} black holes without classical space-time singularities. Singularities appear due to ill-behavior of gauge fixing conditions, one example being the gauge in which theory is classically equivalent to standard General Relativity. The main conclusions of our analysis are: (1) singularities signal a phase transition from broken to unbroken phase of Weyl symmetry, (2) instead of a singularity there is a “baby-universe ” inside a black hole, (3) there is a critical mass after which reducing mass makes black hole larger as viewed by outside observers, (4) if a black hole could be connected with white hole through the “singularity”, this would <b>require</b> <b>breakdown</b> of (classical) geometric description. The singularity of Schwarzschild BH solution is non-generic and so it it dangerous to rely on it in deriving general results. Our results may have important consequences for resolving issues related to information-loss puzzle. The theory we use is basically a completion of General Relativity, con-taining neither additional physical excitations nor higher-derivative terms, but requires physical scalar field such as Higgs field of Standard Model.

The translation factors, elongation factor G and ribosome recycling factor, {{are known to be}} required for recycling, but there is controversy concerning whether these factors act primarily to effect the release of mRNA and tRNA from the ribosome, with the splitting of the ribosome into subunits being somewhat dispensable, or whether their main function is to catalyze the splitting reaction, which necessarily precedes mRNA and tRNA release. Here, we utilize three assays directly measuring the rates of mRNA and tRNA release and of ribosome splitting in several model PoTCs. Our results largely reconcile these previously held views. We demonstrate that, {{in the absence of an}} upstream Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, PoTC breakdown proceeds in the order: mRNA release followed by tRNA release and then by 70 S splitting. By contrast, in the presence of an SD sequence all three processes proceed with identical apparent rates, with the splitting step likely being rate-determining. Our results are consistent with ribosome profiling results demonstrating the influence of upstream SD-like sequences on ribosome occupancy at or just before the mRNA stop codon...|$|R

This metabolic process is initiated by lipases (EC: 3. 1. 1. 3), which catalyze the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) to release free fatty acids and glycerol. A number of lipases have been purified to near homogeneity from seed tissues and analysed for their in vitro activities. Furthermore, several genes encoding lipases have been cloned and characterised from plants. However, only recently has data been presented to establish the molecular identity of a lipase that has been shown to be <b>required</b> for TAG <b>breakdown</b> in seeds.

30|$|The {{mechanisms}} for breakdown in gas discharges {{have been studied}} extensively {{for over a century}} [1]. It is well known that the voltage <b>required</b> to initiate <b>breakdown</b> of a gaseous DC discharge depends strongly on the pressure P multiplied by the distance D of the gap between the electrodes, PD, as described by Paschen's Law [2]. For a gas at atmospheric pressure, by limiting the inter-electrode separation to a distance of less than a millimeter, it is possible to produce a stable ‘normal-glow’ microdischarge [3]. Although such a microdischarge is spatially confined compared to a traditional low-pressure discharge, the normal glow properties of a nonthermal discharge still apply, such as an electron temperature, Te, which is several orders of magnitude larger than the gas temperature, Tg [3 - 5]. Many applications have been explored to exploit this excess electron energy and drive optical or chemical processes such as vacuum-ultraviolet light sources [6], biomedical systems [7, 8], nanoparticle synthesis [9, 10], and plasma ignition [11]. However in atmospheric air, even with a small inter-electrode separation of less than 1  mm, a sizeable voltage (upwards of 4 to 5  kV) may still be <b>required</b> to initiate <b>breakdown.</b>|$|R
