The changes in Stracchino cheese quality are mainly attributable to microbial spoilage and structure breakdown because of enzymatic activity. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of different packaging materials on the shelf life of Stracchino cheese, monitoring changes in rheological, microbiological and sensorial properties over 28 days at 4 C. Three packaging materials were compared in order to optimize the suitable packaging for Stracchino cheese: (1) paper-polyethylene as a reference package commonly used for this product [R]; (2) commercial high-density polyethylene (HDPE) -based film, mainly composed of calcium carbonate and HDPE (Ovtene® [OV]); and (3) experimental active packaging obtained with addition of potassium sorbate to OV (active Ovtene® [AOV]). The OV and AOV resulted more effective to control microbial spoilage than R, without affecting sensorial and chemical properties. AOV allowed the inhibition of yeast growth, probably because of the activity of potassium sorbate. The gel structure, which characterizes the Stracchino cheese, was maintained until 21 days with the application of AOV, while a liquid-like behavior was associated to the sample packed with the reference material after 14 days.

40|$|International audienceCarnobacterium maltaromaticum strains {{are widely}} found in food {{including}} fish, meat and some dairy products. Producing a malty/chocolate like aroma due to 3 -methylbutanal from the catabolism of leucine {{is a general}} characteristic of this species. In this study, we investigated metabolic routes responsible for the biosynthesis of this flavor compound from the catabolism of leucine in C. maltaromaticum LMA 28, a strain isolated from mold <b>ripened</b> <b>soft</b> <b>cheese.</b> Depending on the lactic acid bacterium, leucine can be converted into 3 -methylbutanal following two possible metabolic pathways: either directly by alpha-ketoacid decarboxylase (KADC) pathway or indirectly by alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (KADH) pathway. Both KADC (41. 0 +/- 3. 0 nmol/mg protein/min) and KADH (1. 43 +/- 0. 62 nmol/mg protein/min) activities were detected and determined in vitro in C. maltaromaticum LMA 28. C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 slightly reduced the production of 3 -methylbutanal from leucine {{in the presence of}} a specific inhibitor of KADH enzyme complex, i. e. sodium meta-arsenite, suggesting that both pathways were involved in vivo in leucine catabolism. Moreover the presence of genes encoding aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoacid decarboxylase, alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase was confirmed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{present study}} {{examined}} the influence of eight selected strains of Penicillium nalgiovense as secondary culture on the <b>ripening</b> of <b>soft</b> mould <b>cheese.</b> Ion-exchange chromatography, SDS-PAGE and sensory analysis were used for comparison of P. nalgiovense with common secondary mould culture (Penicillium camemberti). RESULTS: Proteolytic activity was more intensive {{in the case of}} the strains of P. nalgiovense in comparison with the control strains of P. camemberti. Some differences in the proportion and amount of free amino acids were observed between the strains of P. nalgiovense during ripening. Lower proteolytic activity of P. nalgiovense was more desirable for sensory properties of cheese, especially in case sample N 2. CONCLUSION: This study provides information on the usability of selected strains of P. nalgiovense that could support the development of sensory properties of mould-ripened <b>soft</b> <b>cheese.</b> The cheese with the culture N 2 had the best flavour after 35 days of storage. Moreover, this strain showed the lowest bitterness in comparison with the other used P. nalgiovense cultures.

Moreover, in the UF-cheeses investigated in this study, which were produced using Penicillium camemberti as the surface flora, several surface defects were observed: the texture was ‘carton’ like and the rind frequently detached from the cheese. To gain a fuller understanding {{of the development of}} these surface defects in UF-cheeses, the migration of different minerals and ions, and the study of the rind microstructure by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray mapping were performed. The results suggest that the slower diffusion of lactate, possibly due to the mineral layer at the surface of cheeses, acting as a barrier to its diffusion, may have caused an alteration in the metabolism and growth of the surface mould andmay explain the surface defects of these UF-cheeses...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of French fungus-ripened cheeses is due partly to {{the succession of}} fungi that colonize the cheese during ripening.

Its lipases and proteases promote flavor development, and its aminopeptidases reduce bitterness imparted by low-molecular-weight peptides in cheese. We assessed the genetic {{diversity of}} G. candidum strains by using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) -PCR correlated with phenotypic tests for carbon assimilation and salt tolerance. Strains were isolated from milk, curd, and cheese collected in seven major cheesemaking regions of France. Sixty-four isolates were characterized.

All of the strains from the Haute-Savoie were able to assimilate lactate as the sole source of carbon, while lactate assimilation varied among strains from the Auvergne. Strains varied in d-mannitol assimilation, and none used citrate as the sole source of carbon. Yeast-like colony morphology predominated in Reblochon, while all of the strains isolated from St. Nectaire were filamentous.

In TSB-YE supplemented with lactose, glucose, or galactose, lactose and glucose were metabolized {{with a maximum}} growth rate of 0. 32 h– 1 and galactose was not metabolized. During hydrolysis of lactose, the galactose moiety was not excreted. The major product was L(+) lactic acid, with {{no significant difference in}} the lactic acid yield. Glucose was not completely metabolized because cell growth stopped when pH values reached an average of 5. 0. In sterilized UHT milk, the addition of 1 g/L of YE enhanced its coagulation. Compared with commercial starter lactic acid bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis DSMZ 20481 or Streptococcus thermophilus INRA 302, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum LMA 28 was shown to be a slow acidifying strain. However, in spite of this weak acidifying ability, C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 can sustain low pH values in coculture with Lc. lactis DSMZ 20481 or S. thermophilus INRA 302. The individual and interactive effects of initial pH values (5. 2 to 8. 0) and incubation temperatures (23 to 37 °C) on acidifying activity were studied by response surface methodology. The 3 strains displayed different behaviors depending on pH and temperature.

The objective of this work was to assess the effect of the freezing process prior to <b>ripening</b> of low-fat <b>soft</b> <b>cheese</b> containing microparticulated whey proteins as fat replacer. The freezing process consisted of freezing at − 25  °C, frozen storage at − 25  °C during 33  days, and thawing at 6  °C. Refrigerated cheeses, stored at 6  °C, were selected as control samples. High-performance liquid chromatography was used for analyzing the evolution of peptides present in the water-soluble fraction at pH 4. 6 at different ripening times. Principal component analysis was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data obtained from chromatograms. Results indicated that peptide profile was affected by the freezing process. Areas of peaks with hydrophilic characteristics increased during the ripening time, from 1 to 48  days, in both refrigerated and frozen cheeses. Furthermore, areas of hydrophilic peaks were higher in frozen cheeses than in refrigerated cheeses at 21 and 48  days of maturation. However, areas of peaks with hydrophobic characteristics increased in refrigerated cheeses but stayed invariable in frozen cheeses during all the studied ripening periods. In this case, areas of hydrophobic peaks were lower in frozen cheeses than in refrigerated cheeses at the same day of ripening time...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCheeses harbor {{a complex}} microbiota, usually a {{succession}} of different microorganisms during milk coagulation and ripening. Surface-ripened cheeses are characterized by a ripening from the cheese surface to the interior due to the activity of both yeasts and bacteria. Many such cheeses are produced {{all over the world}} with Europe as a leader: Taleggio in Italy; Munster, Epoisses, Livarot in France; Limburger, Tilsit in Germany; Herve in Belgium [1]. The cheese microflora contributes to a large extent {{to the development of the}} typical flavor, texture, and color of the final product. Color is one of the major attributes which affects the consumer perception of quality. Pigments generated by the smear bacteria at the surface of cheeses were poorly studied, exception made for those of the bacteria Brevibacterium linens (aromatic carotenoids, isorenieratene and hydroxyl derivatives). Indeed, for a long time this bacterium has been considered the single source of the color of red-smear <b>ripened</b> <b>soft</b> <b>cheeses.</b> High-throughput sequencing revolutionized the field of microbial ecology, allowing for a more accurate identification of microbial taxa, including those which are difficult to culture and/or are present in low abundance, now revealing the highly diverse bacterial populations of cheese rinds, i. e. with up to 19 bacterial genera described in some cheeses. Arthrobacter bacteria have been isolated on surface-ripened cheeses and their pigments were found in cheese rinds [1]. The genus Arthrobacter is very complex in Nature with 80 species isolated from various environments and listed in the taxonomy, producing a great variety of pigments: orange and yellow (carotenoids –pioneering works in the early seventies [2]), blue and green (indigoidine, indochrome), red (porphyrins, carotenoids). The present study focuses on the chemical characterization of pigments biosynthesized by the cheese-ripening bacteria Arthrobacter arilaitensis. Lyophilized biomass was extracted with 3 x MeOH and 2 x MTBE, with sonication and centrifugation at each step. Samples were analyzed using the same solvent system (Solvent A: MeOH; Solvent B: MTBE) with the gradient conditions described in [1]. A fused core column Ascentis Express Supelco C 18, (150 x 4. 6 mm, particle size 2. 7 m) and a Shimadzu Nexera HPLC-PDA-IT TOF system were used for the HPLC analyses. The UV-vis carotenoid profiles were similar for both strains investigated. Considering the UV-vis spectra (including fine structure), the APCI (-) and (+) mass spectra, and the elution order, 8 different carotenoids were tentatively identified. Four of them (sarcinaxanthin mono-glucoside pentaacetate, decaprenoxanthin di-glucoside, decaprenoxanthin mono-glucoside and decaprenoxanthin-C 16 : 0) are possibly present in very low amount, and were only detected in the APCI (-) ionization mode. The other four free main carotenoids, decaprenoxanthin, sarcinaxanthin, 9 -Z- decaprenoxanthin and 15 -Z- decaprenoxanthin have quite clearly been characterized by both their UV-vis spectra and MS spectra in APCI (-) and (+) ionization mode. Arthrobacter arilaitensis species does indeed produce C 50 carotenoids, and in particular, it mainly produces free all-E- decaprenoxanthin, and in minor amount two of its cis isomers, the 9 -Z- decaprenoxanthin and 15 -Z- decaprenoxanthin. This is in complete accordance with genomic data published about A. arilaitensis (whole genome sequencing [3]) and its Idi, CrtE, CrtB, CrtI, CrtEb, CrtYe and CrtYf carotenogenesis cluster, similar to the cluster of the decaprenoxanthin producing Corynebacterium glutamicum.

We used Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RAPD-PCR) to differentiate the isolates of G. candidum to the strain level. The genetic diversity study was correlated with phenotypic tests for carbon assimilation, salt tolerance, and aminopeptidase activity. We found high genetic diversity of G. candidum even within the same cheese-making regions. Strains did not group according to region. Aminopeptidase tests showed diversity between cheese types, with the strains from St. Nectaire having high activity and strains from Reblochon having little or no activity. The results of carbon assimilation and salt tolerance tests suggest that cheese-making technologies play a role in strain selection. Our study reveals an enormous diversity of G. candidum that has been empirically selected through the centuries by the cheese-makers of France. Native strains of G. candidum could provide a rich source of cheese ripening enzymes for developing aroma and texture.

50|$|Cheese {{is another}} product made from milk. Whole milk is reacted to form curds {{that can be}} compressed, {{processed}} and stored to form cheese. In countries where milk is legally allowed to be processed without pasteurization, {{a wide range of}} cheeses can be made using the bacteria naturally in the milk. In most other countries, the range of cheeses is smaller and the use of artificial cheese curing is greater. Whey is also the byproduct of this process. Some people with lactose intolerance are surprisingly able to eat certain types of cheese. This is because some traditionally made hard <b>cheeses,</b> and <b>soft</b> <b>ripened</b> <b>cheeses</b> may create less reaction than the equivalent amount of milk because of the processes involved. Fermentation and higher fat content contribute to lesser amounts of lactose. Traditionally made Emmental or Cheddar might contain 10% of the lactose found in whole milk.

In outbreak B, birds were identified as likely contaminating the dairy plant’s water supply and cheese during the curd-washing step. Issues noted during outbreak A included the risks of operating a dairy plant in a farm environment, potential for transfer of L. m. from the farm environment to the plant via shared toilet facilities, failure to clean and sanitize culture spray bottles, and cross-contamination during cheese aging. L. m. contamination in outbreak B was traced to wild swallows defecating in the plant’s open cistern water reservoir and amultibarrier failure in the water disinfection system. These outbreaks led to enhanced inspection and surveillance of cheese plants, test and release programs for all SRC manufactured in BC, improvements in plant design and prevention programs, and reduced listeriosis incidence. 1...|$|R
40|$|The use of goat milk {{is limited}} in Indonesia {{due to lack of}} good milking {{practices}} resulted in disliked goaty smell. One of the method to eliminate this off flavor is by processing the goat milk into <b>soft</b> <b>cheese.</b> The aim of this research was to study the stability of viable starter lactic acid bacteria cultures (Lactobacillus acidophilus FNCC- 0051 and L. casei FNCC- 0090) during storage of goat milk <b>soft</b> <b>cheese.</b> Three batches of goat milk <b>soft</b> <b>cheeses</b> were produced with different starter cultures L. acidophilus FNCC- 0051 (5. 0 x 106 cfu mL- 1); L. casei FNCC- 0090 (5. 0 x 106 cfu mL- 1); and the mixture of L. acidophilus FNCC- 0051 (2. 5 x 106 cfu mL- 1) and L. casei FNCC- 0090 (2. 5 x 106 cfu mL- 1). The goat milk cheeses had white color and soft. The viable lactic acid bacteria in the goat milk <b>soft</b> <b>cheese</b> reached 109 cfu g- 1, which was stable for 8 weeks at 5 °C. Panelists liked goat milk <b>soft</b> <b>cheeses,</b> especially in term of its aroma. The specific aroma produced could mask the disliked goaty smell...|$|R
