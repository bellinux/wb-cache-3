The Special 301 Sub-Committee of the Trade Policy Staff Committee conducts additional reviews throughout the year for countries that [...] "merit additional monitoring".

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis is to analyse the newly adopted European Regulation (EU) No. 2015 / 848 as of 20 May 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings (the "Regulation") that shall enter into force in June 2017, especially as regards cross-border insolvency of group of companies. The theoretical part of the thesis introduces the background of European legislation {{in the field of}} international private law and concentrates especially on pieces of legislation regu-lating the insolvency proceedings. The thesis analyses the reasons for general recast of the regulation as well as <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>extension</b> of the scope of the regulation by the rules for cross-border insolvency of group of companies. The practical part consists of a simulation of cross-border insolvency proceedings where a group of companies is concerned.

The dissolution of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia and accession to the European Union are the main two <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>extension</b> of the investment area.

The analysis is worked out in greater detail for the Republic of Slovenia, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of italy and the Republic of Croatia.

40|$|Whether a {{shortened}} {{dental arch}} {{needs to be}} extended depends {{on the degree of}} the shortening. Four categories of shortened dental arches can be distinguished: 1. slightly shortened dental arches; 2. moderately shortened dental arches; 3. extremely shortened dental arches; and 4. asymmetrical extremely shortened dental arches. Decision-making on extending a shortened dental arch should be based on oral function and the patient's perceived impact on oral health-related quality of life. According to this principle, there is no evidence for extending slightly shortened dental arches. Extending moderately shortened dental arches is indicated in exceptional cases, especially for aesthetic reasons. In the case of (asymmetrical) extremely shortened dental arches there are <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>extension.</b> The extension can be restricted to restoring the arch {{to the level of a}} moderately shortened dental arch. With this treatment strategy, it is possible in many cases to conform to the current trend of using fixed partial dentures rather than removable partial dentures...|$|E

50|$|The {{school was}} {{commissioned}} in two phases, the first completed in October 1958 {{and the second}} begun in May 1959.

Although the school was built in anticipation of a population increase, the growth was greater and more rapid than expected, and at its peak Dounreay’s staff of 2,400 people trebled the size of the town.|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} work of Wu and Yau on the ampleness of {{canonical}} line bundle for compact Kähler manifolds with negative holomorphic sectional curvature, we introduce a new curvature notion called real bisectional curvature for Hermitian manifolds. When the metric is Kähler, {{this is just the}} holomorphic sectional curvature H, and when the metric is non-Kähler, it is slightly stronger than H. We classify compact Hermitian manifolds with constant non-zero real bisectional curvature, and also slightly extend Wu-Yau's theorem to the Hermitian case. The underlying <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the <b>extension</b> is that the Schwarz lemma of Wu-Yau works the same when the target metric is only Hermitian but has nonpositive real bisectional curvature...|$|R

50|$|By 2005, {{construction}} on {{the western end of}} the Marina Freeway began, to extend the freeway terminus from Culver Boulevard to approximately 1/2 mi west of Culver Boulevard by building a full interchange at Culver. The freeway extension was completed in early 2007. The freeway extension also allows Route 90 drivers to avoid a traffic signal at Alla Road (just west of Culver Boulevard.). After the end of the freeway, a pair of frontage roads operating as an expressway continues as Route 90 up to Route 1 (Lincoln Boulevard).

50|$|There {{are many}} reasons the Haitian {{elections}} were delayed. Due {{to a lack of}} funding, election officials were not able to meet the voter registration deadline set for early August. In addition there was considerable unrest in parts of Haiti, particularly the Port-au-Prince slums where there were attacks on the new government, and where the U.N. and the Haitian National Police have been accused of committing massacres and targeted killings of anti-occupation protesters and organizers. However, the inability to register voters in the time allocated was the primary <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the <b>extensions.</b> There was also concern that only 800-900 voting stations would be placed throughout Haiti, in comparison to the many thousands of stations that existed during the previous election.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Object-Z[2, 3, 4] is an {{extension}} of the formal specification language Z[5, 7, 8] to accommodate object orientation[6, 1]. The main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> this <b>extension</b> is to improve the clarity of large specifications through enhanced structuring. A Z specification typically defines a number of state and operation schemas. A state schema groups together variables and defines the relationship that holds between their values. At any instant, these variables define the state of that part of the system which they model. An operation schema defines the relationship between the `before' and `after' states corresponding to one or more state schemas. Therefore, inferring which operation schemas may affect a particular state schema requires examining the signatures of all operation schemas. In large specifications this is impracticable. Conventions, such as chapters, group states and operations informally, but cannot enforce structure. Object-Z overcomes this problem by confining i...|$|R

The paper details the decline in the popularity of the Keynesian theory and the return to classical economic principles.
