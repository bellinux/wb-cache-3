5|$|Next, the Dodgers came to Citizens Bank Park for {{a three-game}} series. After the Phillies lost game one (2–0) in a pitchers' duel between Hernandez and Clayton Kershaw, {{when they were}} zero-for-nine with <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position,</b> David Buchanan made his major-league debut on May 24. The Phillies won 5–3, with Buchanan getting the win after a five-inning start and Papelbon earning his 13th save. The next day, Josh Beckett pitched a no-hitter for a 6–0 Dodger victory. The next day (Memorial Day), Kendrick had his first win since August 6, 2013; Howard's five RBIs gave the Phillies a 9–0 win over the Colorado Rockies. The team lost game two of the series, 6–2, despite Ben Revere's first major-league home run; Hamels allowed four runs in seven innings, and Jeff Manship gave up two more in the eighth.|$|E
5|$|Adams still {{uses the}} same 26-inch-wide bass drum he began with in 1973. He has stated that he bought {{it as part of}} a set for $25 at a garage sale. It has the same head {{on the side of the}} drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year. During games, Adams tends to drum at {{particular}} moments: when the Indians take the field at the beginning of the game, if the Indians have <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position,</b> if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top of the ninth inning. Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E
5|$|Uribe {{began his}} {{professional}} career in 1997 {{when he was}} signed by the Colorado Rockies. After advancing through the minors, he made his MLB debut with the Rockies in 2001. He became their shortstop in 2001 and spent all of 2002 in that capacity. He missed part of 2003 with an injury and {{was traded to the}} Chicago White Sox following the season. After one season as a utility player, Uribe became the starting shortstop for the White Sox in 2005; he held that position for the next three years. While Uribe was with the White Sox, the team won the 2005 World Series against the Houston Astros. Uribe hit 21 home runs in 2006 but had a low on-base percentage. He hit 20 home runs in 2007 but had a low batting average with <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> (RISP). In 2008, Uribe lost his starting shortstop role to Orlando Cabrera and shifted to the starter at second, but then lost that job to rookie Alexei Ramírez. He eventually ended the season as the team's third baseman due to an injury to Joe Crede.|$|E

50|$|In {{the third}} inning, the Yankees {{replaced}} first baseman Bill Skowron, who was complaining of back pain, with Elston Howard. In {{the fifth inning}} the Braves had a <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> after an error by Howard. The Braves did not manage to capitalize on this opportunity, as second baseman Red Schoendienst grounded out. By {{the end of the}} fifth inning, the Braves had left four men on base, with the score still tied at 0-0.|$|R
50|$|Otis Nixon led {{the game}} {{off for the}} Braves with a ground rule double due to fan interference. After Deion Sanders struck out, Nixon stole third as Pendleton batted. He then scored as Pendleton responded with a double of his own to right field, scoring the first run {{of the game and}} giving Justice a chance to drive <b>in</b> a <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> Morris settled down, however, and retired Justice on a strikeout and Smith on a flyball to end the inning.|$|R
25|$|Notably, García faced though {{pitching}} {{in the early}} going with the likes of Babe Birrer, José Bracho, Dick Starr, Sandy Ullrich, Roy Welmaker and Lenny Yochim, for name a few. Nevertheless, he delivered rewarding results in the years to come, earning respect as a dangerous hitter with <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position,</b> particularly during the late innings.|$|E
25|$|The Husker offense had {{numerous}} opportunities to score in extra innings {{as they had}} base <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> in the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 15th inning. They even had bases loaded twice during this streak but were unable to push across any runs against a tough Longhorn bullpen. In the 15th inning, the Husker's finally won after an RBI base hit by Austin Darby which scored Tanner Lubach from second base.|$|E
25|$|Nationals closer Sean Doolittle set the Cubs down {{in order}} {{in the top of}} the ninth, and Davis – {{completing}} his longest outing since 2012 – returned to retire Turner, Werth, and Harper in the bottom of the ninth, throwing 44 pitches in his outing, 10 more than he had thrown in any single appearance during the regular season. The season endied on a Harper strikeout on a full count. Despite going 1-for-11 with <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> and walking nine Nationals hitters, the Cubs won the 4-hour 37-minute game 9-8 and the series 3-2 and advanced to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2017 National League Championship Series.|$|E
5000|$|Game 4 {{was another}} {{marathon}} affair. Joe Saunders and Phil Hughes matched zeroes for four innings, before Nate McLouth led off the fifth for Baltimore {{with a home}} run. The Yankees responded in the sixth when Robinson Canó had an RBI groundout, but they left a <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> that inning when Alex Rodriguez struck out. Rodriguez also left men on second and third with one out {{in the bottom of}} the eighth, dropping his batting average for the series down to [...]125 and continuing to draw the scorn of Yankees fans.|$|R
25|$|Boston got to Darling early, {{recording}} three {{second inning}} runs. Dwight Evans and Rich Gedman hit {{back to back}} home runs to lead the inning off and with two out, Wade Boggs drove in Dave Henderson with a single for a 3–0 Red Sox lead. Darling did not pitch {{as well as he}} had earlier in the series and was pulled in the fourth inning with two outs and a <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> Sid Fernandez came in and after walking Boggs, he was able to retire Marty Barrett on a fly ball to right field. Fernandez then retired the side in order in the fifth and sixth.|$|R
500|$|The game {{continued}} without scoring {{until the}} eighth inning. The Dodgers {{managed to get}} their second <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> as Doug Camilli pinch hit for Smith, {{but they did not}} score. Phil Ortega entered to pitch for the Dodgers {{in the bottom of the}} eighth and the Giants continued their offensive performance. Willie Mays walked to open the inning and then stole second base with one out. Davenport and Bailey both walked to load the bases and José Pagán doubled to empty the bases and make the game 8–0. Pierce remained in the game to pitch the ninth, finishing his complete game shutout. Koufax later said of his Game 1 performance, [...] "I had nothing at all." ...|$|R
25|$|Cardinals clinch NL Central on September 27. The Cardinals {{clinched}} the NL Central title {{at home on}} September 27. It was their first NL Central title since 2009. It was their seventh division title since 2000, thanks to 20 rookies, 12 of them had never before appeared in the majors before this year. They were second three consecutive years prior to 2013. The club has a 16-6 record since Allen Craig was lost {{for the remainder of}} the regular season on September 4, with a foot injury. The club previously lost their ace (Chris Carpenter), their shortstop (Rafael Furcal), and their closer (Jason Motte) before Opening Day, plus two more starting pitchers in May and then cleanup hitter Craig, who has the majors highest batting average (.454) with <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> He has been ruled doubtful for the 2013 National League Division Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, because of his Lisfranc injury to his left foot.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{failed to}} score a run and left eight men on base through five innings.	Ethier, pinch hitting, scored Pederson on a single in the sixth inning for the Dodgers' only run. They only had one hit in 13 chances with <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> in the game. Kershaw pitched four {{scoreless}} innings of relief in the game, and in the process, he broke Orel Hershiser's Dodgers postseason record with his 33rd strikeout. Morton pitched four innings of relief to earn the win, as Corey Seager grounded out to José Altuve, who threw to Yuli Gurriel to end the game, series, baseball season, and their 55-year drought. The Astros became the third consecutive road team to win a World Series Game 7 {{as well as the}} fourth consecutive team to end a World Series on the road (after the 2014 Giants, 2015 Royals and 2016 Cubs). They also became just the second team to win a seven game League Championship Series and a seven game World Series in the same year, following the 1985 Kansas City Royals. Springer won the World Series MVP Award.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wildest}} and largest ninth-inning {{comeback}} win all season, the Cardinals {{at home on}} August 8, scored all five of their runs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth after two outs, for a 5-4 win. Previously, the team was an awful 2-45 when trailing after eight innings. The team fell into a 0-4 hole, and were 0-for-11 with <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> It was the 10th time in the last 15 games that a starter could not get to the sixth inning. Down to his last strike at 1-2, Brandon Moss got the tying run in with a bases-loaded walk, and Yadier Molina then finished off the improbable comeback win by getting hit in the ribs by a pitch. The Cardinals have won three of the last four Major League games to end on a walk-off hit-by-pitch. It happened most recently for St. Louis on Aug. 14, 2014, when Jon Jay took a pitch off his body. That was also against the Reds. With the win, the team got its 59th win against 53 losses, tying the Miami Marlins for the second Wild Card spot with 50 games remaining in the season. Michael Wacha could go only five innings, as the fifth starter in a week to not get to the sixth inning.|$|E
5000|$|Falcone went 26-37 with a 3.91 ERA as a Met.

500|$|Both Blackburn and Danks {{held the}} game {{scoreless}} early on, allowing only six baserunners {{through the first}} four innings of the game. The Twins' Michael Cuddyer led {{off the top of}} the fifth with a double, the only Twins <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> for the entire game. Danks induced a deep flyball out from Delmon Young, which allowed Cuddyer to advance to third. Brendan Harris hit a deep flyball to center field which was caught for an out by Ken Griffey, Jr. Cuddyer tried to score on the ball as a sacrifice fly, but Griffey delivered an accurate throw to home plate and White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski blocked the plate and tagged out Cuddyer to end the inning. This play drew praise after the game as a [...] "nice throw" [...] and a [...] "defensive gem".|$|R
25|$|Yomiuri Giants' starter Tetsuya Utsumi and {{relievers}} Scott Mathieson, Tetsuya Yamaguchi and Kentaro Nishimura combined on a nine-hit shutout to {{beat the}} Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles and take one-game lead in the Series. Even though they failed to <b>score</b> <b>in</b> the game, the Eagles had several scoring opportunities. Their leadoff man reached base in six innings and they also ended six innings {{with at least one}} <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> Eagles' rookie-starter Takahiro Norimoto performed well, holding the Giants to only four hits through eight and a third innings. The Giants' two runs came from a Hisayoshi Chono RBI-single in the fifth inning and Shuichi Murata's solo homerun {{in the top of the}} eighth. In the bottom half of the inning, Giants' outfielder Yoshiyuki Kamei stopped a potential game-tying play by making an impressive catch at the wall to retire Kazuo Matsui with runners on first and second with two outs.|$|R
25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} regular season at home on April 1 against the San Francisco Giants. Clayton Kershaw made the opening day start for the third {{straight}} season and pitched a complete game shutout as the Dodgers won 4-0. Kershaw also hit his first career home run in the game, for the Dodgers' first run {{in the bottom of the}} 8th. Korean pitcher Hyun-jin Ryu made his Major League debut the following day, allowing three runs (one earned) on 10 hits in 6 1/3 innings to pick up the 3-0 loss. The Dodgers went 1 for 14 with <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> in the series finale, and Pablo Sandoval and Hunter Pence hit homers off Josh Beckett as the Giants won 5-3. Zack Greinke made his Dodgers debut on April 5, pitching a two-hitter for 6 1/3 innings in the Dodgers' 3-0 win. Andre Ethier hit a solo homer in the game. In his second start of the season, Kershaw pitched seven shutout innings while striking out nine and only allowing two hits in the 1-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Dodgers finished off their three-game sweep of the Pirates with a 6-2 win on April 7. Adrian Gonzalez had four RBI and Ryu picked up his first Major League win in the game.|$|E
25|$|The Phillies were 36-45 and 11 {{games behind}} {{the first place}} Nationals after their series against the Marlins. The Phillies started the month by taking 1 of 3 from the New York Mets. The one win, however, came with Cliff Lee finally winning his {{first game of the}} season after 13 starts. The streak tied for 5th for the longest winless streak for a pitcher. The Phillies would end the first half by getting swept by the Atlanta Braves. They ended the first half with a {{disastrous}} 37–50 mark, their worst since 1997. The Phillies seemed to have woken up in the second half, as they would take 2 of 3 from the Colorado Rockies and Los Angeles Dodgers. Although they only took 1 of 3 from the San Francisco Giants, they would make it up by sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers, all from late comebacks. The sweep was their first 3-game sweep of the year. The sweep, however, got taken back by the Braves as they would get swept by them again because they had a hard time with <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> The sweep woke up the Phillies, as they would blow out the Washington Nationals in the 1st game of the series on July 31, 8–0. The Phillies would end up taking 2 of 3 from the Nationals. After the series against the Nationals on August 2, the Phillies were 47–58, 15 and a half games behind the first place Nationals, and 13 game behind the second wild card. Although their playoff chances are slim, the Phillies performance after the all-star break looked promising for next season. Throughout the month, knowing that they will likely not make the post-season, the Phillies made trades with some of their players. One of the trades were Hunter Pence getting traded to the Giants for Nate Schierholtz, Tommy Joseph, and Seth Rosin. Another trade was Shane Victorino getting trading to the Dodgers for 2 pitchers. Pitcher Joe Blanton also got involved in a trade with the Dodgers. The Phillies would also resign Cole Hamels to a six-year, $144 million extension, the second-largest contract for a pitcher in baseball history.|$|E

500|$|Ruth {{returned}} to his normal production during 1926, when he batted [...]372 with 47 home runs and 146 RBIs. The Yankees built a 10-game lead by mid-June and coasted to win the pennant by three games. The St. Louis Cardinals had won the National League with the lowest winning percentage for a pennant winner to that point (.578) and the Yankees were expected to win the World Series easily. Although the Yankees won the opener in New York, St. Louis took Games Two and Three. In Game Four, Ruth hit three home runs—the first time this had been done in a World Series game—to lead the Yankees to victory. In the fifth game, Ruth caught a ball as he crashed into the fence. The play was described by baseball writers as a defensive gem. New York took that game, but Grover Cleveland Alexander won Game Six for St. Louis to tie the Series at three games each, then got very drunk. He was nevertheless inserted into Game Seven {{in the seventh inning}} and shut down the Yankees to win the game, 3–2, and win the Series. Ruth had hit his fourth home run of the Series earlier in the game, and was the only Yankee to reach base off Alexander, walking in the ninth inning before being caught stealing to end the game. Although Ruth's attempt to steal second is often deemed a baserunning blunder, Creamer pointed out that the Yankees' chances of tying the game would have been greatly improved with a <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In an {{unpredictable}} Game 4, Ryan Vogelsong and Jason Vargas were the starting pitchers. The early signs were {{good for the}} Giants, as Gregor Blanco lead off with a walk, advanced on a wild pitch and stole third base, coming <b>in</b> to <b>score</b> on Hunter Pence's groundout. Having retired Kansas City in the 1st and 2nd innings relatively easily, Vogelsong hit a roadblock in the 3rd. He gave up 5 singles, a walk and a stolen base as the Royals scored 4 runs to knock {{him out of the}} game after recording just 8 outs. Buster Posey reduced the gap to 2 runs {{in the bottom of the}} 3rd with a two-out RBI single. Yusmeiro Petit was called on to pitch, and he delivered another 3 scoreless innings of relief to hold the Royals at 4. Petit also had a single despite an [...]049 career batting average that put a <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the 4th, but the Giants couldn't cash in. Joe Panik lead off the 5th inning with a double and Royals manager Ned Yost took Vargas out of the game. This was to prove a costly decision, as Jason Frasor gave up an RBI single to Pence that made it a one-run game. Danny Duffy was brought in, but he too struggled allowing a single to Pablo Sandoval that moved Pence to 3rd base, and a walk to Brandon Belt to load the bases. Juan Pérez hit a sacrifice-fly to tie the game at 4. In the 6th, Brandon Finnegan was the next Royals reliever to be touched up as Sandoval came through again, this time with a bases-loaded two-run single. Belt added another run on a single to give the Giants a 7-4 lead. Finnegan allowed the first two <b>runners</b> to reach <b>in</b> the 7th, as he was removed from the game in favour of Tim Collins. Blanco then attempted to bunt the runners over, and Collins threw the ball into him as he was running down the line allowing a run to score, the trail runner to 3rd base and Blanco to reach. Panik then drove in two more with his second double of the game as the Giants hit double digits <b>in</b> runs <b>scored.</b> Pence also doubled to make the score 11-4 Giants. Sergio Romo and Hunter Strickland delivered scoreless innings to give the Giants the win that tied the series at 2.|$|R
50|$|Despite having {{claimed the}} Wild Card {{spot on the}} final day of the regular season, the Giants were able to tab ace Madison Bumgarner for the Wild Card game start. Bumgarner had an {{excellent}} regular season for the Giants, finishing with a career-low in ERA and a career-high in strikeouts, finishing fourth in the National League in both categories. On the hill for the New York Mets was Noah Syndergaard, who himself finished 3rd in the NL in ERA and 9th in strikeouts. The pitching matchup didn't disappoint, it took until the bottom of the third inning for the game's first hit and baserunner, with Syndergaard striking out four straight batters on two occasions. The closest either side came to <b>scoring</b> was <b>in</b> the top of the 6th when, after Denard Span singled and stole second base with two outs, Brandon Belt hit a long fly ball to center field which was caught on the dead run by Curtis Granderson, smashing into the wall and holding on. Syndergaard exited after 7 innings, having struck out 10. Crucially as it turned out, the Giants had forced Syndergaard out of the game with Bumgarner still going strong. Another golden opportunity was squandered by the Giants in the top of the 8th inning, when Addison Reed struck out Hunter Pence to end the inning with the bases loaded. After Bumgarner left a <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the bottom of the 8th, the game moved to the 9th with the Mets bringing in closer Jeurys Familia. Brandon Crawford led the inning off with a double to left-center, but Ángel Pagán couldn't lay down the sacrifice bunt and then struck out. Joe Panik worked a walk and Conor Gillaspie stepped up to the plate to launch a three-run home run to right field. Gillaspie had only started the game because Eduardo Núñez was still dealing with a hamstring injury and had to be left off the roster. Bumgarner then got the final three outs, completing the shutout just as he had done in the 2014 Wild Card Game. Bumgarner made 119 pitches, allowed just 6 total baserunners, striking out 6 and setting an MLB record of 23 consecutive scoreless innings pitched in postseason elimination games.

50|$|In the {{deciding}} {{game of the}} World Series, Tim Hudson took the mound for the Giants setting a new record for the oldest pitcher to start a World Series game. Jeremy Guthrie was the starter for the Royals. After being sent down in order in the 1st inning, the Giants offense awoke in the 2nd. Pablo Sandoval started the inning {{being hit by a}} pitch, Hunter Pence and Brandon Belt followed with base hits to load the sacks with nobody out. Michael Morse and Brandon Crawford produced consecutive sacrifice flies to give the Giants a 2-0 lead. The advantage was to be short-lived, as Hudson gave up a single to Billy Butler and an RBI double to Alex Gordon. Salvador Pérez was drilled by a pitch that forced him to hobble down to first base. Mike Moustakas hit a fly-ball to left-field, and Gordon tagged up to go to third base, allowing Omar Infante to tie the game with a sacrifice fly. Alcides Escobar singled, and that was that for Hudson as the Giants were forced to remove a starter {{before the end of the}} 2nd inning for two straight games. Jeremy Affeldt came into the game and got the Giants out of the inning. In the bottom of the 3rd inning, the Giants turned a potentially game-changing double play after the leadoff man reached. Joe Panik dived to snare a ball hit off the bat of Eric Hosmer, flipped the ball with his glove to Crawford who turned the ball over to first base where, after a replay review called for by the Giants, Hosmer was ruled out having elected to slide head-first. In the top of the 4th, Sandoval and Pence again reached to start the inning, and Morse knocked in the go-ahead run off Kelvin Herrera. From that point on, the game became all about the pitchers. Affeldt pitched the fourth, keyed by another Panik-Crawford-Belt double play, before the Giants called upon Madison Bumgarner to hold the lead. The Royals missed two chances with a <b>runner</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the 5th. Bumgarner retired 12 hitters in a row to send the game into the 9th inning with the Giants holding a one-run lead. Instead of electing to use his closer, manager Bruce Bochy allowed Bumgarner to go out and pitch the 9th. Hosmer struck out and Butler popped up and the Giants were an out away. Gordon hit a sinking liner that was misplayed by Gregor Blanco in center field, and then bobbled by Juan Pérez and Gordon reached third base. With Salvador Pérez batting, Bumgarner induced a pop up that was caught by Sandoval and the Giants won the World Series title. Bumgarner's personal performance earned him the World Series MVP. Incredibly only three days after making 117 pitches in shutting out the Royals in Game 5, Bumgarner pitched 5 innings of scoreless relief making 68 pitches and not walking a batter. He broke the record set by Curt Schilling for the most innings pitched in a single postseason.|$|R
