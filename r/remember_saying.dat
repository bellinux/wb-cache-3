I remember I {{had it right}} in the sack. I could just feel it when I dubbed it down, made the final mix from the 16-track down to mono. It was a feeling of power, it was a rush. A feeling of exaltation. Artistic beauty. It was everything ... I <b>remember</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Oh my God. Sit back and listen to this!'" ...|$|E

[...] And they liked that idea and they said, 'Okay. Go write it.' Once we had a basic story, I started {{cataloging}} the strange coincidences in my own life. [...] For example, I was in the Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker.

[...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|When {{he joined}} the Manhattan Project in 1942, Oppenheimer wrote on his {{personal}} security questionnaire that he [...] had been [...] "a member of just about every Communist Front organization on the West Coast". Years later he claimed {{that he did not}} <b>remember</b> <b>saying</b> this, that it was not true, and that if he had said anything along those lines, it was [...] "a half-jocular overstatement". He was a subscriber to the People's World, a Communist Party organ, and he testified in 1954, [...] "I was associated with the Communist movement." [...] From 1937 to 1942, Oppenheimer was a member at Berkeley of what he called a [...] "discussion group", which was later identified by fellow members, Haakon Chevalier and Gordon Griffiths, as a [...] "closed" [...] (secret) unit of the Communist Party for Berkeley faculty.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I <b>remember</b> <b>saying</b> to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is {{nice to be able to}} do something like that that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E

30|$|Remember that, ontologically, we have {{to grant}} the {{existence}} of two distinct experiencers and two distinct experiences. Delfitto and Fiorin (2014 b) provide linguistic evidence that the de se reports of certain control verbs (such as “imagine” and “remember”) are also unambiguously immune to ‘error through misidentification’ {{on the part of}} the author of the reported attitude. As originally discussed by Higginbotham (2003), the statement “Jim <b>remembers</b> <b>saying</b> that John should finish his thesis by July” cannot be true in a scenario in which John fails to identify himself as the person having the experience of saying that John should finish his thesis by July. In fact, the sentence is judged as unsound in a context such as “Jim <b>remembers</b> <b>saying</b> that John should finish his thesis by July, although, now that he thinks about it, he is not sure it was him who he <b>remembers</b> <b>saying</b> it.” Notice, importantly, that the immunity to error is not conveyed by slightly different grammatical formats. The sentence “Jim <b>remembers</b> himself <b>saying</b> that John should finish his thesis by July” does not contradict the following continuation: “although, now that he thinks about it, he is not sure it was him who he <b>remembers</b> <b>saying</b> it.” Delfitto and Fiorin (2014 b) contend that a proper modeling of the semantics of these peculiar statements requires that experiencers and experiences be regarded as belonging to ontological classes distinct from individuals and events. In particular, two properties are of importance in the context of the present discussion: (i) for each experience there is one and only one experiencer (hence, any two experiences with two different experiencers are necessarily different experiences); (ii) for each experience there is one and only one point in time at which the experience occurs (hence, any two experiences occurring at two different points in time are necessarily numerically distinct experiences). While we refer the reader to Delfitto and Fiorin (2014 b) for a throughout discussion of the precise metaphysical status of these ontological classes and their consequences for a theory of meaning, in the reminder of this article we would like to demonstrate how the two properties mentioned above provide a principled answer to the puzzle of FID.|$|R

500|$|On July 2, 2007, Washington {{appeared}} on Larry King Live, {{to present his}} side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on right here on the ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>saying</b> , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay.

500|$|When Alan McGee, Creation's {{publicist}} Johnny Hopkins, {{and marketing}} executive Emma Greengrass first heard Be Here Now at Noel Gallagher's house, each had their doubts about its artistic value, but kept their doubts to themselves. One Creation employee recalled [...] "{{a lot of}} nodding of heads, a lot of slapping of backs." [...] McGee later admitted to having strong misgivings at first: [...] "I heard it {{in the studio and}} I <b>remember</b> <b>saying</b> 'We'll only sell seven million copies'... I thought it was too confrontational." [...] However, {{in an interview with the}} music press a few days later he predicted the album would sell twenty million copies. McGee's hyperbole alarmed both Oasis and their management company Ignition, and both immediately excluded him from involvement in the release campaign. Ignition's strategy from that point on centred on an effort to suppress all publicity, and withheld access to both music and information from anybody not directly involved with the album's release. Fearful of the dangers of over-hype and bootlegging, their aim was to present the record as a [...] "regular, everyday collection of tunes." [...] To this end they planned a modest marketing budget, to be spent on subdued promotional activities such as street posters and music press adverts, while avoiding mainstream instruments such as billboard and TV advertising. According to Greengrass [...] "We want to keep it low key. We want to keep control of the whole mad thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early in 1977, Terry Nation was {{commissioned}} to write four more episodes for Series One and five episodes for Series Two. Nation was now contracted to write all thirteen episodes {{of the first}} series. The BBC had expanded Nation's writing commitment in order that Nation's high profile would help {{the promotion of the}} series. Providing a large amount of material in a short time would prove difficult for Nation. Admitting that he had agreed to write every episode out of [...] "ego and supreme confidence", Nation later recalled that he returned home following the commission and told his wife, [...] "I think I've got myself into deep trouble!". Nation informed Boucher that he would only be able to deliver the first draft of each script, telling Boucher, [...] "...you can have rewrites or you can have the next episode: which do you want?”. As a result, while Nation created the plots, Boucher provided a great deal of input into the characters and dialogue. According to Boucher, [...] "Terry came up with the characters, he came up with thirteen good stories, but he didn't come up with the dialogue.
