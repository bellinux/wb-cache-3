An extra armoured car company joined in the reconnaissance operations far behind the front line. The WDF had been reinforced by a new tank regiment with Matilda II tanks and after a month, the British began to prepare a raid on the central group of Italian encampments and then on Sofafi of 4–5 days' duration, rather than wait for the Italians.|$|E

Originally conceived as a replacement for the wartime Wireless Set 19, it was enhanced during development by the addition of Narrow Band Phase Modulation (NBPhM) facilities to improve the performance and communications reliability at short range particularly at night when ionospheric changes cause increased interference levels. This was accomplished by the use of angle modulation effectively doubling the output power compared to AM and exploiting the capture effect of the mode.A complementary manpack HF set, the A13, was also equipped with NBPhM facilities.|$|E

40|$|An {{electron}} {{cyclotron resonance}} ion source (ECRIS) has been developing long time and their performance is still extending at present. Recently, {{they are not only}} used in producing multi-charged ions, but also molecules and cluster ions. A new type of ion source with a wide operation window is expected for various uses. We developed a novel magnetic field configuration ECRIS. The magnetic field configuration is constructed by a pair of comb-shaped magnetic field by all permanent magnets and has opposite polarity each other with ring-magnets. This magnetic configuration suppresses the loss due to E×B drift, and then plasma confinement is enhanced. We conduct preliminary extracting and forming large bore ion beam from this source. We will make this source a part of tandem type ion source for the first stage. Broad ion beams extracted from the first stage and transfer like a shower to plasma generated by the second stage. We hope to realize a device which has a very wide <b>range</b> <b>operation</b> window in a single device to produce many kinds of ion beams. We try to control plasma parameters by multiply frequency microwaves for broad ion beam extraction. It is found that plasma and beam can be controllable on spatial profiles beyond wide operation window of plasma parameters.
