5|$|The {{practice}} {{of birth control}} was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914, when the movement to legalize contraception began. Longstanding techniques included the <b>rhythm</b> <b>method,</b> withdrawal, diaphragms, contraceptive sponges, condoms, prolonged breastfeeding, and spermicides. Use of contraceptives increased throughout the nineteenth century, contributing to a 50 percent drop in the fertility rate in the United States between 1800 and 1900, particularly in urban regions. The only known survey conducted {{during the nineteenth century}} of American women's contraceptive habits was performed by Clelia Mosher from 1892 to 1912. The survey was based on a small sample of upper-class women, and shows that most of the women used contraception (primarily douching, but also withdrawal, rhythm, condoms and pessaries) and that they viewed sex as a pleasurable act that could be undertaken without the goal of procreation.Engelman, pp. 11–12.|$|E

25|$|One concern {{related to}} the use of calendar-based methods is their {{relatively}} high failure rate, compared to other methods of birth control.

Of commonly known methods of birth control, only the cervical cap and contraceptive sponge have comparably high failure rates.

40|$|Abstract Background Animals, {{including}} humans, {{exhibit a}} variety of biological rhythms. This article describes a method for the detection and simultaneous comparison of multiple nycthemeral <b>rhythms.</b> <b>Methods</b> A statistical method for detecting periodic patterns in time-related data via harmonic regression is described. The method is particularly capable of detecting nycthemeral rhythms in medical data. Additionally a method for simultaneously comparing two or more periodic patterns is described, which derives from the analysis of variance (ANOVA). This method statistically confirms or rejects equality of periodic patterns. Mathematical descriptions of the detecting method and the comparing method are displayed.

25|$|Starting in the 1880s, {{birth rates}} began to drop {{steadily}} {{in the industrialized}} countries, as women married later and families in urban living conditions increasingly favoured having fewer children. This trend was particularly acute in the United Kingdom, where birth rates declined from almost 35.5 births per 1,000 in the 1870s to about 29 per 1,000 by 1900. While the cause is uncertain, the 29% decline within a generation shows that the birth control methods Victorian women used were effective. Many women were educated about contraception and how to avoid pregnancy. While the <b>rhythm</b> <b>method</b> was not yet understood, condoms and diaphragms made of vulcanized rubber were reliable and inexpensive.|$|E

She was conservative in all senses except that she believed women to have sexual passions equal to those of men, and that men and women were equally responsible for controlling those passions. Others of her time believed women to have little if any sexual passion, and placed the responsibility of moral policing squarely on the shoulders of the woman.

40|$|Background The efferent dorsal motor {{nucleus of}} the vagal nuclei complex may {{degenerate}} early {{in the course of}} Parkinson’s disease (PD), while efferent nucleus ambiguous, the principal source of parasympathetic vagal neurons innervating the heart, and afferent somatosensory nuclei remain intact. Objective To obtain neurophysiological evidence related to this pattern, we tested processing of affer-ent sensory information transmitted via the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN) which is known to be connected to autonomic regulation of cardiac <b>rhythm.</b> <b>Methods</b> In this cross-sectional observational study, we recorded (i) somatosensory evoked poten-tials (ABVN-SEP) and (ii) cutaneo-cardioautonomic response elicited by stimulation of the ABVN (modulation of heart-rate variability (HRV index; low frequency power, ln(LF), high frequency power, ln(HF); ln(LF/HF) ratio)) in 50 PD patients and 50 age and sex matched healthy controls. Additionally, auditory evoked potentials and trigeminal nerve SEP were assessed. Results Neither ABVN-SEP nor any of the other functional brainstem parameters differed between patients and controls. Although HRV index was decreased in PD patients, modulation of ln (LF/HF) by ABVN-stimulation, likely indicating cardiac parasympathetic activation, did not differ between both groups...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{an index}} that {{measures}} {{the variability of}} successive durations (nPVI) has been applied {{for the analysis of}} music scores. It has revealed that such serial characteristic of temporal information in music differs cross-culturally (Patel & Daniele, 2003, etc.). More interestingly, this difference was in line with the difference found in the speech rhythm of the mother tongue. Aims The nPVI measures a serial surface level of durational contrast. However, most rhythms in western tonal music are structured in a hierarchical manner. Therefore, it is interesting to see if a hierarchical measure accounts even more for cross-cultural differences in the perception and production of musical <b>rhythms.</b> <b>Method</b> We used short rhythms consisting of three intervals. Eighteen Dutch and 18 Japanese pianists participated in experiments, which consisted of a rhythm perception task (identification), a rhythm production task (performance from scores) and a familiarity judgement task.

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics {{of patients with}} paroxysmal palpitations and neck pounding during sinus <b>rhythm.</b> <b>Methods</b> Clinical, electrocardiographic, and electrophysiological characteristics of six patients with paroxysmal palpitations and neck pounding during sinus rhythm were studied in basal conditions and when symptomatic. Response to treatment was observed. Results Baseline ECGs were normal (four patients) or had first degree atrioventricular block with intermittent PR shortening. During symptoms, narrow QRS rhythms were seen without visible P waves (three patients) or with P waves partially hidden in the QRS complex (three patients). Dual atrioventricular nodal pathways were found in all five patients who had electrophysiological studies. In these patients the slow pathway conduction time was long enough (mean (SD), 425 (121) ¿ms) for ventricular activation after slow pathway conduction during sinus rhythm {{to coincide with the}} next atrial depolarisation, causing neck pounding during exercise (four patients) or at rest (two patients). Tachycardia was not induced in any patient. Medical treatment aggravated symptoms in three patients. A pacemaker was successfully used in two. Conclusions Neck pounding during sinus rhythm is a clinical manifestation of dual atrioventricular nodal pathways.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{examined}} how {{ethnic differences in}} sleep and depression were related to environmental illumination and circadian <b>rhythms.</b> <b>Methods</b> In an ancillary study to the Women's Health Initiative, 459 postmenopausal women were recorded for one week in their homes, using wrist monitors. Sleep and illumination experience were estimated. Depression was self-rated with a brief adjective check list. Affective diagnoses were made using the SCID interview. Sleep disordered breathing was monitored with home pulse oximetry. Results Hispanic and African-American women slept less than European-American women, according to both objective recordings and their own sleep logs. Non-European-American women had more blood oxygen desaturations during sleep, which accounted for 26 % of sleep duration variance associated with ethnicity. Hispanic women were much more depressed. Hispanic, African-American and Native-American women experienced less daily illumination. Less daily illumination experience was associated with poorer global functioning, longer but more disturbed sleep, and more depression. Conclusions Curtailed sleep and poor mood were related to ethnicity. Sleep disordered breathing {{was a factor in}} the curtailed sleep of minority women. Less illumination was experienced by non-European-American women, but illumination accounted for little of the contrasts between ethnic groups in sleep and mood.

40|$|Objective We characterised the {{spectral}} {{response of the}} EEG to median nerve stimulation using wavelet analysis, and compared the relative magnitudes of effect of several different action–observation conditions on the beta and mu ‘rebound’ <b>rhythms.</b> <b>Methods</b> EEG responses to median nerve stimulation were recorded from 8 normal adult subjects during baseline or action–observation conditions. Analysis was performed by convolution of the EEG with a family of wavelets. Results Decreased power in the mu and beta bands characterized the EEG following median nerve stimulation until 500 ms post-stimulus, followed by increased amplitudes (‘rebound’) of both rhythms. Execution of movement, observation of object-directed movement and observation of somatosensory stimulation all caused a decreased rebound of the beta rhythm whereas observation of aimless thumb movement did not. Conclusions Wavelet analysis of the EEG extracted similar features reported in previous studies using bandpass filtering {{with respect to the}} activation state of the motor cortex during action observation. Further, our results show that observation of somatosensory stimulation alone is sufficient to cause significant modulation of motor cortex activity. Significance These results add further details as to what stimuli can activate the human mirror neuron system and the analytical techniques used may be useful for future studies of clinical populations such as autistic patients...|$|R

Proanthocyanidins improve cardiovascular risk factors that exhibit circadian oscillations. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} current study was to determine whether proanthocyanidins can modulate body <b>rhythms.</b> <b>Methods</b> and results: Male Wistar rats were orally gavaged with 250 mg grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) /kg body weight at zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 (light on). Phenotypic biorhythm was evaluated by measuring the concentration of plasma melatonin and metabolites, using MNR-metabolomics, at several ZT. Remarkably, GSPE treatment maintained nocturnal melatonin levels at ZT 3 and altered the oscillations of some metabolites in plasma. Quantification of expression of clock-core (Clock, Bmal 1, Per 2, Rorα, Rev-erbα) and clock-controlled (Nampt) genes in the hypothalamus by RT-PCR showed that this phenotypic alteration was concomitant with the modulation of the expression pattern of Bmal 1 and Nampt. However, GSPE did not modulate the nocturnal expression of clock genes when administered at ZT 12 (light off).
