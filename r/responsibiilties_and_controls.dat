30|$|Wide area {{protection}} <b>and</b> <b>control</b> collects the measurement, <b>control</b> <b>and</b> protection information of each substation and sends out commands through the substation {{area protection}} <b>and</b> <b>control</b> device. The substation area protection <b>and</b> <b>control</b> device collects local area protection information <b>and</b> sends out <b>control</b> commands directly, for instance, without local area protection. Local area protection function is realized without depending on substation area and wide area protection <b>and</b> <b>control</b> systems, but executes necessary information exchange. Local area bay protection, substation area protection, and wide area protection <b>and</b> <b>control</b> are combined organically {{to form a}} complete hierarchical protection <b>and</b> <b>control</b> system, which not only guarantees the independence, reliability, and quick operation of bay protection, but also uses substation area and wide area protection <b>and</b> <b>control</b> {{to solve the problems}} of relay protection for traditional substations, and improve protection performance <b>and</b> <b>control</b> capability of system security and stability.|$|R

30|$|Theoretical {{opinions}} differ {{regarding the}} evaluation of the relationship between check <b>and</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms <b>and</b> trust. On the one hand, it is assumed that check <b>and</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms are interlaced with trust and thus are not mutually exclusive. Möllering [48], however, believes in the duality rather than the dualism of check <b>and</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms <b>and</b> trust. According to him, the check <b>and</b> <b>control</b> mechanism of a system may be the prerequisite of trust and, in turn, the trust in the system may encourage the trust in its checks <b>and</b> <b>control.</b> Indeed, a system is trusted because it provides mechanisms of checks <b>and</b> <b>control.</b> By extension, the control mechanisms are also trusted [see also 49, 50]. Nooteboom [36] arranges trust <b>and</b> checks <b>and</b> <b>control</b> in a time sequence by assuming that trust becomes necessary when checks <b>and</b> <b>control</b> end [ibid.: 4]. Luhmann [1], in contrast, expresses a more radical view by saying that the transparency created through checks <b>and</b> <b>control</b> does not require trust at all. If, on the other hand, checks <b>and</b> <b>control</b> are taken as statements of mistrust, they gain, according to Luhmann [ibid.: 113], a system-stabilising function: “Whether systems are trusted … may … decisively depend on whether trust is suspended at critical points and mistrust is applied”. 3 With regard to trust towards institutions, Shapiro [50] argues that the checks <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of these institutions might set off a spiral of mistrust [ibid.: 652]. On the other hand, trust <b>and</b> checks <b>and</b> <b>control</b> are regarded as compatible with each other. Hartmann [37], for example, assumes that those who have trust do not need monitoring <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> will do without. Luhmann [1 : 26] says that it is contradictory “to the function and style of trust to demand or offer detailed factual information and expert proof” [see also 4].|$|R
