25|$|One of the 1960 Stock trains {{is still}} owned by LUL and remains in use as track <b>recording</b> <b>unit,</b> running with a 1973 Stock centre trailer. The {{original}} 1960 track recording cars were scrapped because of asbestos contamination, {{and two of}} the retired motor cars were converted to replace them. A second unit is owned by Cravens Heritage Trains. It is kept at Ruislip depot, and has been used for railtours and filming work since it was purchased in 1995.|$|E
25|$|After that, {{he decided}} to record his second album in Ireland and his guest musicians {{included}} Irvine, Lunny, and uilleann piper Liam O'Flynn. The album, Prosperous, was recorded by Bill Leader who had brought his mobile <b>recording</b> <b>unit</b> (a Revox tape machine and two microphones) to Ireland {{in the summer of}} 1971. Rehearsals took place at Irvine's flat in Dublin and the recordings were made in Prosperous, County Kildare, down in the cellar of Downings House, owned by Moore's sister and brother-in-law, Anne and Davoc Rynne.|$|E
25|$|The word {{processor}} was a stand-alone office {{machine in the}} 1960s, combining the keyboard text-entry and printing functions of an electric typewriter with a <b>recording</b> <b>unit,</b> either tape or floppy disk (as used by the Wang machine) with a simple dedicated computer processor for the editing of text. Although features and designs varied among manufacturers and models, and new features were added as technology advanced, {{word processor}}s typically featured a monochrome display {{and the ability to}} save documents on memory cards or diskettes. Later models introduced innovations such as spell-checking programs, and improved formatting options.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{costs were}} {{estimated}} at , {{which included the}} illumination of the cliffs, a mobile sound <b>recording</b> <b>unit,</b> and a helicopter to film aerial footage. With U2 only able to invest $30,000, Fey agreed to help finance the project, along with Island Records. A joint production company called [...] "U2 at Red Rocks Associates" [...] was subsequently established to fund the filming; the three parties split costs and shared profits from television rights and video sales. The radio rights were sold to American radio network NBC for inclusion in their concert series The Source. Throughout the United States leg of their War Tour, U2 filled venues with capacities {{similar to that of}} Red Rocks, leading the band to anticipate that the filming would take place before a sold-out audience and that the concert's revenues would help to offset production costs.|$|E
500|$|Rick Danko {{recalled}} that he, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson joined Robbie Robertson in West Saugerties, {{a few miles}} from Woodstock, in February 1967. The three of them moved into a house on Stoll Road nicknamed [...] "Big Pink"; Robertson lived nearby with his future wife, Dominique. Danko and Manuel had been invited to Woodstock to collaborate with Dylan on a film he was editing, Eat the Document, a rarely seen account of Dylan's 1966 world tour. At some point between March and June 1967, Dylan and the four Hawks began a series of informal recording sessions, initially at the so-called Red Room of Dylan's house, Hi Lo Ha, in the Byrdcliffe area of Woodstock. In June, the recording sessions moved to the basement of Big Pink. Hudson set up a <b>recording</b> <b>unit,</b> using two stereo mixers and a tape recorder borrowed from Grossman, as well as a set of microphones on loan from folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary. Dylan would later tell Jann Wenner, [...] "That's really the way to do a recording—in a peaceful, relaxed setting—in somebody's basement. With the windows open ... and a dog lying on the floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 October 1948, RDF {{broadcast}} Schaeffer's Etude aux chemins de fer. This was {{the first}} [...] "movement" [...] of Cinq études de bruits, and {{marked the beginning of}} studio realizations and musique concrète (or acousmatic art). Schaeffer employed a disk-cutting lathe, four turntables, a four-channel mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile <b>recording</b> <b>unit.</b> Not long after this, Henry began collaborating with Schaeffer, a partnership that would have profound and lasting effects on the direction of electronic music. Another associate of Schaeffer, Edgard Varèse, began work on Déserts, a work for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer's studio, and were later revised at Columbia University.|$|E

2500|$|The trains {{were used}} as a {{test-bed}} for automatic train operation, where control signals were picked up from the running rails, and all control of the moving train, apart from the initial command to start when leaving a station, was managed by a [...] "black box" [...] controller. The Woodford to Hainault section of the Central line was used for these tests, {{in preparation for the}} introduction of the system on the Victoria line when it opened. In 1986, three trains were converted back for manual operation, and a 3-car unit worked the peak-only Epping to Ongar shuttle service, until that line closed in 1994. One train still works as a track <b>recording</b> <b>unit,</b> while a second is in private ownership and has been used for railtours on the Underground.|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for The Loudest Engine {{took place at}} the Killers' Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas, from September to October 2010. The album was recorded with a Studer A820 2" [...] 24-track reel-to-reel analogue tape machine. 00:07, c 3:00, d 1:25, e3:23. After Joel insisted that the album be recorded to tape, Stoermer sought and acquired the <b>recording</b> <b>unit.</b> The band decided to not record anything that they could not perform live, referring to their last album Radio Wars, which was very electronically oriented. Members of the band stated that they had a lot more freedom than ever before in the studio, {{which is one of the}} reasons they chose Stoermer as a producer. They knew as a musician that he understood the importance of letting a band just play music instead of pressuring them to push their instrument or sound elsewhere. Stoermer researched autobiographies of record producers, including the book, Recording The Beatles, to use as technical reference points for recording the album.|$|E

40|$|This thesis has {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} the punitive turn and the crime policies of the Green party (Miljöpartiet de Gröna) and the Sweden democrats (Sverigedemokraterna) to answer the research question; what influence the punitive turn has had on the parties policies.

From an account of the punitive turn has a word-list with <b>recording</b> <b>units</b> been created, of those <b>recording</b> <b>units</b> has a computer-search been made of the two parties most recent official documents which accounts for the parties holistic politics; MP´s Partyprogramme from 2013, and SD´s Principleprogramme from 2011. The result of the qualitative complementarity shows; a greater frequency of <b>recording</b> <b>units</b> for MP than for SD. The analysis of the qualitative facilitation-result shows; a lesser direct influence of the punitive turn for MP than for SD. The result and analysis are discussed regarding whether the research question has been answered, and no such conclusion is considered to be made by the researcher, instead are the result and analysis open for interpretation of the reader...|$|R
