50|$|Following {{the victory}} of the Popular Front at the 1936 {{legislative}} elections, Léo Lagrange was then named under-secretary of State for Sport and given responsibility for the organisation of Leisure, under the authority of the Minister for Public Health Henri Sellier. It {{was the first time that}} France had such a state secretary, and the Popular Front enacted the first paid holidays (2 weeks), among other social reforms. His mandate was not addressed exclusively to youth but to all of society. He was focused nevertheless on the young because they constituted the future of society. Léo Lagrange strongly opposed the fascist model of sport, which transformed it into a substitute for belligerent activities and instrumentalized it in a militarist manner. To the contrary, Léo Lagrange advocated a conception of sports based on anti-militarism and on the fulfillment of individual personality:“… It cannot be a question in a democratic country of militarizing the distractions and the pleasures of the masses and of transforming the joy skillfully distributed into a means of not thinking.” He dedicated himself in developing sporting, tourist and cultural leisure, but he opposed the professionalisation of sports, creating an elitist caste of sportsmen, and was against their development in France. He was at the origin of the creation of the popular leisure pass which grants 40% of reduction on <b>rail-bound</b> transports, while he encouraged and impelled the movement of youth hostels. 1936 in France was witness, under the Popular Front, to the first departures towards snow resorts with special trains and reduced fares on the cable cars; popular cruises were also later introduced. Léo Lagrange also played a major role in the co-organisation of the People's Olympiad in Barcelona with the Spanish Second Republic. Nazi Germany had managed to gain the right to organise the Olympic Games in Berlin, against Barcelona, but anti-fascists refused to participate in these Games and went on with their own project. The trials for these popular Olympiads proceeded on 4 July 1936 in the Pershing stadium in Paris, which had been built in June 1919. Léo Lagrange chaired these days in person, along with Minister of Transport Pierre Cot, André Malraux, who later fought in the International Brigades, and other figures of the Popular Front. Through their club, the FSGT, or individually, 1.200 French athletes were registered with these anti-fascist Olympiads.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Self-optimizing {{mechatronic}} {{systems are}} {{a new class of}} technical systems which are able to autonomously reason about their objectives and to select appropriate behavior adaptations with regard to their current environment and changing requirements. Obviously, reasoning and changing the system’s behavior during operation is a time critical task. Thus, it is usually not possible to explore all possible behaviors and evaluate them regarding various objectives. To reduce this effort, the set of nondominated solutions, the Pareto set, can be computed in advance and thus the effort of adapting the system behavior is reduced to a decision making process. This paper introduces a search based approach to approximate the Pareto set with a multi objective search algorithm. The algorithm is designed for the management of a hybrid energy storage module in a <b>rail-bound</b> vehicle where the two contradicting objectives of maximizing the power reserve to maintain robust against unexpected power peaks and minimizing the deterioration of the storages have to be optimized simultaneously.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the influence of reliability of urban public transport services on network evaluation and network design. Public transport services suffer from all kind of disturbances, varying demand patterns, weather conditions, incidents, road works, et cetera. Current practice uses all kinds of operational measures to ensure the quality of the services despite of these disturbances. In network evaluation and network design, however, reliability is usually not considered. The research presents an extensive overview of phenomena affecting public transport service quality, as well as a framework and instrument to determine the influence of the network on reliability indicators and the total network performance. Using case studies a number of measures is analysed with respect to their effectiveness. This research demonstrates that already at the level of public transport service network design there are possibilities to improve service reliability: for example networks in which travellers have multiple options to travel to their destination and networks in which line lengths are limited. However, it is dependent on the specific situation whether this will lead to an improvement of the overall network performance as well. For <b>rail-bound</b> public transportation, for instance tram, is proves to be possible to implement smart infrastructure measures, for instance turning facilities and shortcuts, to improve both service reliability and total network performance.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} and competitiveness of rail transportation depends on safety {{and availability of}} single highly loaded components. Until now they have been replaced in fixed maintenance intervals irrespective of any usage related conditions. Knowing the component status, life cycle costs could be reduced by means of optimized maintenance and/or "fit for purpose" design. For example, <b>rail-bound</b> vehicle wheel sets {{are among the most}} highly stressed traveling gear components of the bogie. When such a component fails, a serious accident may occur. A health monitoring system based on the interpretation of ultrasonic signatures has been developed.

40|$|Double graduation. Second faculty is: Technology, Policy and Management. Department: Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics. Disruptions {{in public}} transport, if not {{properly}} addressed, can have consequent impacts on passengers, {{but also on}} public transport operators, translating into revenue loss. Yet so far, both operators and researchers have mainly focused {{on the supply side}} first (timetable, crews and rolling stock), before passengers. In this study, an assessment framework allowing for multiple service control strategies to be assessed and then compared for one given disruption from a passenger perspective is developed. It focuses on the incident phase, i. e. the phase {{from the start of the}} incident until the cause of the disruption is resolved. A case study in the metro of Rotterdam, operated by the RET, is used to test the framework. It reveals that there is room for improvement at the traffic control centre of the RET. On a yearly basis, savings in terms of societal costs could amount to approximately 900 K€, if every disruption similar to the case study is handled like in the best case scenario, deemed reasonably implementable by experts at the RET. There are two main takeaways for public transport operators. First, during the incident phase, a regularity paradigm benefits best passengers than a punctuality paradigm, thus impacting the way traffic controllers work. Second, pre-planned service control strategies in urban, <b>rail-bound</b> public transport systems need to have a variant for peak hours. The framework was thus successfully developed and can be used by other operators.

40|$|In recent years, {{considerable}} {{effort has}} been spent at a European level to establish comprehensive methods for the experimental assessment of rolling noise emission of <b>rail-bound</b> vehicles and tracks. This work was concentrated in the European METARAIL and STAIRRS projects. The objective of these was to improve the accuracy and the reproducibility of pass-by noise measurements compared to the standards that were current at that time. A further aim was to develop experimental methods separately to identify the contributions to rolling noise of the vehicles and the tracks. In these projects, measurement methods were developed that could determine the combined wheel/rail roughness and the ‘transfer functions’ for the vehicle and the track, that is, the separate noise contributions per unit roughness. The roughness and transfer function spectra provide a powerful basis by which vehicles and tracks can be characterized by measurement, to a high extent, independent of the running speed and site conditions. Such {{a description of the}} track and rolling stock allows the prediction of rolling noise spectra for different combinations of vehicles and track from those at which the characteristics have been measured. The measurement effort is limited; only straightforward one-third octave band measurements of pass-by sound pressure and vertical railhead vibration are needed. This paper describes the method, giving the derivation of the calculation by which the roughness levels, transfer function spectra levels and the vibration decay rates in the track are determined from the measured quantities. Typical results are shown. Among other applications, the method allows fast assessment of wheel roughness for whole vehicles or trains, speed-independent assessment of the effectiveness of track and vehicle noise control measures and the separation of rolling noise from noise due to other sources...|$|E
40|$|In modern storing {{technology}} High-Bay Warehouses are {{of great}} importance due to their large capacity by combining relatively small floor area with random access on all units, a large band-width with respect to weight and measurement of the storage good and the simplicity of integration in the logistical peripheries. The storage and retrieval operations are usually performed by automated <b>rail-bound</b> storage at retrieval machines, or types of manual floor-travelling fork-lifts for High-Bay Warehouses. Particularly by automated high-bay warehouse systems, {{a high degree of}} positioning accuracy is a basic requirement for sufficient reliability. The aim of this work is to investigate the essential elements required for improving the positional accuracy with reference to the various influential parameters. The influential parameters are wearout, tolerance, static and dynamic deformation of the storage and retrieval machine, as well as the tolerance and static deformations of the rack structure or travel and guide rails. Another basic parameter is the positional aberation at the centring location. To study the qualities of positioning systems, an experimental model was conceived and constructed allowing the emulation of the vibration of the wing unit of storage and retrieval machines. Theoretical calculations as well as the experimental results show that both the vibration level of the column of signle mast machines and the vertical vibrations of the lifting carriage can be simulated with adequate precision. Various arrangements of positioning systems were compared with respect to the expected qualities. One arrangement based upon a laser positional transducer was chosen, built, and investigated {{with the help of the}} developed experimental model. A high positioning accuracy of this positioning system was verified-which was almost independent of all the enumerated influential parameters. (orig.)

40|$|Since 1897, {{when first}} plans evolved in Dresden, {{the city and}} its {{self-conscious}} inhabitants have been attracted to the utopian idea of an underground <b>rail-bound</b> rapid mass transit. In 5 waves throughout 4 different political epochs plans were worked up to implement such form of transport. While some reasons remained the same - offering quick reliable connections, or supporting the territorial integration of the growing (sub-) urban catchment area - other project parameters changed with societal systems and technological advance. To name and explain some important ones are the population density, urban design principles with regard to transportation, construction solutions in the water permeable soil of the Elbe river valley, the advance of Intelligent Transporation Systems to replace "concrete by bytes", or the organisation of public transport bodies. Not to forget the soft aspects of prestige and the old Saxonian rivalty with Leipzig. Nowadays, 120 years after, the only underground section is short, far off the center and was never included in the original plans. Instead a succesful dense tramway network and a nearly extended S-Bahn track cover the mobility needs of many of its 540, 000 + citizens. After all, might the way to a liveable, sustainable city like Dresden be even easier having avoided the Dystopia named U-Bahn? External comparisons with other (West German) cities having built rail tunnels from the 60 's on, and internally with the existing Dresden public transport system suggest this thesis. Costs and door-to-door travelling times, amongst others, are used as indicators.

40|$|Among {{policy-makers}} in Europe the {{modal shift}} - a shift från polluting modes of freight transport to less polluting modes - {{has been a}} popular suggestion for reducing CO 2 -emissions of transportation. In particular, intermodal road-rail solutions, where a combination of road and rail transport is utilized to move trailers and containers, have been stressed as an important measure to reach de desired reduction in emissions. However, {{looking back at the}} development over the last twenty years, no shift to <b>rail-bound</b> transport can be seen. for example, the share of <b>rail-bound</b> transport has decreased. There are several potential explanations to the absence of modal shift. Often, the supply-side is held responsible, with rail operators offering too low quality due to lack of standards, lack of proactivity, and general infrastructure and transport system deficiencies. Others claim the non-existent shift dependson inertia on the demand-side. Innovations on the transport market are driven by the demand-side customers {{and as long as the}} demand-side is not willing to make any adjustments to better fit the supply-side's offers, no shift will occur. Arguably, both underdeveloped service production and demand side inertia create barriers to realize the political ambitions of the EU. But supply- and demand-side problems cannot be discussed in isolation: low service quality leads to low demand and with low demand there are little incentives to invest in quality. On the intermodal transport market (and much of the trucking market as well), supply and demand is matched in contractual relations. These contracts affect the incentives of the players, and from the economics and supply chain management literature it is well known that badly designed contracts and incentives may lead to sub-optimization and double-marginalization effects, including lower production levels and less total profit than what would have been optimal. Therefore, instead of focusing on aggregate behaviour, this research approaches the modal shift by investigating t he contract that governs the sale and purchase of these services. The purpose, is to build a model to explore the currently used contracts on the intermodal market, explain how these contracts may have affected the modal shift, and explore how changes in the contracts and market conditions could increase the share of intermodal transport. The purpose is approached through a research process in which the findings from two company cases, Bring Frigo and Volvo Logistics, are used to model the system. We consider a situation in which a Service Provider approaches an Intermodal Operator to build the service capacity that the service provider can use to satisfy demand created by the upstream Shippers. The system is then modeled as a one-period, continuous, newsvendor modal with fixed costs associated with each train put into operation. Any demand which cannot be satisfied by the intermodal operator is handled by a truck carrier. Contrary to the trucking market, the Operator is the leader in our Stackelberg game, in which the Service Provider decides upon the final modal mix. It is found in the cases that the operators tend to have a strict production focus, preferring to transfer the responsibility of filling the train to the service provider. Since the service providers are used to having very low fixed costs (no own assets), they claim that this way of selling the capacity inhibits the possibilities to increase the rail-share of their modal mix. In the model, we therefore investigate two possible ways to contract the capacity: 1) through a unit price per trailer, in which an arbitrary number of trailers is sold to the service provider at a unit price per trailer, and 2) with a service charge per train, in which the operator charges a fixed rate for operating each train, leaving the responsibility to fill the train to the service provider. The research characterizes these contracts and show that the operator prefers a per-train charge in most instances: the production focus in inherent with the current market structure. It is also shown that the per-train type of payment coordinates the system in several instances and thus outperforms the unit price preferred by the operator. In that, the production focus has no negative impact in the modal mix in these instances. However, none of the contract types can guarantee coordination, leading to lower total profits than optimal. We therefore show how a three-part tariff, in which the operator charges a unit cost per trailer, a service charge per train, and a wealth-transferring component, can achieve full coordination. Such a contract may however be difficult to implement due to its complexity. Analysis with the model shows that policy measures such as a general carbon tax under some circumstances may increase the amount of intermodal capacity although this may not always be the case due to decentralized decision-making. Measures aiming at reducing the financial risks of the markets, such as allowing longer trains, reducing slot-fees, or introducing a well-functioning spor-market may more easily achieve a higher intermodal share. In that, the research provides insight on the mechanisms on the micro-level that may affect the realization of the political visions, with implications for operators and service providers as well as policy-makers. In particular, the semi-fixed cost structure of the intermodal investment has been poorly addressed in the past, and by analyzing the impact this has on the capacity investment, the study builds on previos research on green logistics, as well as mode choice, capacity management, and supply chain contracting. Finally suggestions for future research along the four potential paths are discussed: empirical research to understand the actual rather complex market; relax model assumptions regarding number of time periods, compliance regime, private information, hidden actions and risk aversion; include more players as shippers and infra structure owners; and compare results with other service markets very capacity is "lumpy"...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe TGM (Tunis-Goulette-Marsa) is {{a railway}} line which connects Tunis with Marsa while passing by Goulette. The first {{electrified}} suburban {{line of the}} African continent, bears officially the name of TGM since 1905, date of the inauguration of the first direct layout through the Tunis Lake. In fact well the TGM was at {{the origin of the}} Tunis extension of towards north creating in sea front, the most attractive suburbs of the capital. We propose to put the projector on this railway line characteristics and the architectural specificities of its stations, in an historical and contemporary aiming, in order to direct the Tunisian urban developers towards the interests of the railway heritage and to feed the current reflexion on Tunisian urban space and the <b>rail-bound</b> transports. Indeed, to follow the evolution of the suburban railroad statutes contributes to an awareness of the city as a significant space. The reading of urban space is not limited to architectural forms, it is also organized by its means of transports. Instead of getting lost in a total, general and reducing definition of the northern Tunis suburbs identity, we will target the place of the railway identity of an area in its total identity. More precisely, we think that the Railway stations are urban entities which knew how to generate their own temporal culture, and where it is urgent to study the “lifespan” of its identity impact. Line TGM is punctuated by stations which preserved the original néo-Moorish style with a repair in 1979, but today, a harmony loss with surrounding urban fabric is clearly perceptible. These stations are directly active in the production of the suburbs regional identity but are locked up and are not any more transformed to constitute a different universe being used as developing reference. The TGM myth does not exist any more but only in books. With the accelerated urbanization and use of cars, those which take it are stripped and do not have any idea of its history. This micro-regional identity can, through a particular form of development, overcome the challenges of urban developments which tend to asphyxiate it and destroy it. On a methodological level, it is a question to write an identifying monograph of a space, on the one hand, by exploring its endogenous memory, and on the other hand, by focusing on contemporary uses and practical. We will carry a new glance on urban, architectural, technical, economic and social potentialities of TGM line and stations. We will emphasize the permanence of historical indices which are continuously secreted. The results will consolidate the assumption that the railway line identity and architectural potential must be better taken into Tunisian urban space reflexions. The relations which we establish between railway identity, architectural identity and social identity, is a transverse reading which makes possible a better control of increasing contradictions between the areas modernization and their urban identity...|$|E
