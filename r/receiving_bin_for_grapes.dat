In the case of citrus, ripe fruit with a greenish tint is placed in special storage rooms where ethylene gas is used {{to bring out the}} color. Obvious [...] "culls" [...] (fruit that is not suitable to sell for eating due to cosmetic defects) is removed and sold for juice or other uses. Fruit that is ready to be packed into crates or flats is run through a washer and then air-dried. A light coating of natural wax is applied to help the fruit retain moisture and enhance its appeal.|$|R

30|$|Since HD {{is mainly}} used <b>for</b> <b>grape</b> vine {{irrigation}} and that grape plants {{are sensitive to}} EC, Na+ and Cl− (Tanji and Kielen 2002; Stevens et al., 2012); this study specifically assessed HD water suitability <b>for</b> <b>grape</b> irrigation. From EC parameter, HD water for both wet and dry seasons were unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>grape</b> irrigation while based on Cl−, only HD sample for dry season was unsuitable (Table  1). High salinity affects vine productivity by reducing their capability to take up water and eventually via physical damages when the conc. of ions reach toxic levels (Pitt and Stevens 2012).These results generally challenge the main objective of HIS and can be among the reasons <b>for</b> reported poor <b>grape</b> productivity in Hombolo suburb (FGDs). Similarly, owing to high salinity in many SDWs, farmers and herders in Nzuguni, Kitelela, Mahoma Nyika and Mahoma Makulu diverted runoff into some SDWs so as to dilute the salinity and make them suitable for irrigation, livestock and domestic uses (Field observations and FGDs).|$|R
