50|$|An ongoing {{problem with}} the engines was their {{propensity}} for surging or stalling with 68 incidents reported between 2003 and October 2016 though this rate had reduced after {{the introduction of the}} Block 3 engine version. The US Naval Air Systems Command intends to award Rolls Royce two contracts to examine the effectiveness of proposed reliability improvements, the first is a software tweak to the engine management software for the compressor guide vanes that internal testing showed could improve surge margin by 0.8% at sea level and 3% at altitude. The second is the discovery that a temperature sensor at the inlet of the compressor sends incorrect readings leading to 2.5% out of 4% steady power shortfall at the compressors correct rotational speed again correctable with a software fix. In addition Bell-Boeing are developing an inlet barrier system to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>loss</b> from the engine ingesting dust and sand particles to supplement the engines existing centrifugal based particle separators as they {{can only do so much}} to improve the quality of air they receive.|$|E
50|$|An {{engineering}} {{option was}} designed to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>loss</b> due to engine radiator fan operation and to increase the heat available for heating of the passengers. After experiments by Wing-Commander T.R. Cave-Browne-Cave (CBC), Professor of Engineering at Southampton University, a satisfactory design was produced. The 'CBC' system involved two small engine radiators being placed above the driver's cab roof level at the front outer corners of the double deck to give maximum aerodynamic air flow. The engine coolant water was pumped around these instead of the traditional radiator. In cold weather, all or {{a portion of the}} air passing through these radiators, was diverted by flaps, the left into the upper saloon and the right to the lower deck. In hot weather, the flaps could be changed by push-pull levers in the driver's cab roof to divert all the hot air to the outside of the vehicle. The movement of the vehicle was (usually) adequate to cool the engine without the need for a fan or radiator at the traditional position in front of the engine. The traditional 'radiator' grille {{at the front of the}} vehicle was not required, but was usually retained (with a few exceptions) and blanked off behind. 'Varivane' wax capsule operated shutters were fitted in front of the upper radiators to keep the coolant at optimum temperature. There were some disadvantages to the scheme and eventually customers stopped specifying it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} {{hysteresis}} band (HB) current control technique to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> in a shunt active lter. During a switching {{period in the}} zero-crossing region, the inverter output current ows through a transistor. By changing the direction, it ows through the free-wheeling diode of the same switch in an inverter leg, or vice versa. The shunt active lter current typically has 6 zero-crossing regions during a fundamental frequency cycle.
