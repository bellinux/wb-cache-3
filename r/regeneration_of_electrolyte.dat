The {{role played}} by the counter {{electrode}} (CE) in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) is crucial: it is indeed responsible for catalyzing the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the redox <b>electrolyte</b> after its action to take back the oxidized light harvesters to the ground state, thus keeping the device active and stable. The activity of CE is moreover directly related to the fill factor and short circuit current through the resistance of the interface electrode-electrolyte that affects the series resistance of the cell. Despite that, too few efforts have been devoted to a comprehensive analysis of this important device component. In this work we combine an extensive electrochemical characterization of the most common materials exploited as CEs in QDSSCs (namely, Pt, Au, Cu 2 S obtained by brass treatment, and Cu 2 S deposited on conducting glass via spray) with a detailed characterization of their surface composition and morphology, aimed at systematically defining the relationship between their nature and electrocatalytic activit...|$|R

Our study reveals {{the possibility of a}} favorable electron transfer from the excited dye to the semiconductor conduction band (CB) and suggests three possible pathways of the electron injection from the dye to the nanoparticle (TiO 2) (38).

The influence <b>of</b> the <b>electrolyte</b> composition on the geometric and electronic features of the dye/TiO 2 system has also been studied.

More recently Grumwald put forward a theory in which the effect <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> on the initial as well as the transition state was considered to be important. Experimental support for the latter theory was rather weak as it consisted solely of results obtained using different organic compounds for the solubility and rate determinations (the solubility data showing the effect <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> on the initial state).

40|$|Abstract: The {{articular}} disc in the temporomandibular joint {{plays an}} important role in mandibular growth. Functional appliances induce <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle even after condylectomy. The aim of this study was to examine the role of the articular disc in <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle after unilateral condylectomy with use of a functional appliance in growing rats. Fifty growing rats were subjected to unilateral condylectomy and then half of them underwent discectomy. The functional appliance was applied to half of the rats in each group to induce <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle. Four and eight weeks later, morphometric and histologic analyses of the mandible were performed. <b>Regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle was demonstrated in the two condylectomy groups. In the condylectomy+appliance group, the shape and cartilage of the condyle were equivalent to a normal condyle. However, <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle was not observed in the two discectomy groups even with the use of the functional appliance. The articular disc appears to be crucial in the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> a damaged condyle, suggesting that defects or damage to the articular disc may influence mandibular growth and <b>regeneration</b> or repair <b>of</b> the condyle.
