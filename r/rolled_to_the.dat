5|$|In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, {{operated}} by a Boeing 767, crashed after the left engine thrust reverser deployed in-flight for reasons {{that could not be}} determined. The crash of a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the thrust reverser on No. 2 engine. The aircraft <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right and crashed in a populated area of São Paulo, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Today, silver bullion has the ISO 4217 {{currency}} code XAG, {{one of only}} four precious metals to have one (the others being palladium, platinum, and gold). Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> correct thickness, heat-treated, and then used to cut blanks from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8000 silver coins per hour.|$|E
5|$|Due to the missed field goal, Air Force {{took over}} from {{the point at which}} the kick was missed, the 27-yard line. Despite gaining a bit of {{momentum}} when they kept Virginia Tech from scoring, the Falcons were unable to gain a first down and went three and out, punting the ball away. Tech declined to return the ball, which <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech three-yard line, where the Hokies' offense took over. On the first play after the punt, Tech's Nigel Bowe fumbled the ball, which was leapt upon by several Air Force defenders, who recovered it. After the fumble recovery, it took the Falcons just one play to score a touchdown and gain a 107 lead.|$|E

5|$|These flights covered {{performance}} tests {{such as we}} do on planes undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed weaknesses of the Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics... immediately apparent {{was the fact that}} the ailerons froze up at speeds above 200 knots so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the control stick. It <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative acceleration due to its float-type carburetor. We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: Go into a vertical power dive, using negative acceleration if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the acceleration. At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.|$|E
25|$|On 9 November 2012, BFL509, a Curtiss C-46A (C-GTXW), {{landed at}} Yellowknife Airport {{and when it}} <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> runway 16/34 intersection, the left main landing gear collapsed. The {{aircraft}} then {{came to rest on}} the left wing and suffered substantial damage. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service. The cause of the accident was that a hammer, lodged between the inboard drag strut and sliding member, caused the landing gear to collapse.|$|E
25|$|The {{preliminary}} report, {{issued on}} 16 March 2011, {{stated that the}} aircraft, being flown by the co-pilot, had deviated from the runway centre-line on final approach and that the crew decided to execute a third go-around four seconds before impact. The aircraft <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left and to the right, and the right wing then impacted the runway. No deficiencies in the aircraft or the airfield infrastructure were identified. The report did not include any findings.|$|E

25|$|Various {{tests are}} performed, {{and then the}} vehicle is rolled {{horizontally}} to the pad, where the Fixed Pad Erector (FPE) is used to raise the vehicle to the vertical position, inside the MST. At this time, the GEM-60 solid motors, if any are required, are <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pad and attached to the vehicle. After further testing, the payload (which has already been enclosed in its fairing) is transported to the pad, hoisted into the MST by a crane, and attached to the vehicle. Finally, on launch day, the MST is rolled away from the vehicle, and the vehicle is ready for launch.|$|E
25|$|One witness {{interviewed by}} the NTSB, a pilot driving on a road {{southwest}} of the airport, told investigators that he saw the airplane in normal flight at normal altitudes, and that {{he believed that the}} approach was not abnormal. The airplane completed a 180-degree turn from the downwind leg of the approach and continued the turn. He then saw the aircraft pitch slightly, before it <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left until the wings were vertical. The airplane then turned nose-down and smashed into the ground. He saw no fire or smoke during the flight and he believed both propellers were rotating.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the vehicle}} is a Launch Table, with six Tail Service Masts (TSMs), two for each CBC. The Launch Table {{supports}} the vehicle on the pad, and the TSMs provide further support and fueling functions for the CBCs. The vehicle is mounted to the Launch Table by a Launch Mate Unit (LMU), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle by bolts that sever at launch. Behind the Launch Table is a Fixed Pad Erector (FPE), which uses two long-stroke hydraulic pistons to raise the vehicle to the vertical position after being <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pad from the Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF). Beneath the Launch Table is a flame duct, which deflects the rocket's exhaust away from the rocket or facilities.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{majority}} of the interviewed witnesses, the airplane suddenly <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left until the wings were perpendicular to the ground. The aircraft then descended in a nose-down attitude and disappeared from sight behind trees near the airport. One witness told investigators that they saw a puff of smoke emanate from the aircraft prior to or subsequent to the airplane rolling to the left. Others reported loud engine noises described as a squeal, whine, or an overspeeding or accelerating engine during the last moments of the flight, although they said that these noises seemed to have stopped, or at least faded before the aircraft impacted with flat ground two miles short of the runway.|$|E
25|$|UCLA {{opened the}} scoring when running back Greg Jones {{scored on a}} 12-yard run. Sophomore Zenon Andrusyshyn kicked the extra point to make it 7–0. After a USC punt, Beban had the Bruins on the move again at the USC 41-yard line. The next play, Beban took a one step drop, <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, and faked a {{sideline}} pass to the right, then wheeled around and blindly threw a pass in the left flat intended for running back Greg Jones. However, USC linebacker Pat Cashman was not fooled by the fake {{to the right and}} jumped in front of Jones to take an interception return 55 yards for a USC touchdown. Rikki Aldridge kicked the extra point to tie the game. While O.J. Simpson's 64-yard run became famous, this play by Cashman turned the game around.|$|E

25|$|The {{recorded}} {{data shows}} that the No. 1 engine reached a minimum torque level of −9% in Beta range, while No. 2 engine reached a minimum of 0%. This thrust asymmetry was coincident with the aircraft commencing a <b>roll</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left (maximum recorded value of 40 degrees bank). It {{is possible that the}} PF may have made a control wheel input <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unanticipated left <b>roll.</b> However, without FDR parameters of control wheel or control surface position the Investigation could not determine if such an input was made. The subsequent application of power <b>to</b> commence <b>the</b> go-around, at approximately 100 feet, coincided with the commencement of a rapid <b>roll</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right and loss of control. The roll continued through the vertical, the right wingtip struck the runway and the aircraft inverted.|$|R

25|$|During {{the final}} flare to land, the plane <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, landed hard on its right main gear and the No. 3 engine touched the runway. The right wing {{separated}} from the fuselage. The aircraft continued to roll over and skidded off the runway in flames. When it stopped, it was on its back and {{the rear of the}} plane was on fire, coming to rest on a grass area next to the runway, 1,100 m from the runway threshold. The right wing was found on a taxiway 90 meters from the nose of the plane. As shown in photos of the aircraft at rest, the fire caused significant damage to the rear section of the aircraft but was quickly extinguished due to the heavy rain and quick response from rescue teams in the airport.|$|E
25|$|Aboard the Boeing, {{the crew}} was {{preparing}} for arrival at JFK International, flying in clear air above an overcast sky with good visibility as they approached Carmel. The aircraft was being flown on autopilot with altitude-hold engaged, and the pilot, Capt. Thomas H. Carroll, had his left hand on the control yoke. On seeing an aircraft at his 10 o'clock position on {{what appeared to be}} a collision course, he immediately disengaged the autopilot, put the wheel hard over to the right, and pulled back on the yoke. His copilot, First Officer Leo M. Smith, also grabbed the controls and acted together with him. The aircraft <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right and it became apparent that this maneuver would not allow the two aircraft to pass clear of each other, so Carroll and Smith attempted to reverse the wheel to the left and pushed on the yoke. Before the aircraft could react to the control reversal, two shocks were felt and the Boeing entered a steep dive; the Boeing's left wing had struck the tail of the Constellation and both aircraft were out of control.|$|E
500|$|The coast watchers {{landed at}} 19:50, {{the same time}} the MTBs {{reported}} sighting of two enemy [...] "destroyers" [...] sailing south—in fact the two corvettes. Using radar, the corvettes detected the destroyers on their port side at 20:15 and ordered general quarters, while UJ 202 fired two star shells. The crew of R 187 saw this as she followed the corvettes from afar. The destroyers engaged the German corvettes at 20:20, at a position due west of Lun on the island of Pag, assigning a corvette each as a target. The first British salvos scored hits on the corvettes, using their [...] guns, from a distance of [...] UJ 202 was hit directly by several shots, knocking out its [...] gun, a bow-mounted quadruple [...] gun, and a stern-mounted [...] gun. Her bridge and radio room were also hit. She continued to return fire while attempting to sail to Rab. UJ 208 was also quickly hit, and its [...] and bow-mounted [...] guns were knocked out of action. Her crew managed to put out fire on her stern, but another blaze amidships blocked all communications between the forward and aft sections of the vessel. By 20:30, she <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> port and began sinking. UJ 202 sank at 21:00.|$|E

500|$|The next {{match was}} for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship between The Undertaker and Edge. The match went {{in and out of}} the ring early on, with both {{competitors}} throwing each other out of the ring. The Undertaker instinctively tried to apply the triangle choke hold on Edge, but the referee made him break the hold. Edge then tried to do one of Undertaker's moves, Old school, but Undertaker countered. Mid-way in the match, Edge's associates, Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder, distracted Undertaker after performing an Old school on Edge. This distraction led Edge to remove the top turnbuckle padding. Back and forth action was seen between the two individuals. As the top turnbuckle was exposed, the Undertaker executed Snake Eyes on Edge. As the Undertaker ran off the ropes, Edge performed a Spear for a near-fall. Afterwards, the Undertaker clotheslined Edge to the outside of the ring, then <b>rolled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor after. Undertaker threw Edge over the barricade to the front row with a clothesline while the referee began the 10-count. Both men struggled back to the floor and the Undertaker tackled Edge into the barricade at the eight count. He then rolled into the ring to win the match by countout and the belt. After the match, Vickie Guerrero announced that Undertaker hadn't won the title as it can only be won by pinfall or submission, leaving the title vacant. Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Edge.|$|E
