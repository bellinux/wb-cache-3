40|$|The {{evolution}} of multiple sexual traits remains controversial and poorly understood in evolutionary biology. In many bird species, males exhibit complex courtships involving feather ornaments and behavioral display. Multiple traits may convey {{information on the}} genetic and phenotypic quality of males. In particular, fixed characters, such as feather ornaments (produced once a year during the annual molt in many bird species) might convey information about past male condition (at the time of trait development); whereas flexible traits such as behavioral displays should be sensitive to present condition. Here we show that both flexible behavioral displays and fixed feather ornaments of peacocks, used by females to choose a mate, honestly reflect health status. Correlative data showed that peacocks with high display rate (the number of behavioral displays per hour) {{and a large number}} of tail eyespots had low levels of circulating heterophils, suggesting better health status. Experimental activation of the immune system, through LPS injection, significantly <b>reduced</b> <b>display</b> rate compared to a control group. However, the sensitivity of a male display rate to the immune challenge was dependent on the number of tail eyespots: males with higher number of tail eyespots were better able to cope with the experimental immune challenge, and maintained their display rate at levels closer to the levels performed before the immune activation. These results are consistent with the idea that multiple signaling might enhance information reliability...|$|E
40|$|The {{readiness}} to perform species typical social displays and the {{readiness to}} startle {{in reaction to}} novel stimuli are increased in socially isolated paradise fish. Males that are kept in large, bisexual populations or have been socially isolated {{for a few hours}} show low display and low startle readiness. Reactivity is increased following 1 day of social isolation, and a further increase is obtained by prolonging the isolation up to 4 days. Males that receive continuous visual stimulation from a conspecific male or from a goldfish for 4 days show <b>reduced</b> <b>display</b> and reduced startle readiness.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{the first}} to explore the {{cortical}} correlates of signed language (SL) processing under point-light display conditions, the observer identified either a signer or a lexical sign from a display in which different signers were seen producing {{a number of different}} individual signs. Many of the regions activated by point-light under these conditions replicated those previously reported for full-image displays, including regions within the inferior temporal cortex that are specialised for face and body-part identification, although such body parts were invisible in the display. Right frontal regions were also recruited – a pattern not usually seen in full-image SL processing. This activation may reflect the recruitment of information about person identity from the <b>reduced</b> <b>display.</b> A direct comparison of identify-signer and identify-sign conditions showed these tasks relied to a different extent on the posterior inferior regions. Signer identification elicited greater activation than sign identification in (bilateral) inferior temporal gyri (BA 37 / 19), fusiform gyri (BA 37), middle and posterior portions of the middle temporal gyri (BAs 37 and 19), and superior temporal gyri (BA 22 and 42). Right inferior frontal cortex was a further focus of differential activation (signer>sign). These findings suggest that the neural systems supporting point-light displays for the processing of SL rely on a cortical network including areas of the inferior temporal cortex specialized for face and body identification. While this might be predicted from other studies of whole body point-light actions (Vaina, Solomon, Chowdhury, Sinha, & Belliveau, 2001) it is not predicted from the perspective of spoken language processing, where voice characteristics and speech content recruit distinct cortical regions (Stevens, 2004) in addition to a common network. In this respect, our findings contrast with studies of voice/speech recognition (Von Kriegstein, Kleinschmidt, Sterzer, & Giraud, 2005).

40|$|As an ever-greater {{share of}} our {{national}} military airborne resources transition from manned to unmanned aircraft (UA) the issues associated with unmanned aircraft operations {{become more and more}} important. This study seeks to understand the difficulties associated with controlling both the unmanned aircraft and an onboard video sensor. Traditional unmanned aircraft involve multiple operators controlling multiple control displays that are often oriented on misaligned reference frames. One example unmanned aircraft mission includes a target described on a north-up reference frame, such as a map. The pilot plans a flight path, to this target, on a north-up map, but controls the aircraft along that flight path using an aircraft-view reference frame that offers a forward-looking cockpit view. Finally, the sensor operator controls the sensor to point at the target area using a sensor-view reference frame that offers a sensor viewfinder perspective. Any unmanned aircraft operator or team of operators is required to manage tasks across these multiple reference frames (north-up, aircraft-view, and sensor-view). This study investigated several display design techniques that had the potential to reduce the cognitive burden associated with correlating information from multiple reference frames. Orientation aids, reference frame alignment, display integration, and <b>reduced</b> <b>display</b> redundancy were all evaluated with human subject simulator experiments. During four separate experiments, a total of 80 subjects were asked to complete a series of representative unmanned aircraft operational tasks involving target acquisition, imagery orientation, target tracking, and flight path control. A simulator was developed to support this effort and allow for modification of display characteristics. Over all four experiments the reference frame alignment technique reduced basic orientation time and improved target acquisition time along with other performance and workload measures. The currently accepted practice of placing an orientation aid, such as a north arrow, on the displayed sensor video was only significant on the basic imagery orientation task and did not {{have a significant impact on}} the more involved target acquisition task. This research introduced a potential benefit of reference frame alignment on unmanned aircraft operations. by Matthew Richard Rabe. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Today, {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} (ATCO) mainly use radar screens with hardly any visual assistance functionality to guide air traffic safely in the terminal maneuvering area. In the future, new requirements {{will have to be}} fulfilled by controllers. The distance-based air traffic control (ATC) approach will be shifted via a time- and a trajectory- to a performance-based approach of operation methods. This goes along with greater parts of monitoring tasks for controllers and is difficult to handle with current displays. However, there is potential by using air-ground data link negotiated four dimensional trajectories, flight management system data on ground and more precise navigation capabilities. These assumptions can be considered in advance for new and enhanced controller display concepts. In contrast to current broad integrations of new controller working position systems and displays at a single point in time, systems will have to be more flexible in the future. To avoid extensive system user trainings and to increase user acceptance simultaneously, new functionalities can be integrated in few small consecutive steps instead of one great step. This paper addresses a concept of a migration tolerant human machine interface for approach controllers with a series of learning steps between prototypically implemented display revisions. The radar based display was modified using design metaphors. Nine iterative changes included marking of distances in Nautical miles on standard arrival routes and symbols for cardinal direction in the first two steps. Third and fourth step comprised straightening displayed routes and homogenized route angles. The fifth display revision led to a rectangular structure of routes, whereas the whole view was rotated into a runway dependent horizontal view in stage six. Afterwards, the merge point appearance was adapted and performance-coded aircraft symbols were introduced. The last revision included a parallel and screen border orthogonal route structure for unidirectional movement of aircraft on the resulting monitoring display. In the course of adaptations, controller roles also changed. Monitoring controllers using the resulting complexity <b>reduced</b> <b>display</b> are assisted by executive controllers with conventional radar displays. During an evaluation study for the display set with ten controllers, participants were split into two groups. The first group had to work with all ten display revisions and therefore experienced nine transition steps. The second group only went through two transitions between the state-of-the-art display revision zero, the intermediate stage number five, and the final display layout. The comparison of system usability and transition questionnaire ratings should reveal user acceptance differences between these groups. Results showed that participants’ usability and learnability ratings were quite similar for display revision five comparing both groups, but dropped down for the group with only two transitions when using display revision nine. The adequate dimension of learning steps between all ten implemented display revisions was hit quite well due to controllers’ feedback. It was therefore shown that introducing new ATC display functionalities in small steps is superior against a one-step approach. Following, the migration tolerant display steps are an eligible concept to face future requirements of the air traffic management domain...|$|E

40|$|Providing {{support for}} {{multimedia}} applications on low-power mobile devices remains a significant research challenge. This is {{primarily due to}} two reasons: • Portable mobile devices have modest sizes and weights, and therefore inadequate resources, low CPU processing power, <b>reduced</b> <b>display</b> capabilities, limited memory and battery lifetimes as compared to desktop and laptop systems. • On the other hand, multimedia applications tend to have distinctive QoS and processing requirementswhichmake themextremely resource-demanding. This innate conflict introduces key research challenges {{in the design of}} multimedia applications and device-level power optimization. Energy efficiency in this kind of platforms can be achieved only via a synergistic hardware and software approach. In fact, while System-on-Chips are more and more programmable thus providing functional flexibility, hardwareonly power reduction techniques cannot maintain consumption under acceptable bounds. It is well understood both in research and industry that system configuration andmanagement cannot be controlled efficiently only relying on low-level firmware and hardware drivers. In fact, at this level there is lack of information about user application activity and consequently about the impact of power management decision on QoS. Even though operating system support and integration is a requirement for effective performance and energy management, more effective and QoSsensitive power management is possible if power awareness and hardware configuration control strategies are tightly integratedwith domain-specificmiddleware services. The main objective of this PhD research has been the exploration and the integration of amiddleware-centric energymanagement with applications and operating-system. We choose to focus on the CPU-memory and the video subsystems, since they are the most power-hungry components of an embedded system. A second main objective has been the definition and implementation of software facilities (like toolkits, API, and run-time engines) in order to improve programmability and performance efficiency of such platforms. Enhancing energy efficiency and programmability ofmodernMulti-Processor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) Consumer applications are characterized by tight time-to-market constraints and extreme cost sensitivity. The software that runs on modern embedded systems must be high performance, real time, and even more important low power. Although much progress has been made on these problems, much remains to be done. Multi-processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) are increasingly popular platforms for high performance embedded applications. This leads to interesting challenges in software development since efficient software development is a major issue for MPSoc designers. An important step in deploying applications on multiprocessors is to allocate and schedule concurrent tasks to the processing and communication resources of the platform. The problem of allocating and scheduling precedenceconstrained tasks on processors in a distributed real-time system is NP-hard. There is a clear need for deployment technology that addresses thesemulti processing issues. This problem can be tackled by means of specific middleware which takes care of allocating and scheduling tasks on the different processing elements and which tries also to optimize the power consumption of the entire multiprocessor platform. This dissertation is an attempt to develop insight into efficient, flexible and optimalmethods for allocating and scheduling concurrent applications tomultiprocessor architectures. It is a well-known problem in literature: this kind of optimization problems are very complex even in much simplified variants, therefore most authors propose simplified models and heuristic approaches to solve it in reasonable time. Model simplification is often achieved by abstracting away platform implementation ”details”. As a result, optimization problems become more tractable, even reaching polynomial time complexity. Unfortunately, this approach creates an abstraction gap between the optimization model and the real HW-SW platform. The main issue with heuristic or, more in general, with incomplete search is that they introduce an optimality gap of unknown size. They provide very limited or no information on the distance between the best computed solution and the optimal one. The goal of this work is to address both abstraction and optimality gaps, formulating accurate models which accounts for a number of ”non-idealities” in real-life hardware platforms, developing novel mapping algorithms that deterministically find optimal solutions, and implementing software infrastructures required by developers to deploy applications for the targetMPSoC platforms. Energy Efficient LCDBacklightAutoregulation on Real-LifeMultimediaAp- plication Processor Despite the ever increasing advances in Liquid Crystal Display’s (LCD) technology, their power consumption {{is still one of the}} major limitations to the battery life of mobile appliances such as smart phones, portable media players, gaming and navigation devices. There is a clear trend towards the increase of LCD size to exploit the multimedia capabilities of portable devices that can receive and render high definition video and pictures. Multimedia applications running on these devices require LCD screen sizes of 2. 2 to 3. 5 inches andmore to display video sequences and pictures with the required quality. LCD power consumption is dependent on the backlight and pixel matrix driving circuits and is typically proportional to the panel area. As a result, the contribution is also likely to be considerable in future mobile appliances. To address this issue, companies are proposing low power technologies suitable for mobile applications supporting low power states and image control techniques. On the research side, several power saving schemes and algorithms can be found in literature. Some of them exploit software-only techniques to change the image content to reduce the power associated with the crystal polarization, some others are aimed at decreasing the backlight level while compensating the luminance reduction by compensating the user perceived quality degradation using pixel-by-pixel image processing algorithms. The major limitation of these techniques is that they rely on the CPU to perform pixel-based manipulations and their impact on CPU utilization and power consumption has not been assessed. This PhDdissertation shows an alternative approach that exploits in a smart and efficient way the hardware image processing unit almost integrated in every current multimedia application processors to implement a hardware assisted image compensation that allows dynamic scaling of the backlight with a negligible impact on QoS. The proposed approach overcomes CPU-intensive techniques by saving system power without requiring either a dedicated display technology or hardware modification. Thesis Overview The remainder of the thesis is organized as follows. The first part is focused on enhancing energy efficiency and programmability of modern Multi-Processor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs). Chapter 2 gives an overview about architectural trends in embedded systems, illustrating the principal features of new technologies and the key challenges still open. Chapter 3 presents a QoS-driven methodology for optimal allocation and frequency selection for MPSoCs. The methodology is based on functional simulation and full system power estimation. Chapter 4 targets allocation and scheduling of pipelined stream-oriented applications on top of distributed memory architectures with messaging support. We tackled the complexity of the problem by means of decomposition and no-good generation, and prove the increased computational efficiency of this approach with respect to traditional ones. Chapter 5 presents a cooperative framework to solve the allocation, scheduling and voltage/frequency selection problem to optimality for energyefficient MPSoCs, while in Chapter 6 applications with conditional task graph are taken into account. Finally Chapter 7 proposes a complete framework, called Cellflow, to help programmers in efficient software implementation on a real architecture, the Cell Broadband Engine processor. The second part is focused on energy efficient software techniques for LCD displays. Chapter 8 gives an overview about portable device display technologies, illustrating the principal features of LCD video systems and the key challenges still open. Chapter 9 shows several energy efficient software techniques present in literature, while Chapter 10 illustrates in details our method for saving significant power in an LCD panel.
