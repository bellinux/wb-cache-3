5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> (Fig.16). The pulse <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sometimes}} said that SSEPs are elicited only by stimuli of high <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency,</b> {{but this is}} not generally correct. In principle, a sinusoidally modulated stimulus can elicit a SSEP even when its <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> is low. Because of the high-frequency rolloff of the SSEP, high frequency stimulation can produce a near-sinusoidal SSEP waveform, {{but this is not}} germane to the definition of a SSEP.|$|E
25|$|A similar effect {{imposes a}} maximum range as well. In order to {{maximize}} range, longer times between pulses should be used, {{referred to as}} a pulse repetition time, or its reciprocal, pulse <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} and characterize both asynchronous optical sampling terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (AOS THz-TDS) and terahertz {{frequency comb}} spectroscopy (TFCS) as high-speed, high-resolution terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. Two mode-locked femtosecond (fs) lasers with slightly different <b>repetition</b> <b>frequencies</b> are used without a mechanical delay stage to generate and detect THz pulses. The <b>repetition</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{of the two}} fs lasers are stabilized by use of two phase-locked loops sharing the same reference oscillator. For AOS THz-TDS, the difference <b>frequency</b> between the <b>repetition</b> <b>frequencies</b> is optimized, and the signal-to-noise ratio is measured {{as a function of}} the measurement time. The spectra of a THz frequency comb and its individual modes are measured using TFCS. A spectral resolution of 100 MHz is obtained in both types of spectroscopy. PACS numbers: 07. 57. Pt, 07. 57.

25|$|For metallized film capacitors, {{so-called}} pulse tests {{simulate the}} pulse load that might occur during an application, {{according to a}} standard specification. IEC 60384 part 1, specifies that the test circuit is charged and discharged intermittently. The test voltage corresponds to the rated DC voltage and the test comprises 10000 pulses with a <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> of 1nbsp&Hz. The pulse stress capacity is the pulse rise time. The rated pulse rise time is specified as 1/10 of the test pulse rise time.|$|E
25|$|While {{this work}} progressed, the teams {{continued}} {{development of the}} basic system. Burcham and Atkinson continued their development of the transmitter section, attempting to generate very short pulses of power to feed the magnetron. They finally settled on a solution using two tubes, a thyratron and a pentode, which produced 1µs pulses at 15kW. GEC preferred a design using a single thyratron, but this was eventually abandoned in favour of the AMRE design. Further work pushed this system to 50kW, producing 10kW of microwaves at a pulse <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> of 2500 cycles per second.|$|E

25|$|The aircraft's {{principal}} sensor was an Ericsson PS 37 X-band monopulse radar, {{which used}} a mechanically steered parabolic dish {{housed in a}} radome. This radar performed several functions, including air-to-ground and air-to-air telemetry, search, track, terrain-avoidance and cartography. On the JA 37 fighter-interceptor model, the PS 37 radar {{was replaced by the}} more capable Ericsson PS 46 X-band pulse <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency,</b> which had an all-weather look-down/shoot-down capability reportedly in excess of 50 kilometers and continuous-wave illumination for the Skyflash missiles as well as the ability to track two targets while scanning.

500|$|The male call can {{be heard}} {{at any time of}} day and {{consists}} of an unusual hissing-type sound, starting as a series of one-second sibilant bursts about a second apart repeated more rapidly until they become a constant hiss lasting 7–10s. Described as [...] "rp, rp, rp, rp, rrrrrp", the sound is produced when single muscular contractions click the tymbal inward, buckling 7–9 of the tymbal ribs, each of which produces a pulse. This occurs alternately on the two tymbals and is rapidly repeated at a frequency of about 143Hz (in groups of four except when the cicada is in distress– when they are ungrouped and at a lower frequency), giving a pulse <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> of around 1050 per second, with a relatively broad sound frequency range of 7.5–10.5kHz, that has a dominant frequency (at which the peak energy is observed) of 9.5–9.6kHz.|$|E

500|$|Singing can cease and restart suddenly, either rarely or frequently, {{and often}} ends abruptly. The song has been {{described}} as [...] "Tar-ran-tar-rar-tar-ran-tar-rar", [...] and consists of a series of pulses emitted at a rate of 240–250 a second. The tymbal covers are much larger than other species and also make the call louder and send it in a particular direction. There are two distinct phases of song, which the double drummer switches between at irregular intervals. One phase is a continuous call that can last for several minutes; during this period the frequency varies between 5.5–6.2kHz and 6.0–7.5kHz 4–6 times a second. In the other phase, the song is interrupted by breaks of increasing frequency resulting in a staccato sound. These breaks can be mistaken for silence as the difference in volume is so great, though the song actually continues at a much lower volume. During this staccato phase, which lasts for several seconds, the frequency remains around 5.75–6.5kHz. The frequency of the song is a high harmonic of the pulse <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency,</b> which makes for a particularly ringing sound. Double drummers congregate in groups to amplify their calls, which likely drives off potential bird predators.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{frequency}} combs generators (OFCGs) have demonstrated {{to be extremely}} useful tools {{in a wide variety}} of applications. The current research trends look toward compact devices that are able to offer high phase correlation between optical lines, and in this sense, mode-locked laser diodes (MLLDs), with <b>repetition</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the few gigahertz (GHz) range, and especially microresonators, with <b>repetition</b> <b>frequencies</b> of hundreds of GHz, are the most promising devices fulfilling these requirements. Nevertheless, focusing in the few GHz frequency rate, MLLDs cannot provide continuous tunability and require special devices that are still far from offering reliability and repeatability for commercial use. In this letter, we demonstrate for the first time the generation of a flat OFCG based on a single commercial vertical cavity surface emitting laser under gain-switching regime with 20 optical lines (spaced by 4. 2 GHz) in a 3 -dB bandwidth, offering wide tunability range and very high phase correlation between optical modes.
