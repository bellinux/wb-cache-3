We compute the M-triangle of Armstrong’s poset of m-divisible non-crossing partitions for the root systems of type E 7 and E 8. For the other types except Dn {{this had been}} accomplished in the earlier paper “The F-triangle of the generalised cluster complex. ” Altogether, this almost settles Armstrong’s F = M Conjecture predicting a surprising relation between the M-triangle of the m-divisible partitions poset and the F-triangle (a certain refined face count) of the generalised cluster complex of Fomin and Reading, the only gap remaining in type Dn. Moreover, we prove a reciprocity result for this M-triangle, again {{with the possible exception}} of type Dn. Our results are based on the calculation of certain decomposition numbers for the reflection groups of types E 7 and E 8, which carry in fact finer information than does the M-triangle. The decomposition numbers for the other exceptional reflection groups had been computed in the earlier paper. We present a conjectured formula for the type An decomposition numbers. 1. Introduction.

In design d <b>w</b> <b>rk</b> the use of the computer analysis of the acoustic emission (AE) signals for recognition f the salt stress-strain stages is considered. The main attention in this analysis is given on amplitude-time parameters of the initial part of signals. The Byes criterion was used for the recognition. The obtained outcomes have allowed determining the loss ratio the minimum of the recognition error. The dependence of the correct deformation stage recognition probability on an number of AE signal informative parameter is established. It is shown that the correct recognition probability 0. 95 - 0. 97 is reached on loss relation 0. 1 and parameters number equal 12 - 13 and more...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Potable water is a commodity taken for granted by many in modem society. In places where it is not naturally available, it is usually produced by adequate processing of the supply from other sources, {{as is the case}} with seawater desalination. Such processes require an energy supply, which just as well may not exist at many of these locations. In view of the above, this <b>w</b> <b>rk</b> focuses on the study of two well-established technologies and their integration: water desalination by Reverse Osmosis (RO) and electricity generation using Wind Energy. Based on the premise that no energy backup or storage devices would be employed, two alternative wind-powered RO system configurations are proposed. Their components are individually described and modelled. Control strategies are devised for both systems, aiming at making the best possible use of the energy available. The expected performances of both systems are assessed through simulation of computer models. Based on the simulated performance results, one of the systems is chosen for further development. A prototype system is built and experimental tests carried out. The design of the prototype is detailed and the results obtained are presented. In the light of these results, the developed model is validated and the viability of the system is discussed. Finally, practical implementation issues are discussed; a case study is introduced, including performance predictions and a simplified economic analysis presented...|$|R
