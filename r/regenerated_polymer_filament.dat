40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the possible mechanism of stretch on cell electrochemical potential change, {{based on the}} physicochemical properties of cytoskeletal network. Synthetic polyelectrolyte gel {{was used as an}} experimental model of the cytoskeleton. Gel samples with different density of network cross linking were studied. Triangular axial deformations of samples were applied. Simultaneously, the electrochemical (Donnan) potential of the gel was measured between a micropipette electrode pinned into the swollen gel, and a reference electrode in the outer solution. We found that axial deformation shifts the gel potential toward depolarization. The extent of gel depolarization showed a close negative correlation with the Young modulus of the gel. We suggest that the underlying mechanism {{is likely to be a}} universal process of counterion adsorption on charged <b>polymer</b> <b>filaments</b> due to the decrease of distance between <b>polymer</b> <b>filaments</b> owing to gel elongation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|To {{develop skills}} {{sufficient}} for hearing preservation cochlear implant surgery, surgeons need to perform several electrode insertion trials in ex vivo temporal bones, thereby consuming relatively expensive electrode carriers. The objectives {{of this study}} were to evaluate the insertion characteristics of cochlear electrodes in a plastic scala tympani model and to fabricate radio opaque <b>polymer</b> <b>filament</b> dummy electrodes of equivalent mechanical properties. In addition, this study should aid the design and development of new cochlear electrodes. Automated insertion force measurement is a new technique to reproducibly analyze and evaluate the insertion dynamics and mechanical characteristics of an electrode. Mechanical properties of MED-EL’s FLEX 28, FLEX 24, and FLEX 20 electrodes were assessed {{with the help of an}} automated insertion tool. Statistical analysis of the overall mechanical behavior of the electrodes and factors influencing the insertion force are discussed. Radio opaque dummy electrodes of comparable characteristics were fabricated based on insertion force measurements. The platinum-iridium wires were replaced by <b>polymer</b> <b>filament</b> to provide sufficient stiffness to the electrodes and to eradicate the metallic artifacts in X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. These low-cost dummy electrodes are cheap alternatives for surgical training and for in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo research purposes...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} framework for the linear and nonlinear visco-elastic properties of reversibly crosslinked networks of semiflexible polymers. In contrast to affine models where network strain couples to the polymer end-to-end distance, in our model strain rather serves to locally distort the network structure. This induces bending modes in the <b>polymer</b> <b>filaments,</b> the properties of wich are slaved to the surrounding network structure. Specifically, we investigate the frequency-dependent linear rheology, in particular in combination with crosslink binding/unbinding processes.

The model, which is fully predictive and contains no adjustable parameters, captures the rupture characteristics of the available data sets and agrees quantitatively with critical stress–critical strain data and the dependence of critical strain on the Weissenberg number. © 2003 The Society of Rheology...|$|R

The helical domain boundaries are {{eliminated from the}} relaxing structure by unwinding through {{the ends of the}} rod. The growth of the helical domains results in self-propulsive motion of the expanding rod, as one large helix spanning the entire chain relaxes during the late stages of the dynamics.

At present, electrospinning is rapidly emerging as a unique and versatile technique for the preparation of smooth nanofibers with controllable morphology from various polymers [1, 2]. The nanofibers produced by electrospinning have high surface area and highly porous structure, and furthermore, design flexibility is an important advantage of electrospun nanofibers [3].|$|R

Fibers are deposited on glass, varying the diameter and the relative orientation of the <b>polymer</b> <b>filaments</b> (random vs aligned configuration). While no significant variation is observed in the static contact angle (about 130) of deposited water drops upon changing the average fiber diameter up to the micrometer scale, fibers are found to exhibit unequalled water adhesion.
