5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes {{on the theme of}} Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint on the theme of Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to <b>retouch</b> or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to paint a replacement on the theme of Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E

40|$|As {{the title}} suggests, this Master’s project treats the {{problems}} related to automatic <b>retouching</b> of user-selected regions in digital images. <b>Retouching</b> refers {{to the process of}} removing an arbitrary region from an image, replacing it with a substitute region that ultimately should blend in seamlessly with the other parts of the image. Automatic refers to that the user should not need to do anything else than select the region aimed for <b>retouching</b> and start the <b>retouching</b> algorithm. <b>Retouching</b> is an entirely subjective process, from the selection of the region to be <b>retouched</b> to the <b>retouching</b> process as well as the resulting image. The <b>retouching</b> in this Master’s project is aimed at ordinary images, e. g., arbitrary images from your family photo album. An extensive survey of previous work related to the <b>retouching</b> problem is summarized. A discussion regarding the user selection process is given. Details of implemented algorithms are described along with thei...|$|R
40|$|Digital <b>retouching</b> of face {{images is}} {{becoming}} more widespread due {{to the introduction of}} software packages that automate the task. Several researchers have introduced algorithms to detect whether a face image is original or <b>retouched.</b> However, previous work on this topic has not considered whether or how accuracy of <b>retouching</b> detection varies with the demography of face images. In this paper, we introduce a new Multi-Demographic <b>Retouched</b> Faces (MDRF) dataset, which contains images belonging to two genders, male and female, and three ethnicities, Indian, Chinese, and Caucasian. Further, <b>retouched</b> images are created using two different <b>retouching</b> software packages. The second major contribution of this research is a novel semi-supervised autoencoder incorporating "subclass" information to improve classification. The proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art detection algorithms for the task of generalized <b>retouching</b> detection. Experiments conducted with multiple combinations of ethnicities show that accuracy of <b>retouching</b> detection can vary greatly based on the demographics of the training and testing images.

25|$|One of {{her more}} unusual {{commissions}} came in 1896, when Emily Dickinson's sister Lavinia arranged for Hills to <b>retouch</b> {{one of the}} few existing photographs of the deceased poet, an austere formal portrait that had been taken when Dickinson was around 16 and which neither Dickinson nor her sister had thought was a good likeness. Hills used the photograph as a base to create a memorial portrait; the result, featuring a softened, curlier hairline and a frilly-necked dress, pleased Lavinia. Between 1913 and 1937, this portrait appeared in half a dozen volumes of work by and about the poet that were produced by Dickinson's niece Martha Dickenson Bianchi.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} these {{is focused on the}} Levant. The Kebaran culture (20,000–17,000 BP) not only {{introduced}} the microlithic assemblage into the region, it also has African affinity specifically with the Ouchtata <b>retouch</b> technique associated with the microlithic Halfan culture of Egypt (20,000–17,000 BP) The Kebarans in their turn were directly ancestral to the succeeding Natufian culture (10,500–8500 BCE), which has enormous significance for prehistorians as the clearest evidence of hunters and gatherers in actual transition to Neolithic food production. Both cultures extended their influence outside the region into southern Anatolia. For example, in Cilicia the Belbaşı culture (13,000–10,000 BC) shows Kebaran influence, while the Beldibi culture (10,000–8500 BC) shows clear Natufian influence.|$|E

Using kerosene lanterns, he developed the glass plate negatives at night and contact printed the images on gaslight paper. Reading instruction booklets from Kodak and Ilford, he taught himself to mix his own chemicals and use sunlight to develop his prints. In 1940, Alonge began to <b>retouch,</b> sepia tone, and hand-color his photographs. When electricity came to Benin in 1945, {{he was able to}} take studio portraits and develop his photos indoors. Alonge's first camera was a Kodak Brownie; later, he used a Rolleiflex and other 35 mm cameras, and finally high-speed film.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of 8500–7500 BC, another {{hunter-gatherer}} group, showing clear affinities with the cultures of Egypt (particularly the Outacha <b>retouch</b> technique for working stone) was in Sinai. This Harifian culture may have adopted the use of pottery from the Isnan culture and Helwan culture of Egypt (which lasted from 9000 to 4500 BC), and subsequently fused with elements from the PPNB culture during the climatic crisis of 6000 BC to form what Juris Zarins calls the Syro-Arabian pastoral technocomplex, which saw {{the spread of the}} first Nomadic pastoralists in the Ancient Near East. These extended southwards along the Red Sea coast and penetrating the Arabian bifacial cultures, which became progressively more Neolithic and pastoral, and extending north and eastwards, to lay the foundations for the tent-dwelling Martu and Akkadian peoples of Mesopotamia.|$|E

40|$|<b>Retouching</b> can {{significantly}} elevate the visual appeal of photos, but many casual photographers lack the expertise {{to do this}} well. To address this problem, previous works have proposed automatic <b>retouching</b> systems based on supervised learning from paired training images acquired before and after manual editing. As {{it is difficult for}} users to acquire paired images that reflect their <b>retouching</b> preferences, we present in this paper a deep learning approach that is instead trained on unpaired data, namely a set of photographs that exhibits a <b>retouching</b> style the user likes, which is much easier to collect. Our system is formulated using deep convolutional neural networks that learn to apply different <b>retouching</b> operations on an input image. Network training with respect to various types of edits is enabled by modeling these <b>retouching</b> operations in a unified manner as resolution-independent differentiable filters. To apply the filters in a proper sequence and with suitable parameters, we employ a deep reinforcement learning approach that learns to make decisions on what action to take next, given {{the current state of the}} image. In contrast to many deep learning systems, ours provides users with an understandable solution in the form of conventional <b>retouching</b> edits, rather than just a "black box" result. Through quantitative comparisons and user studies, we show that this technique generates <b>retouching</b> results consistent with the provided photo set...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{advertisers}} {{and magazine}} editors {{have been widely}} criticized for taking digital photo <b>retouching</b> to an extreme. Impossibly thin, tall, and wrinkle- and blemish-free models are routinely splashed onto billboards, advertisements, and magazine covers. The ubiquity of these unrealistic and highly idealized images {{has been linked to}} eating disorders and body image dissatisfaction in men, women, and children. In response, several countries have considered legislating the labeling of <b>retouched</b> photos. We describe a quantitative and perceptually meaningful metric of photo <b>retouching.</b> Photographs are rated on {{the degree to which they}} have been digitally altered by explicitly modeling and estimating geometric and photometric changes. This metric correlates well with perceptual judgments of photo <b>retouching</b> and can be used to objectively judge by how much a <b>retouched</b> photo has strayed from reality...|$|R
40|$|<b>Retouching</b> {{glass plate}} negatives was a {{practice}} that emerged {{about the same time}} as the glass plate negative itself. How was photography being <b>retouched</b> in the early 20 th century? Today there are generally available known digital tools. A hundred years ago, the <b>retouching</b> was done by hand, by the photographer, or by specific professionals that don’t distance themselves, in technical demand, of the arts of drawing and painting. But the <b>retouching</b> was invisible in the final object, because the changes were done on the negative. Its contemporary books, in the form of manuals, are a window to the past telling us about the techniques and materials used. Existing archive collections of photographic glass plate negatives are testimony to the expertise of photographers and the practical use of those books. The present work will show examples of tools and materials used for <b>retouching</b> of photographic glass plate negatives, taking as an example a portrait collection at the Photographic Archive of Lisbon. Also some considerations are done about the conservation of <b>retouched</b> glass plate negatives in archive collections. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

50|$|Backed edge blades {{have one}} of the edges, {{generally}} a side one, rounded or chamfered by abrupt <b>retouching.</b> There are fewer types of these blades, and may be divided into those where the entire edge is rounded and those where only a part is rounded, or even straight. They are fundamental in the blade-forming processes, and from them, innumerable other types were developed. Dufour bladelets are up to three centimeters in length, finely shaped with a curved profile whose <b>retouches</b> are semi-abrupt and which characterize a particular phase of the Aurignacian period. Solutrean backed edge blades display pronounced and abrupt <b>retouching,</b> so that they are long and narrow and, although rare, characterize certain phases of the Solutrean period. Ouchtata bladelets are similar to the others, except that the <b>retouched</b> back is not uniform but irregular; this type of microlith characterizes certain periods of the Epipaleolithic Saharans. The Ibero-Maurusian and the Montbani bladelet, with a partial and irregular lateral <b>retouching,</b> is characteristic of the Italian Tardenoisian.|$|R
50|$|The {{solution}} to the definition problem is stated in the article on Acheulean. The difference is to be {{defined in terms of}} complexity.

Then he reworks or <b>retouches</b> the edges by removing very small chips so as to straighten and sharpen the edge. Typically but not necessarily the reworking is accomplished by pressure flaking.|$|R

Water-colours, inks, dyes and chemical reducers are used with such tools as scalpels, pointed brushes, airbrushes and <b>retouching</b> pencils.|$|R

[...] The latter photograph has been uncritically accepted by many historians as documentation of the actual event, although a closer examination reveals that the wire-cutters are made out of wood. [...] Butcher also did not hestitate to <b>retouch</b> photos. [...] He photographed a hill in Cherry County that had been important to early setters because of its cedar trees; since the trees had been cut long before he got there with his camera, he scratched trees on the bare hill on his negative. [...] To illustrate Ephraim Swain Finch's account of how he had battled an 1876 infestation of grasshoppers, he posed Finch in his cornfield, then incised scores of dots and specks into the negative to depict the flying insects. [...] When he sought to illustrate a large flock of ducks, but realized that the birds were flying too fast for his camera to record, he photographed the scene without the waterfowl and then scratched dozens of ducks into the negative.|$|E
