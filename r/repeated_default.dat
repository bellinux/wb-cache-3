40|$|Background: Default {{remains an}} {{important}} {{challenge for the}} Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme, which has achieved improved cure rates. Objectives: This study describes the pattern of time of default in patients on DOTS. Settings and Design: Tuberculosis Unit in District Tuberculosis Centre, Yavatmal, India; Retrospective cohort study. Materials and Methods: This analysis was done among the cohort of patients of registered at the Tuberculosis Unit during the year 2004. The time of default was assessed from the tuberculosis register. The sputum smear conversion and treatment outcome were also assessed. Statistical Analysis: Kaplan-Meier plots and log rank tests. Results: Overall, the default rate amongst the 716 patients registered at the Tuberculosis Unit was 10. 33 %. There {{was a significant difference}} in the default rate over time between the three DOTS categories (log rank statistic= 15. 49, P= 0. 0004). Amongst the 331 smear-positive patients, the cumulative default rates at the end of intensive phase were 4 % and 16 %; while by end of treatment period, the default rates were 6 % and 31 % in category I and category II, respectively. A majority of the smear-positive patients in category II belonged to the group ′treatment after default′ (56 / 95), and 30 % of them defaulted during re-treatment. The sputum smear conversion rate at the end of intensive phase was 84 %. Amongst 36 patients without smear conversion at the end of intensive phase, 55 % had treatment failure. Conclusions: Patients defaulting in intensive phase of treatment and without smear conversion at the end of intensive phase should be retrieved on a priority basis. Default constitutes not only a major reason for patients needing re-treatment but also a risk for <b>repeated</b> <b>default...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{extend the}} common Poisson shock {{framework}} reviewed {{for example in}} Lindskog and McNeil (2003) to a formulation avoiding <b>repeated</b> <b>defaults,</b> thus obtaining a model that can account consistently for single name default dynamics, cluster default dynamics and default counting process. This approach allows one to introduce significant dynamics, improving on the standard "bottom-up" approaches, and to achieve true consistency with single names, improving on most "top-down" loss models. Furthermore, the resulting GPCL model has important links with the previous GPL dynamical loss model in Brigo, Pallavicini and Torresetti (2006 a,b), which we point out. Model extensions allowing for more articulated spread and recovery dynamics are hinted at. Calibration to both DJi-TRAXX and CDX index and tranche data across attachments and maturities shows that the GPCL model has the same calibration power as the GPL model while allowing for consistency with single name...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{what happens to}} firms after they default on their bank loans. We approach this question by establishing a set of stylized facts concerning the evolution of default and its resolution, focusing on access to credit after default. Using a unique dataset from Portugal, we observe {{that half of the}} default episodes last 5 quarters or less and that larger firms have shorter default periods. Most firms continue to have access to credit immediately after default, though only a minority has access to new loans. Firms have more difficulties in regaining access to credit if they are small, if their default was long and severe, if they borrow from only one bank or if they default with their main lender. Further, half of the defaulting firms record another default in the future. We observe that firms with <b>repeated</b> <b>defaults</b> are, on average, smaller and have experienced longer and more severe defaults. ...|$|R

5000|$|Poincaré for his part, while {{demanding}} that France's right to collect reparations was non-negotiable, {{did not wish}} a break with Britain. He was also prepared to compromise on German reparations, albeit highly reluctantly, if the British were willing to offer security guarantees {{and a reduction in}} French war debts. Despite Poincaré's best efforts to work out an Anglo-French plan for Germany to pay reparations, the British continued to insist that the French lower their reparations demands on Germany, asking in July 1922 that the French accept a voluntary two-year moratorium on collecting reparations from Germany {{while at the same time}} insisted that they would accept no reduction in French war debts, even if the French were to reduce reparation claims. By the summer of 1922, a vicious circle had been created: the more Germany defaulted on reparations, the more the British pressed for reductions in reparations, which in turn led to further defaults by the Germans out of the hope that reparations might be cancelled altogether. Poincaré was greatly offended by the British demand that the French cancel all reparations for two years, which he saw as rewarding Germany for its <b>repeated</b> <b>defaults</b> and feared that once the reparations were stopped, they would never start again. On 10 August 1922 Lloyd George told his cabinet that Britain should not [...] "give in to the tender mercies of M. Poincaré and the French militarists," [...] for that would mean that Britain had [...] "yielded up control of Europe not to France, but to M. Poincaré and his chauvinistic friends." [...] It was British policy to encourage Germany to default on reparations out of the hope that this might force the French to occupy the Ruhr in response. In November 1922, the British member of the reparations commission, Sir John Bradbury, told the American Colonel James Logan that the British government wanted [...] "to let M. Poincaré try out his policy in the face of their sulky disapproval in the hope that, when M. Poincaré had gone a little way in his independent policy, the French people, feeling consequently the weakening of the franc, increased taxation, etc., would rise in their wrath and oust M. Poincaré before too much harm had been done." [...] By December 1922 he was faced with British-American-German hostility and saw coal for French steel production and money for reconstructing the devastated industrial areas draining away.

Putative pseudogene repeats were identified with screening using Repbase (Jurka 2000) with the “mask pseudogenes” and “report simple repeats” options of the online tool CENSOR (Kobany et al. 2006). This was done to identify repetitive elements by comparing our sequences to known eukaryotic repeats and prototypic sequences stored in Repbase utilizing WU-BLAST. A second search was conducted with FastPCR (Kalendar et al. 2009) using the repeat search option of the program. Under “type of repeats” we checked for simple, direct, inverted, direct antisense, and direct reverse <b>repeats,</b> respectively. <b>Default</b> values were used under a kMers repeat screening. After each search, repetitive motifs and sequences were recorded and compared with the results obtained from the Repbase search. After repeats were identified in the trn L-F IGS sequences, further structural trn F(GAA) gene elements or residues were annotated manually using the anticodon domain as reference.

40|$|Brachyspira pilosicoli is an {{anaerobic}} intestinal spirochaete that colonizes {{the large}} intestine of various host species, {{in which it}} may induce diarrhoea, poor growth rates and a localized colitis known as intestinal (or colonic) spirochaetosis. The spirochaete {{is considered to be}} potentially zoonotic. The purpose of the current study was to develop a multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) method as a simple and rapid tool to investigate the molecular epidemiology of B. pilosicoli. The genomic sequence of B. pilosicoli strain 95 / 1000 was analyzed for potential tandem <b>repeats</b> using the <b>default</b> parameters of the Tandem Repeat Finder program. A total of 22 repeat loci were identified and tested for their presence and variability on a set of 10 B. pilosicoli isolates. Five loci that were present in most isolates and that showed evidence of allelic variation were selected and used with a collection of 119 isolates from different host species and geographical locations. Not all the isolates amplified at all loci, but using the available data a total of 103 VNTR profiles were generated. The discriminatory power of this method was 0. 976. A phylogenetic tree constructed from the allelic profiles confirmed the diversity of B. pilosicoli, and the general lack of clustering of strains based on species of origin or geographic origin. Some isolates with known epidemiological links were found to be identical or highly similar. The MLVA method was simple and easy to use, and could readily differentiate between strains of B. pilosicoli. MLVA should prove to be a useful tool for rapid identification of relationships between B. pilosicoli isolates in epidemiological investigations...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies Merton 2 ̆ 7 s optimal portfolio problem {{applied to}} an investor who trades in a Credit Default Swap (CDS). This work began {{under the guidance}} of Dr Capponi following his previous analysis Capponi and Figueroa [2011] with corporate bonds. We study the a portfolio optimization problem of a speculative investor allocating the wealth to an equity, a money market account and to a Credit Default Swap. This work is differentiated from Capponi and Figueroa [2011] since they analyze a portfolio of an equity, money market account and a zero-coupon corporate bond. The primary difference is our consideration of a CDS instead of a defaultable bond. Note that there is {{a significant difference in the}} reward structure of these two assets. The CDS has a continuous payment while the bond does not. Also, we consider the correlation between the CDS and the equity. ^ Initially, we assume a market existing in a single regime and market coefficients are assumed to be constant. Under these assumptions, the dynamics of the CDS price are determined in terms of a stochastic differential equation. The utility maximization problem is solved using a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and verification theorems are shown for its solution. Explicit optimal strategies are obtained for an investor with a logarithmic utility function. ^ With data from the last 150 years, we see that the corporate bond market suffers <b>repeated</b> clustered <b>defaults.</b> Since we are considering CDS that are written on corporate bonds, we incorporate this market behavior by modeling the economy to exist in multiple regimes. The market coefficients are assumed to depend on the regime in place. This regime is modeled by a nite state continuous Markov process. The CDS price dynamics is determined in terms of a Markov modulated stochastic differential equation and the Utility maximization problem is solved in the same way as above. Explicit optimal strategies are obtained for a logarithmic investor in a market that exists in 3 regimes. ^ In the last chapter, we extend the work done in Capponi and Figueroa [2011] to the situation where the assets are correlated with one another. Over the last 10 years, it has been observed that the credit markets and the equity markets are correlated. To incorporate this behavior, we model the default process as a doubly stochastic Poisson process where the default rate is a function of the stock price. The CDS price dynamics are determined as a function of the stock price and the utility maximization problem is solved in a similar fashion. Explicit strategies are obtained for a logarithmic investor. We see that the optimal investment in the CDS and stock are dependent on each other. ...|$|R
40|$|Adam Smith {{recommended}} sovereign insolvency as 2 ̆ 2 {{always the}} measure {{which is both}} least dishonourable to the debtor, and least hurtful to the creditor. 2 ̆ 2 Christopher G. Oechsli published a detailed proposal of how to adapt Chapter 11, Title 11 of the US Code, well before August 1982, the date considered {{by many as the}} official beginning of the debt crisis. After Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s <b>default,</b> <b>repeated</b> suggestions to emulate Chapter 11 for sovereign debtors met stiff opposition, especially from International Financial Institutions (2 ̆ 2 IFls 2 ̆ 2) such as the International Monetary Fund (2 ̆ 2 IMF 2 ̆ 2). Their formalistic counterargument was that Chapter 11 did not address the problem of sovereignty. In defense, I proposed an international version of Chapter 9 in a paper presented at a conference at Zagreb University in 1987. In November 2001, the IMF suddenly presented its 2 ̆ 2 new approach, 2 ̆ 2 emulating Chapter 11 for sovereigns. Presently, four proposals are on the table: Collective Action Clauses (2 ̆ 2 CACs 2 ̆ 2), voluntary Codes of Good Conduct for debt renegotiation proposed both by the Banque de France, and (less elaborated) by the Institute of International Finance, and two models of sovereign insolvency. The first two proposals and insolvency models do not preclude each other. By helping creditors to organize, enabling them to act more quickly and efficiently, CACs are a useful component of any insolvency. The proper functioning of fair procedures depends on the full ability of parties to defend their legal and economic interests. Rules such as those elaborated by the Banque de France may help defuse crises. By contrast, the two insolvency proposals contradict each other fundamentally. For details of my proposal-termed the Fair Transparent Arbitration Process (2 ̆ 2 FTAP 2 ̆ 2) by many nongovernmental organizations (2 ̆ 2 NGOs 2 ̆ 2) -to adapt Chapter 9, Title 11 of the US Code, I refer to other publications. Highlighting its irreconcilable differences vis- -vis the IMF 2 ̆ 7 s Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (2 ̆ 2 SDRM 2 ̆ 2), this paper discusses five issues of specific interest to jurists: impartial decisionmaking, the necessity to emulate Chapter 9, human rights and debtor protection, why equal treatment of creditors is mandatory, and an optional element to allow smoother negotiations and to stabilize capital markets...|$|R
