40|$|A {{pseudorandom}} {{genomic library}} of Bacteroides succinogenes DNA, cloned into pUC 8 in Escherichia coli, was screened <b>for</b> <b>beta-glucanase</b> activity on 0. 1 % lichenan plates. Six high-activity clones, containing identical 5. 2 -kilobase inserts of B. succinogenes DNA, were obtained. The clones exhibited activity solely on beta-glucan substrates containing beta-(1 [...] 3) (1 [...] 4) linkages, thus manifesting a specific fibrolytic enzyme previously unrecognized in B. succinogenes. A subclone (pJI 10) {{of the original}} insert (1. 35 kilobases in size) expressed full beta-glucanase activity under control of its own promoter. The expression of beta-glucanase in pJI 10 appeared subject to catabolite regulation by glucose. Detailed analysis of enzyme activity in the parental and deleted derivatives, subcloned into pUC 18 and pUC 19, suggested that the apparent glucose repression was an artifact arising {{as a consequence of}} interactions with the lac transcriptional unit in the plasmid vector...|$|R
