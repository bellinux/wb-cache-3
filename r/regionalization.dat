25|$|The Government of Alan García (1985–1990) {{passed a}} law that {{transferred}} the functions related to rural water and sanitation construction and technical assistance to regional governments. With the change in government in 1990, these changes did not materialize, as the <b>regionalization</b> stalled.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, {{under the}} second Presidency of Joaquín Balaguer (1966–1978), CAASD {{was set up}} in the capital Santo Domingo as the first {{regional}} water and sewer company. This was followed by the creation of CORAASAN in the second largest city of the country, Santiago, in 1977. The <b>regionalization</b> process then stalled for two decades. But at the request of Congressmen representing their respective constituencies, the process of <b>regionalization</b> resumed and in 1997-98 laws were passed creating three additional regional water and sewer companies in Puerto Plata, Moca and Romana. At the same time, INAPA embarked on its own decentralization programme, handing over the operation of rural water supply systems to community-based organizations. These efforts were supported by technical assistance from USAID (see below).|$|E
25|$|The 1970s medical {{students}} saw {{a need for}} the decentralization of IFMSA. To this aim, IFMSA contributed {{to the creation of}} regional medical student organizations in Africa and Asia. Subsequently, regional vice-presidents were elected for six regions as a way of promoting <b>regionalization</b> but this structure was abandoned after a few years.|$|E
25|$|AUPE {{lost more}} than 3,000 more members in one year, many in the U.S.-style {{privatization}} of liquor stores. In addition, many members were reorganized into boards and agencies, requiring a restructuring of the union. And more than 8,500 hospital workers faced <b>regionalization,</b> whereby health agencies had responsibility over their individual regions, while budging was still handled at a centrally-planned, provincial level.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s {{the water}} and {{sanitation}} sector in the Dominican Republic experienced an abrupt decentralization and subsequent re-centralization. Since 1962, the institutional framework has remained relatively stable, with a gradual process of <b>regionalization</b> to the provinces with the largest cities of the country. In the period since 1980, which was characterized by economic growth fueled primarily by a massive inflow of tourists, substantial investments were made and service coverage increased significantly.|$|E
25|$|As mayor, Cunningham is {{credited}} with leading an economic renaissance in Bethlehem, rejuvenating the city's two downtowns and helping kick-start Bethlehem's economy {{after the collapse of}} Bethlehem Steel. As the twice-elected Lehigh County executive, Cunningham restructured county operations to make economic growth and community <b>regionalization</b> the focus of his administration. Several major Lehigh Valley projects came to fruition during his tenure, including Coca-Cola Park, Boston Beer Company's largest brewery, and new Ocean Spray manufacturing operations.|$|E
25|$|Education in Ethiopia was {{dominated}} by the Tewahedo Church for many centuries until secular education was adopted in the early 1900s. The current system follows school expansion schemes which {{are very similar to}} the system in the rural areas during the 1980s, with an addition of deeper <b>regionalization,</b> providing rural education in students' own languages starting at the elementary level, and with more budget finances allocated to the education sector. The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, four years of lower secondary school and two years of higher secondary school.|$|E
25|$|R$67,496,000.00 of the {{municipal}} GDP is from services, currently {{the major source of}} GDP of Águas de São Pedro. A major part of the tertiary sector is tourism, and the city's economy is geared exclusively toward this sector. The municipality of Águas de São Pedro is integrated with the Tourism Region of the Itaqueri Ridge and has as its main attraction its medicinal mineral waters. According to city officials, the new tourism routes go through <b>regionalization.</b> Tourists attracted by the natural attractions also help to stimulate the commercial sector of the city. The busiest retail centres are Carlos Mauro Avenue and Trade Street, which after renovations costing R$302,000.00 has become a pedestrian street.|$|E
25|$|Consolidation of Locals was {{to address}} the <b>regionalization</b> of the {{contracting}} industry. The contractor who only worked within the local area was quickly becoming {{a thing of the}} past, while non-Union contractors were free to move their crews - experienced with the company’s methods of operation - from job to job, Union Contractors could not move their workers beyond the borders of the District's jurisdictional boundaries without replacing their crews with new carpenters from the jurisdictional district outside the Contractor's home Council. Union contractors rightfully claimed the situation was making them less competitive than the non-Union crews, and the 50% rule was adopted. Union contractors may now use crews with one local Carpenter for each Company Carpenter on jobs outside their Region.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} questions addressed in cellular neuroscience include {{the mechanisms of}} how neurons process signals physiologically and electrochemically. These questions include how signals are processed by neurites – thin extensions from a neuronal cell body, consisting of dendrites (specialized to receive synaptic inputs from other neurons) and axons (specialized to conduct nerve impulses called action potentials) – and somas (the cell bodies of the neurons containing the nucleus), and how neurotransmitters and electrical signals are used to process information in a neuron. Another major area of neuroscience is directed at investigations {{of the development of}} the nervous system. These questions include the patterning and <b>regionalization</b> of the nervous system, neural stem cells, differentiation of neurons and glia, neuronal migration, axonal and dendritic development, trophic interactions, and synapse formation.|$|E
25|$|Decentralization {{was among}} Toledo’s most {{successful}} institutional reforms. In addition to announcing regional elections upon his inauguration, he charged a Decentralization and <b>Regionalization</b> Commission with developing proposals. In 2002, {{a constitutional amendment}} was approved which established three levels of government: local, regional, and national. Over the next few years, the congress gradually passed on resources and responsibilities to the regional and municipal governments including food programs, social development projects, and health and education programs. He divided the single district up, called for regional elections, and eliminated the centralist Ministry of the Presidency that had been instituted under Fujimori. However, when Peru Possible's rival political party APRA made significant gains in regional elections, the Toledo administration halted its decentralization program by withholding power {{in the areas of}} revenue and expenditure. This left many regionally elected governors confused as to how far their authority extended. Without strong fiscal plans to support his new policy of centralization, Toledo had to continue decentralizing power and recognizing more regions. Toledo continued to assert control of regional governments, however, by withholding funding.|$|E

2500|$|The XVII Governo Constitucional government, {{headed by}} Prime Minister José Sócrates, {{tried to create}} new rules and {{implement}} reforms aiming at better efficiency and rationalized resource allocation in the public sector, fighting civil servant overcapacity (excedentários) and reducing bureaucracy for both citizens and companies (e.g.: empresa na hora, PRACE – Programa de Reestruturação da Administração Central do Estado, and SIMPLEX – Programa de Simplificação Administrativa e Legislativa), among others. Since the XVII Governo Constitucional government (with José Sócrates as Prime Minister and Teixeira dos Santos as Minister of Finance) Portugal's fiscal policy improved with a steady increase {{of the number of}} taxpayers and the growth of the receipt amount from State taxation. However these policies had little effect, and the country's public debt and deficit were both out of control by 2010, along with a record high unemployment rate. João Bilhim directed in 2005 the committee responsible for the Programme for Restructuring the State's Central Administration (PRACE) but was said to be disappointed with the results. Several reforms and measures implemented in 2006/2007 by the government (XVII Governo Constitucional – headed by Prime Minister José Sócrates), resulted in improved welfare system financial sustainability but reduced income expectations of future pensioners up to 40%. In addition, economically active people must work for more years before retirement than formerly. A sustainability factor was also introduced, giving employees the option of working longer or receiving slightly lower pensions, as life expectancy forecasts increase. After the Portuguese <b>regionalization</b> referendum of 1998 where the [...] "No" [...] to <b>regionalization</b> of the country into seven regions was victorious, the XVII Governo Constitucional government announced in January 2009 its firm intention of starting again a <b>regionalization</b> process for Portugal. According to this governmental project, mainland Portugal was to be regionalized de jure into five regions {{with a wide range of}} administrative autonomy, using the already established NUTS 2 system: Alentejo, Algarve, Centro, Lisbon, and Norte. The transformation of the Portuguese public administration from a traditional one to an information technology-based multiplatform service, was praised by the European Commission through its European Union benchmark for the sector, that consecutively placed Portugal in the first position of the ranking in 2009 and 2010.|$|E
2500|$|British Columbia {{is divided}} into defined regions for various {{political}} purposes. One is {{for the purpose of}} providing local government services in various ways. [...] Among the most important subdivisions of the province are forest regions and forest districts, which have jurisdiction over forests and their management, and also range and grazing leases, and also manage Ministry of Forests recreation sites and campgrounds. [...] Other important subdivisions are Ministry of Environment regions (which controls water rights and management, environmental oversight, pesticide and herbicide permits, the British Columbia Conservation Officer Service and Fish and Wildlife Branch; the provincial parks are managed by a sub-department of the Ministry of Environment, BC Parks), health regions (which administer health funding, hospitals and ambulance services), school districts (whose taxation authority is distinct from that of regional districts and organized by tax assessment areas), and mining districts (whose authority under the Mines Act supersedes nearly all other jurisdictions). [...] The Ministry of Tourism also has a system of tourism regions, and the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Small Business Development divides the province into development regions, with BC Stats using a different <b>regionalization</b> system than that of Statistics Canada, which uses regional district boundaries to organize its data. [...] Also very important is a system of Regional Management Planning Boards, which are [...] "roundtable"-type planning authorities on which local stakeholders ranging from taxpayer and industry groups, municipalities and chambers of commerce, Ministry of Forests and Ministry of Environment/BC Parks and in some cases First Nations hammer out long-range plans for regional land-use management.|$|E
