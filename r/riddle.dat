At the urgent and tearful imploring of his bride, Samson told her the solution, and she told it to the thirty groomsmen.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Bruce and Utsler {{attempted}} {{to obtain a}} contract with a major record label. The duo eventually {{signed a contract with}} the short-lived Jive Records sub-label Battery Records, which released the group's third studio album, <b>Riddle</b> Box, on October 10, 1995. After Battery/Jive Records showed little interest in promoting the album, Insane Clown Posse funded the promotion of <b>Riddle</b> Box independently. This effort led the group to Dallas, Texas, where it persuaded several music retail stores to stock the album. Sales averaged 1,500 copies per week as a result.|$|E
5000|$|Anglo-Saxon <b>riddles</b> {{are part}} of Anglo-Saxon literature. The most famous Anglo-Saxon <b>riddles</b> {{are found in the}} Exeter Book. This book {{contains}} secular and religious poems and other writings, along with a collection of 94 <b>riddles,</b> although there is speculation {{that there may have been}} closer to 100 <b>riddles</b> in the book. The <b>riddles</b> are written in a similar manner, but [...] "it is unlikely that the whole collection was written by one person." [...] It is more likely that many scribes worked on this collection of <b>riddles.</b> Although the Exeter Book has a unique and extensive collection of Anglo-Saxon <b>riddles,</b> <b>riddles</b> were not uncommon during this era. <b>Riddles</b> were both comical and obscene.|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{previously}} {{researchers had}} tended to take <b>riddles</b> {{out of their}} social performance contexts, the rise of anthropology in the post-War period encouraged more researchers to study the social role of <b>riddles</b> and <b>riddling.</b> However, wide-ranging studies of <b>riddles</b> {{have tended to be}} limited to Western countries, with Oriental and African <b>riddles</b> being relatively neglected.|$|R

He cancelled two weeks of shows and spent time recovering from the shock in Barbados. In March, he performed in front of Princess Margaret at the Royal Albert Hall in London, raising money for the NSPCC. On March 14, he recorded with Nelson <b>Riddle</b> for the last time, recording the songs Linda, Sweet Loraine, and Barbara. The two men had a major falling out, and later patched up their differences in January 1985 at a dinner organized for Ronald Reagan, when Sinatra asked <b>Riddle</b> to make another album with him. <b>Riddle</b> was ill at the time, and died that October, before they had a chance to record.|$|E

50|$|In the {{competitive}} Greek societies, words were a primary locus of competition: {{there can be}} no doubt about the popularity of wordplay in the Greek world. <b>Riddles</b> shared in this popularity: sympotic <b>riddles</b> are particularly well attested--it seems there was no symposium without a fair number of <b>riddles.</b> The contest-riddle was a known form of <b>riddling.</b> So <b>riddling</b> pervaded Greek life on many levels and during many occasions.|$|R

50|$|In {{the medieval}} period, verse <b>riddles,</b> {{alongside}} other puzzles and conundra, became a significant literary {{form in the}} Arabic-speaking world, and accordingly in Islamic Persian culture. Since early Arabic and Persian poetry often features rich, metaphorical description, and ekphrasis, {{there is a natural}} overlap in style and approach between poetry generally and <b>riddles</b> specifically; literary <b>riddles</b> are therefore often a subset of the descriptive poetic form known in both traditions as wasf. <b>Riddles</b> are attested in anthologies of poetry and in prosimetrical portrayals of riddle-contests in Arabic maqāmāt and in Persian epics such as the Shahnameh. Several stories in One Thousand and One Nights involve <b>riddles.</b> In both Arabic and Persian, <b>riddles</b> seem to have become increasingly scholarly in style over time, increasingly emphasising <b>riddles</b> and puzzles in which the interpreter has resolve clues to letters and numbers to put together the word which is the <b>riddle's</b> solution.|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{testing has}} shown that Kiger Mustang is a {{descendant}} of the Spanish horse. Many of today's Kiger Mustangs {{can be traced back}} to a single stallion named Mesteño, captured with the original herd in 1977 and released back to the Kiger HMA. Several organizations exist which inspect and register Kiger Mustangs; each has their own standards for entry into the stud book. In 1988, the Kiger Mustang Association (now the Kiger Mesteño Association) was formed as the original registry for the herd. By 2013, the organization had registered around 800 horses, and annually inspects between 75 and 100 new horses. Two other associations are the Steens Mountain Kiger Registry, established in 1993, and the Kiger Horse Association and Registry. The Kiger Mustangs of the <b>Riddle</b> Mountain and Kiger HMAs are the best known herds of mustangs in Oregon, despite making up only a small portion of the population. As of 2013, the state had a total estimated BLM-managed feral horse population of almost 2,600, roaming over 17 HMAs and a Wild Horse Territory co-managed with the US Forest Service. A census taken in April 2010 found 60 Kiger Mustangs in the <b>Riddle</b> Mountain HMA and 81 in the Kiger HMA; estimates made in February 2013 list 40 horses in <b>Riddle</b> Mountain and 61 in Kiger.|$|E

5|$|Humpty Dumpty is a {{character}} in an English nursery rhyme, probably originally a <b>riddle</b> {{and one of the}} best known in the English-speaking world.

40|$|<b>Riddles</b> {{can refer}} to all spheres of human being. The thesis is based on {{contemporary}} theories and methods of cognitive linguistics and etnolinguistics: <b>riddles</b> {{can be seen as}} a specific semiotic system, which contains references to the certain way of understanding the world. The aim of this thesis is to define the linguistic picture of human being and human body in Czech folk <b>riddles.</b> The article of etnolinguist H. Kazancewa provides the methodical basis. <b>Riddles</b> can be classified: <b>riddles</b> about human ontogenesis are in the first group, rhyming <b>riddles</b> describing human body and its parts using neologisms are in the second group, <b>riddles</b> about organs and parts of the body are in the third group. Part of human body can be encoded on the basis of its appearance, or on the basis of its function, or both. Sets of organs in the second and in the third group differ. Head, hair, eyes, nose, mouth, hands (and arms) and legs appear in both groups - they have the central position in the linguistic picture of the human body in Czech. The second group of <b>riddles</b> encodes forhead, stomach, knees, feet and heels in addition. The third group of <b>riddles</b> encodes teeth, tongue, beard, fingers and ears in addition. Some parts of human body - back, buttocks, genitals - appear exceptionally or are missing. <b>Riddles</b> about [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We propose general denitions for <b>riddling</b> {{and partial}} <b>riddling</b> of a subset V of R m with nonzero Lebesgue measure and show these {{properties}} are invariant {{for a large}} class of dynamical systems.

We nd that basins of attraction can be partially <b>riddled</b> but {{if this is the case}} then any partial <b>riddling</b> must be evident near the attractor. We use these concepts to aid classication of bifurcations of attractors from invariant subspaces. In particular, our weak attractor is a generalization of the absorbing area investigated by other authors and we suggest that a transition of a basin to <b>riddling</b> is usually associated with loss of stability of a weak attractor...|$|R

5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} <b>riddle</b> game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E
