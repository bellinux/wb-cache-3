40|$|The <b>roofing</b> <b>nail</b> is an {{important}} and often a limiting factor in successfully using metal building sheets. This study has been directed toward {{an analysis of the}} problems involved and the comparative performance of typical special nails offered commercially for fastening building sheets. All nails used for fastening steel sheets exposed to the weather should have a protective coating such as galvanizing, and a head which will exclude moisture from the hole made by the nail. The tendency of nails to 2 ̆ 2 creep 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 or move outward without any apparent cause, thus necessitating renailing, has been a troublesome problem. No definite conclusions have been reached regarding the causes of this phenomenon, but some suggestions are offered for its remedy. Forces exerted by the wind and by the expansion and contraction of the metal due to changes in temperature may have some influence in loosening the nail. Creeping of nails from asphalt roofing and from boxes, however, shows that internal forces are probably of major importance. These may be the minute changes in dimension and character of the wood as it absorbs or gives up moisture. Screw shank nails probably creep less than plain shank nails, and it appears that ring shank nails will not creep. Many failures have been the result of using poor nailing girts or of carelessness {{on the part of the}} workman in failing to hit the girt...|$|E

50|$|The 20th century saw the {{manufacture}} of composition asphalt shingles which can last from a thin 20-year shingle to the thickest which are limited lifetime shingles, the cost depending on the thickness and durability of the shingle. When a layer of shingles wears out, they are usually stripped, along with the underlay and <b>roofing</b> <b>nails,</b> allowing a new layer to be installed. An alternative method is to install another layer directly over the worn layer. While this method is faster, it does not allow the roof sheathing to be inspected and water damage, often associated with worn shingles, to be repaired. Having multiple layers of old shingles under a new layer causes <b>roofing</b> <b>nails</b> to be located further from the sheathing, weakening their hold. The greatest concern with this method is that {{the weight of the}} extra material could exceed the dead load capacity of the roof structure and cause collapse. Because of this, jurisdictions which use the International Building Code prohibit the installation of new roofing on top of an existing roof that has two or more applications of any type of roof covering; the existing roofing material must be removed before installing a new roof.|$|R

50|$|All {{shingles}} were organic {{at first}} with the base material, called felt, being primarily cotton rag until the 1920s when cotton rag became more expensive and alternative materials were used. Other organic materials used as the felt included wool, jute or manila, and wood pulp. In 1926 the Asphalt Shingle and Research Institute with the National Bureau of Standards tested twenty two types of experimental felts and found {{no significant differences in}} performance. In the 1950s self-sealing and manually applied adhesives began to be used to help prevent wind damage to shingle roofs. The design standard was for the self-sealing strips of adhesive to be fully adhered after sixteen hours at 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Also in the 1950s testing on the use of 3/4 inch staples rather than <b>roofing</b> <b>nails</b> was carried out showing they could perform as well as nails but with six staples compared with four nails. In 1960 fiberglass mat bases were introduced with limited success, the lighter more flexible shingles proved to be more susceptible to wind damage particularly at freezing temperatures.

60|$|The timber {{framework}} of these houses, {{as compared with}} those of recent date, is like the skeleton of an old giant, beside the frail bones of a modern man of fashion. Many of them, by the vast strength and soundness of their oaken substance, have been preserved through a length of time which would have tried the stability of brick and stone; so that, in all the progressive decay and continual reconstruction of the street, down our own days, we shall still behold these old edifices occupying their long-accustomed sites. For instance, on the upper corner of that green lane which shall hereafter be North Street, we see the Curwen House, newly built, with the carpenters still at work on the <b>roof</b> <b>nailing</b> down the last sheaf of shingles. On the lower corner stands another dwelling,--destined, at some period of its existence, to be the abode of an unsuccessful alchemist,--which shall likewise survive to our own generation, and perhaps long outlive it. Thus, through the medium of these patriarchal edifices, we have now established a sort of kindred and hereditary acquaintance with the Main Street.|$|R
50|$|Analysis of {{the bomb}} by FBI experts {{determined}} that the explosive device was a pipe bomb with nails wrapped to its surface for shrapnel effect, {{and that it was}} equipped with a timer-armed motion trigger to ensure that it would explode only when the car was driven. The bomb was also placed on the floorboard directly under the driver's seat, not on the floorboard behind the seat as the Oakland Police Department had claimed. That evidence pointed to the bomb being an anti-personnel device placed with the intent of killing the driver of Bari's car. Despite that evidence, the FBI investigation remained focused on the theory that the explosion was an accidental detonation of a device knowingly transported by Bari, with attempts to match <b>roofing</b> <b>nails</b> transported in Bari's car to finishing nails used with the bomb. After seven weeks of continual news stories citing repeated police claims that all evidence pointed to Bari and Cherney as culprits, the Alameda County District Attorney announced that he would not file any formal charges against the pair due to insufficient evidence against them. Law enforcement agencies never followed through on the evidence that the bombing was an attempt on Bari's life and the crime would go unsolved.|$|R

Use of noninvasive hair sampling to survey these reclusive species has great potential as an alternative, with wide applicability in ecology and conservation. Hairtrapping has been extensively used for focal studies of temperate mammals, but its use and applicability {{as a means to}} survey mammals in tropical environs has never been addressed. We evaluated the effectiveness. of 2 hairtrap types and 2 scents along an elevational gradient within El Cielo Biosphere Reserve (ECBR, Mexico) to detect presence of carnivores. Hairtraps that used <b>roofing</b> <b>nails</b> as a haircollecting surface collected more hairs and detected a greater number of species than did hairtraps that used velcro, strips. Different scent treatments (commercial freagrance and catnip oil) did not differ for these same variables. Of successful nail hairtraps, 60 % collected >= 20 hairs (max. = 439), providing enough material for DNA analyses. Hairtrap surveys detected 74 % of the potential target mammal species at ECBR with only 19 days of field effort. Developing countries have limited budgets for biodiversity monitoring and hairtraps compare favorably with other methods with a high costbenefit ratio. Hairtraps are inexpensive, portable, can be made with overthecounter materials, and can be successfully used to collect data applicable to population and genetic studies of tropical carnivores...|$|R

40|$|Clout {{developed}} out {{of sustained}} interest by Bracey into {{the expansion of}} painting into other media and with breaking down and questioning the boundaries of what painting can be, in terms of media and subject. Through further research into {{the power of the}} miniature and media’s use of image, Bracey spent one year producing Clout. The work consists of 7000 individual paintings on the heads of <b>roofing</b> <b>nails,</b> 1000 of which were shown in John Moores exhibition. Each painting portrayed a different image and subject, reflecting the visual saturation of contemporary culture. The miniaturisation process seduces the viewer into closer engagement and micro-curated exhibitions emerge through viewer choices and interests. From the large choice available each viewer will make different selections dependant on variables of each personality such as cultural associations, eye height and attention span, reflecting wider concerns within society. The John Moores competition is widely acknowledged as Britain’s leading painting exhibition and takes place biennially to form a major component of the Liverpool Biennial. Clout was selected by 5 judges (Ann Bukantas, Gavin Turk, Gill Hedley, Callum Innes and Jarvis Cocker) from more than 1900 entries for this prestigious exhibition. Among the 55 other artists were leading artists such as Ian Davenport, Alexis Harding and Lisa Milroy. Clout came third in the visitor’s choice award for the exhibition. The exhibition also featured a 136 page catalogue (ISBN 1 - 902700 - 28 - 7) and was widely reviewed in art journal and newspapers. Clout has been further shown at Pumphouse gallery, London; Chapter, Cardiff; Draiocht, Dublin Firstsite in Colchester and Aspex, Portsmouth...|$|R

40|$|For this {{exhibition}} Bracey {{was commissioned by}} curator Annabel Lucas and firstsite gallery {{to develop a new}} body of work inspired by research into zoo design and parallels between issues of display common to galleries and zoos. The resulting artwork culled from experiences of both, to produce a hybrid system of the two, a major concern being that the visitor to the gallery constructs their own route of experience, rather than following a prescribed formula. 26 individual pieces were made from a host of media. Although there was only one traditional oil painting on canvas, all of the work was a questioning of painting in the expanded field. Examples of other outcomes are photography, origami, laser cut acrylic plastic and my first foray into video. The work continued issues related to the miniature, and of several units combining to make a whole, both in individual pieces and the exhibition as a whole. The series was commissioned by Firstsite through a research and development stipend of £ 4, 155. New work was shown alongside earlier work at Colchester: Palette (1997 -present); an ongoing oil painting, Healthy Snacks (2002 / 3); a mountain of colour, created with pistachio shells, Clout (2003 - 6), thousands of painted <b>roofing</b> <b>nails</b> and Various Titles (2004 / 5); hundreds of small canvases. To accompany the Colchester exhibition, Bracey I wrote and designed a guide pamphlet, delivered 2 public talks and a Firstsite paper was produced with a commissioned essay by Judith Palmer.
