40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore joint place {{branding}} in <b>rural</b> <b>regions,</b> focusing on cooperation between the various stakeholders involved and on the salient features of <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> that are used in the place branding process. Branding is conceptualized as a social process where brand value is co-created by the stakeholders. Place branding is seen as a participative process, bringing stakeholders together with the aim to strengthen the identity of the place. The fundamental question is how to build long-term commitment in a group of key stakeholders. Many sources discuss place branding for large cities, but <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> have received little attention. The process of place branding was investigated for three <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> in Finland. The cooperation in the network of actors was addressed through focus group interviews. Place branding in <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> is a process needing the combined effort of various stakeholders. Although public organizations are needed to create the preconditions for a joint approach, the efforts of private operators engaged in mutually beneficial relationships are at the heart of successful place branding. The findings show that the establishment of a body to coordinate actions is essential for any place branding effort. It is also suggested that the meaning of landscape is especially important for place branding in <b>rural</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} it is {{examined}} whether <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> in the EU {{with a relatively}} high (low) employment growth in the 1980 s and early 1990 s have some common socio-economic characterics, which {{can contribute to the}} explanation of their employment performance. We have grouped the socio-economic characterics around the headings "local resources", "economic activities" and "supply of labour". We base our analysis on 465 regions in the EU 15, which we have divided into three groups: most <b>rural</b> <b>regions,</b> intermediate regions and most urban regions. Within each of these groups we have made a further distinction into leading (i. e. high non-agricultural employment growth) and lagging (i. e. low non-agricultural employment growth) regions. The analysis shows that leading <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> have both growth of industrial employment and services employment and show a population growth as well, whereas in lagging <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> population growth stagnates. Besides, leading <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> tend to have a lower unemployment rate than lagging regions and tend to have a higher infrastructure endowment (highways, railways and waterways). On the other hand for quite a number of socio-economic indicators hardly any differences have been found between leading and lagging <b>rural</b> <b>regions,</b> like participation rates, education level of the population, average firm size, share of female employed in total employment and the share of farm holders with other gainful activities...|$|R

The ecclesiastical link with the Moscow Patriarchate was immediately restored. Within months nearly a million Orthodox pilgrims, from all over the country, fearing that these reclaimed western parishes would share the fate of others in the USSR, took the chance to visit them. However, the Soviet authorities, although confiscating some of the public property, did not show the repressions of the post-revolutionary period that many expected and no executions or physical destruction took place.|$|E
25|$|The land reform, {{implemented}} by Sfatul Țării in 1918–1919, {{resulted in a}} rise of a middle class, as 87% of the region's population lived in rural areas. The reform was however marred by {{the small size of}} the awarded plots, as well as by preferential allotment of land to politicians and administrative personnel who had supported the political goals of the Romanian government. Generally, urban development and industry were insignificant, and the region remained primarily an agrarian <b>rural</b> <b>region</b> throughout the interwar period. Certain improvements were achieved in the area of education, the literacy rate rising from 15.6% in 1897 to 37% by 1930; however, Bessarabia continued to lag behind the rest of the country, the national literacy rate being 60%. During the inter-war period, Romanian authorities also conducted a program of Romanianization that sought to assimilate ethnic minorities throughout the country. The enforcement of this policy was especially pervasive in Bessarabia due to its highly diverse population, and resulted in the closure of minority educational and cultural institutions.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s and 40s, {{there was}} a second wave of migration. This new group, mostly landless peasants, is known as the Zabbaleen. The {{descendants}} of subsistence farmers, the Zabbaleen originate from the El Badari district in Asyut, a <b>rural</b> <b>region</b> in Upper Egypt, which is the southern part of Egypt. As farming ceased to be a viable way of life, the Zabbaleen faced economic hardships which prompted them to migrate to Cairo in search of work. Henceforth, the Wahiya collaborated with the Zabbaleen, who purchased waste from the Wahiya for use as fodder for pig farming. Initially, the Zabbaleen settled in the Imbaba district of the Giza governorate, but were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970. Thereafter, the Zabbaleen settled mainly in an abandoned quarry {{at the foot of the}} Mokattam hills, east of Cairo, which is under the jurisdiction of the Cairo Governorate. Although the governor of Cairo granted the Zabbaleen administrative permission to settle in the area, he did not issue a lease or legal tenure. Thus, because of their precarious situation, the Zabbaleen initially lived in makeshift settlements of tin huts, made mostly of barrels that the Zabbaleen found amongst the waste that they collected. This Zabbaleen community later emerged as the informal garbage collectors and recyclers of Cairo. The literal meaning of the word Zabbaleen is garbage-men (singular: Zabbal). The Zabbaleen are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means pig pen operators, because they raise pigs that eat the organic components of the waste that they collect.|$|E

40|$|To {{account for}} {{differences}} among <b>rural</b> and urban <b>regions,</b> the OECD {{has established a}} regional typology, classifying TL 3 regions as predominantly urban (PU), intermediate (IN) or predominantly rural (PR).

This paper suggests a refinement of the current typology to include a criterion on the accessibility to urban centres. The results show a clear distinction between remote <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> and <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> close to a city in terms of declining and ageing population, level of productivity and unemployment. This extended typology, which includes a measure of distance from cities for the population living in a rural area, has been first applied to Europe by the Directorate of Regional Policy of the European Commission and then to North America by the OECD...|$|R
40|$|Surveys were {{conducted}} in one urban and two <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> of the United Republic of Cameroon to estimate the annual incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis. Three different survey methods were used: a review of hospital and clinic registers, a school survey, and a house-to-house survey. The house-to-house survey identified {{the highest number of}} lame children and gave estimates of incidence of between 18. 8 and 32. 6 per 100 000 population in the three regions. The estimates of incidence obtained by the two other survey methods in the urban region did not differ significantly from that obtained by house-to-house survey but, in the <b>rural</b> <b>regions,</b> were significantly lower. It is concluded that house-to-house surveys are a sensitive method of identifying lame children in both urban and <b>rural</b> <b>regions.</b> School surveys and review of hospital and clinic registers, while equally sensitive in urban regions, are less sensitive in <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> and may significantly underestimate the annual incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis. These limitations should be borne in mind when using the survey methods...|$|R

Moreover, the Ottomans did not countenance that a semi-literate Arabic-speaking peasant from a <b>rural</b> <b>region</b> such as Keserwan {{would serve as a}} representative of the Tanzimat. They reacted to Shahin's revolt negatively, although the provincial Ottoman authorities of Beirut generally felt powerless to act against the peasant rebels due to a lack of funds and forces on the ground.

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{comparative}} analysis of factors hampering and encouraging {{the development of}} employment in 9 leading and 9 lagging regions in the EU during the 1980 s and {{the first half of}} the 1990 s is made. Derived from this comparative analysis, some lessons, which leading and lagging <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> can learn from each other with regard to employment creation, are given. During the period 1980 - 1995 leading <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> tend to have both growth in industrial employment and in services employment. Besides, in this period leading <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> showed also a population growth, whereas that in lagging <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> stagnated. Leading <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> are characterized by a rather well developed road infrastructure relatively to lagging regions. So in leading regions infrastructure is no serious economic constraint for entrepreneurs, whereas the poorer condition of infrastructure in lagging regions hampers economic development. On the whole actors in leading regions show a better developed capacity than actors in lagging regions. This is for example reflected in the way in which they co-operate with other actors inside and outside the region, in which they face challenges, in which they innovate and in which they launch projects in line with the strengths and needs of the region. Due to the higher capacity of actors in leading regions, both internal and external networks are rather strong. Lessons, which may be helpful in the creation of employment in <b>rural</b> <b>regions,</b> are: design projects according to the strengths of the region, integrate infrastructure into a broader development concept, follow a multisectoral approach in employment creation, tourism is not the only solution, involve a wide range of local actors in the development process and strengthen both internal and external networks...|$|R
