5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, workers will pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc {{objected to}} the use of his troops in the attack on Royan in April 1945. As a result, only part of 2e DB was employed. The {{division}} rejoined Seventh Army, crossing the Rhine on 25 April, and joining the pursuit into Bavaria. Leclerc visited Dachau concentration camp after its liberation by the Americans. In an incident that took place 8 May 1945 at Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria, he was presented with a defiant group of captured Frenchmen of the SS Charlemagne Division. He asked them why they wore a German uniform, to which one of them replied by asking why Leclerc wore an American one. Leclerc told his men to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> That was taken as a death sentence. The group of French Waffen-SS men was summarily executed by the RMT without any form of military tribunal procedure, and their bodies left where they fell until an American burial team collected them. For his services leading the 2e DB, Leclerc was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour.|$|E

Of the engines from Norfolk and Western (NW) and Southern, many were equipped with high short hoods. Although these locomotives are aging, a significant number of 'high hoods' still remain on the roster as of January 2017.

25|$|Practice of good {{oral hygiene}} {{including}} daily brushing, flossing {{and the use}} of appropriate mouthwash can significantly reduce the number of oral bacteria, including S. mutans and inhibit their proliferation. S. mutans often live in dental plaque, hence mechanical removal of plaque is an effective way of getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> However, there are some remedies used in the treatment of oral bacterial infection, in conjunction with mechanical cleaning. These include Fluoride, which has a direct inhibitory effect on the enolase enzyme, as well as Chlorhexidine, which works presumably by interfering with bacterial adherence.|$|E

25|$|Paul VI did renounce many {{traditional}} {{symbols of the}} papacy and the Catholic Church; some of his changes to the papal dress were reversed by Pope Benedict XVI in the early 21st century. Refusing a Vatican army of colourful military uniforms from centuries, he got <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> He became the first pope to visit five continents. Paul VI systematically continued and completed the efforts of his predecessors, to turn the Euro-centric Church into a Church of the world, by integrating the bishops from all continents in its government and in the Synods which he convened. His 6 August 1967 motu proprio Pro Comperto Sane opened the Roman Curia to the bishops of the world. Until then, only Cardinals could be leading members of the Curia.|$|E

25|$|At {{the peak}} of the terror, the {{slightest}} hint of counter-revolutionary thoughts or activities (or, {{as in the case of}} Jacques Hébert, revolutionary zeal exceeding that of those in power) could place one under suspicion, and trials did not always proceed according to contemporary standards of due process. Sometimes people died for their political opinions or actions, but many for little reason beyond mere suspicion, or because some others had a stake in getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Most of the victims received an unceremonious trip to the guillotine in an open wooden cart (the tumbrel). In the rebellious provinces, the government representatives had unlimited authority and some engaged in extreme repressions and abuses. For example, Jean-Baptiste Carrier became notorious for the Noyades ("drownings") he organised in Nantes; his conduct was judged unacceptable even by the Jacobin government and he was recalled.|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} of Saakadze {{and the death of}} Shah Abbas I in 1629, Teimuraz {{proceeded}} to strengthen his authority in eastern Georgia. He instigated Zurab of Aragvi to murder Semayun Khan, an Iranian-appointed rival king of Kartli in 1630, and then had Zurab assassinated, thereby getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> both. By the early 1630s, Teimuraz I had gained more or less stable control of both Kartli and Kakheti. Determined to eliminate the Safavid hegemony over Georgia, Teimuraz sent his ambassador, Niciphores Irbachi, to Western Europe and requested the aid from Philip IV of Spain and Pope Urban VIII. However, the rulers of Europe were too involved in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) {{to be concerned about the}} fate of a small Caucasian kingdom, and nothing came of this mission, the publication of the first Georgian printed book Dittionario giorgiano e italiano ("Georgian-Italian Dictionary"; Rome, 1629) by Stefano Paolini and Niciphores Irbachi being the only result of this embassy.|$|E
25|$|Rossakoff {{arrives at}} Poirot's flat. She happily confesses to Poirot that {{she put the}} jewels in the professor's pocket as she had found them in her own bag when the raid started, and {{so she had to}} get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as quickly as she could. It was Varesco who planted them on her and she admits that he is the true owner of the premises. Poirot takes her into the next room where Higgs and Cerberus are waiting. Higgs can handle any dog and took the {{otherwise}} fierce animal out during the raid. Poirot asks Rossakoff to order the obedient dog to drop what it is holding in its mouth and it does so. A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|E
