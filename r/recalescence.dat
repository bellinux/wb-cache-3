50|$|<b>Recalescence</b> is an {{increase}} in temperature that occurs while cooling metal when a change in structure with {{an increase}} in entropy occurs. The heat responsible for the change in temperature is due to the change in entropy. When a structure transformation occurs the Gibbs free energy of both structures are more or less the same. Therefore the process will be exothermic. The heat provided is the latent heat.|$|E
40|$|International audienceNucleation undercoolings are {{measured}} {{for the primary}} dendritic structure and for the eutectic structure in aluminum-copper samples solidified during electromagnetic levitation. The recorded cooling curves are {{used to determine the}} heat extraction rate and the solidification times. Metallurgical characterizations consist of composition measurements using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry and analyses of SEM images. The distribution maps drawn for the average copper composition, the volume fraction of the eutectic structure and the dendrite arm spacing reveal strong correlations. An equiaxed solidification model based on mass and heat balances is developed for the interpretation of the measurements. The model predicts the effect of diffusion in the liquid and in the solid, as well as the consequences of the <b>recalescences</b> occurring immediately after the nucleation of the primary dendritic structure and the eutectic structure. The nucleation undercooling of the eutectic structure is shown to be a key parameter for a quantitative prediction of the fraction of phases in the solidified samples...|$|R
50|$|Solidification {{occurs in}} two steps: {{nucleation}} and crystal growth. In the nucleation stage solid particles form within the liquid. When these particles form their internal energy {{is lower than}} the surrounded liquid, which creates an energy interface between the two. The formation of the surface at this interface requires energy, so as nucleation occurs the material actually undercools, that is it cools below its freezing temperature, because of the extra energy required to form the interface surfaces. It then <b>recalescences,</b> or heats back up to its freezing temperature, for the crystal growth stage. Note that nucleation occurs on a pre-existing solid surface, because not as much energy is required for a partial interface surface, as is for a complete spherical interface surface. This can be advantageous because fine-grained castings possess better properties than coarse-grained castings. A fine grain structure can be induced by grain refinement or inoculation, which is the process of adding impurities to induce nucleation.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWithin NEQUISOL project, {{crystallisation}} kinetics and microstructure {{evolution in}} undercooled melts of Al-based alloys is investigated. Different techniques are applied for containerless processing {{of the different}} alloys. These allow for undercooling a liquid far below its equilibrium melting temperature. An undercooled melt is in a metastable state giving access of different solidification pathways the system can take. Solidification starts with nucleation and is completed by subsequent growth of crystals. The negative temperature gradient {{in front of the}} solid-liquid interface and the concentration gradient in alloys destabilize a planar interface leading to dendrite growth. Dendrite growth dynamics and microstructure evolution in undercooled melts is investigated on drops undercooled by Electro-Magnetic Levitation (EML). The speed of the propagating solidification front is monitored by means of a high-speed camera with a maximum frequency of 120 000 pictures per second. Under Earth conditions strong alternating electromagnetic fields are needed to compensate the gravitational force. This, in turn, causes forced convection due to the strong stirring effects. Therefore, equivalent experiments are conducted under microgravity conditions using the TEMPUS facility for electromagnetic levitation in reduced gravity during parabolic flights and during TEXUS sounding rocket missions. Experiments on four selected alloys, Al 40 Ni 60, Al 70 Ni 30, Al 65 Ni 35 and Al 89 Cu 11 are in preparation to be performed on board the ISS using the Electro-Magnetic Levitator currently under development by DLR/ESA. In addition atomization facilities are operated that combines containerless processing with large cooling rates and reduced gravity on Earth. Atomization is an industrial processing route to produce metastable materials in large amount. We present a comparison of first experiments conducted in reduced gravity (parabolic flight, TEXUS) and reference experiments on Earth of measurements of the growth velocity as a function of undercooling of the congruently melt-ing Al 50 Ni 50 alloy and the Raney type alloy Al 68. 5 Ni 31. 5. The latter one is of special interest for industry because of its extraordinary potency as a catalyst. The experiments clearly demonstrate how important convection is in heat and mass transport processes which control dendrite growth dynamics and, hence, microstructure evolution. A sharp interface theory is presented that takes into account heat and mass transport by forced convection. This mesoscopic model is able to predict the dendrite growth kinetics obtained both on Earth as well as in reduced gravity. In addition, mesoscopic modelling is combined with macroscopic modelling to describe the entire solidification process involving several <b>recalescences</b> and the non-equilibrium solidification of several solid microstructures...|$|R

For undercoolings < 60 K, a microstructure consisting of mixed anomalous and lamellar eutectic is observed. Analysis of eutectic spacing in the lamellar eutectic reveals little dependence upon the undercooling of the bulk melt and is consistent with growth at an undercooling of 1. 5 K. Depending upon undercooling, {{the progress of the}} <b>recalescence</b> front may be either continuous or spasmodic, wherein periods of rapid growth are separated by significant interludes in which growth totally arrests. Analysis of spot brightness profiles reveals that, during continuous growth, the <b>recalescence</b> is characteristic of the advancement of a planar, space-filling front, while a double <b>recalescence</b> occurs during spasmodic growth, the first of which is characteristic of the propagation of a dendritic, or non-space-filling, front.

40|$|Solidification {{of metal}} alloys with initial high undercoolings occurs with rapid <b>recalescence</b> due to rapid heat {{release of the}} latent heat of fusion.

The rapid heating during <b>recalescence</b> alters the initially solidified structures, in ways that must include partial remelting, ripening, coarsening, and decomposition of the rapidly solidified primary metastable or supersaturated phases. New ways to study the solidification and remelting phenomena associated with the rapid heating during <b>recalescence</b> of undercooled alloys were developed. The phenomena are studied by using: (1) emulsions of iron and nickel base alloys in viscous liquid carriers; and (2) rapid heating of metal samples by electric discharge, using a technique similar to the exploding wire process (EWP), except with less power input.

Double <b>recalescence</b> was observed at all undercoolings, with crystal growth velocities being measured for the first <b>recalescence</b> event. These velocities were extremely low, with a maximum value of 0. 018 m s- 1 being recorded. At all undercoolings a eutectic structure was observed, comprising alternating lamellae of single phase Œ≥(Ni 31 Si 12) and Ni-rich lamellae containing of a fine (200 - 400 nm) dispersion of Œ≤Ni 3 Si and Œ±Ni.

We postulate that the direct solidification of Œ≤Ni 3 Si from the melt is suppressed, with an Œ±-Œ≥ eutectic being formed instead.

40|$|The {{solidification}} microstructure in wedge-shaped castings of Cu-Ni-Ti-Zr glass forming alloys is investigated, while the composition was systematically varied. Near the critical thickness for glass formation, a spatially inhomogeneous dispersion of nanocrystals is observed, where spherical regions contain {{a much higher}} density of nanocrystals than the surrounding material. This microstructure is inconsistent with the prevalent theories for crystallization in metallic glasses, which predict a spatially uniform distribution of crystals. The spatial localization of the nucleation density is attributed to a <b>recalescence</b> instability. Linear stability analysis of the equations for heat flow coupled with crystal nucleation and growth reveals that at low temperature <b>recalescence</b> can occur locally, triggered by a small fluctuation {{in the early stages}} of the crystallization process, because in deeply undercooled liquids the nucleation rate increases with temperature. The localized <b>recalescence</b> events and their interaction accelerate crystallization; consequently they are important in determining the glass forming ability as well as the microstructure of these alloys. The composition dependence of the critical thickness for glass formation, determined from the observed microstructures, and in situ small angle scattering results indicate that the crystallization occurs in several steps, involving competing crystalline phase...|$|E
40|$|During rapid solidification, a molten {{sample is}} cooled below its {{equilibrium}} solidification temperature {{to form a}} metastable liquid. Once nucleation is initiated, growth of the solid phase proceeds and {{can be seen as}} a sudden rise in temperature. The heat of fusion is rejected ahead of the growing dendrites into the undercooled liquid in a process known as <b>recalescence.</b> Fe-Cr-Ni alloys may form several equilibrium phases and the hypoeutectic alloys, with compositions near the commercially important 316 stainless steel alloy, are observed to solidify by way of a two-step process known as double <b>recalescence.</b> During double <b>recalescence,</b> the first temperature rise is associated with formation of the metastable ferritic solid phase with subsequent conversion to the stable austenitic phase during the second temperature rise. Selection of which phase grows into the undercooled melt during primary solidification may be accomplished by choice of the appropriate nucleation trigger material or by control of the processing parameters during rapid solidification. Due to the highly reactive nature of the molten sample material and in order to avoid contamination of the undercooled melt, a containerless electromagnetic levitation (EML) processing technique is used. In ground-based EML, the same forces that support the weight of the sample against gravity also drive convection in the liquid sample. However, in microgravity, the force required to position the sample is greatly reduced, so convection may be controlled over a wide range of internal flows. Space Shuttle experiments have shown that the double <b>recalescence</b> behavior of Fe-Cr-Ni alloys changes between ground and space EML experiments.
