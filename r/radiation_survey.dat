25|$|Following {{a single}} IND (improvised nuclear device) {{detonation}} in the US, the National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center(NARAC) would, within minutes to at most hours, after the detonation have a reliable prediction of the fallout plume size and direction, and when armed with this prediction would then begin attempting to corroborate this with readings from <b>radiation</b> <b>survey</b> meter equipment that would fly over {{close to the}} ground in the affected area by means of helicopter or drone(UAV) aircraft on material intelligence gathering missions. Which would also follow within tens of minutes to at most hours after the detonation.|$|E
25|$|In {{respect to}} the other {{non-lethal}} weapon effects from an IND detonated {{on or near the}} surface, the detonation's blast wave would likely produce a momentary electric grid blackout due to the loss of a large portion of a city's electrical equipment drawing power/electrical load, while the electromagnetic pulse(EMP) from a surface/ground-burst explosion would cause little damage outside the blast area, so cell phone towers that survive the blast should be capable of carrying communications. Although if communications during the 9/11 attacks or after a major hurricane are anything to go by, and the cell phone network towers survive, the service would be overloaded(a Mass call event) and thereby made useless soon after; however, if prior arrangements between the cell network and emergency responders are made to give them priority and bar access to all other individuals, then it may be an effective service. However, as Civil defense(CD) shelters, as depicted in the film, were stocked for such an eventuality, they contained amongst other things, at least one CDV-715 <b>radiation</b> <b>survey</b> meter and a CD emergency radio receiver which would respectively be used to facilitate a safe delayed evacuation, regardless of outside help and if communications continued, inform them of the outside situation as it developed.|$|E

25|$|Even {{without an}} {{engineered}} containment building like those used today, the SL-1 reactor building contained {{most of the}} radioactivity, though iodine-131 levels on plants during several days of monitoring reached fifty times background levels downwind. <b>Radiation</b> <b>surveys</b> of the Support Facilities Building, for example, indicated high contamination in halls, but light contamination in offices.|$|R
2500|$|Numerous <b>radiation</b> <b>surveys</b> {{and cleanup}} {{of the surface}} of the burial ground and {{surrounding}} area have been performed in the years since the SL-1 incident. Aerial surveys were performed by EG Las Vegas in 1974, 1982, 1990, and 1993. The Radiological and Environmental Sciences Laboratory conducted gamma <b>radiation</b> <b>surveys</b> every 3 to 4 years between 1973 and 1987 and every year between 1987 and 1994. Particle-picking at the site was performed in 1985 and 1993. Results from the surveys indicated that cesium-137 and its progeny (decay products) are the primary surface-soil contaminants. During a survey of surface soil in June 1994, [...] "hot spots," [...] areas of higher radioactivity, were found within the burial ground with activities ranging from 0.1 to 50 milliroentgen (mR)/hour. On November 17, 1994, the highest radiation reading measured at 2.5 feet (0.75 m) above the surface at the SL-1 burial ground was 0.5 mR/hour; local background radiation was 0.2 mR/hour. A 1995 assessment by the EPA recommended that a cap be placed over the burial mounds. The primary remedy for SL-1 was to be containment by capping with an engineered barrier constructed primarily of native materials. This remedial action was completed in 2000 and first reviewed by the EPA in 2003.|$|R

50|$|Large {{variations}} in dose were possible {{depending on the}} machine design, displacement of the shielding materials, and the time and frequency of use. <b>Radiation</b> <b>surveys</b> showed that American machines delivered an average of 13 roentgen (r) (roughly 0.13 sievert (Sv) of equivalent dose in modern units) to the customer's feet during a typical 20 second viewing, with one capable of delivering 116 r (~1 Sv) in 20 seconds. British Pedoscopes were about ten times less powerful. A customer might try several shoes in a day, or return several times in a year, and radiation dose effects may be cumulative.

2500|$|On 9 June, staff {{entered the}} Reactor Building to conduct <b>radiation</b> <b>surveys.</b> [...] On 25 June and the {{following}} day boric acid dissolved in 90 tons of water was pumped into the spent fuel pool of Reactor 3. Concrete debris from the March hydrogen explosion of the reactor building have been detected in the spent fuel pool. In June TEPCO discovered that {{the water in the}} pool was strongly alkaline: the pH had reached a value of 11.2. Leaching of calcium hydroxide (portlandite) or calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) from the concrete could have caused this. The alkaline water could accelerate the corrosion of the aluminium racks holding the spent fuel rods. If the fuel assemblies would fall, this could lead to re-criticality. In the mean time preparative works began to install a recirculation cooling system at the fuel pool, that should be operational in the first weeks of July.|$|R
