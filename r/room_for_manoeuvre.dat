5|$|In 1914, the Australian Army mostly copied British Army doctrine, {{in as much}} as one existed semi-officially in {{the form}} of the Field Service Regulations. Pre-war {{planning}} had largely seen the Australian Army focus on defending the continent from invasion with a relatively small force, and as a result any future war was thought to likely be a highly mobile one. This was in contrast to the offensive focus of many British and European theorists of this time, despite their influence on local professional military debate. As a result, there was an emphasis on entrenchments, and whilst there was a recognition of the problems posed by increasing firepower as a result of the continued development of small arms and artillery technology, there was considered to be little requirement for the direct assault of static defensive positions given the <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> afforded by the vastness of the Australian continent. Meanwhile, in order to be compatible with British forces, pre-war agreements ensured that Australian Army units were mostly organised, trained and equipped in accordance with British Army doctrine and establishment tables.|$|E
5|$|While Marlborough {{fought in}} the Low Countries a series of {{personal}} and party rivalries instigated a general reversal of fortune. The Whigs, who were the main prop of the war, had been laying siege to Godolphin. As a price for supporting {{the government in the}} next parliamentary session, the Whigs demanded a share of public office with the appointment of a leading member of their Junto, the Earl of Sunderland (Marlborough's son-in-law), to the post of Secretary of State. The Queen, who loathed Sunderland and the Junto, and who refused to be dominated by any single party, bitterly opposed the move; but Godolphin, increasingly dependent on Whig support, had little <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> With Sarah's tactless, unsubtle backing, Godolphin relentlessly pressed the Queen to submit to Whig demands. In despair, Anne finally relented and Sunderland received the seals of office; but the special relationship between Godolphin, Sarah, and the Queen had taken a severe blow and she began to turn increasingly to a new favourite – Sarah's cousin, Abigail Masham. Anne also became ever more reliant on the advice of Harley, who, convinced that the duumvirate's policy of appeasing the Whig Junto was unnecessary, had set himself up as alternative source of advice to a sympathetic Queen.|$|E

One of the major issues Sargsyan faces was the emigration from Armenian that started at the period of the decline of the Soviet regime.

25|$|Whilst {{maintaining}} the British claim, the British Government considered {{a transfer of}} sovereignty {{less than two years}} before the outbreak of war. However, the British Government had limited <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> owing to the strength of the Falkland Islands lobby in the Houses of Parliament. Any measure that the Foreign Office suggested on the sovereignty issue was loudly condemned by the islanders, who reiterated their determination to remain British. This led to the British Government maintaining a position that the right to self-determination of the islanders was paramount. But Argentina did not recognise the rights of the islanders, and so negotiations on the sovereignty issue remained at a stalemate.|$|E
25|$|On 28 February, Rommel, Messe and {{the senior}} {{armoured}} unit commanders met to discuss an attack on Medenine, the junction of several roads and tracks. An attack from three directions was suggested, from Toujane to Metameur on the left, an attack in the centre and {{an attack on the}} right from the Hallouf Pass to Medenine. Rommel suggested an attack nearer the coast to create the possibility of attacking from an unexpected direction but the subordinates disagreed because of information from reconnaissances by the Afrika Korps that the coastal approaches were difficult, mined and covered by many guns. There was no <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> and the tanks would be easy targets for British artillery and aircraft. Rommel gave way and the plan was drawn up by Messe and Lieutenant-General Heinz Ziegler, the temporary commander of the Afrika Korps.|$|E

German armoured units had encountered the same problems of lack of observation and <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> as the Allies. A lack of infantry {{and the effect of}} Allied artillery fire, made co-operation much more difficult and made direct command almost impossible. Operation Martlet had achieved its purpose, in distracting and inflicting attrition on the German forces opposite. Daglish wrote in 2007, that although XXX Corps had failed to reach its objective, German attention was diverted from the area of Operation Epsom and that tanks in the area had been sent westwards to counter-attack the gap forced by the 49th Division, leaving them out of position when the main attack by VIII Corps began.|$|E

25|$|The Channel coast was {{a natural}} obstacle, {{only a few hundred}} {{kilometres}} from the German border and over such a distance, motorised supply from railheads could function, using the dense west European road network and by living off the land, amidst the highly developed agriculture of western Europe, unlike in Poland where it had been much harder to maintain momentum. Tooze concluded that although the German victory of 1940 was not determined by brute force, the Wehrmacht did not rewrite the rules of war or succeed only because of the ardour of German soldiers and French pacifism. The odds against Germany were not so extreme as to be insurmountable by better planning for an offensive based on the familiar principles of Bewegungskrieg (manoeuvre warfare). The German army managed to concentrate a hugely powerful force at the decisive point but took a gamble of great magnitude that could not be repeated if the attack failed. When the Germans attempted to repeat the success of 1940 against the Soviet Union in 1941, little was left in reserve. The Red Army had a greater margin of numerical superiority, better leadership and more <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> and the Napoleonic principle of the concentration of superior force at the decisive point was impossible for the Germans to achieve.|$|E
2500|$|The Slovenes {{were aware}} {{that they would not}} be able to deter the YPA forces for an {{extended}} period of time. Under Defence Minister Janez Janša, they adopted a strategy based on an asymmetric warfare approach. TO units would carry out a guerrilla campaign, using anti-tank weapons and anti-aircraft missiles to ambush YPA units. Tank columns could be trapped by destroying the lead and rear vehicles in favourable terrain — for instance, on a narrow mountain road where <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> was limited [...] enabling the rest to be tackled more easily. In preparation for this, the Slovenian government covertly bought lightweight missile systems from foreign suppliers, notably the SA-7 Grail (Strela) anti-aircraft missile and the German-designed Armbrust anti-tank system. Hit-and-run and delaying tactics were to be preferred and frontal clashes were to be avoided since in such situations the YPA's superior firepower would have been very difficult to overcome.|$|E
2500|$|As Antwerp fell on 9 October, Falkenhayn {{ordered the}} III Reserve Corps (5th and 6th Reserve {{divisions}} and 4th Ersatz Division) westwards {{in pursuit of}} the Belgian army. With the fall of the fortress and the arrival of Franco-British forces in the area between Lille and Dunkirk, Falkenhayn ordered the 4th Army headquarters to Flanders from Lorraine and the assembly of a new army with the XXII, XXIII, XXVI and XXVII Reserve corps, to break through the Allied forces between Menin and the sea. German cavalry of HKK 4 operating {{to the north of the}} 6th Army, had probed north-west as far as Ypres and towards Estaires in the Lys valley, then retired south across the Lys near Armentières, before moving south-west through Bailleul and Frelinghien to Laventie. The 3rd Cavalry Division found the road to Estaires blocked and 6th Cavalry Division moved through Deûlémont and Radinghem-en-Weppes to Prémesques and Fleurbaix. A skirmish occurred with French Chasseurs but reinforcements arrived to drive them off and [...] reservists were captured. The moves of the German cavalry united the divisions of HKK 4 with HKK 1 and HKK 2 but with so little <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre,</b> HKK 4 was sent north of the Lys on 11 October. Next day, HKK 4 was ordered onto the defensive as British and French cavalry advanced from the west. The 6th Army had arrived piecemeal from Lorraine, the VII Corps deploying from La Bassée towards Armentières; on 15 October the XIX Corps arrived opposite Armentières, followed by the XIII Corps from Warneton to Menin. British attacks by II Corps and III Corps against the German VII and XIX corps led to the XIII Corps being moved south as a reinforcement opposite the junction of the II and III corps.|$|E

40|$|Multilevel trade {{governance}} and transnational social regulation put democratic self-regulation under stress. A {{growing number of}} supra- and transnational norms, rules, and regulations on trade, environmental issues, or any other field of regulation, prove that we are facing another great transformation, the transformation of international relations and intergovernmental politics into law-generating fora, with government and private networks {{and a number of}} court-like institutions as central actors. This process of transnational juridification limits parliamentary <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> and comprehensively alienates many citizens submitted to transnational regulation from this process. This contribution attempts to clarify the mechanisms at work. In a second step it seeks to identify possible concepts that could grasp this transformation, and confronts them again with the problem of self-government. In a bow to the particularities of the transnational sphere, it tries to resist the methodological nation-state trap. Instead, it supports a constitutionalization of participative structures in global administrative governance. The outline, degree, and limits of such a concept are not self-explaining. The EU and its attempts to integrate civic participation, thus, may illustrate concrete outlines of such a project. This reconstruction allows for concluding observations on global structures and the constitutionalization of participatory transnational governance on a global scale...|$|R

50|$|The {{topics of}} discussions were almost {{completely}} {{unknown to the}} public. The Communists {{did their best to}} prevent wider knowledge of the negotiations, supposedly to prevent them being used as political propaganda. The Opposition Round Table agreed to this suggestion at a meeting on 10 June; this aroused suspicions they were implicated in a behind-the-scenes deal. Some smaller parties outside the table claimed an underhanded bargain between the old and new political elite was taking place without public consultation. The Opposition Round Table did its best to dissipate such suspicions. Indeed, all involved were devoted to a peaceful and democratic transition (to which the regime implicitly agreed through its acceptance of negotiations), and were nervous about uncontrolled popular mobilisation—especially as talks began before the Berlin Wall fell and Solidarity scored a decisive electoral victory. Nevertheless, the 10 June agreement severely limited its <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvring.</b> The lack of publicity did not cause conflicts between the negotiating elite of the parties and their membership, but it did cause a number of misunderstandings in society at large. It was only when the Round Table agreement was signed on 18 September that the public became fully aware of the different viewpoints represented at the round table; the plenary session dealing with its breakup was broadcast on television.|$|R

40|$|Consideration and {{coordination}} {{of all the}} interests that emerge {{in the process of}} spatial planning usually result in a number of conflicts. This is, among other issues, a consequence of rigid protective sectorial guidelines and the absence of comprehensive planning. It is, however, possible to avoid this by assuring proper spatial information and a coordinated process of spatial planning and strategic environmental assessment that comes with it. This article derives from the assumption that the presentation of spatial status and sectorial guidelines, both obligatory by law for the preparation and assessment of plans in spatial planning, make this possible in a limited way, and it therefore makes sense to use analytic spatial planning tools as well. The practicability of the results gained by the vulnerability analysis and the possibility of creating strategic environmental premises preparation has been verified on the environmental protection background documents for the Municipality of Piran Spatial plan. The results show that vulnerability analysis, in comparison to presentation of spatial status, gives a better idea of more or less sensitive areas as well as its individual components and thus allows more <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> the coordination of interests and for a more objective assessment of impacts on the environment. The analysis makes it possible to upgrade the protection guidelines of the sectors by preparing conceptually clearer direction for the protection and development of individual environmental components and by preparing comprehensive environmental premises that enable us to be more effective and sustainable in comprehensive spatial planning...|$|R

There were more noise and smoke, than there was bloodshed, as commonly happens on such occasions; but these sufficed to secure the victory. The savages were soon in a real panic, and no authority of Waally's could check their flight.

40|$|New {{scientific}} developments often encounter {{problems with}} respect to public acceptance of its products. The challenge for a new scientific field –such as ecogenomics (genomics approach to assessing ecosystems of the soil) – is to realize its societal promise in a generally accepted way. It is widely acknowledged that a more appropriate societal embedding could be enhanced by addressing societal aspects and involving stakeholders early in the development process. To this end an inventory study was conducted among various stakeholders, including researchers, industry, policy makers, advisory councils and NGOs to inquire about their expectations of scientific developments, possible future applications and possible societal aspects of ecogenomics. This study was executed {{within the framework of}} the Netherlands research program on ecogenomics. Results of this study show that ecogenomics is indeed at an early stage of development; there is at the moment little agreement among stakeholders about future applications and potential societal effects. Particularly societal groups found it difficult to reflect on societal aspects because they felt that they had currently insufficient knowledge about ecogenomics –e. g. few societal groups were familiar with the term ‘ecogenomics’. In addition, it is not clear among stakeholders how and by whom the research agenda should be shaped. Findings also indicate that the course of development may still be altered relatively easily because few things (networks and technologies) have become entrenched and no controversy among stakeholders has yet arisen.
