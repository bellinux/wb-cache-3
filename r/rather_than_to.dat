5|$|Although {{of little}} {{strategic}} value and undamaged {{during the early}} stages of World War II, {{in the final stages of}} the war a number of V-1 flying bombs and V-2 ballistic missiles struck the area. The worst attack occurred in February 1945, when a V-2 struck Westbeech Road, killing 17 and injuring 68. The bombsites were redeveloped with housing in then-current styles, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> Plumbe and Earle's designs.|$|E
5|$|As head of state, Hitler became supreme {{commander}} of the armed forces. The traditional loyalty oath of servicemen was altered to affirm loyalty to Hitler personally, by name, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> the office of supreme commander or the state.

5|$|Before {{the battle}} was over, Hitler {{and several of his}} {{followers}} killed themselves. The city's garrison surrendered on 2 May but fighting continued to the north-west, west, and south-west of the city {{until the end of the}} war in Europe on 8 May (9 May in the Soviet Union) as some German units fought westward so that they could surrender to the Western Allies <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Pittsburgh {{also became}} a {{national}} model for community development, through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson, who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became {{the model for the}} nationwide NeighborWorks America. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> demolish and redevelop.|$|E
5|$|In 1824 the Weights and Measures Act imposed one {{standard}} 'imperial' system of {{weights and measures}} on the British Empire. The effect of this act was to standardise existing British units of measure <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> align them with the metric system.|$|E

5|$|Kohlberg's stages are not {{culturally}} neutral, {{as demonstrated}} by its application {{to a number of}} different cultures. Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates.

5|$|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} rewrite {{of the abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E
5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E

5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections of the train. This distinction applied to both living and dead passengers. Intended to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> provide different facilities, the carriages intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{that the}} public {{appreciated}} instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests {{that he may have}} been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E

With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
5|$|John Jeremy Thorpe {{was born}} in 1929, the son and {{grandson}} of Conservative MPs. After school at Eton, he studied law at Trinity College, Oxford, where, having decided on a political career, he devoted his main energies to making a personal impact <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> his studies. Rejecting his Conservative background, he joined the small, centrist Liberal Party, by the late 1940s a declining force in British politics but still offering a national platform and a challenge to an ambitious young politician. He became secretary, and eventually president, of the university's Liberal Club, and met many of the party's leading figures. In the Hilary term (January–March) of 1950–51 Thorpe {{served as president of}} the Oxford Union.|$|E

The ruff {{is one of the}} few lekking species in which the display is primarily directed at other males <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> the females, and it is among the small percentage of birds in which the males have well-marked and inherited variations in plumage and mating behaviour. There are three male forms: the typical territorial males, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and a very rare variant with female-like plumage. The behaviour and appearance for an individual male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by its genes (see §Biology of variation among males).|$|E
