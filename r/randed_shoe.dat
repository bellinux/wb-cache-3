50|$|Brothers Jack and Oscar Johnson, {{and their}} cousin Frank C. Rand, moved from Mississippi to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1892 {{and started the}} Johnson, Carruthers & <b>Rand</b> <b>Shoe</b> Company. Henry O. Rand, father of Frank, and John C. Roberts were {{financial}} backers. In 1898, the Johnsons sold their company and moved to St. Louis to start Roberts, Johnson & <b>Rand</b> <b>Shoe</b> Company. Frank <b>Rand,</b> a graduate of Vanderbilt University, became a stock clerk and advanced to become vice-president. A headquarters building went up at 15th Street and Washington in 1909.|$|R
2500|$|Eventually {{the modern}} shoe, with a sewn-on sole, was devised. Since the 17th century, most leather shoes {{have used a}} sewn-on sole. This remains the {{standard}} for finer-quality dress shoes today. Until around 1800, welted <b>rand</b> <b>shoes</b> were commonly made without differentiation for {{the left or right}} foot. Such shoes are now referred to as [...] "straights". Only gradually did the modern foot-specific shoe become standard.|$|R
50|$|Rand {{began his}} career as a stock clerk for the Roberts, Johnson, and <b>Rand</b> <b>Shoe</b> Company in 1898. He became its Vice-President in 1907. When the company became known as the International Shoe Company in 1911, he {{remained}} as Vice-President. He then served as its President from 1916 to 1930, and as its Chairman from 1930 to 1949. In 1928, as President, Rand reported strong, steady growth. The company, which became the world's largest manufacturer of shoes, eventually changed its name to Furniture Brands International.|$|R
50|$|With {{his brother}} Jackson Johnson and his cousins Edgar E. Rand and Frank C. Rand, Johnson co-founded Johnson, Carruthers & <b>Rand</b> <b>Shoe</b> Co. in Memphis, Tennessee in 1893. By 1908, {{they moved to}} St. Louis, where they co-founded the Roberts, Johnson & Rand Co. with John C. Roberts. In 1911, they {{acquired}} the Peters Shoe Co.. It eventually {{became known as the}} International Shoe Company, and Johnson became its president, while his brother Jackson was its chairman. By the time of his death, the International Shoe Company had become the largest shoe manufacturing company in the world.|$|R
50|$|A decade later, {{during the}} yellow fever {{epidemic}} of 1878, the mansion {{was used as}} a quarantine hospital for patients. Colonel Walter and three of his sons died from the disease that year and the mansion was then inherited by his widow, Fredonia. In 1889, it was purchased by her son-in-law, Oscar Johnson, husband of daughter Irene. Johnson was a co-founder of Roberts, Johnson & <b>Rand</b> <b>Shoe</b> Company, a shoe company in St. Louis, Missouri later known as the International Shoe Company. The Johnsons added a formal landscape garden and summered at the mansion. In 1903, they hired German-born architect Theodore C. Link to remodel the house.|$|R
50|$|The {{company began}} in 1911 as International Shoe Company with {{the merger of}} Roberts, Johnson & <b>Rand</b> <b>Shoe</b> Company and Peters Shoe Company. In 1966 the company {{changed its name to}} Interco as the result of diversification, and once the company exited the shoe business, adopted the name Furniture Brands International. Some of the brands it owned in the {{furniture}} industry included Broyhill, Thomasville, Drexel Heritage, Henredon, Hickory Chair, Pearson, Laneventure, and Maitland-Smith. In 2013, Furniture Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and announced plans to sell most of its divisions. New owner KPS Capital Partners announced the formation of Heritage Home Group on November 25 of that year.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was erected for the Roberts, Johnson and <b>Rand,</b> a <b>shoe</b> manufacturing company later {{known as the}} International Shoe Company (which became Furniture Brands International). It was designed by German-born American architect Theodore C. Link. It is notable {{as one of the}} first St. Louis factories specifically designed for shoe production.|$|R
5000|$|Men's {{highland}} dress {{includes a}} kilt (or trews) of his clan tartan, along {{with either a}} tartan full plaid, fly plaid, or short belted plaid. Accessories may include a belt, sporran, sgian dubh, tartan socks, garters, kilt pins and clan badges. Ghillie brogues are the traditional, welted <b>rand,</b> thick soled <b>shoes</b> with no tongues and long laces. The laces are wrapped around and tied firmly above the wearer's ankles so that the shoes do not get pulled off in the mud. The shoes lack tongues so the wearer's feet can dry more quickly in the typically damp Scottish weather.|$|R
5000|$|By 1905, St. Louis {{had moved}} from ninth to third {{in the country in}} shoe production. Peters Shoe Company had {{continued}} significant growth, and its products sold all over the United States and even in Mexico and Europe. The two largest shoe companies in the city, Roberts, Johnson & <b>Rand</b> and Peters <b>Shoe</b> Company, merged in 1911 to form International Shoe Company, but each company kept its own identity. Peters Shoe remained in its own building, with Weatherbird Shoes on display, until 1930, when the company moved into what had become the International Shoe Building. Washington Avenue became known as [...] "Shoe Street U.S.A." [...] because it [...] "claimed more shoe trade than any other street in the world".|$|R
50|$|Frank <b>Rand</b> led International <b>Shoe</b> {{through a}} time of major growth and through the {{difficulties}} created by the Great Depression. With Jackson Johnson's death, Rand moved into the chairman's slot and served in that position {{until his death in}} 1949. William H. Moulton, who had joined Roberts, Johnson & Rand in 1908, took over as president, serving until his 1939 retirement. International Shoe not only endured the Depression but thrived, due to lower prices increasing demand for shoes, and the lack of labor trouble. Eventually, most International Shoe plants organized because the New Deal outlawed the company's strategies to prevent unionization. The National Labor Relations Board had to act to allow workers in Hannibal to organize. Byron Gray, an employee since 1909, became president in 1939.|$|R
