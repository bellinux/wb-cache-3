5|$|<b>Retinopathy</b> of {{prematurity}} was {{not observed}} before World War II, but with the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly {{became one of the}} principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in <b>retinopathy</b> of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and hypoxia-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions and problems of <b>retinopathy</b> of prematurity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Retinopathy</b> of {{prematurity}} may regress spontaneously, {{but should}} the disease progress beyond a threshold (defined as five contiguous or eight cumulative hours of stage 3 <b>retinopathy</b> of prematurity), both cryosurgery and laser surgery {{have been shown}} {{to reduce the risk of}} blindness as an outcome. Where the disease has progressed further, techniques such as scleral buckling and vitrectomy surgery may assist in re-attaching the retina.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or <b>retinopathy</b> of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. <b>Retinopathy</b> of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of <b>retinopathy</b> of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevention}} of oxygen toxicity depends {{entirely on the}} setting. Both underwater and in space, proper precautions can eliminate the most pernicious effects. Premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth. In this case {{prevention of}} bronchopulmonary dysplasia and <b>retinopathy</b> of prematurity {{must be carried out}} without compromising a supply of oxygen adequate to preserve the infant's life.|$|E

40|$|Expression of platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) -A and PDGF-B is {{increased}} {{in patients with}} proliferative <b>retinopathies</b> in which traction retinal detachments occur. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} increased expression of PDGF-A in the retina of transgenic mice results in retinal gliosis due to proliferation of astrocytes with different retinal phenotypes based on the time of onset and location of the PDGF-A production. In this study, we investigated the effects of PDGF-B in the retina using gain-of-function transgenic mice that express PDGF-B in photoreceptors. These mice show proliferation of astrocytes, pericytes, and, to a lesser extent, endothelial cells, resulting in ectopic cells on the surface and extending into the retina. The sheets of cells exert traction on the retina resulting in traction retinal detachments similar to those seen in humans with proliferative <b>retinopathies.</b> These studies suggest that PDGF-B has more dramatic effects in the retina than PDGF-A, because it acts on additional cell types, in particular on pericytes, which have a highly developed contractile apparatus. These studies in the retina suggest a means {{that could be used in}} other tissues throughout the body to achieve graded PDGF effects. They also provide a new model of traction retinal detachment that can be used to investigate new treatments for patients with proliferative <b>retinopathies...</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Retinopathy</b> of {{prematurity}} (ROP) {{in infants}} frequently regresses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years. Where {{the disease has}} progressed to the stages requiring surgery, the outcomes are generally good {{for the treatment of}} stage 3 ROP, but are much worse for the later stages. Although surgery is usually successful in restoring the anatomy of the eye, damage to the nervous system by the progression of the disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision.

40|$|Many vitreoretinal pathologies have witnessed impressive advances in their management over the past decade. Most of these advances have involved pharmacologic innovation aimed at controlling exudative diseases of the retina, {{including}} neovascular agerelated macular degeneration (AMD),[13]  macular edema secondary to diabetic retinopathy,[4]  and venous occlusive diseases.

40|$|Diseases of the {{posterior}} segment, including those affecting the vitreous, retina, choroid, and optic disc, {{are common in}} small animals. These diseases may be of congenital, traumatic, inflammatory, degenerative, and neoplastic origin. Diseases of the vitreous affect both cats and dogs, but are more frequent in dogs. Vitreal conditions include persistence of the primary hyaloid vasculature (persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous [PHPV]), vitreal syneresis (liquefaction of the vitreous), asteroid hyalosis (presence of numerous white spherical opacities suspended in the vitreous), vitreal hemorrhage, and vitreal herniation through the pupil. Presentation of vitreous in the pupil and anterior chamber is usually associated with lens displacement and lensectomy, and cataract removal with rupture of {{the posterior}} lens capsule and anterior vitreous membrane. Neoplasms, pigment, parasites, foreign bodies, and cysts also affect the vitreous. For these vitreal diseases, surgery may be indicated for diagnosis, or treatment of the vitreal pupillary herniation into the anterior chamber. The removal of diseased vitreous and traction bands in the repair of retinal detachments will be presented in the section on retinal surgeries. Congenital and degenerative <b>retinopathies</b> are among the more frequently diagnosed clinical disorders in dogs, {{and the majority of}} these <b>retinopathies</b> appear inherited. Inflammations of the retina and choroid in dogs are frequent, and often associated with systemic infections. In cats, congenital and degenerative <b>retinopathies</b> are less frequent, but inflammations of the ocular fundus and hypertensive <b>retinopathies</b> are common. Surgeries of the retina and choroid in small animals include retinal or chorioretinal biopsies, and the correction of retinal detachments. The development of the different types of vitreoretinal surgeries in small animals is still early, but these surgeries have been reported since the 1970 s. The expensive instrumentation and time-consuming training have delayed application of vitreoretinal surgical procedures in veterinary ophthalmology. Nevertheless, several institutional veterinary ophthalmology centers offer this highly specialized service. The inclusion of vitreoretinal surgery in this text will hopefully stimulate its continued development in small animals.

40|$|Inosine- 5 ′-monophosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (IMPDH) plays {{key roles}} in purine nucleotide metabolism and cell proliferation. Although IMPDH {{is a widely}} studied therapeutic target, there is limited information about its physiological regulation. Using Ashbya gossypii as a model, we describe the molecular mechanism and the structural basis for the allosteric regulation of IMPDH by guanine nucleotides. We report that GTP and GDP bind to the regulatory Bateman domain, inducing octamers with compromised catalytic activity. Our data suggest that eukaryotic and prokaryotic IMPDHs might have developed different regulatory mechanisms, with GTP/GDP inhibiting only eukaryotic IMPDHs. Interestingly, mutations associated with human <b>retinopathies</b> map into the guanine nucleotide-binding sites including a previously undescribed non-canonical site and disrupt allosteric inhibition. Together, our results {{shed light on the}} mechanisms of the allosteric regulation of enzymes mediated by Bateman domains and provide a molecular basis for certain <b>retinopathies,</b> opening the door to new therapeutic approaches...|$|R
40|$|Oxidation of {{cholesterol}} into oxysterols {{is a major}} way of elimination {{of cholesterol}} from the liver and extrahepatic tissues, including the brain and the retina. Oxysterols are involved in various cellular processes. Numerous links have been established between oxysterols and several disorders such as neurodegenerative pathologies, <b>retinopathies</b> and atherosclerosis. Different components of the lipid layer such as sphingolipids, sterols and proteins participate to membrane fluidity and forme lipid rafts microdomains. Few data {{are available on the}} links between lipids rafts and oxysterols. The purpose of this review is to suggest the potential role of lipid rafts microdomains in the development of <b>retinopathies</b> with special emphasis and opening perspectives of their interactions with oxysterols. Actually cholesterol oxidation mechanism may have deleterious effect on its ability to support rafts formation. This review suggest that the effect of oxysterols of lipid rafts would probably depend on the oxysterol molecule and cell type...|$|R

40|$|Diabetic and age-related <b>retinopathies,</b> both assocd. {{with growth}} of {{abnormal}} blood vessels, are {{leading causes of}} blindness in the developed world. Current treatments, such as Laser Photocoagulation and anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) drugs, have limited efficacy and undesirable side effects. A recently discovered therapeutic peptide Luminate {{has proven to be}} effective in human clin. trials. Over half of the patients in phase I human clin. trial demonstrated vision improvement with 4 lines or over, and in some patients, the macular thicknesses was reduced back to the healthy state. It has shown significantly longer lasting benefits than anti-VEGF treatments and shows synergistic effects when used with them. Thus, the peptide appears to act through a different pathway than anti-VEGF agents. Finding that pathway may provide new insights into the <b>retinopathies</b> and their managements. Therefore, we are using the peptide as a tool to find the mol. mechanism of its clin. obsd. therapeutic effects.

40|$|Purpose: To {{propose the}} {{objectives}} of undergraduate training in direct ophthalmoscopy (DO). Method: Narrative {{review of the literature}} on (i) opinions about the expected proficiency from students in DO, and (ii) estimates of its diagnostic value. Results: (i) Authorities disagree on the proficiency in DO that they expect from students. Textbooks of physical diagnosis differ in their coverage of DO. Surveys have indicated that US physicians expect students to be able to detect optic nerve head abnormalities. The Association of American Medical Colleges expects students to perform ophthalmoscopic examination and describe observations. The International Council of Ophthalmology expects students to recognize also diabetic and hypertensive <b>retinopathies.</b> The Association of University Professors in Ophthalmology requires that students recognize papilloedema, cholesterol emboli, glaucomatous cupping and macular degeneration. (ii) There is evidence that DO, even by ophthalmologists, is inadequate for screening for glaucoma, diabetic and hypertensive <b>retinopathies.</b> Two studies have suggested a limited value of DO in detecting clinical emergencies. Conclusions: The evidence that DO, even by ophthalmologists, is sub-optimal in detecting common abnormalities challenges existing the notions of training medical students. On pending the results of additional studies of the value of DO in detecting emergencies, we suggest that undergraduate teaching of DO should impart the following: (i) an ability to identify the red fundus reflex and optic disc; (ii) an ability to recognize signs of clinical emergencies in patients, mannequins or fundus photographs; and (iii) knowledge about, but not an ability to detect, other <b>retinopathies.</b> © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|The heparin-binding {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}}-like growth factor (HB-EGF) has {{been implicated in}} wound-healing processes of various tissues. However, {{it is not known}} whether HB-EGF may represent a factor implicated in overstimulated wound-healing processes of the retina during proliferative <b>retinopathies.</b> Therefore, we investigated whether human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which are crucially involved in proliferative <b>retinopathies,</b> express and respond to HB-EGF. RPE cells express mRNAs for various members of the EGF-related growth factor family, among them for HB-EGF, {{as well as for the}} EGF receptors ErbB 1, - 2, - 3, and - 4. The gene expression of HB-EGF is stimulated in the presence of transforming and basic fibroblast growth factors and by oxidative stress and is suppressed during chemical hypoxia. Exogenous HB-EGF stimulates proliferation and migration of RPE cells and the gene and protein expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). HB-EGF activates at least three signal transduction pathways in RPE cells including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (involved in the proliferation-stimulating action of HB-EGF), p 38 (mediates the effects on chemotaxis and secretion of VEGF), and the phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase (necessary for the stimulation of chemotaxis). In epiretinal membranes of patients with proliferative <b>retinopathies,</b> HB-EGF immunoreactivity was partially colocalized with the RPE cell marker, cytokeratins; this observation suggests that RPE cell-derived HB-EGF may represent one factor that drives the uncontrolled wound-healing process of the retina. The stimulating effect on the secretion of VEGF may suggest that HB-EGF is also implicated in the pathological angiogenesis of the retina...|$|R
