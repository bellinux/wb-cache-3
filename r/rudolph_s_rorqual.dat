Materials and methods: Bacterial conjunctivitis isolates of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were exposed to 1 : 1000 dilutions of moxifloxacin 0. 5 %, tobramycin 0. 3 %, gentamicin 0. 3 %, and water (control). At 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after exposure, aliquots were collected, cells were cultured, and viable cell counts were determined using standard microbiological methods. Results: Moxifloxacin achieved 99. 9 % kill (3 -log reduction) at approximately 2 hours for S. pneumoniae and at 15 minutes for H. influenzae. Tobramycin and gentamicin did not achieve 3 -log reduction of S. pneumoniae during the 180 -minute study period. An increase in bacterial growth was noted for these isolates. Gentamicin took more than 120 minutes to achieve the 3 -log reduction of H. influenzae and tobramycin did not reach the 3 -log reduction of this pathogen during the 180 -minute study period. Conclusion: Moxifloxacin killed S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in vitro faster than tobramycin and gentamicin, suggesting its potential clinical benefit as a first-line treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis to minimize patient symptoms and to limit the contagiousness of the disease.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1950 s to early 1960 <b>s</b> <b>Rudolph</b> A. Marcus {{developed}} a theory for treating {{the rates of}} outer-sphere electron-transfer reactions. Outer-sphere reactions are reactions in which an electron is transferred from a donor to an acceptor without any chemical bonds being made or broken. (Electron-transfer reactions in which bonds are made or broken {{are referred to as}} inner-sphere reactions.) Marcus derived several very useful expressions, one of which {{has come to be known}} as the Marcus cross-relation or, more simply, as the Marcus equation. It is widely used for correlating and predicting electron-transfer rates. For his contributions to the understanding of electron-transfer reactions, Marcus received the 1992 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This paper discusses the development and use of the Marcus equation. Topics include self-exchange reactions; net electron-transfer reactions; Marcus cross-relation; and proton, hydride, atom and group transfers...|$|R
40|$|Everyting conceivable, {{all that}} has ever been imagined, can be {{included}} in our minds and souls. As psyche means “breath”, “soul” and “mind”, it points to the relevance of psychology as a study of mental, emotional and spiritual processes involved in our identity make-up. One of the main organizers of our self and psychological experiences is our relationhip with death: our fear of abandonement and of being alone when conceiving our own death, {{the fear of the}} loss of the others, leading to the fear of attachment and emotional death. Pat Kinevane, a contemporary Irish playright, deals, in his 2005 play, Forgotten, with the idea of family and social abandonment of old people in nursing homes. The interconnected stories of Dora, Eucharia, Flor and Gustus, the characters in the play, aged 80 - 100 years old, living in separate retirement and care facilities around Ireland, reveal these fears. Mental illness in the current explosion of anxiety is also crucial to our identity. Another play by Kinevane, Silent (2010), ends with the word silent, which indicates the insanity, invisibility and ultimately the death of the protagonist, Tino McGoldring, a homeless man tormented by the suicide of his brother. His self after the loss of his brother, wife, family, job, mind is constructed in relation to the past and the imaginary world of the Italian-American icon of the film industry of the 1920 <b>s,</b> <b>Rudolph</b> Valentino...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} that a slide-tape program does not {{necessarily}} produce better immediate recall of bibliographic instruction than the traditional library tour. These findings contradict Frank F. Kuo's conclusion that a slide-tape program is superior to the lecture tour. The disparity between the two studies indicates {{the need for further}} research into the effectiveness of this and the other kinds of media presentations now used by academic libraries. VIDEOTAPES, slide/tape presentations, tape recordings for individual use-increasingly these are the means by which students are taught how to use academic libraries. 1 Their popularity is due largely to the practical ad-vantages they offer. They are convenient. They help avoid disruption in the library, eliminate scheduling problems for the li-brary staff responsible for bibliographic in-struction, and reduce the amount of staff time idvolved in preparing and giving lec-ture tours. But do patrons learn from these media presentations as well as they do from the traditional lecture tour? Or do they learn better? These questions need to be an-swered if academic libraries are to be c~nfident about the effectiveness of their bibliographic instruction programs. 2 This article takes a step toward meeting this need, at least in reference to slide/tape programs. It offers findings and conclusions based on testing done on 151 students in a freshman-level business report-writing course. The specific hypothesis tested is whether a slide/tape presentation produces Julia F. Baldwin is documents librarian and Robert <b>S.</b> <b>Rudolph</b> is associate professor of En...|$|R
40|$|OWL 2 EL is {{a popular}} {{ontology}} language that supports role inclusions [...] -that is, axioms that capture compositional properties of roles. Role inclusions closely correspond to context-free grammars, which was used to show that answering conjunctive queries (CQs) over OWL 2 EL knowledge bases with unrestricted role inclusions is undecidable. However, OWL 2 EL inherits from OWL 2 DL the syntactic regularity restriction on role inclusions, which ensures that role chains implying a particular role can be described using a finite automaton (FA). This is sufficient to ensure decidability of CQ answering; however, the FAs can be worst-case exponential in size so the known approaches do not provide a tight upper complexity bound. In this paper, we solve this open problem and show that answering CQs over OWL 2 EL knowledge bases is PSPACE-complete in combined complexity (i. e., the complexity measured in the total size of the input). To this end, we use a novel encoding of regular role inclusions using bounded-stack pushdown automata [...] -that is, FAs extended {{with a stack of}} bounded size. Apart from theoretical interest, our encoding can be used in practical tableau algorithms to avoid the exponential blowup due to role inclusions. In addition, we sharpen the lower complexity bound and show that the problem is PSPACE-hard even if we consider only role inclusions as part of the input (i. e., the query and all other parts of the knowledge base are fixed). Finally, we turn our attention to navigational queries over OWL 2 EL knowledge bases, and we show that answering positive, converse-free conjunctive graph XPath queries is PSPACE-complete as well; this is interesting since allowing the converse operator in queries is known to make the problem EXPTIME-hard. Thus, in this paper we present several important contributions to the landscape of the complexity of answering expressive queries over description logic knowledge bases. © 2014 AI Access Foundation.

40|$|High {{resolution}} microwave (a-type) and millimetre-wave (b-type) {{spectra of}} HeN– 13 C 16 O, HeN– 12 C 18 O, and HeN– 13 C 18 O clusters (N ≤ 10) were observed, significantly extending the initial spectroscopic observations on HeN– 12 C 16 O by Surin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 2008, 101, 233401]. The frequencies of the a-type series, which evolves from the end-over-end {{rotation of the}} dimer, decrease from N = 1 to 3, then increase smoothly to at least N = 9. This turnaround indicates a rapid evolution of the solvation character from classical to quantum. The b-type series, which evolves from the free molecule rotation of CO, increases from N = 0 to 6 and then decreases to at least N = 10. This is consistent with an initially increasing anisotropy of the helium environment, followed by a tendency of the solvation shell to become more isotropic. The shift of the vibrational frequency of CO as determined from the infrared [A. R. W. McKellar, J. Chem. Phys., 2004, 121, 6868; ibid., 2006, 125, 164328] and microwave data reveals an approximately linear decrease from N = 1 to at least 9. If the linear shift were to continue until completion of the first solvation shell (N ≈ 14), the estimated helium nanodroplet shift will be well undershot [K. von Haeften, <b>S.</b> <b>Rudolph,</b> I. Simanovski, M. Havenith, R. E. Zillich and K. B. Whaley, Phys. Rev. B: Condens. Matter Mater. Phys., 2006, 73, 054502]. In this case, {{there must be an}} upturn in the vibrational shift beyond N = 14, which is not predicted by theory [T. Škrbić, S. Moroni and S. Baroni, J. Phys. Chem. A, 2007, 111, 7640]. By extrapolating the a-type series to N = 14 (assuming a linear vibrational shift), we estimate the rotational constant, B, of CO in the helium nanodroplet to be [similar] 74 % of its gas phase value. This is in reasonable agreement with simulations (76 % at N = 14), which predict the limiting value to be approximately reached upon completion of the first solvation shell (73 % at N = 100) [T. Škrbić, S. Moroni and S. Baroni, J. Phys. Chem. A, 2007, 111, 7640]. However, this value is significantly larger than that inferred from helium nanodroplet experiments (63 %). P. L. Raston, Y. Xu, W.
