5|$|A {{consistent}} {{shift from}} land based trade to sea based trade {{has been recorded}} since the last three millennia. The strategic advantages of port cities as trading centers are many: they are both less dependent on vital connections and less vulnerable to blockages. Oceanic ports can help forge trading <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> {{parts of the world}} easily.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of World War II, {{evacuated}} and orphaned children were the subjects of studies that outlined their reactions to separation, including the ability to cope by forming <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> children. Some of this material remained unpublished until the post-war period and only gradually contributed to understanding of young children's reactions to loss.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} {{social and psychological}} well-being of empty nest mothers in Sari City, Iran. Questionnaires were used to collect data from 241 women. Findings indicate significant relationships between marital satisfaction, having intimate <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>others,</b> family members, dependence on the mother, social participation, quality <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>others,</b> extracurricular activities, religious beliefs and psychological well-being of the respondents. In multivariate regression equation, dependency of the mothers to child (beta= 0. 292) and quality <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>others</b> (beta= 0. 292) have highest direct effect and quality <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>others</b> have highest indirect effect (beta= 0. 074) on psychological well-being of the empty nest...|$|R

5|$|The {{book has}} also become popular among {{political}} leaders and those in business management. Despite its title, The Art of War addresses strategy in a broad fashion, touching upon public administration and planning.

5|$|The exact <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> basal sauropod genera remain unclear. Ronan Allain {{and colleagues}} (2004, 2008) found that Vulcanodon is most {{closely related to}} Tazoudasaurus, a newly {{discovered}} sauropod genus from Morocco. These researchers suggested reintroducing the name Vulcanodontidae to name the clade containing Vulcanodon and Tazoudasaurus. However, this sibling relationship between Tazoudasaurus and Vulcanodon could not be confirmed by other analyses.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} the dodo and the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} {{were placed in}} a family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> pigeons were unresolved. Each was also placed in a monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as it was thought that they had evolved their similarities independently. Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, within the family Columbidae.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{influenced}} by Elvis Presley, Gillan started and fronted several local bands in the mid-1960s, and eventually joined Episode Six when their original singer left. He first found widespread commercial success after joining Deep Purple in 1969. After an almost non-stop workload, {{during which time}} he recorded six albums in four years, and problematic <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> band members, particularly guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, Gillan resigned from the band in June 1973, having given a lengthy notice period to their managers.|$|E
5|$|Miles' storylines {{have often}} centred on his friendships and romantic <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> characters. He {{has become a}} {{surrogate}} father to several teenagers, including Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell). Miles and Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes) had a long relationship together, during which they lost an unborn child. Kirsty eventually left town, ending their relationship. After sharing a long friendship, Miles and Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) entered into a romantic relationship in 2011. Leah becomes pregnant and Miles proposes to her. Miles has earned a generally positive reception, while Quong Tart has been nominated for three Inside Soap Awards.|$|E

5|$|Near the Congo River {{a female}} who participates in strong {{emotional}} or sexual relationships with another female among the Nkundo people {{is known as}} yaikya bons√°ngo (a woman who presses against another woman). Lesbian relationships are also known in matrilineal societies in Ghana among the Akan people. In Lesotho, females engage in what is commonly considered sexual behavior to the Western world: they kiss, sleep together, rub genitals, participate in cunnilingus, and maintain their <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> females vigilantly. Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires a penis, however, they do not consider their behavior sexual, nor label themselves lesbians.|$|E
5|$|Polytolypa is a {{monotypic}} genus of fungus {{containing the}} single species Polytolypa hystricis. First {{classified in the}} Onygenaceae family, as of 2008 it {{is considered to be}} in the Ajellomycetaceae, although there is still uncertainty as to its phylogenetic <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> similar genera. This species is only known from a single specimen derived in the laboratory from a specimen of dung of the North American porcupine, Erethizon dorsatum, collected in Ontario, Canada. Polytolypa hystricis contains bioactive compounds that have antifungal activity.|$|E
5|$|The melampittas are a family, Melampittidae, of New Guinean birds {{containing}} two enigmatic species. The {{two species}} {{are found in}} two genera, the greater melampitta in the genus Megalampitta and the lesser melampitta in the genus Melampitta. They are little studied and before being established as a family in 2014 their taxonomic <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> birds were uncertain, being considered at one time related variously to the pittas, Old World babblers and birds-of-paradise.|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse's <b>{{relationship}}s</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> NFL {{owners were}} occasionally, {{as in his}} relationship with the Rams, alleged to constitute conflicts of interest. His $3 million loan to help Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose with his gambling debts was one example, as it violated the NFL constitution and bylaws. On other occasions, he was criticized for his overly-secretive ways as NFL Finance Committee Chairman, as other league owners found it difficult to obtain information on how league finances were being spent. In particular, owners were upset about not being informed about money given to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a 5-year extension of his contract. The extension was awarded to him by the Finance Committee as a reward for negotiation of the league television contract in 1982, even though Rozelle had five years remaining on his current contract.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{was married}} twice, divorcing {{his first wife}} in acrimonious circumstances, and had a {{reputation}} for infidelity. His <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> players were difficult; team-mates and opponents alike found him hard to get along with. He was unsuccessful in business dealings and failed to establish a successful career once he retired from cricket. He moved to South Africa in the 1950s in an attempt to start a business, but this came to nothing. As a result, he and his family struggled financially. Shortly after beginning a career as a sports administrator, he was involved in a serious car crash in 1960 which left him frail. He {{died of a heart attack}} in 1965.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

5|$|Jardine {{joined the}} Territorial Army in August 1939. Once World WarII began, he was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Berkshire Regiment {{and went with}} the British Expeditionary Force to France. He served at Dunkirk, where he was fortunate to escape but suffered some injuries. After serving as staff captain at St. Albans, he was posted to India {{for the remainder of}} the war. He served in Quetta, then Simla as a major in the Central Provisions Directorate. He became fluent in the Hindustani language and although friendly, never formed close <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> officers. He gave lectures and played some cricket while in India. He left the army in 1945 only to find his job with the coal mining company was no longer available.|$|E
5|$|Rupert is {{probably}} best remembered today {{for his role as}} a Royalist commander during the English Civil War. He had considerable success during the initial years of the war, his drive, determination and experience of European techniques bringing him early victories. As the war progressed, Rupert's youth and lack of maturity in managing his <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> Royalist commanders ultimately resulted in his removal from his post and ultimate retirement from the war. Throughout the conflict, however, Rupert also enjoyed a powerful symbolic position: he was an iconic Royalist Cavalier and as such was frequently the subject of both Parliamentarian and Royalist propaganda, an image which has endured over the years.|$|E
5|$|The King {{was related}} by {{marriage}} to the rulers of Great Britain, Russia and Prussia, maintaining a particularly strong attachment to the Prince and Princess of Wales, who visited Athens in 1869. Their visit occurred despite continued lawlessness which culminated in the kidnap of a party of British and Italian tourists, including Lord and Lady Muncaster. Two female hostages, a child and Lord Muncaster were released, but four of the others: British diplomat E. H. C. Herbert (the first cousin of Lord Carnarvon), Frederick Vyner (the brother-in-law of Lord Ripon, Lord President of the Council), Italian diplomat Count Boyl di Putifigari, and Mr. Lloyd (an engineer) were murdered. George's <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> ruling houses assisted him and his small country but also often put them {{at the center of}} national political struggles in Europe.|$|E
