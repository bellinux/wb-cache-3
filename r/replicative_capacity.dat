Clonal composition was unaffected by undernutrition while with animal growth the frequency of the most extensively replicating clones was reduced. Differentiation of precursors occurred in all clones, while differentiation did not occur in skin fibroblasts cloned under identical conditions. Clonal composition and mature fat cell number were related in that fat cell numbers were identical bilaterally in both depots and increased more extensively with growth in perirenal than epididymal tissue.

LCMV is already identified as the best model to examine the difference between acute and viral infection in its natural host Mus musculus, the common house mouse. Conveniently, the mouse is also the most widely used genetic model for mammalian genetics. A major phenotypic difference results from only two nucleotide differences between acute LCMV, also known as Armstrong LCMV, and one of its variant, Clone 13, which leads to persistent LCMV infection.

40|$|Neuraminidase (NA) {{mutations}} conferring {{resistance to}} NA inhibitors {{were believed to}} compromise influenza virus fitness. Unexpectedly, an oseltamivir-resistant A/Brisbane/ 59 / 2007 (Bris 07) -like H 1 N 1 H 275 Y NA variant emerged in 2007 and completely replaced the wild-type (WT) strain in 2008 - 2009. The NA of such variant contained additional NA changes (R 222 Q, V 234 M and D 344 N) that potentially counteracted the detrimental effect of the H 275 Y mutation on viral fitness. Here, we rescued a recombinant Bris 07 -like WT virus and 4 NA mutants/revertants (H 275 Y, H 275 Y/Q 222 R, H 275 Y/M 234 V and H 275 Y/N 344 D) and characterized them in vitro and in ferrets. A fluorometric-based NA assay {{was used to determine}} Vmax and Km values. <b>Replicative</b> <b>capacities</b> were evaluated by yield assays in ST 6 Gal 1 -MDCK cells. Recombinant NA proteins were expressed in 293 T cells and surface NA activity was determined. Infectivity and contact transmission experiments were evaluated for the WT, H 275 Y and H 275 Y/Q 222 R recombinants in ferrets. The H 275 Y mutation did not significantly alter Km and Vmax values compared to WT. The H 275 Y/N 344 D mutant had a reduced affinity (Km of 50 vs 12 µM) whereas the H 275 Y/M 234 V mutant had a reduced activity (22 vs 28 U/sec). In contrast, the H 275 Y/Q 222 R mutant showed a significant decrease of both affinity (40 µM) and activity (7 U/sec). The WT, H 275 Y, H 275 Y/M 234 V and H 275 Y/N 344 D recombinants had comparable <b>replicative</b> <b>capacities</b> contrasting with H 275 Y/Q 222 R mutant whose viral titers were significantly reduced. All studied mutations reduced the cell surface NA activity compared to WT with the maximum reduction being obtained for the H 275 Y/Q 222 R mutant. Comparable infectivity and transmissibility were seen between the WT and the H 275 Y mutant in ferrets whereas the H 275 Y/Q 222 R mutant was associated with significantly lower lung viral titers. In conclusion, the Q 222 R reversion mutation compromised Bris 07 -like H 1 N 1 virus in vitro and in vivo.

The relation between chronological age and fibroblast growth characteristics was assessed in nonagenarian subjects of the Leiden 85 + Study.

40|$|Telomeres are {{nucleoprotein}} {{structures that}} cap {{the ends of}} chromosomes and thereby protect their stability and integrity. In the presence of telomerase, the enzyme that synthesizes telomeric repeats, telomere length is controlled primarily by Rap 1 p, the budding yeast telomeric DNA binding protein which, through its C-terminal domain, nucleates a protein complex that limits telomere lengthening. In the absence of telomerase, telomeres shorten with every cell division, and eventually, cells enter replicative senescence. We have set out to identify the telomeric property that determines the <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity</b> of telomerase-deficient budding yeast.

The factors that may account for this partial control of viral replication were assessed in a longitudinal observational study of 20 HIV-infected adults who remained on a stable protease inhibitor-based regimen despite ongoing viral replication (plasma HIV RNA levels consistently > 500 copies/ml). Longitudinal plasma samples (n = 248) were assayed for drug susceptibility and viral replication capacity (measured by using a single-cycle recombinant-virus assay). The initial treatment-mediated decrease in plasma viremia was directly proportional to the reduction in <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity</b> (P = 0. 01).

The emergence of primary genotypic mutations within protease (particularly V 82 A, I 84 V, and L 90 M) was temporally associated with increasing phenotypic resistance and decreasing <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity,</b> while the emergence of secondary mutations within protease was associated with more-gradual changes in both phenotypic resistance and <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity.</b> We conclude that HIV may be constrained in its ability to become both highly resistant and highly fit and that this may contribute to the continued partial suppression of plasma HIV RNA levels that is observed in some patients with drug-resistant viremia...|$|E

Careful analysis of amino acid substitutions located outside domain C of HBV RT, including those known to partially restore replication capacities in vitro, showed that the in vivo replication of HBV variants is driven by multiple forces, including intrinsic replicative advantages conferred by mutations accumulating outside domain C and the changing environment in which these variants replicate.

The recombinant D 222 G HA mutant was generated from a wild-type (WT) clinical strain by using reverse genetics and site-directed mutagenesis. <b>Replicative</b> <b>capacities</b> were determined in MDCK and MDCK-a 2, 6 cells. Antigenicity was characterized by HA inhibition and microneutralization assays. HA titers were determined using human, chicken, and resialylated turkey red blood cells (RBCs). Virulence and contact-transmissibility were analyzed in mice and ferrets. Results. The recombinant D 222 G virus grew to significantly higher titers and generated larger viral plaques compared with the WT in MDCK but not in MDCK-a 2, 6 cells. The mutant also showed a significant reduction in HA titers using a 2, 6 -expressing RBCs. The 2 recombinants were antigenically similar. The D 222 G mutant virus induced higher lung viral titers and alveolar inflammation in mice whereas the 2 recombinants had similar impacts in ferrets. Conclusions. The D 222 G HA mutation alters receptor binding specificity, resulting in higher lung titers in mice. This could contribute to the higher case fatality rates reported in humans...|$|R

Here, we used a system of ex vivo tonsillar tissue to compare the pathogeneses of sequential primary R 5 HIV- 1 isolates from patients in these two categories. The absolute <b>replicative</b> <b>capacities</b> of HIV- 1 isolates seemed to be controlled by tissue factors. In contrast, the replication level hierarchy among sequential isolates and the levels of CCR 5 (+) CD 4 (+) T-cell depletion caused by the R 5 isolates seemed to be controlled by viral factors. R 5 viruses isolated from nonswitch virus patients depleted more target cells than R 5 viruses isolated from switch virus patients. The high depletion of CCR 5 (+) cells by HIV- 1 isolates from nonswitch virus patients may explain the steady decline of CD 4 (+) T cells in patients with continuous dominance of R 5 HIV- 1.

To investigate the molecular basis for these differences, recombinant full-length clones were constructed by reciprocal DNA fragment exchange between a molecular clone derived from a monocyte-tropic isolate (ADA) and portions of two full-length clones incapable of infection or replication in primary monocyte cultures (HXB 2 and NL 4 - 3). Virions derived from proviral clones that contained ADA sequences encoding vpu and the N and C termini of the surface envelope glycoprotein (gp 120) were incapable of replication in monocytes. However, a 283 -base-pair ADA sequence encoding amino acids 240 - 333 of the mature gp 120 protein conferred the capacity for high-level virus replication in primary monocytes. The predicted amino acid sequence of this ADA clone differed from NL 4 - 3 and HXB 2 at 22 of 94 residues in this portion of gp 120, which includes the entire third variable domain. Only 2 of 11 residues implicated in CD 4 binding are located in this region of gp 120 and are identical in HXB 2, NL 4 - 3, and ADA.

40|$|Marburg virus (MARV) is {{a highly}} {{pathogenic}} virus that causes severe, often lethal diseases specifically in humans and non-human primates. In rodents MARV is non-pathogenic. However, sequential passaging of MARV in rodents results in selection of a rodent-lethal virus. Lofts et al. established a guinea pig-lethal MARV containing only four non-silent amino acid changes in viral genome (Lofts et al., 2007). One amino acid substitution (D 184 N) was detected in the viral matrix protein VP 40 and three amino acid substitutions were detected in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L (S 741 C, D 758 A and A 759 D). We analyzed {{the effects of the}} guinea pig-adaptive mutations on the functions of VP 40 and L in a comparative study including human and guinea pig cells. Functional analyses were performed with ectopically expressed VP 40 D 184 N and L mutants by using different assays. The influence of the D 184 N mutation in VP 40 on the <b>replicative</b> <b>capacities</b> of MARV in guinea pig cells was analyzed by infection of cells with recombinant MARV containing the D 184 N mutation in VP 40. The first part of the study demonstrated that a recombinant rMARV containing only the D 184 N amino acid substitution in VP 40 displayed a higher level of viral fitness specifically in guinea pig, but not in human cells. The mutant virus showed higher <b>replicative</b> <b>capacities,</b> enlarged inclusion bodies and enhanced infectivity only in guinea pig cells. Detailed comparative analysis of VP 40 functions, in human and guinea pig cells, indicated that the membrane binding capabilities and the interferon antagonistic function were not altered by the D 184 N amino acid substitution. However, presence of the D 184 N mutation in VP 40 enhanced the production of VP 40 -induced virus-like particles (VLPs) specifically in guinea pig cells. In addition, the amount of NP in infectious virus-like particles (iVLPs) and virus preparations was enhanced in presence of the D 184 N mutation in VP 40 specifically in guinea pig cells. These data might partially explain the higher infectivity of VP 40 D 184 N containing iVLPs compared to wildtype VP 40 containing iVLPs. Most importantly, the inhibitory capacity of VP 40 on replication and transcription was species-specifically lowered by the D 184 N mutation in VP 40, allowing significantly higher levels of replication and transcription in guinea pig cells. The second part of the study focused on the importance of the mutations in the L protein observed in the guinea pig-lethal MARV. Interestingly, only the S 714 C substitution increased replication in both species while the other mutations, D 758 A and A 759 D severely impaired the polymerase function. All L mutant proteins displayed proper expression and were able to localize into inclusion bodies which represent the sites of viral transcription/replication. Finally, co-expression of plasmids encoding L with the S 741 C amino acid substitution and VP 40 D 184 N in guinea pig cells resulted in eight fold higher levels of replication and transcription in comparison to human cells. This suggested that the D 184 N mutation in VP 40 and the S 741 C mutation in L together significantly improve replication of MARV in guinea pig cells. Altogether these data suggests that the D 184 N substitution in VP 40 and the S 714 C substitution in L can contribute to the increased pathogenicity of guinea pig-lethal MARV...|$|R
40|$|The twin {{processes}} of viral evolutionary escape and reversion {{in response to}} host immune pressure, in particular the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, shape Human Immunodeficiency Virus- 1 sequence evolution in infected host populations. The tempo of CTL escape and reversion is known to differ between CTL escape variants in a given host population. Here, we ask: are rates of escape and reversion comparable across infected host populations? For three cohorts taken from three continents, we estimate escape and reversion rates at 23 escape sites in optimally defined Gag epitopes. We find consistent escape rate estimates across the examined cohorts. Reversion rates are also consistent between a Canadian and South African infected host population. Certain Gag escape variants that incur a large replicative fitness cost are known to revert rapidly upon transmission. However, the relationship between escape/reversion rates and viral <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity</b> across {{a large number of}} epitopes has not been interrogated. We investigate this relationship by examining $in$ $vitro$ replicative capacities of viral sequences with minimal variation: point escape mutants induced in a lab strain. Remarkably, despite the complexities of epistatic effects exemplified by pathways to escape in famous epitopes, and the diversity of both hosts and viruses, CTL escape mutants which escape rapidly tend to be those with the highest <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity</b> when applied as a single point mutation. Similarly, mutants inducing the greatest costs to viral <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity</b> tend to revert more quickly. These data suggest that escape rates in Gag are consistent across host populations, and that in general these rates are dominated by site specific effects upon viral <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Telomeres {{are unique}} protein–DNA {{structures}} {{that comprise the}} termini of eukaryotic linear chromosomes (for review see references 1, 2). Telomeric DNA does not contain protein-encoding genes but rather consists of G-rich hexanucleotide repeats that in vertebrate cells are (TTAGGG) n sequences. Based on studies initially carried out in yeast and other single cell organisms, it appears that telomere functions include the stabilization and protection of chromosomal ends from events such as illegitimate recombination, the determination of chromosomal localization within the nucleus, and the regulation of cellular <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity.</b> It is this last function, the role of telomeres in regulation of <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity,</b> that has received particular attention in studies of cellular senescence and organismal aging.

40|$|Werner Syndrome (WS) {{is a human}} {{segmental}} progeria {{resulting from}} mutations in a DNA helicase. WS fibroblasts have a shortened <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity,</b> an aged appearance, and activated p 38 MAPK, features that can be modulated by inhibition of the p 38 pathway. Loss of the WRNp RecQ helicase {{has been shown to}} result in replicative stress, suggesting that a link between faulty DNA repair and stress-induced premature cellular senescence may lead to premature ageing in WS. Other progeroid syndromes that share overlapping pathophysiological features with WS also show defects in DNA processing, raising the possibility that faulty DNA repair, leading to replicative stress and premature cellular senescence, might be a more widespread feature of premature ageing syndromes. We therefore analysed <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity,</b> cellular morphology and p 38 activation, and the effects of p 38 inhibition, in fibroblasts from a range of progeroid syndromes. In general, populations of young fibroblasts from non-WS progeroid syndromes do not have a high level of cells with an enlarged morphology and F-actin stress fibres, unlike young WS cells, although this varies between strains. p 38 activation and phosphorylated HSP 27 levels generally correlate well with cellular morphology, and treatment with the p 38 inhibitor SB 203580 effects cellular morphology only in strains with enlarged cells and phosphorylated HSP 27. For some syndromes fibroblast <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity</b> was within the normal range, whereas for others it was significantly shorter (e. g. HGPS and DKC). However, although in most cases SB 203580 extended <b>replicative</b> <b>capacity,</b> with the exception of WS and DKC the magnitude of the effect was not significantly different from normal dermal fibroblasts. This suggests that stress-induced premature cellular senescence via p 38 activation is restricted to a small subset of progeroid syndromes...|$|E

40|$|Transmission of {{drug-resistant}} pathogens {{presents an}} almost-universal challenge for fighting infectious diseases. Transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) can {{persist in the}} absence of drugs for considerable time. It is generally believed that differential TDRM-persistence is caused, at least partially, by variations in TDRM-fitness-costs. However, in vivo epidemiological evidence for the impact of fitness costs on TDRM-persistence is rare. Here, we studied the persistence of TDRM in HIV- 1 using longitudinally-sampled nucleotide sequences from the Swiss-HIV-Cohort-Study (SHCS). All treatment-naïve individuals with TDRM at baseline were included. Persistence of TDRM was quantified via reversion rates (RR) determined with interval-censored survival models. Fitness costs of TDRM were estimated in the genetic background in which they occurred using a previously published and validated machine-learning algorithm (based on in vitro <b>replicative</b> <b>capacities)</b> and were included in the survival models as explanatory variables. In 857 sequential samples from 168 treatment-naïve patients, 17 TDRM were analyzed. RR varied substantially and ranged from 174. 0 / 100 -person-years;CI=[51. 4, 588. 8] (for 184 V) to 2. 7 / 100 -person-years;[0. 7, 10. 9] (for 215 D). RR increased significantly with fitness cost (increase by 1. 6 [1. 3, 2. 0] per standard deviation of fitness costs). When subdividing fitness costs into the average fitness cost of a given mutation and the deviation from the average fitness cost of a mutation in a given genetic background, we found that both components were significantly associated with reversion-rates. Our results show that the substantial variations of TDRM persistence {{in the absence of}} drugs are associated with fitness-cost differences both among mutations and among different genetic backgrounds for the same mutation...|$|R
40|$|Enzootic {{transmission}} of West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) involves various {{species of birds}} and ornithophilic mosquitoes. Single nucleotide substitutions in the WNV genome may impact viral fitness necessary for WNV adaptation and evolution as previously shown for the WN 02 genotype. In an effort to study phenotypic change, we developed an in vivo fitness competition model in two biologically relevant hosts for WNV. The House Finch (HOFI; Haemorhous mexicanus) and Culex tarsalis mosquitoes represent moderately susceptible hosts for WNV, are highly abundant in Western North America and frequently are infected with WNV in nature. Herein, we inoculated HOFIs and Cx. tarsalis competitively (dually) and singly with infectious-clone derived viruses of the founding California isolate COAV 997 - 2003 (COAV 997 -IC), the founding North American isolate NY 99 (NY 99 -IC), and a 2004 field isolate from California (CA- 04), and compared the <b>replicative</b> <b>capacities</b> (fitness) of these viruses to a genetically marked virus of COAV 997 (COAV 997 - 5 nt) by measuring RNA copy numbers. COAV 997 and COAV 997 - 5 nt exhibited neutral fitness in HOFIs and Cx. tarsalis, and the temperature-sensitive phenotype of COAV 997 did not affect replication in HOFIs as none of the infected birds became febrile. The NY 99 and CA- 04 isolates demonstrated elevated fitness in HOFIs compared to COAV 997 - 5 nt, whereas all viruses replicated to similar titers and RNA copies in Cx. tarsalis, and the only fitness differences were related to infection rates. Our data demonstrated that competitive replication allows for the sensitive comparison of fitness differences among two genetically closely related viruses using relevant hosts of WNV while eliminating host-to-host differences. In conclusion, our approach may be helpful in understanding the extent of phenotypic change in fitness associated with genetic changes in WNV...|$|R
