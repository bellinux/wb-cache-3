5|$|Sawyer and {{his wife}} were both Republicans in the 1940s. After {{witnessing}} political corruption and voter fraud in their own ward and around the city, they became disillusioned with the party organization in the city and joined the <b>reform</b> <b>effort</b> led by Joseph S. Clark, Jr., and Richardson Dilworth. Clark and Dilworth brought together Democrats, independents, and disaffected Republicans like Sawyer in a coalition against the Republican political machine, which they regarded as irredeemably corrupt. In 1949, Sawyer served as a Democratic committeeman and Clark and Dilworth won city offices that year.|$|E

He and Clark were allies in the anti-corruption <b>reform</b> <b>effort</b> that had swept the city four years earlier. Dilworth had run for mayor unsuccessfully in 1947, with Clark as his {{campaign}} manager. In 1949, he was elected City Treasurer. He resigned that post to run for governor in 1950, but was defeated by Republican John S. Fine. Democratic party leaders had intended Dilworth to be their candidate for mayor again in 1951, but when Clark announced his candidacy, Dilworth agreed to run for district attorney instead. He won, taking just shy of 58% of the vote. In the primary election in May, Dilworth easily defeated his underfunded opponent, William A. Paschall, a local meat dealer.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the West Park Commission was riddled with {{political}} graft, and the three parks became dilapidated. As part of a <b>reform</b> <b>effort</b> in 1905, Jens Jensen was appointed as General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect for the entire West Park System. Jensen, now recognized as dean of the prairie style of landscape architecture, improved deteriorating sections of the parks and added new features. Among Jensen's improvements were a semi-circular entryway at Marshall Boulevard, and a formal garden at the corner of Ogden Avenue and Sacramento Drive. By the time Jensen designed the garden, Ogden Avenue, a diagonal roadway with a major streetcar thoroughfare that would later become part of Route 66, had already been constructed. The road divided the park into two separate landscapes, creating a busy intersection at the junction of Ogden and Sacramento Avenues. Jensen's solution was a long axial garden on the southeast side of the intersection, providing a buffer between Ogden Avenue and playing fields to the south. Jensen demolished the conservatories in each of the West Park System parks in favor of one grand conservatory at Garfield Park.|$|E

40|$|Teacher {{turnover}} in urban public schools {{has traditionally been}} associated with school destabilization and is considered adversarial to school improvement and <b>reform</b> <b>efforts.</b> However, the 2009 federal education reform initiative, Race to the Top, endorsed forced teacher turnover at the lowest performing schools as a strategy for recruiting teachers of greater human capital and commitment to student learning. Using qualitative case study methods, this dissertation explored whether teacher turnover affects school <b>reform</b> <b>efforts,</b> and if so, how, by studying teacher turnover at three urban public high schools in New England. The findings revealed that teacher turnover does affect school <b>reform</b> <b>efforts.</b> In {{two of the three}} cases studied, teacher turnover contributed to the churn of human capital and to the disruption of social capital. In both of these cases, school <b>reform</b> <b>efforts</b> were negatively affected. In the third case, the potential negative effects of teacher turnover were largely mitigated through advanced planning. The leadership team also demonstrated how carefully controlled internal turnover could be used to advance <b>reform</b> <b>efforts...</b>|$|R

25|$|Alecu Filipescu-Vulpea, {{also known}} as Aleco Filipescul, Alecsandru R. Filipescu or Alexandru Răducanu Filipescu (1775 – November 1856), was a Wallachian {{administrator}} and high-ranking boyar, who played {{an important part in}} the politics of the late Phanariote era and of the Regulamentul Organic regime. Beginning in the 1810s, he took an anti-Phanariote stand, conspiring alongside the National Party and the Filiki Eteria to institute new constitutional norms. Clashing with the National Party over the distribution of spoils, and only obtaining relatively minor positions in the administration of Bucharest, Filipescu eventually joined a clique of boyars that cooperated closely with the Russian Empire. His conditional support for the Eterists played out during the Wallachian uprising of 1821, when Vulpea manipulated all sides against each other, ensuring safety for the boyars. He returned to prominence under Prince Grigore IV Ghica, but sabotaged the monarch's political <b>reform</b> <b>effort</b> and also seduced his wife Maria.

500|$|The first {{nationwide}} government-funded {{school system}} in China {{was established in the}} year 3 AD under Emperor Ping of Han (9 BC–5 AD). During the Northern Song dynasty, the government gradually reestablished an official school system after it was heavily damaged during the preceding Five Dynasties period. Government-established schools soon eclipsed the role of private academies by the mid-11th century. At the apex of higher education in the school system were the central schools located in the capital city, the Guozijian, the Taixue, and several vocational schools. The first major <b>reform</b> <b>effort</b> to rebuild prefectural and county schools was initiated by Chancellor Fan Zhongyan (989–1052) in the 1040s. Before this time, the bulk of funds allotted for the establishment of prefectural and county schools was left up to private financing and minimal amount of government funding; Fan's <b>reform</b> <b>effort</b> started the trend of greater government financing, at least for prefectural schools. Major expansion of educational facilities was initiated by Emperor Huizong, who used funds originally allotted for disaster relief and food-price stabilizing to fund new prefectural and county schools and demoted officials who neglected to repair, rebuild, and maintain these government schools. The historian John W. Chaffe states that by the early 12th century the state school system had [...] of land that could provide for some 200,000 student residents living in dormitories. After the widespread destruction of schools during the Jurchen invasions from the 1120s to 1140s, Emperor Gaozong of Song (r. 1127–1162) issued an edict to restore prefectural schools in 1142 and county schools in 1148, although the county schools by and large were reconstructed by the efforts of local county officials' private fundraising.|$|E

Under the act, appointments were awarded on merit and competitive examination. To ensure the reform was implemented, Congress and Arthur established and funded the Civil Service Commission. The Pendleton Act, however, covered only 10% of federal government workers. For Arthur, previously known for having been a [...] "veteran spoilsman," [...] civil service reform became his most noteworthy achievement.|$|E
500|$|For {{more than}} a century France {{maintained}} colonial rule in Algerian territory. This allowed exceptions to republican law, including Sharia laws applied by Islamic customary courts to Muslim women which gave women certain rights to property and inheritance {{that they did not have}} under French law. Discontent among the Muslim Algerians grew after the World Wars, in which the Algerians sustained many casualties. Algerian nationalists began efforts aimed at furthering equality by listing complaints in the Manifesto of the Algerian People, which requested equal representation under the state and access to citizenship, but no equality for all citizens to preserve Islamic precepts. The French response was to grant citizenship to 60,000"meritorious" [...] Muslims. During a <b>reform</b> <b>effort</b> in 1947, the French created a bicameral legislature with one house for the French citizens and another for the Muslims; but gave a European's vote equal seven times more weight than a Muslim's vote. Paramilitary groups such as the National Liberation Front (Front de Libération nationale, FLN) appeared, claiming an Arab-Islamic brotherhood and state. This led to the outbreak of a war for independence, the Algerian War, in 1954.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In their {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} school mathematics education from the “new math ” {{movement of the}} 1950 s to <b>reform</b> <b>efforts</b> of the 1980 s, Fey and Graeber (2003) contend that mathematics education <b>reform</b> <b>efforts</b> contain cyclical crisis-reform-reaction episodes. The current research examines a selected group of teachers ‟ understanding of reform {{and the impact of}} the cycle of reform on their attitudes about their profession. The teachers in this study, participants in a professional development experience supporting progressive <b>reform</b> <b>efforts</b> in California during the 1990 s, responded to a survey and follow-up interviews were conducted with a representative sample. The findings indicate that participants were supportive of the reform movement, but felt “left out ” of the decision-making process—especially when the reform movement ended. If cycles of reform continue in mathematics education, teachers may become less willing to participate in future <b>reform</b> <b>efforts.</b> Furthermore, cycles of reform may lead to a decrease in teacher morale, which may in turn lead to teachers leaving the profession, thereby further exacerbating the impending teacher shortage within and beyond the U.
