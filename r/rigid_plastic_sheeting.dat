Three opportunities for improvement currently exist at AMPAGLAS: 1. Re-evaluating the number of packers employed and on duty, 2. Reducing the strip and clean time of extruders and streamlining the process, and 3. An efficient method of recording, monitoring and analyzing machine downtime and plant efficiency. The purpose of this project is to address all three opportunities and submit relevant suggestions to improve and measure productivity. This report documents a literature study on relevant topics, methodologies and alternative methods {{to be used in}} this project. It also analyses relevant data gained through time studies and other methods, and relates suggested solutions. Through simulation it is found that the number of packers employed may b...|$|E
50|$|Cold frame {{construction}} {{is a common}} home or farm building project, although kits and commercial systems are available. A traditional plan makes use of old glass windows: a wooden frame is built, about one to two feet tall, and the window placed on top. The roof is often sloped towards the winter sun to capture more light, and to improve runoff of water, and hinged for easy access. Clear <b>plastic,</b> <b>rigid</b> or <b>sheeting,</b> {{can be used in}} place of glass. An electric heating cable, available for this purpose, can be placed in the soil to provide additional heat.|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the use of solar radiation for reducing survival of mountain pine beetle populations in infested logs. Ponderosa pine logs were used in experiments 1 and 2 and lodgepole pine logs were used in experiment 3. Experiment 1 comprised three treatments: (1) one-layer solar treatment without <b>plastic</b> <b>sheeting</b> and logs rotated one-third of a turn once a week; (2) two-layer solar treatment with plastic sheeting; and (3) two-layer solar treatment without <b>plastic</b> <b>sheeting.</b> For experiment 2, two additional one-layer treatments were added: one-layer treatment with <b>plastic</b> <b>sheeting</b> and no rotation and a one-layer with no <b>plastic</b> <b>sheeting</b> and no rotation. Experiment 3 included all the above-mentioned one-layer treatments only. For all experiments, brood density per 0. 05 m 2 (0. 5 ft 2) was estimated before and after treatment and analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Subcortical temperatures were monitored in one replicate of all treatments in all experiments. In experiment 2, phloem moisture was monitored before and after treatment in uninfested logs. All treatments in all experiments caused drastic reductions in brood survival. In experiment 1, the one-layer treatment with the logs rotated once a week significantly reduced brood survival compared to the two-layer without <b>plastic</b> <b>sheeting</b> treatment but was not different from the two-layer with <b>plastic</b> <b>sheeting</b> treatment. There were no differences in brood survival after treatment associated with any treatments in experiments 2 and 3. In all experiments brood survival was consistently reduced in the aspect...|$|R
