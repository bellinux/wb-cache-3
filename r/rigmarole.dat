500|$|Some critics {{could not}} see past the production's state of disarray. The Hornet captioned its review, [...] "Thespis; or, the Gods Grown Old and WEARISOME!" [...] The Morning Advertiser found it [...] "a dreary, tedious two-act <b>rigmarole</b> of a plot... {{grotesque}} without wit, and the music thin without liveliness... however, not entirely devoid of melody.... The curtain falls before a yawning and weary audience." [...] But others found much to admire in the work, despite the poor opening performance. The Illustrated Times wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Donoghue {{wrote in}} The New York Times {{that he did}} not care much about what {{happened}} to Alice and her comrades. He felt that Lessing presents Alice as [...] "an unquestioned <b>rigmarole</b> of reactions and prejudices", which leaves no room for any further interest. Donoghue complained that Lessing has not made up her mind on whether her characters are [...] "the salt of the earth or its scum". In a review in the Chicago Tribune, Kuehn felt that the work has little impact and is not memorable. He said Lessing's real interest is character development, but complained that the characters are [...] "trivial or two-dimensional or crippled by self-delusions".|$|E

6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{answered}} Dorothy. [...] "I'm {{anxious to}} see what the <b>Rigmaroles</b> are like, and this path ought to take us there the quickest way." ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Carey described going under-cover as the stalker role: [...] "Well, {{we had a lot}} of people outside. I'm walking up to the Plaza , and when I was dressed as Mariah Carey, there were a lot of people just standing there taking pictures, and the street was closed down, and it was a whole <b>rigmarole.</b> It is what it is. So, basically, I went into costume as the stalker, and I told my bodyguard, 'I don't want you to walk with me.' So, a friend of mine was there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy. On July 10, 2009, Carey announced through her Twitter account that the video would premiere on the talent competition program, America's Got Talent, which was hosted by Cannon. The full version premiered two days later on 106 & Park. Carey was present at the show and discussed the making of the video.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Great Depression many economists traditionally argued against deficit spending. The fear was that government spending would [...] "crowd out" [...] private investment and would thus not have any effect on the economy, a proposition known as the Treasury view. Keynesian economics rejected that view. They argued that by spending vastly more money—using fiscal policy—the government could provide the needed stimulus through the multiplier effect. Without that stimulus business simply would not hire more people, especially the low skilled and supposedly [...] "untrainable" [...] men who had been unemployed for years and lost any job skill they once had. Keynes visited the White House in 1934 to urge President Roosevelt to increase deficit spending. Roosevelt afterwards complained that, [...] "he left a whole <b>rigmarole</b> of figures – he must be a mathematician rather than a political economist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steven Pacey {{was cast}} as Tarrant. Pacey was {{told about the}} part by Chris Boucher at the BBC bar. Remembering his audition, Pacey said, [...] "...reading the {{character}} breakdown, and it said, 'Del Tarrant is thirty-five years old-' and I thought, 'This is a bit silly, I'm only twenty-one'. I went downstairs thinking it {{was a waste of}} time, and saw other actors who all seemed nearer the right age. When I went to see David Maloney [...] his advice to me was to keep my performance as gritty as possible". Maloney was concerned that Pacey's curly hair made Pacey look similar to Gareth Thomas. Judith Smith, Maloney's production secretary, recalled that [...] "...there was all the <b>rigmarole</b> about trying to straighten his hair and can we cut it really short, and what can we do?".|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps some of 'em do write books," [...] {{asserted}} {{the little}} Wizard. [...] "I've {{read a few}} <b>rigmaroles</b> that might have come from this very town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's don't wait," [...] {{returned}} Dorothy. [...] "I've {{heard of}} the <b>Rigmaroles,</b> and wondered what they were like; but now I know, and I'm ready to move on." ...|$|R

2500|$|Florescu {{also earned}} some {{attention}} {{as a literary}} essayist, popularizer, and critic—much inspired by four scholars, whom he deemed the elite of French literature: Abel-François Villemain, Sainte-Beuve, Hippolyte Taine, and Emile Hennequin. Călinescu stresses that Florescu's opening lesson of 1873 was [...] "a lamentable <b>rigmarole</b> that {{addressed the issue of}} historical objectivity". Later tracts were [...] "wordy, without proper ranking of values". According to Bucur, Florescu was an [...] "amateur", [...] "textbook cultivated", [...] "a cultural journalist enthusiastic about beauty and culture, taking pains not to fatigue a public that cannot sustain the effort." [...] According to Iorga, his exposition was [...] "always lively, not without fortunate characterizations"—such as when Florescu depicted Danton as a [...] "poor man's Mirabeau". Overall, however, Iorga referred to Florescu as a [...] "bizarre" [...] or [...] "weird" [...] author. Similarly, the anti-Symbolist Ilarie Chendi viewed Florescu as [...] "cultured, but ill-regulated".|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it!" [...] {{said the}} Wizard, {{laughing}} merrily. [...] "It's a <b>rigmarole</b> because {{the boy is}} a <b>Rigmarole</b> and we've come to <b>Rigmarole</b> Town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, Miss Monson," [...] he continued, {{after a very}} {{beautiful}} specimen of <b>rigmarole</b> {{in the way of}} love-making, a <b>rigmarole</b> that might have very fairly figured in an editor's law and logic, after he had been beaten in a libel suit, [...] "I think, Miss Monson, you cannot have overlooked the VERY particular attentions I have endeavored to pay you, ever since I have been so fortunate as to have made your acquaintance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, stuff!" [...] said Jane peevishly. [...] "You {{are always}} preaching long <b>rigmaroles</b> about nothing at all. I {{did not say}} there was any impropriety about Gertrude. She is too proper to be pleasant, in my opinion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{are you not}} sinning your mercies, you fellows?" [...] Dan replied. [...] "There {{is young}} Kelver here. At school it was always his trouble that he could give us {{a good time and}} make us laugh, which nobody else in the whole school could do. His {{ambition}} was to kick a ball as well as a hundred other fellows could kick it. He could tell us a good story now if he would only write what the Almighty intended him to write, instead of gloomy <b>rigmaroles</b> about suffering Princesses in Welsh caves. I don't say it's bad, but a hundred others could write the same sort of thing better." ...|$|R
60|$|The lighter vessels which passed, overtook, or crossed them, {{in their}} course, failed not to assail {{them with their}} boisterous raillery, which was then called water-wit; for which the extreme plainness of Mistress Martha's features, contrasted with the youth, {{handsome}} figure, and good looks of Nigel, furnished the principal topics; while the circumstance of the boat being somewhat overloaded, did not escape their notice. They were hailed successively, as a grocer's wife upon a party of pleasure with her eldest apprentice--as an old woman carrying her grandson to school--and as a young strapping Irishman, conveying an ancient maiden to Dr. <b>Rigmarole's,</b> at Redriffe, who buckles beggars for a tester and a dram of Geneva. All this abuse was retorted in a similar strain of humour by Greenjacket and his companion, who maintained the war of wit with the same alacrity {{with which they were}} assailed.|$|R

6000|$|... "She's {{intimate}} with ME. Goodness knows what <b>rigmarole</b> I've treated her to!" [...] They had parted an hour ago; since when, he believed, {{her brother had}} arrived.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{his uncle}} exclaimed, as he entered, [...] "I suppose {{you have been}} sent to tell me they have got {{to the bottom of this}} <b>rigmarole</b> affair." ...|$|E

6000|$|After the dog story, {{we thought}} we were going to have a little quiet. But we were mistaken; for, with the same breath with which he {{finished}} the dog <b>rigmarole,</b> our talkative companion added: ...|$|E
6000|$|Without looking around, {{with her}} hands in her lap, an absent look in her eyes, the girl began in a husky contralto voice: [...] "Bounded on the north--" [...] and went through the whole <b>rigmarole</b> in the same way, careless, but certain.|$|E
6000|$|... “However,” says he, “if {{you think}} this money of your father’s ill gotten, my advice to you would be, give some {{of it to the}} lepers and some to the missionary fund. And as for this {{extraordinary}} <b>rigmarole,</b> you cannot do better than keep it to yourselves.” ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked hard}} {{at me with}} his shrewd grey eyes {{all the time that}} he was uttering this <b>rigmarole,</b> and I gave him a glance in return which showed him that he was not dealing with a fool. He took out a canvas bag full of money.|$|E
6000|$|... "However," [...] says he, [...] "if {{you think}} this money of your father's ill gotten, my advice to you would be, give some {{of it to the}} lepers and some to the missionary fund.

6000|$|... "Then why do {{you tell}} me all this <b>rigmarole</b> about your uncle and his leetle property, and Warwickshire? What have I {{to do with your}} uncle? Sir, I do not {{understand}} you--not at all. Nor do I know why I have the honor to see you here, Captain Bood-dle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you are {{speaking}} in riddles, Lisle; {{and if there}} is one thing I hate, it is riddles. When a fellow begins to talk in that way, I always change the subject. Why a man should try to puzzle his brain, with such <b>rigmarole</b> things, is more than I can imagine." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, gentlemen, my {{grandfather}} was shown to his quarters, up a huge Staircase composed of loads of hewn timber; and through long <b>rigmarole</b> passages, hung with blackened paintings of fruit, and fish, and game, and country frollics, and huge kitchens, and portly burgomasters, such as you see about old-fashioned Flemish inns, till at length he arrived at his room.|$|E
60|$|And now, in good sooth, {{why should}} an indigent discerning Freeman give his vote without bribes? Let us rather honour {{the poor man}} that he does discern clearly wherein lies, for him, the true kernel of the matter. What is it to the ragged grimy Freeman of a Tenpound-Franchise Borough, whether Aristides <b>Rigmarole</b> Esq. of the Destructive, or the Hon. Alcides Dolittle of the Conservative Party be sent to Parliament;--much more, whether the two-thousandth part of them be sent, for that {{is the amount of}} his faculty in it? Destructive or Conservative, what will either of them destroy or {{conserve}} of vital moment to this Freeman? Has he found either of them care, at bottom, a sixpence for him or his interests, or those of his class or of his cause, or of any class or cause that is of much value to God or to man? <b>Rigmarole</b> and Dolittle have alike cared for themselves hitherto; and for their own clique, and self-conceited crotchets,--their greasy dishonest interests of pudding, or windy dishonest interests of praise; and not very perceptibly for any other interest whatever. Neither <b>Rigmarole</b> nor Dolittle will accomplish any good or any evil for this grimy Freeman, like giving him a five-pound note, or refusing to give it him. It will be smoothest to vote according to value received. That is the veritable fact; and he indigent, like others that are not indigent, acts conformably thereto.|$|E
60|$|Father Jean {{heard another}} version {{a few weeks}} later, told him by an English officer of Engineers who had ridden from the nearest station on a bicycle and who arrived hot and ravenously thirsty. And Father Jean, under promise of seeing Suzanne on the first opportunity, {{believed}} it. But to most of his flock it sounded an impossible <b>rigmarole,</b> told {{for the purpose of}} disguising the truth.|$|E
60|$|They {{were soon}} among the pretty hills and valleys again, and the Sawhorse sped up hill and {{down at a}} fast and easy pace, the roads being hard and smooth. Mile after mile was speedily covered, and before the ride had grown at all {{tiresome}} they sighted another village. The place seemed even larger than <b>Rigmarole</b> Town, but was not so attractive in appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't tell me, sir," [...] Captain Bayley exclaimed angrily. [...] "What do I {{care for}} evidence? Of course {{he told me}} a long <b>rigmarole</b> story, {{but he could not}} have {{believed}} it himself. No one but a fool could believe my nephew Frank guilty of theft; the idea is preposterous, it was as much as I could do to restrain myself from caning him when he was speaking." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{what did}} the man mean by his {{extraordinary}} <b>rigmarole</b> about the newspaper, and that crazy old woman? he thought suddenly. It was a damnable presumption, anyhow, something that only an Englishman could be capable of. All this {{was a sort of}} sport for him--the sport of revolution--a game to look at from the height of his superiority. And what on earth did he mean by his exclamation, [...] "Won't the truth do?" ...|$|E
