Second, rockets could be arranged in stages. Finally, the exhaust speed (and thus the efficiency) could be greatly increased to beyond {{the speed of sound}} by using a De Laval nozzle.

25|$|Stellar X-ray {{astronomy}} {{is said to}} {{have started}} on April 5, 1974, with the detection of X-rays from Capella. A <b>rocket</b> <b>flight</b> on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella (α Aur). During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor. The X-ray luminosity of Lx = 1031 erg·s−1 (1024 W) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun's X-ray luminosity.|$|E
25|$|On April 1, 2004, the U.S. Department of Transportation {{issued the}} company {{what it called}} the world's first license for a sub-orbital manned <b>rocket</b> <b>flight.</b> The license was {{approved}} by the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which has backed licenses for more than 150 commercial launches of unmanned launch vehicles in its 20 years, but never a license for manned flight on a sub-orbital trajectory. The Mojave Airport, operating part-time as Mojave Spaceport, is the launch point for SpaceShipOne. SpaceShipOne performed the first privately funded human spaceflight on June 21, 2004. Flight 16P on September 29, 2004 and Flight 17P on October 4, 2004 won the X-Prize for Scaled Composites and SpaceShipOne.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{closed loop}} control system has been {{developed}} to maintain the gas pressure in thin-window proportional counters during <b>rocket</b> <b>flights.</b> This system permits convenient external control of detector pressure and system flushing rate.

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering <b>rocket</b> <b>flight</b> from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above. Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere. These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|After {{a launch}} {{of one of}} Goddard's rockets in July 1929 again gained the {{attention}} of the newspapers, Charles Lindbergh learned of his work in a New York Times article. At the time, Lindbergh had begun to wonder what would become of aviation (even space flight) in the distant future and had settled on jet propulsion and <b>rocket</b> <b>flight</b> as a probable next step. After checking with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and being assured that Goddard was a bona fide physicist and not a crackpot, he phoned Goddard in November 1929. Professor Goddard met the aviator soon after, in his office at Clark University. Upon meeting Goddard, Lindbergh was immediately impressed by his research, and Goddard was similarly impressed by the flier's interest. He discussed his work openly with Lindbergh, forming an alliance that would last {{for the rest of his}} life. While having long since become reticent to share his ideas, Goddard showed complete openness with those few who shared his dream, and whom he felt he could trust.|$|E
500|$|Two Aerobee-Hi rocket flights on September 20, 1962, and March 15, 1963, {{detected}} {{and confirmed}} an X-ray source in Auriga at RA [...] Dec , identified as Capella. Stellar X-ray astronomy started on April 5, 1974, with {{the detection of}} X-rays from Capella. A <b>rocket</b> <b>flight</b> on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella. During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor. The X-ray luminosity (Lx) of ~1024 W (1031 erg s−1) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun's X-ray luminosity. Capella's X-rays {{are thought to be}} primarily from the corona of the more massive star. Capella is ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS J051642.2+460001. The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 would require magnetic confinement, unless it is a free-flowing coronal wind.|$|E
40|$|Two <b>rocket</b> <b>flights</b> of an {{absolute}} pyrheliometer, separated by 30 months, indicate {{an increase in}} solar luminosity (solar constant) of 0. 4 percent. The significance of this result is considered {{in light of the}} instrument performance during the <b>rocket</b> <b>flights</b> and of pre- and postflight intercomparisons with independently maintained pyrheliometers. There is a high probability that the measured difference is real. Additional observations are required to determine whether the difference results from random fluctuations in solar luminosity, a nonrandom change of short duration, or a sustained change that has climatological significance...|$|R
