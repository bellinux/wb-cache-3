50|$|The {{implementation}} of reusable plastic containers arises {{as a consequence}} of concerns with sustainability and environmental impact. Use of <b>recyclable</b> plastic <b>packages</b> is beneficial environmentally but is more expensive. The adoption of reusable plastic containers will amount to an approximate annual increase of 0.058 euros/kg of delivered goods. The cost associated with reusable plastic containers are packaging purchasing costs, transportation costs, labor/handling costs, management costs, and costs resulting from losses. Packaging purchasing costs encompasses the cost of the containers as well as any associated service costs. This cost is reoccurring but is only relevant once every 50 cycles, which is the typical lifetime of reusable plastic containers. One cycle consists of the initial stages of processing plastic containers {{all the way to the}} use and recycling of these containers by the consumers. Transportation costs are slightly higher for reusable plastic containers as compared to traditional use and throwaway plastic containers in that these reusable containers need additional transportation to recycling facilities. Reusable plastic containers also require work loading and unloading from trucks as well as quality inspection, this adds additional labor costs. Management costs exists because reusable plastic container stock count needs to be managed. The final cost of reusable plastic containers is the cost incurred when packages are lost or there are errors within the management system. Figure 2 provides a detailed summary of the costs associated with adopting reusable plastic containers.|$|R

50|$|Many {{materials}} {{can be considered}} a “green” material until its background is revealed. Any material that has used toxic or carcinogenic chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing (such as formaldehyde in glues used in woodworking), has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer, or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green. In order for any material to be considered green, it must be resource efficient, not compromise indoor air quality or water conservation, and be energy efficient (both in processing and when in use in the shelter). Resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content, reusable or recyclable content, materials that employ recycled or <b>recyclable</b> <b>packaging,</b> locally available material, salvaged or remanufactured material, material that employs resource efficient manufacturing, and long-lasting material as possible.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of companies are exploring ways to improve their environmental footprint. Some environmental benefits are offered by bio-based plastic packaging; however, this approach requires trade-offs. For example, plastic bottles made with polylactic acid (PLA), a bio-based plastic resin, lack the impact strength offered by plastic bottles made with polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Other trade-offs include diminished shelf life capabilities, increased cost, and recycling infrastructure. In particular, displacement of <b>recyclable</b> plastic <b>packaging</b> with plastics made from renewable resources has created controversy among environmental advocates. Despite its performance, cost, and recycling shortcomings, PLA offers an attractive choice to some because it represents the transition towards use of renewable resources. In an attempt to address trade-offs, I developed an analytical framework with assistance from key stakeholders. After identifying the fundamental objective of the best choice of resin for the manufacture of plastic bottles, I surveyed stakeholders to create a list of essential packaging criteria, with the three major criteria being performance as a bottle material, cost, and environmental impact. I relied on private interviews with industry experts and conference presentations to gather bottle data for four resins: PLA, PET, high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP). The framework for comparison was Multiattribute Utility Theory (MAUT), a methodology designed to address trade-offs among multiple objectives to achieve an overall objective. Based on the survey results and best available data as input for MAUT, PET was the best choice of resin for the beverage bottle. This non-bio-based plastic emerged as the top choice largely due to its superior performance on criteria such as strength and shelf life. Further analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the four plastics showed that even if all environmental and cost characteristics of the bio-based plastic, PLA, were as favorable as any of the other plastics I analyzed, PLA still would not come to the top. Only if PLA’s performance as a bottle material (strength, etc.) increased several fold would PLA become the top choice among the four I analyzed. Similarly, analysis of the weighting of the criteria showed that increasing the weights on environmental criteria, compared to performance and cost criteria, cannot elevate PLA to the top choice, mainly because HDPE has desirable environmental characteristics such as recyclability. Only increasing the weight on environmental criteria such as greenhouse gas emissions while decreasing the weight on all other environmental criteria would allow PLA to become the top choice among the four bottle materials I analyzed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} from 1990 to mid 1993, a {{consortium}} of three institutes were commissioned by the German Environment Office (Umweltbundesamt) to develop a comprehensive methodology for drawing up Life Cycle Inventories for products. This work was carried out {{under the leadership of}} the Fraunhofer Institute (FhILV) in Munich and resulted in considerable data generation. In the studies concerning the manufacture and processing of packaging materials, a group of companies belonging to the Industry Group for Food Technology and Packaging (Industrievereinigung für Lebensmitteltechnologie und Verpackung e. V.) lent their participation by making available industrial data on the manufacture and processing of packaging materials. For one pilot area, concerning different <b>recyclable</b> and refillable <b>packaging</b> systems for fresh milk and beer distribution, results from Life Cycle Inventories were presented to the German Environment Office in June 1993. The Environment Minister at the time (Töpfer) made the information public in September 1993. Life Cycle Inventories for products consist of {{a very large number of}} individual, environmentally relevant facts (150 - 200 facts per balance) and thus no conclusions can be immediately drawn from the information. Our workers were acutely aware of this and had made this point clear on several occasions. They had also indicated the need for an aggregation method for the relevant environmental burdens (an Impact Assessment). This was a task left to the German Environment Office. In July 1994 a study was presented by the Office which, via a complicated and multi-stepped Impact Assessment, finally led to ecological judgement of packaging systems. In a workshop in September 1994, a panel of experts commented on the working methodology and judgements mostly with scepticism. A key point of criticism here was the Office's endeavour to find exaggerated, one-dimensional judgements instead of the internationally respected multi-dimensional "Improvement" approach. Characteristic here was the German Office's "impulse" to look at representative, average situations concerning packaging system usage and not at the factors which largely influence Life Cycle Inventory results, factors, that may - under realistic circumstances - lead to conclusions much different from those drawn from looking at an average situation. In view of this working philosophy, the German Council for Packaging commissioned the Fraunhofer Institute in September 1993 to aggregate the environmental effects and burdens for a number of pilot Life Cycle Inventories. This work required inter-disciplinary teamwork and, at the initiative of the Fraunhofer Institute, a circle of experts was formed in Munich to lay down the conditions required for the aggregation methods...|$|R

40|$|Although green {{consumption}} is increasingly {{popular in the}} academic literature, practice is still far from commonplace among consumers. Few {{studies have been conducted}} to explain consumer reluctance to adopt green products (GPs), particularly with regard to the roles of the various risks consumers perceive in their purchases.

We used a means-end chain (MEC) approach to explore the links that consumers establish between the attributes of green cleaning products, their consequences, and their perceived risks. Findings indicate that consumers perceive greater risk with respect to the functional, financial, and temporal aspects of GPs than to their physical and psychosocial aspects. Social desirability appears to be a strong personal value attached to the purchase of GPs. We also identified positive (pleasant fragrance, natural ingredients, <b>recyclable</b> <b>packaging,</b> lack of health risks, protection of the environment, enhancement of personal and social image) and negative motivations (limited distribution, weaker concentration, less attractive label, higher cost, longer and more complex purchasing process, product ineffectiveness) associated with the purchase of green cleaning products...|$|E
