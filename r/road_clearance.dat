5|$|The 2nd Panzer Division (XVIII Mountain Corps) entered Yugoslavia {{from the}} east {{on the morning of}} 6 April and {{advanced}} westward through the Struma Valley. It encountered little resistance, but was delayed by <b>road</b> <b>clearance</b> demolitions, mines and mud. Nevertheless, the division was able to reach the day's objective, the town of Strumica. On 7 April, a Yugoslav counter-attack against the division's northern flank was repelled, and the following day, the division forced its way across the mountains and overran the thinly manned defensive line of the Greek 19th Mechanized Division south of Doiran Lake. Despite many delays along the mountain roads, an armoured advance guard dispatched toward Thessaloniki succeeded in entering the city by the morning of 9 April. Thessaloniki was taken after a long battle with three Greek divisions under the command of General Bakopoulos, and was followed by the surrender of the Greek Eastern Macedonia Army Section, taking effect at 13:00 on 10 April. In the three days it took the Germans to reach Thessaloniki and breach the Metaxas Line, some 60,000 Greek soldiers were taken prisoner. The British and Commonwealth forces then took over the defence of Greece, with the bulk of the Greek Army fighting to maintain their old positions in Albania.|$|E
25|$|Route 15 {{east of the}} new Northern Liberties loop {{is being}} rebuilt {{as part of a}} {{reconstruction}} project for Interstate 95. The components of the I-95 project related to Route 15 include reconstruction of Girard Avenue's bridge over Aramingo Avenue, and widening and partial realignment of Richmond Street. All the tracks in these areas will be replaced, except for the Richmond & Cumberland loop which will be removed. Also part of the project is the construction of four separate bridges for CSAO tracks over a realigned Richmond Street to replace the low-clearance nuisance bridge left over from the former Port Richmond Yard. The new bridges, rationalized in width to current Conrail trackage, will provide much greater <b>road</b> <b>clearance</b> by virtue of being relocated away from underneath the I-95 viaduct. Route 15 east of Frankford Avenue to the Frankford and Delaware Avenue station and the SugarHouse Casino will be served by a shuttle bus {{for the duration of the}} project, which is expected to last through 2018.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessor, the BMD-4 {{is capable}} of {{parachuting}} from aircraft with the entire crew and passengers inside the vehicle which allows target engagement after landing to be instant. An Il-76 is able to transport two of these vehicles {{at a time in}} comparison to three BMD-1s and BMD-2s. Its engine is the 2V-06-2; the same as the BMD-3. This engine develops a total power of 450 horsepower (hp). The BMD-4 is also fully amphibious with two water jets mounted {{on each side of the}} back of the hull and can swim at speeds of up to 10km/h in a Beaufort scale of 2. With a high power-to-weight ratio, the BMD-4 features superior acceleration in comparison to other infantry fighting vehicles. The maximum speed on a highway is 70km/h and the BMD-4 can maneuver on a 60° gradient and a 35° side slope. The BMD-4 can cross 1.8 m trenches and climb 0.8 m tall obstacles. This vehicle's suspension is hydropneumatic and giving an adjustable ground clearing of 130–530mm with the normal <b>road</b> <b>clearance</b> being 450mm. The clearance is changed by the driver and can be changed within 10 seconds.|$|E

40|$|Subarctic peatlands are {{increasingly}} faced with disturbances from resource extraction industries. Their rehabilitation is being required through government regulation, and backed by financial guarantees. A three-year field experiment {{was conducted to}} test a modification of existing peatland rehabilitation protocols on winter <b>road</b> <b>clearances</b> in subarctic peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowland. The experiment was conducted on severely disturbed sections of winter roads with extensive cut hummocks. Sphagnum fragments were not spread on bare peat surfaces, contrary to existing proto-cols, because of the close proximity to propagules in vast and adjacent, undisturbed peatlands. Factorial combinations of microclimate amelioration (straw mulch) and phosphorus fertilization were applied, as in existing protocols. Rock phosphate fertilization and straw mulch did not increase the recolonization of Sphagnum nor of other bryophytes, lichens or vascular plants. After three years, Sphagnum remained almost absent and bare peat was colonized mostly by lichens and bryophytes typical of disturbed peat surfaces. The spreading of fragments on top of severely disturbed surface peats appears to be {{required in order to}} rehabilitate peatlands, even when extensive undisturbed peatlands are found nearby...|$|R

500|$|The 3rd Pioneers would {{subsequently}} {{serve on}} the Western Front from late 1916 {{until the end of}} the war. After a brief period of acclimatisation in a [...] "nursery sector" [...] around Armentieres, the battalion's first major action came around Messines in June 1917, during which several of the battalion's companies were assigned to the assaulting companies to dig communication trenches while other troops were assigned general engineering duties such as <b>road</b> <b>clearance,</b> tramway maintenance, anti-aircraft defence and water supply, laying pipes and ensuring that they were maintained throughout the battle. Following this, the battalion's next major battle of 1917 was the Third Battle of Ypres, before moving back to Wavrans in late October 1917. One member of the battalion, Lance Corporal Walter Peeler, received the Victoria Cross, for his bravery during the Battle of Broodseinde in October 1917. During the action, Peeler was part of a Lewis Gun team that was supporting the 37th Infantry Battalion; tasked with providing anti-aircraft defence, when the first wave of the assault was held up, Peeler advanced ahead of the assaulting infantry and destroyed one of the German positions that was causing heavy casualties. He then proceeded to destroy a machine gun position.|$|E

40|$|Road {{networks}} in mountainous areas {{are particularly vulnerable}} following natural and man-made incidents since they are sparse and have {{a limited number of}} links and nodes. This weakness, or vulnerability, complicates the management of traffic flows in the event of emergencies, thus leading to problems of congestion and accessibility. The case of the international corridors along Alpine Valleys is significant since they serve both tourist and commercial routes, and have a typical tree-like structure that accommodates few roads dedicated to long-distance mobility and to local access. To manage emergencies and support the decision making process, local administrations and Civil Protection Agencies should use tools able to evaluate the effects of localized or widespread network failures or incidents in real-time, and limit the effects of reduced accessibility and/or differentiated traffic demand. The authors have developed a dedicated tool, called PoliNET that implements the Network Analyst® extension of ArcGIS® to solve specific vehicle routing problems for mountainous road network. Essentially, PoliNET identifies the best (shortest and fastest) routes for different vehicle categories (cars and motorcycles, vans and small trucks, articulated lorry and tractor-trailers, exceptional load vehicles) when the network operates under specific constraints (<b>road</b> <b>clearances)</b> and/or experiencing failures (interruption).

50|$|Tires {{are often}} {{improved}} on off-road vehicles {{in order to}} better traverse rough terrain. Regular automotive tires don't provide enough traction to help a vehicle through sand, dirt, snow and ice, so specialized tires are normally used on off-road 4x4 vehicles. Large overall wheel diameter provides a better ride comfort and <b>road</b> <b>clearance.</b> Wide tires help to distribute the weight on sand, while narrower tires help get better traction in the snow or on ice. Each tire type has its own tread type to provide a proper grip in certain road conditions. Common off-road tire types are: Sand tires, Mud-terrain tire, Snow tires and All-terrain tire.|$|E

The Southgate West development was underway on land covered by Hogs Hill Farm, which occupied a ridge of land between the Horsham and Brighton <b>Roads.</b> Land <b>clearance</b> revealed two ditches filled with debris such as bones and pieces of pottery. [...] The next year, a large house on Horsham Road was demolished {{to make way for a}} new road of houses; the builders discovered similar pits, and the remains were identified as pre-Roman using carbon dating techniques. The remains of crucibles, slag and other ironworking materials were also discovered; these were confirmed as being from the same era, the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. [...] It was later confirmed that the Hogs Hill Farm remains dated from the Roman era, meaning that the ironmaking and pottery-producing activities of the Atrebates were continued by their conquerors. [...] By the time the excavations and investigation finished, evidence of three iron bloomeries, a small flint mine, roof tiles (possibly from a building on the site) and many pieces of pottery had been found and catalogued.|$|R
5000|$|Basic {{modifications}} are simple. A lightweight, shortened fiberglass {{front body}} panel is fitted after the sheet metal from the trunk lid edge forward and rear engine deck lid and everything rearward (rear apron and engine compartment) is removed. The rear treatment leaves the engine totally exposed to aid in cooling. A tubular steel cage front and rear bumper is fitted to the body and floor pan for protection of engine and occupants. Shortened fiberglass fenders both front and rear meant removal of the Beetle's distinctive running boards and the likely addition of more tubular steel parts (side bars) in their place. The rugged torsion bar front and rear suspension standard on the Beetle, allows it to withstand the rigors of offroading and the rear ride height to easily be raised slightly and stiffened to make clearance for larger heavy-duty off-road tires and wheels. The relatively light {{front end of the}} Beetle allows some compensation for the lack of four wheel drive. The taller sidewall tires provide more flexible ride comfort and rocky <b>road</b> ground <b>clearance.</b> The Beetle suspension [...] "stops" [...] can be moved to allow more suspension travel. Longer shock absorbers for the increase in suspension travel, provide more damping control over bumps giving more driver control and comfort. Some people eliminate the torsion bar suspension and install coilover-type springs that mount to a roll cage, allowing extreme amounts of travel with a very comfortable ride.|$|R
