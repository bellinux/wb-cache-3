5000|$|Zátopek's running {{style was}} {{distinctive}} {{and very much}} at odds with what {{was considered to be}} an efficient style at the time. His head would often <b>roll,</b> <b>face</b> contorted with effort, while his torso swung from side to side. He often wheezed and panted audibly while running, which earned him the nicknames of [...] "Emil the Terrible" [...] or the [...] "Czech Locomotive". When asked about his tortured facial expressions, Zátopek is said to have replied that [...] "It isn't gymnastics or figure skating, you know." [...] In addition he would train in any weather, including snow, and would often do so while wearing heavy work boots as opposed to special running shoes. He was always willing to give advice to other runners. One example he often gave was always to be relaxed and to help ensure that while running, gently touch the tip of your thumb with the tip of your index or middle finger. Just making that slight contact would ensure that arms and shoulders remained relaxed.|$|E
40|$|Helical wedge rolling (HWR) is a {{forming process}} wherein the wedges are {{helically}} wound on the <b>roll</b> <b>face.</b> To form a product, two identical rolls {{need to be}} used, both positioned askew to the axis of the billet (cylindrical bar). In {{order to maintain the}} material between the rolls rotating in the same direction, the tools cut into the material, making it rotate and translate (towards the axis of the billet) at the same time. The helically moving wedges form the material into the desired shape. In the final stage of the process, the formed product is cut off from the bar stock by the cutters located right behind the wedges. Developed at the Lublin University of Technology (Poland), the innovative HWR process has been successfully applied to produce balls. The present paper describes an example of the application of the HWR process for producing a lever preform made of aluminum alloy. The design of the process is discussed and the tools used in the process are described. The developed rolling method was positively verified by a numerical simulation.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} a fine in-plane (<b>roll)</b> <b>face</b> orientation estimation for a perspective face analysis algorithm that requires normalized frontal faces. As {{most of the}} face analysers (e. g., gender, expression, and recognition) need frontal up-right faces, {{there is a clear}} need for the precise roll estimation, as precise face normalization has an important role in classification methods. The in-plane orientation estimation algorithm is constructed on top of regular Viola-Jones frontal face detector. When a face is detected for the first time, it is rotated with respect to the face origin to find the boundaries of the detection. Mean value of these angles {{is said to be the}} measurement of the in-plane rotation of the face. Since we only need a face detection algorithm, the proposed method can work effectively on very small sized faces where traditional landmark (eye, mouth) or planar detection based estimations fail. Experiments on controlled and unconstrained large-scale datasets (CMU Rotated, YouTube, Boston University Face Tracking, Caltech, FG-NET Aging, BioID and Manchester Talking-Face) showed that the proposed method is robust to various settings for in-plane face orientation estimation in terms of RMSE and MAE. We achieved less than ± 3. 5 ∘ mean absolute error for roll estimation which proves that the accuracy of the proposed method is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art tracking based approaches for the roll estimation...|$|E

40|$|Titanium and its alloys have {{extremely}} high {{strength to weight}} ratio and corrosion resistance. This has made titanium alloys very attractive materials for many structural applications. However, {{the high price of}} these alloys has seen their use restricted to very few high performance areas such as aerospace and bio-medical applications. The costs can be significantly reduced by directly converting titanium powder to metal products, particularly via the direct powder rolling process. This present research is based on a parametric study of powder rolling and operational effects including rolling speed, roll gap size, roll surface width and powder feeding rate on the integrity of the metal powder compacted strip that is produced from the direct powder rolling process. The objectives of this work were to predict the powder rolling compaction performance in terms of compaction pressure, roll surface force and rolling torque, and produce the highest possible relative density of CP-titanium green strips by optimized rolling variable setups, and to achieve its full density by additional hot deformation processing. In this work, a purpose-built gravity fed vertical powder rolling mill with a roller diameter of 265 mm and a roller width of 150 mm was used. Johanson's powder rolling model has been implemented to simulate performance and a series of rolling parameter setups have been conducted by the using a purpose-built powder rolling mill. Pre-alloyed, water-atomized stainless steel 316 L powder and hydride-dehydride (HDH) CP-titanium powders with a mean particle size of 100 μm were used as the experimental material to validate the simulated results in terms of relative density and strip dimensions. The powder rolling experiments were carried out based on the Johanson's powder rolling model to conduct a parametric experimental study in various setups of powder rolling parameter combinations, including roll gap, <b>roll</b> <b>face</b> width, rolling speed and powder feeding rate...|$|E

40|$|As {{the initial}} five-y ar {{authorization}} for the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) nears an end, {{there is much}} discussion concerning reauthorization. This paper enters that discussion {{from the vantage point}} of the distinctive region of Appalachian Ohio. We investigate the persp ctives of those most affected by welfare reform: Recipients, agency directors, employers, front-line w rkers, and county commissioners. We focus on two of the primary goals of PRWORA: Family support and labor force attachment. Additionally, since meeting these goals depends largely upon levels of federal and state funding, we also investigate expectations and concerns regarding levels of financial support. The purpose of this study is to determine the lessons that can be learned concerning the reauthorization of PRWORA, especially ones that pertain to poor, rural regions such as Appalachian Ohio. Some lessons are familiar ones and have been illustrated in other contexts. For example, we show that high levels of funding should be maintained and also hat most families remaining on welfare <b>rolls</b> <b>face</b> multiple barriers to employment. Other lessons, however, are shaped by the characteristics that make Appalachian Ohio so unique. One such lesson is the essential nature of economic development; we give vidence that Appalachian Ohi...|$|R
