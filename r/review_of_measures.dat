The review concludes with considerations that should be taken into account when selecting emotion measure(s) for use in psychotherapy research and practice. These considerations include having a clear working definition of emotion, reliability issues that arise when measures reflect a state-dependent construct (e. g., emotional experience), and the potential need to assess more than one component of emotional responding.

The aim of the paper is {{to answer the question}} <b>of</b> whether these <b>measures</b> are adequate. Building on comparative <b>reviews</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> association, the paper identifies three additional measures as suitable candidates. These additional measures, together with the five existing ones, are assessed for their theoretical utility based on seven criteria laid out in the paper. Subsequently, the same measures are applied to South African multiple-cause data that comprises over four million records. The multiple-cause software Cause_limp v 1. 1 was used to extract the data for the cell entries of the 2 x 2 contingency table, with diabetes as a multiple-cause and cardiac arrest as a co-morbid condition. The paper concludes that existing <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> multiple-cause mortality need to be supplemented with other measures, in particular the Positive Matching Index (PMI).

All equations are coupled {{to a general}} surface mass transfer boundary condition.

This review also covers some areas {{that may not be}} well recognized. The key role of the effective diffusivity is highlighted, with a brief <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>measured</b> values. The temperature-dependence of the surface oxidation rate is shown to be more complex than usually shown for the diffusion-affected zone. Assumption of linear kinetics permits ready estimation of equilibration time for development of the quasi-steady burnoff profile. In addition, approximations for the time-steady hydrogen concentration profiles are developed for the case of oxidation by H 2 O.
