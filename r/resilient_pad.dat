25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of traditional track structures is the heavy demand for maintenance, particularly surfacing (tamping) and lining {{to restore the}} desired track geometry and smoothness of vehicle running. Weakness of the subgrade and drainage deficiencies also lead to heavy maintenance costs. This can be overcome by using ballastless track. In its simplest form this consists of a continuous slab of concrete (like a highway structure) with the rails supported directly on its upper surface (using a <b>resilient</b> <b>pad).</b>|$|E
50|$|The rhinarium {{is adapted}} for {{different}} purposes in different mammals according to ecological niche. In aquatic mammals, development of lobes {{next to the}} nostrils {{allow them to be}} closed for diving. In mammals that dig or root with their noses, the rhinarium often develops into a <b>resilient</b> <b>pad,</b> with the nostrils off to the side or below, and capable of closing for exclusion of dust. Examples include the common wombat, marsupial mole, and members of the Chrysochloridae. In the elephants it has become a tactile organ. In the walrus, it is covered with stiff bristles to protect it during foraging for shellfish. In many animals the form and purpose of the rhinarium remains to be elucidated.|$|E

40|$|Although railroads {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular modes of {{transportation}} in countries such as Sri Lanka, Australia, and USA, their rapidly growing populations and increasing congestion in road transport has created severe challenges to the sustainability of rail transport infrastructure, which in turn increases the de-mand for high speed and heavy-haul trains. Ballast is the foundation material beneath concrete sleepers that provides key structural support against the high dynamic loading exerted by moving trains. However, the deg-radation of ballast seriously affects track stability and longevity. In recent years the use of <b>resilient</b> rubber <b>pads</b> has become increasingly popular. In this study, large scale cyclic and impact load tests were performed at the University of Wollongong to understand performance of ballast and the subsequent mitigation of ballast deg-radation using <b>resilient</b> rubber <b>pads.</b> The test results confirm that the use of <b>resilient</b> <b>pads</b> significantly reduces the ballast deformation and degradation due to high cyclic and impact stresses...|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} to specificate the formation process of stress-strain state of {{buildings in the}} construction process is a new problem which requires including real production characteristics going beyond calculation models into calculation methods. Today the construction process lacks this specification. When mounting vibroisolators the stress-strein of a structure state is changing. The mounting method of vibroisolators is patented and consists in multistage successive compression loading of each vibroisolator with the constant speed and following fixation of this displacement. The specified engineering method of rubber-steel pads calculation in view of change of their form during deformation, nonlinearity, rheological processes is offered. <b>Resilient</b> <b>pads</b> look like rubber plates rectangular in plane reinforced on the basic surfaces with metal sheets. The influence of a time-variable static load and free vibrations of loaded pads are considered...|$|R
40|$|Rail track {{substructure}} (ballast, subballast and subgrade) is {{the most}} essential component of the railway system in view of track stability. The ballast is the largest component of the track substructure {{and it is the}} key load-bearing stratum packed with rock aggregates underneath and around the sleepers, thereby providing structural support against dynamic stresses caused by moving trains. However under large dynamic stresses exerted by heavy haul and high speed trains, the degradation of track substructure including ballast becomes significant. This in turn affects the track stability and creates frequent maintenance, thus increasing the life cycle cost of the rail network. Therefore, mitigating degradation of the ballast layer is vital in view of track longevity. In recent years, the use of <b>resilient</b> soft <b>pads</b> (shock mats) above the ballast (i. e. Under Sleeper Pad, USP) and below the ballast (i. e. Under Ballast Mat, UBM) has become a common practice. Many countries, including Australia have adopted the use of <b>resilient</b> <b>pads</b> in the rail track foundation. Currently, the studies on resilient mats are mostly limited to the reduction of vibration and noise. There is a lack of proper assessment of the geotechnical behavior of ballast when used along with shock mats. This paper provides an assessment of the triaxial behavior of the track substructure with and without shock mats under dynamic loading condition. A numerical model was developed based on the modified stress-dilatancy approach to capture the stress-strain and volume change behavior of ballast during impact loading. Model predictions are compared with laboratory results. It was found that the shock mats provide significant advantages in terms of reduced particle breakage and enhanced track stability...|$|R

40|$|Turnouts are a {{key element}} of the railway system. They are also the part of the system with the highest number of {{degradation}} modes and associated failures. There are a number of reasons for this, including high dynamic loads resulting from non-uniform rail geometry and track support stiffness. The main aim {{of this study is to}} propose a methodology to optimise the pad stiffness along a crossing panel in order to achieve a decrease in the indicators of the most common failure modes. A three-dimensional vehicle/track interaction model has been established, considering a detailed description of the crossing panel support structure. A genetic algorithm has been applied to two main types of constructions, namely direct and indirect fixing, to find the optimum combinations of <b>resilient</b> <b>pad</b> characteristics for various cases of travelling direction, travelling speed and support conditions...|$|E
40|$|A sealed, low {{maintenance}} battery (10, 100) is formed of a casing (14, 102) having a sealed lid (12, 104) enclosing cell compartments (22, 110) formed by walls (24, 132). The cells comprise a stack (26) of horizontally disposed negative active plates (30) and positive active plates (28) interspersed with porous, resilient separator sheets (30). Each plate has {{a set of}} evenly spaced tigs (40, 41) disposed on one side thereof; like polarity tigs being disposed {{on one side and}} opposite polarity tigs on the other. Columns of tigs are electrically and mechanically joined by vertical bus bars (46). The bus bars contain outwardly projecting arms (56) of opposite polarity which are electrically joined at each partition wall (24) to electrically connect the cells in series. The stack is compressed by biasing means such as <b>resilient</b> <b>pad</b> (58) attached to the lid or by joining the tigs (52) to the post (48) at a distance less than the thickness of the mat (124). The end bus bars (46) are joined to straps (60, 62) which connect to the terminals (16, 18). The negative plates contain more capacity than the positive plates and the starved electrolyte imbibed in the separator sheets permits pressurized operation during which oxygen diffuses through the separator sheet to the negative plate where it recombines. Excess pressure is relieved through the vent and pressure relief valve (20) ...|$|E
40|$|The complex {{stiffness}} of resilient elements {{is an important}} parameter {{required in order to}} model vibration isolation for many applications. Measurement methods are being standardized which allow such a stiffness to be measured as a function of excitation frequency for known loading conditions. This paper describes one such method, the direct method, in which the resilient element is placed between two large blocks, the vibrations of which are measured. A number of refinements to this method are proposed here. These aspects of the method are then illustrated by using example results of measurements on a <b>resilient</b> rail <b>pad</b> for use in railway track. It is shown how the frequency range of the measurements can be extended and how rotational and lateral components can be separated reliably...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on track}} {{stiffness}} and wheelâ€“rail contact forces measured in a demonstrator turnout (switch & crossing, S&C), a viscously damped track model for simulation of vehicle dynamics is developed and validated. Track stiffness at nominal wheel loads, {{in the frequency}} range up to 20 Hz, was measured using a rolling stiffness measurement vehicle (RSMV). Vertical and lateral contact forces were measured by an instrumented wheelset mounted in a freight car featuring Y 25 bogies. The measurements were performed for traffic both in the through and diverging routes, and in the facing and trailing moves. The full set of test runs was repeated with different types of rail pad to investigate the influence of track stiffness on contact forces. It is concluded that wheelâ€“rail impact loads at the crossing can be reduced by using more <b>resilient</b> rail <b>pads.</b> The track model is a mass-spring-damper model that is moving with each wheelset in the vehicle model. Reasonable agreement between simulated and measured vertical contact forces at the crossing can be obtained when using a track model with one vertical degree of freedom (dof) per rail, each with neglected inertia, coupled to one track mass with one vertical and one rotational dof. This model can be tuned to capture the large phase delay in dynamic track stiffness at low frequencies, {{as measured by the}} RSMV, and remaining sufficiently resilient at higher frequencies...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} {{simulation}} of dynamic interaction between a railway vehicle and a turnout (switch and crossing, S&C) is validated versus field measurements. In particular, the implementation {{and accuracy of}} viscously damped track models with different complexities are assessed. The validation data come from full-scale field measurements of dynamic track stiffness and wheel-rail contact forces in a demonstrator turnout that was installed {{as part of the}} INNOTRACK project with funding from the European Union Sixth Framework Programme. Vertical track stiffness at nominal wheel loads, in the frequency range up to 20 Hz, was measured using a rolling stiffness measurement vehicle (RSMV). Vertical and lateral wheel-rail contact forces were measured by an instrumented wheel set mounted in a freight car featuring Y 25 bogies. The measurements were performed for traffic in both the through and diverging routes, and in the facing and trailing moves. The full set of test runs was repeated with different types of rail pad to investigate the influence of rail pad stiffness on track stiffness and contact forces. It is concluded that impact loads on the crossing can be reduced by using more <b>resilient</b> rail <b>pads.</b> To allow for vehicle dynamics simulations at low computational cost, the track models are discretised space-variant mass-spring-damper models that are moving with each wheel set of the vehicle model. Acceptable agreement between simulated and measured vertical contact forces at the crossing can be obtained when the standard GENSYS track model is extended with one ballast/subgrade mass under each rail. This model can be tuned to capture the large phase delay in dynamic track stiffness at low frequencies, as measured by the RSMV, while remaining sufficiently resilient at higher frequencies...|$|R
40|$|The turnout (Switch & Crossing) {{is a vital}} {{component}} in railway networks as it provides flexibility to traffic operation by allowing trains to switch between tracks. The flexibility comes at a cost as the common lack of a transition curve in the diverging route together with the variation and discontinuities in rail profiles result in higher rail degradation rates than in regular track. In this thesis, dynamic interaction between vehicle and turnout is studied using numerical tools for multibody dynamics with focus on laying a foundation for robust optimization of turnout geometry. Considering a stochastic spread in traffic parameters, quantitative and qualitative estimates of rail profile degradation are computed. The influence of wheel profile wear on wheelâ€“rail interaction in a turnout is studied, and it is concluded that equivalent conicity is the wheel profile characterization parameter with the best correlation to rail damage of the investigated parameters. In addition, the influence of hollow worn wheels on rail damage is investigated and {{it is found that}} such wheel profiles display a significantly different and potentially more harmful running behaviour at the crossing. The influence of wheelâ€“rail friction coefficient is studied and it is shown that friction correlates strongly to lateral contact forces and wear in the diverging route. Wheelset steering, considering the turnout specific configuration of rail profiles and the presence of check rails, is discussed. One of the track models studied is a discretized mass-spring-damper model with nine degrees-of-freedom. This track model can be tuned to capture the large phase delay at low frequencies found in measurements of dynamic track stiffness, while remaining sufficiently resilient at higher frequencies. Good agreement between the simulation model and field measurement data has been observed. It is concluded that the use of more <b>resilient</b> rail <b>pads</b> can reduce wheelâ€“rail impact loads during the crossing transition...|$|R
40|$|In {{ballasted}} railway track, {{the deterioration}} of a sleeper and ballast support usually occurs due to both regular and irregular wheel/rail interactions. The repeated impact of train wheels over sleepers can reduce the lifetime of a sleeper and degrade ballast. To attenuate {{the effect of the}} impact loads on concrete sleepers, the <b>resilient</b> rail seat <b>pads</b> are used. After a certain time in service conditions, the worn rail pads have to be replaced. Assessment of the condition of rail pads is of great importance to track engineers and {{plays an important role in}} the overall track maintenance cost. A non-destructive methodology for evaluating and monitoring the dynamic properties of the rail pads has been developed based on an instrumented hammer impact technique and an equivalent single degree-of-freedom system approximation. In this study, the sample rail pads were collected during track maintenance work on a rail network in New South Wales, Australia. The measurements were performed using an instrumented hammer in a frequency range between 0 and 1, 000 Hz. The effective mass, dynamic stiffness, and dynamic damping ratio were extracted in order to assess the current condition of the worn rail pads, thus assisting track engineers to optimise track maintenance operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{repeated}} {{impact of}} train wheels over sleepers {{can reduce the}} lifetime of a sleeper and degrade ballast. In more extreme cases {{it can lead to}} the breakdown of the concrete sleeper. Concrete sleepers are rigid compared to steel and wooden sleepers and therefore it is necessary to provide impact attenuation to prevent premature breakdown of the concrete. One of the measures employed to attenuate the effect of the impact loads on concrete sleepers has been the use of the <b>resilient</b> rail seat <b>pads.</b> Numerous analytical and numerical models have been formulated to investigate the dynamic behaviour of railway track substructures. All models require careful selection of the track component properties to satisfactorily represent track vibration response. However, there is currently no standard method available {{that can be used to}} evaluate the dynamic properties of the rail pads. At the University of Wollongong, an instrumented hammer was used to excite an equivalent single degree-of-freedom system (SDOF), incorporating a rail <b>pad</b> as a <b>resilient</b> element, to determine the dynamic properties using methods of modal analysis. The analytical SDOF dynamic model was applied to best fit the experimental modal measurements that were performed in a frequency range of 0 - 500 Hz. The curve fitting gives such dynamic parameters as the effective mass, dynamic stiffness, and dynamic damping constant, all of which are required for numerical modelling of a railway track...|$|R
40|$|A {{state-of-the-art}} {{study on}} ground-borne vibration induced by railway turnouts (switches & crossings) is presented. Vibration generating mechanisms and possibilities for cost-effective mitigation measures are discussed. A brief literature survey {{and examples of}} results from vibration measurements performed by the Schweizerische Bundesbahnen (SBB) are presented. The present work was performed within the EU FP 7 project RIVAS (Railway Induced Vibration Abatement Solutions). Mitigation measures for turnouts described in the literature mainly aim at reducing the dynamic wheel-rail contact force (impact load) in the crossing panel. This is supported by field observations of amplified ground-borne vibration at turnouts, indicating {{that there is a}} need to improve the design of these track components. A smooth wheel transition between wing rail and crossing nose is important to achieve low energy impacts on the crossing. Measures to mitigate the vibrations include the use of soft or stiff Under Sleeper Pads (USP) for better and more stable turnout geometry over time. The use of USP may also reduce the magnitude of vibrations transferred from turnout to soil. Other measures include improving the design of the crossing panel (material and geometry of crossing nose and wing rails) and the use of more <b>resilient</b> rail <b>pads.</b> Results from a Swiss test campaign at two different sites (Rubigen and Le Landeron), using stiff USP in four turnouts, are presented and compared to results from four nominal turnouts without USP. However, the vibrations measured at Le Landeron, and even more so for Rubigen, seem to be significantly influenced by the turnout and soil conditions. It is important to accurately determine the condition of each turnout to enable a meaningful comparison between the turnouts and to draw conclusions on the influence of turnout mitigation measures on vibration emission. The best approach to reduce the amplification of vibration is a system approach where different parameters (such as rail profiles, rail material, resilient layers) are designed to interact in a harmonious and robust way. It is thus important to identify the combination of parameters that defines the design of an optimum turnout. Modelling is required to optimize the wheel transition over the crossing panel. Further tests are needed to define the relevant geometric parameters influencing the wheel trajectory and the amplified vibrations. If an improvement of the dynamic wheel-rail interaction (wheel transition) can be accomplished that reduces impact loads on the crossing panel, both vibration magnitudes and the need for crossing panel maintenance can be reduced...|$|R
