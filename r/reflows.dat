The <b>reflow</b> soldering process by RTP system can be successful, but it is sensitive to some typical defects.

Collateral flow was assessed before coronary angioplasty, and contrast <b>reflow</b> was evaluated 15  minutes after reperfusion. The presence of contractile reserve was assessed by low dose dobutamine echocardiography (5  to 15  µg/kg/min) at (mean (SD)) 3  (2) days after myocardial infarction. Recovery of segmental function (myocardial viability) was evaluated by resting echocardiography at a two month follow up. The study was prospective.  PATIENTS— 35 consecutive patients referred for acute transmural myocardial infarction.  RESULTS—Contrast <b>reflow</b> was observed in 20  patients (57 %) and collateral flow in 14  (40 %). Contrast <b>reflow</b> and collateral contrast flow were both correlated with reversible dysfunction on initial dobutamine echocardiography and at follow up (p <  0. 05). The presence of <b>reflow</b> or collateral flow on myocardial contrast echocardiography was a highly sensitive (100 %) but weakly specific (60 %) indicator of segmental dysfunction recovery.

The morphology, size and chemical nature of the interfacial IMCs play a very important role on the reliability of the ultra fine pitch flip chip interconnects. P-enriched layer (Ni 3 P) underneath the interfacial Ni 3 Sn 4 for Sn- 3. 5 Ag solder was a weak interface, along which the failures were prone to occur...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper focuses on the effect of <b>reflow</b> process on the contact resistance and reliability of anisotropic conductive film (ACF) interconnection. The contact resistance of ACF interconnection increases after <b>reflow</b> process due to the decrease in contact area of the conducting particles between the mating I/O pads. However, the relationship between the contact resistance and bonding parameters of the ACF interconnection with <b>reflow</b> treatment follows the similar trend to that of the as-bonded (i. e. without <b>reflow)</b> ACF interconnection. The contact resistance increases as the peak temperature of <b>reflow</b> profile increases. Nearly 40 % of the joints were found to be open after <b>reflow</b> with 260 °C peak temperature. During the <b>reflow</b> process, the entrapped (between the chip and substrate) adhesive matrix tries to expand much more than the tiny conductive particles because of the higher coefficient of thermal expansion, the induced thermal stress will try to lift the bump from the pad and decrease the contact area of the conductive path and eventually, leading to a complete loss of electrical contact. In addition, the environmental effect on contact resistance such as high temperature/humidity aging test was also investigated. Compared with the ACF interconnections with Ni/Au bump, higher thermal stress in the Z-direction is accumulated in the ACF interconnections with Au bump during the <b>reflow</b> process owing to the higher bump height, thus greater loss of contact area between the particles and I/O pads leads to an increase of contact resistance and poorer reliability after <b>reflow...</b>|$|R

Arterial blood flow was measured using ultrason-ography. Cell death, inflammation and nitrotyrosine were measured using immunofluorescence. When <b>reflow</b> was first induced in the contralateral side, we observed improved outcome markers compared with those when <b>reflow</b> was first induced in the ipsilateral side and/or simultaneous <b>reflow</b> was induced in both sides. Our data suggest that progressive rerouting of arterial flow through the circle of Willis toward the ischemic site reduced cell death...|$|R
40|$|Effects of <b>reflow</b> {{time on the}} {{interfacial}} microstructure and {{shear strength}} of the SAC/FeNi-Cu connections were investigated. It {{was found that the}} amount of Cu 6 Sn 5 within the solder did not have a noticeable increase after a long time period of <b>reflowing,</b> indicating that the electro-deposited FeNi layer blocked the Cu atoms effectively into the solder area during a long period under liquid-conditions. The ball shear test results showed that the SAC/FeNi-Cu joint had a comparable strength to the SAC/Cu joint after <b>reflowing,</b> and the strength drop after <b>reflowing</b> for 210 s was less than that of the SAC/Cu joint...|$|R
