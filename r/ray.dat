The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) {{controlled}} {{most of the}} opening of the match with aerial maneuvers against The Heavenly Bodies (Jimmy Del <b>Ray</b> and Tom Pritchard). Del <b>Ray</b> tried to help his partner but superkicked him instead. The Heavenly Bodies gained the advantage after Pritchard performed a powerbomb on Morton, which Del <b>Ray</b> followed with a moonsault. Del <b>Ray</b> and Morton fought back and forth, with Del <b>Ray</b> performing another moonsault and Morton executing a hurricanrana. After all four wrestlers brawled in the ring once more, Del <b>Ray</b> hit Gibson in the back with a tennis racquet. Pritchard then pinned Gibson to win the belts for The Heavenly Bodies.|$|E
5|$|At the secured facility, Fauxlivia is able {{to clear}} Peter, Astrid (Jasika Nicole) and Walter from the lab {{in order to allow}} <b>Ray</b> access to the lab. <b>Ray</b> {{continues}} to avoid shifting to a new body. Walter returns to the lab to confirm a theory and is interrupted by <b>Ray.</b> <b>Ray</b> successfully removes the data device, knocks out Walter, and flees to give it to Newton. When <b>Ray</b> requests to be able to return to his family, Newton kills him near his home, but by this time, the Fringe division has identified <b>Ray</b> and have converged on his address. On spotting Newton, they engage in a car chase, eventually damaging Newton's car. Fauxlivia recovers Van Horn's data disc from Newton and hides it before taking Newton into custody.|$|E

50|$|Anticrepuscular <b>rays</b> or antisolar <b>rays</b> {{are similar}} to crepuscular <b>rays,</b> but seen {{opposite}} the sun in the sky. Anticrepuscular <b>rays</b> are near-parallel, but appear to converge at the antisolar point because of linear perspective. Anticrepuscular <b>rays</b> are most frequently visible near sunrise or sunset. Crepuscular <b>rays</b> are usually much brighter than anticrepuscular <b>rays.</b> This is because for crepuscular <b>rays,</b> seen {{on the same side}} of the sky as the sun, the atmospheric light scattering and making them visible is taking place at small angles (see Mie theory).|$|R

5|$|In 1949, <b>Ray</b> married Bijoya Das, {{his first}} cousin and long-time sweetheart. The couple had a son, Sandip, {{who is now}} a film {{director}}. In the same year, French director Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River. <b>Ray</b> helped him to find locations in the countryside. <b>Ray</b> told Renoir about his idea of filming Pather Panchali, which had long been on his mind, and Renoir encouraged him in the project. In 1950, D.J. Keymer sent <b>Ray</b> to London to work at its headquarters office. During his three months in London, <b>Ray</b> watched 99 films. Among these was the neorealist film Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle Thieves) (1948) by Vittorio De Sica, which {{had a profound impact on}} him. <b>Ray</b> later said that he came out of the theatre determined to become a film-maker.|$|E

5|$|Satyajit Ray's ancestry can {{be traced}} back for at least ten generations. Ray's grandfather, Upendrakishore <b>Ray</b> was a writer, illustrator, philosopher, publisher, amateur {{astronomer}} and a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, a religious and social movement in nineteenth century Bengal. He also set up a printing press by the name of U. <b>Ray</b> and Sons, which formed a crucial backdrop to Satyajit's life. Sukumar <b>Ray,</b> Upendrakishore's son and father of Satyajit, was a pioneering Bengali writer of nonsense rhyme (abol tabol) and children's literature, an illustrator and a critic. <b>Ray</b> was born to Sukumar and Suprabha <b>Ray</b> in Calcutta.|$|E

5|$|The {{electric}} shock delivered by a marbled electric <b>ray</b> can be severe {{but is not}} directly life-threatening. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, when live rays were used to treat conditions such as chronic headaches. This and other electric <b>ray</b> species are used as model organisms in biomedical research. Various coastal demersal fisheries take the marbled electric <b>ray</b> as bycatch; captured rays are usually discarded as they have little commercial value. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and thus International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this <b>ray</b> under Data Deficient. In the Mediterranean Sea, it remains the most common electric <b>ray</b> and in some areas may be increasing in number.|$|E

He was introduced to audio engineer Charles Brungardt through production and songwriting team Jake and the Phatman, who had worked on <b>Ray</b> <b>Ray.</b> Brungardt interned at Blakeslee Recording Company, Saadiq's North Hollywood recording studio, and eventually became his principal sonic partner on projects.

5|$|After the rescue, onlookers applaud Hancock for his {{handling}} of the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular again, as <b>Ray</b> had predicted. He goes out to dinner with <b>Ray</b> and Mary, with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior and <b>Ray</b> reveals that Mary isn't Aaron's mother, who died after giving birth. After Hancock tucks a drunken <b>Ray</b> in bed, Hancock approaches and kisses Mary. At first, she responds passionately, but then turns angry, throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street. Hancock departs, confused at having apparently found another like himself. The next morning, Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers from Mary. She warns him to stay away from her and her family but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to answer his questions. When she arrives, Hancock discovers that Mary also has superpowers and is apparently immortal. He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins so she tells him that they are the last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers. Mary claims that they are brother and sister, which Hancock dismisses, given the nature of the previous night's kiss. Hancock realizes that Mary is not being entirely truthful and he departs to tell <b>Ray</b> about her. Their interaction results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. <b>Ray,</b> downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock. <b>Ray</b> departs his meeting and arrives home {{just in time to see}} Mary land in the backyard, followed closely by Hancock. She then reveals that, although he doesn't remember it, Hancock is her husband. The three then quietly go their separate ways.|$|E

In the first match, against New South Wales, the two batted in partnership for the first time for their state. <b>Ray</b> came in at 5/53 to join Neil and he fell for 9 to leave the score at 6/64 as Victoria collapsed to be all out for 130. In the second innings, <b>Ray</b> joined Neil with the score at 5/266 and the latter fell at 6/292, ending a 26-run partnership. The pair did not bat together in the second match against South Australia as Neil was out before <b>Ray</b> came in on both occasions. The 1947-48 was the most productive for the Harveys as a combination for Victoria until <b>Ray</b> played a full season in 1953-54 together with Neil.|$|E
