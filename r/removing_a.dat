5|$|Dopamine (DA, a {{contraction}} of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several {{important roles in}} the brain and body. It is an amine synthesized by <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized {{in the brain and}} kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals.|$|E
5|$|It was {{determined}} that many Ontario highways no longer serve long-distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998 (downloading), <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> significant percentage of the provincial highway network.|$|E

5|$|After marrying {{his niece}} Martina and being crowned by the Patriarch, the 35-year-old Heraclius {{set out to}} perform his work as emperor. Phocas' brother, Comentiolus, {{commanded}} a sizable force in central Anatolia but was assassinated by the Armenian commander Justin, <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> major threat to Heraclius' reign. Still, transfer of the forces commanded by Comentiolus had been delayed, allowing the Persians to advance further in Anatolia. Trying to increase revenues and reduce costs, Heraclius limited the number of state-sponsored personnel of the Church in Constantinople by not paying new staff from the imperial fisc. He used ceremonies to legitimize his dynasty, and he secured a reputation for justice to strengthen his grip on power.|$|E

When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E
5|$|Congress further {{weakened}} the acts in 1894 by <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> provision against conspiracy. In 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes {{was elected president}} after a highly contested election, receiving support from three Southern states {{in exchange for a}} pledge to allow white Democratic governments to rule without federal interference. As president, he refused to enforce federal civil rights protections, allowing states to begin to implement racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws. A Federal Elections Bill was successfully filibustered in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|In {{relations}} with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, Gillard represented Australia at the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in London in April 2011 and hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Perth in October of that year. The Perth CHOGM saw the historic announcement, by Gillard and British Prime Minister David Cameron, of changes to the succession laws regarding to thrones of the Commonwealth realms, overturning rules privileging male over female heirs {{to the line of}} succession and <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> ban on Roman Catholic consorts. At the CHOGM, Gillard also hosted Queen Elizabeth II, for what was suggested to be the Monarch's final visit to Australia, due to her age.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, 2012, {{mainstream}} media reported that Cook {{had been killed}} in Winston-Salem, North Carolina after being struck by a car.

The original news organization released an explanation story after finding out of their mistake.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the changes}} made shortly after 9/11 was the colour scheme of the police cars; the {{original}} colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the New York City Police Department. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. Other changes include altering the flight path of a plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper, <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> mission referencing terrorists, {{as well as some}} changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.|$|E

50|$|Iodine has a {{nutritional}} relationship with selenium. A family of selenium-dependent enzymes called deiodinases converts T4 to T3 (the active hormone) by <b>removing</b> <b>an</b> iodine atom {{from the outer}} tyrosine ring. These enzymes also convert T4 to reverse T3 (rT3) by <b>removing</b> <b>an</b> inner ring iodine atom; and convert T3 to 3,3'-Diiodothyronine (T2) also by <b>removing</b> <b>an</b> inner ring atom. Both of the latter are inactivated hormones which are ready for disposal and have essentially no biological effects. A family of non-selenium dependent enzymes then further deiodinates the products of these reactions.|$|R
5|$|Among the {{innovations}} in business {{caused by the}} use of the nickel in coin-operated machines was the automat, in which patrons would serve themselves by inserting a coin (initially a nickel, though by the 1950s a higher denomination was needed) into a mechanism, turning a handle, and <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> sandwich or dessert. These restaurants were first established in Germany, but were popularized in the United States by, among other firms, Horn & Hardart. A type of business which took its name from the coin was the nickelodeon cinema, where a nickel bought admission to view a series of one-reel short films, generally about 12minutes in length, which ran continuously from early afternoon until late at night, with the patron free to remain as long as he liked. Although another denomination gave the penny arcade its name, the nickel was commonly used there as well.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the coup}} were almost {{certainly}} the Byzantines, who had every interest in <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if {{not from a}} pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or {{he may have been}} related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained the support of the Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes' loyalty economically.|$|E
5|$|During the party, Tony Yayo enters {{another room}} of the mansion and removes a {{painting}} {{from one of the}} walls, revealing a hidden safe: after opening it and <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> silver necklace, a woman (Buffie Carruth) who has followed him from the party enters the room and the pair begin to embrace. At this point, the police suddenly enter the room, searching for Tony Yayo, although it is shown that he has escaped just in time through an open door in the room. Reunited in the Mercedes-Benz with 50 Cent, Tony Yayo gives the necklace to 50 Cent: at this point, Tony Yayo abruptly wakes up, in his jail cell, showing the preceding events of the video to have been a dream.|$|E

5|$|Even though Champollion {{was appalled}} by the rampant looting of ancient {{artefacts}} and destruction of monuments, the expedition {{also contributed to the}} destruction. Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05m in a corridor. English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into a pillar at Karnak. In a letter to the Pasha recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled. Champollion's suggestions may have led to Muhammad Ali's 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering the construction of a museum in which to house the ancient artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E
5|$|Freda's {{deal with}} his {{producers}} failed {{when he left the}} set on the twelfth day of production. After an argument with the producers, Freda left the production allowing Mario Bava to step in to finish the film in the next two days. Reasons for Freda leaving production differ, and range from Freda having a misunderstanding with the producers, to Bava stating that Freda was taking too long to make the film. Bava's ending was different than Freda's initial ending which involved finding the heroine hanged. Among the changes Bava made to finish the film, included changing the supporting character of the journalist becoming the lead and <b>removing</b> <b>a</b> sub-plot about a dismembered criminal who returns to life on being reassembled. Bava also extended other portions of the film with stock footage and montages of newspaper presses.|$|E
