5000|$|His third son, Joseph Henry Horwood (1841 [...] - [...] 17 April 1913) {{worked at}} the Bendigo Iron Works {{constructing}} mining equipment. He returned to Adelaide in 1867 to supply the Montacute goldmine with a ten head stamp battery, which he bought back the following year and installed at the Echunga goldmine. He then {{spent some time with}} his mining engineer brother John William Horwood in Castlemaine, Victoria before returning to Adelaide in 1872. He built a crushing plant in the Barossa Valley, then moved to Moonta to work on the copper mines, but withdrew in 1874 after being singled out for retribution for his part in suppressing the miners' strike. On 18 March 1875 he married Maria Brooks, and in the same year started work for Francis Clark & Sons, managing their machinery dealership on Grenfell Street then Blyth Street which they sold in 1882. He took over Strapps' foundry in Currie Street, then, with Samuel Strapps (c. 1840-1913), founded a machinery manufacturing and sales business in Currie Street, bringing foreman Thomas Ward with him. Horwood's specialty was well-drilling and he built the first steam-powered <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine,</b> as well as being a pioneer in tube-lined bores. His fence-wire tensioning device and windmills won several prizes at the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society shows. The business moved to Franklin Street in 1906 and became J. H. Horwood and Co. Ltd. in 1912.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The rotary {{power head}} {{is the most}} {{important}} part of the cutting drill. After researching the status of the rotary power head, we invented a new decelerator—roulette curve profile movable tooth transmission, and applied it in cutting drill, we presented the rotary power head with roulette curve profile movable tooth transmission. The moving components, such as the input shaft and the output shaft, of the roulette curve profile movable tooth transmission are self-balance, so the transmission can bring about random tooth number difference. Analyzing the principle of the transmission, we create the three-dimensional modeling by using Solidworks 2010. The rotary power head with the new transmission installed is convenient in assembling and disassembling, transferring bigger torque, having a relatively small radial dimension, suitable for heavy-loaded <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R

40|$|This Master Thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} at Atlas Copco <b>Rock</b> <b>Drills</b> AB, Örebro and at Linköping University, Sweden from February 2010 through August 2010. The project deals with performance improvement of hydraulic <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> <b>machine</b> manufactured by Atlas Copco <b>Rock</b> <b>Drills.</b> Atlas Copco <b>Rock</b> <b>Drills</b> AB {{is a world}} leading supplier of percussive <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> equipment for surface and underground applications. HOPSAN, a software developed at Linkoping University, provides an integrated simulation environment for simulation of fluid power systems. During the work, a HOPSAN model of a piston accumulator has been developed and its performance with a <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> has been studied. Furthermore, the fatigue strength calculations of a piston accumulator has been {{made on the basis}} of stress analysis performed using the ANSYS software. One of the <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> of valveless type, developed at Atlas Copco Rocktec Division works at higher efficiency than the conventionally used <b>rock</b> <b>drills.</b> But the problem with this type of drill is that the piston swings between two large and highly pressurized oil volume which causes strength problems in the housing of the <b>rock</b> <b>drill.</b> The aim of this work is to achieve the higher efficiency of the <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> without having any strength problems. Therefore, some study and research is proposed to replace the large oil volume by one or two piston accumulators. This thesis work involves modelling, simulation, design and fatigue strength calculations of a piston accumulator and its implementation to the <b>rock</b> <b>drill.</b> Optimization of the piston accumulator has also been conducted while working with the <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> so that highest possible eciency could be achieved. The performance of the rockdrill with piston accumulator has been analyzed and results are studied. In the end, a short fatigue life calculations are performed and results are discussed. Prior to fatigue life calculations, a transient dynamic stress analysis has been performed and stress amplitudes are identified which contributes to the accumulated damage to piston in accumulator...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new in-situ technique for characterizing rock mass mechanical {{strength and the}} associated spatial distribution in the ground. The technique involves automatic drilling process monitoring (DPM). Case examples are given to show the original DPM data and analyzed results in a weathered <b>rock</b> mass. The <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> in the examples are pneumatic rotary-percussive <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> with down-the-hole hammers. The DPM data can directly show the in-situ <b>rock</b> mass <b>drilling</b> resistance strengths and their spatial distribution along the drillhole in the ground. The DPM is a simple, reliable and practical tool for furthering the practice and knowledge of rock mechanics and engineering in the underground environments comprising weathered soils and rocks. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Marvin, Casler, Elias Koopman, a New York City [...] "novelty purveyor," [...] and William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, a former associate of Thomas A. Edison, formed the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company in 1896 and moved the business to Canastota, New York. Casler and Edison were the originators of motion pictures in the United States. Edison obtained a patent for his own movie camera in 1897. He sued Biograph in 1898 for patent infringement; however, lost the suit after years of legal battles. In 1908, {{a year after the}} courts upheld Biograph's camera patent, the establishment joined with Edison's company to form the Motion Picture Patents Company.|$|R
50|$|In a new {{innovation}} for Queensland {{several kinds}} of <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> were experimented with but all failed. As {{a result of this}} hand drilling operations were resorted to. The use of <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> in driving this tunnel may have been unsuccessful, however there is evidence of the use of <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> in cuttings to the south of this tunnel as far as the head of Rosenthal Creek. The use of the <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> is contemporary with the introduction of the Low patent <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> into Victoria where it was used for driving the Mount Tarrengower tunnel at Maldon. Earthworks were also greater than expected due to the unstable nature of rock that was encountered.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project is to design the components of a tribometer, instrument the assembly for force data acquisition, and to retrofit it onto an existing computer numerical controlled (CNC) machining center; this design {{will be used for}} fundamental tribometric testing of tooling materials suited for <b>rock</b> <b>drilling.</b> When reproducing <b>machining</b> conditions in a traditional tribometer, the machine dynamics of the cutting process which determines the tribological response of the tool material is not well captured. Retrofitting an existing CNC machine for rock tribometric testing replicates the machine dynamics more accurately than traditional tribometer tests. Further, simultaneous rotary-percussive drilling capabilities would be enabled. For achieving this objective, the tribological parameters relevant to rock machining will first be identified, then individual components for applying and measuring forces will be designed, and finally the assembly will be instrumented for real-time data acquisition. This work is expected to provide a low-cost adaptation, as well as a template for in-situ tribological testing designs on equipment used for similar field-level operations...|$|R

The description of a test rig for commercial rotary-percussion drills follows. The rig is equipped with several instruments for the continuous monitoring of the most significant drilling process parameters: blow frequency, rotation speed, drilling fluid flow rate, power and drilling speed. The results of a test programmer that was carried out with a type GBH 8 / 65 DCE Bosch electrical rotary-percussion <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> on granite are finally reported and commented. It is considered quite encouraging that the performance of the machine investigated is comparable to those reported in the literature for conventional pneumatic and hydraulic <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> in dolomites, a rock that opposes a much lower resistance to rock breakage than granite.
