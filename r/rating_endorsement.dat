40|$|The {{survey design}} {{involving}} a screener or filter question {{followed by a}} series of more detailed questions is used in many surveys.

Alternatively, the cumulative cognitive burden experienced by respondents after answering many survey questions may be a principal factor in respondent satisficing, and thus measurement error, toward the end of surveys.

The Centers for Disease Control estimated deaths related to pharmaceutical opioids reached nearly 19, 000 in 2014. Of prescription opioids sold, 10 % are extended release (ER) and 90 % immediate release (IR). However, most regulations and interventions have focused on decreasing ER abuse. Our objective was to compare rates of abuse and diversion of ER and IR opioid analgesics over time using multiple surveillance programs. Rates of abuse and diversion of ER and IR opioid formulations were compared using data from four surveillance programs in the Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction Related Surveillance (RADARS®) System. Data were evaluated from 2009 through 2015, and Poisson regression used to compare IR and ER opioid cases over time. From 2009 to 2015, IR opioids were prescribed at a rate 12 to 16 times higher than ER. In the Poison Center Program, population-adjusted rates of Intentional Abuse for IR were 4. 6 fold higher than ER opioids (p< 0. 001). In the Drug Diversion Program, population-adjusted rates of diversion were 6. 1 fold higher for IR than ER opioids (p< 0. 001). In the Opioid Treatment Program, population-adjusted <b>rates</b> of <b>endorsements</b> for abuse were 1. 6 fold higher for IR opioids than ER (p = 0. 002).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{sought to}} examine {{the potential impact of}} cultural contexts on the <b>rate</b> of <b>endorsement</b> of paranormal explanations for causal scenarios. It also sought to explore the potential differences in cognitive reasoning systems of those classed as paranormal believers vs. non-believers. A quantitative, within-subjects, questionnaire based, study was employed – followed by a between-subjects comparison of the believers vs. non-believers. It was found that the cultural context of causal scenarios had no significant impact on the rate at which participants endorsed explanations. The finding of cultural context having no significant effect within the dimension of Traditional Paranormal Belief may be regarded as critical as it contradicts previous statements by Lange, Irwin and Houran (2000) that such beliefs are grounded in a person’s cultural heritage. Significant differences in <b>endorsement</b> <b>rates</b> between believers and non-believers was found, which was then explored by the further categorization of participants under the two belief dimensions of New Age Philosophy and Traditional Paranormal Beliefs. Potential applications of different cognitive reasoning systems are discussed as an explanation for the disparity in endorsement scores. The experimental results appear to support and expand previous findings by Wilson (2013) regarding interactions between intuitive thinking styles, analytical thinking styles, and vitalism. The results also challenge the validity of the Rasch scaled version of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (Tobacyk, 2004) put forward by Lange, Irwin and Houran (2000).

Although the IAT reveals {{differential}} associations of two target concepts (e.g. male-female and weak-strong), the GNAT reveals associations within one concept (for example, whether female is associated more strongly with weak or strong).Participants are presented with word pairs among distractors. Participants are instructed to indicate [...] "go" [...] if the words are target pairs, or [...] "no-go" [...] if they are not. For example, participants may be instructed to indicate [...] "go" [...] if the word pairs are female names and words that are related to strength.

Setting: Preparation for parenthood classes conducted in a public hospital in South Western Sydney, Australia. Participants: People attending the session were in their 2 nd to 3 rd trimester, of low to middle socioeconomic status, and 95 % were expecting their first child. Eighty-five percent of women were accompanied by their male partner at the session. Data are reported from 201 women and 182 men. Measure: A 17 -item issues checklist was devised initially and later expanded to 19 items. The initial checklist covered three psychosocial issues: interpersonal, intrapersonal, and parental competency. The expanded checklist also included items on infant care issues. Participants rated each item as {{to the extent to which}} they had been thinking or worrying about it over the past few weeks. Results: More than half of the men and women had been thinking or worrying about their ability to cope as new parents; just less than half of both men and women endorsed the item regarding the effect having a baby would have on their relationship with their partner; approximately 40 % of women had thought that they might get bored or lonely when at home with the baby, and an equal rate of men reported that their partner experiencing this sense of boredom or loneliness was an issue for them. There were few differences between the genders in the <b>rate</b> of <b>endorsement</b> on the issues checklist. Conclusion: That many of the issues on the checklist are prevalent in both women and men at this time in the pregnancy would suggest that these are topics that would be pertinent for inclusion at preparation for parenthood classes.

The research was motivated by a syllogistic reasoning study carried out by Evans, Handley, Harper, and Johnson-Laird (1999), and predictions were derived from mental model theory (Johnson-Laird, 1983; Johnson-Laird & Byrne, 1991). With regard to the <b>endorsement</b> <b>rate</b> data: Experiment 1 failed to find evidence that a search for counterexamples or alternative models took place. In contrast experiment 2 (transitive inference) found some evidence to support the search for alternative models under possibility instructions, and following an improved training session, experiment 3 produced strong evidence to suggest that people searched for other models; which was mediated by cognitive ability. There was also strong evidence from experiments 4, 5 and 6 (abstract and everyday conditionals) to support the search for counterexamples and alternative models. Furthermore it was also found that people were more likely to find alternative causes when there were many that could be retrieved from their everyday knowledge, and that people carried out a search for counterexamples with many alternative causes under necessity instructions, and across few and many causal groups under possibility instructions.. The evidence from the latency data was limited and inconsistent, although people with higher cognitive ability were generally quicker in completing the tasks...|$|R

METHOD: 154 women completed the Antenatal Psychosocial Questionnaire (APQ) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} identify antenatal psychosocial risk factors predictive of EPDS caseness, with an EPDS score of 10 or more being taken to indicate depression. RESULTS: Antenatal depression was more common than postnatal depression. 44 women (30 %) met criteria for antenatal depression and 33 women (22. 6 %) met criteria for postnatal depression. 21 women (14. 4 %) were depressed both before and after delivery of their baby, and women who had antenatal depression {{were significantly more likely to}} be depressed postnatally.

40|$|Socially Desirable Responding (SDR) {{is defined}} as a biased {{tendency}} to endorse personality inventory items that are generally judged to be socially acceptable, and to avoid endorsing items that are judged to be socially undesirable. Rare Virtue (RV) scales, such as the MMPI- 2 Lie scale, have been designed to detect SDR. The items of such scales, called RV items, typically invite respondents to claim unlikely virtues or deny common faults. The present study hypothesized that RV items perform much differently when a Dichotomous response format (e. g., true/false) is used than when a Likert response format is used. A total of 457 undergraduates in six experimental conditions made ratings on a questionnaire that consisted of 55 RV items and 59 randomly selected items from the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP). A variable called the Over/Underestimation Value (OUV) measured how much the <b>endorsement</b> <b>rate</b> for each SNAP and RV item differed from what would be predicted based on the item 2 ̆ 7 s social desirability. As predicted, OUV was significantly higher for RV items than for SNAP items, and this difference was significantly higher when a Dichotomous format was used than when a Likert format was used. Four RV scales, including the Lie scale and Wiggins Sd scale of the MMPI- 2, were administered to respondents who were instructed to fake good on the questionnaire. Each of the four RV scales significantly discriminated fakers from a control group of non-fakers. However, contrary to prediction, the scales 2 ̆ 7 success in discriminating fakers from non-fakers was not significantly greater when a Dichotomous response format was used than when a Likert format was used.
