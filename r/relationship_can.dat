5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, Erin {{tries to}} break up with Andy, saying she no longer loves him and is angry that he left and barely communicated with her. Andy vehemently protests the breakup and says their <b>relationship</b> <b>can</b> work out if she just pretends to still love him. Erin walks outside to Pete, saying she could not do it. Pete tells her he is okay with this, since all he wants is for her to be happy. Emboldened by this, she gives him a kiss, runs back up to Andy's office, and breaks up with him. In her brief breakup speech she repeats her {{complaints}} about his three-month absence, not realizing that he is talking to David Wallace on speakerphone.|$|E
5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This <b>relationship</b> <b>can</b> be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real interest rate parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E
5|$|Rae grows {{close to}} Ste, her {{employer}} at the diner, and they begin dating. Brendan Brady is jealous {{because he is}} attracted to Ste, and tries to separate them. Brendan and Ste begin sleeping together; he tells Ste to continue seeing Rae so their own <b>relationship</b> <b>can</b> remain a secret. Rae discovers that she is pregnant and Ste promises to support her. Rae considers having an abortion but ultimately decides against it. After catching Brendan and Ste kissing, Rae resolves to raise the baby alone, but suffers a miscarriage after a vicious row with Brendan. Rae threatens to out Brendan to the community, so he retaliates by setting her up and having her arrested as a drug dealer. Rae is released without charge after Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) tampers with the substance, which {{is found to be}} icing sugar.|$|E

Regarding such civil unions, “The Church in Wales has no formal view on whether people in civil partnerships {{who are in}} a sexual <b>relationship</b> <b>can</b> serve as clergy.

25|$|It is {{possible}} to construct an expected value equal to the probability of an event by taking the expectation of an indicator function that is one if the event has occurred and zero otherwise. This <b>relationship</b> <b>can</b> be used to translate properties of expected values into properties of probabilities, e.g. using the law of large numbers to justify estimating probabilities by frequencies.|$|E
25|$|A swinger {{party or}} partner-swapping {{party is a}} {{gathering}} at which individuals or couples in a committed <b>relationship</b> <b>can</b> engage in sexual activities with others as a recreational or social activity.

25|$|The {{separation}} by rank has {{the intended}} purpose of maintaining military discipline among service members. According to the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice, it can be illegal for an officer to fraternize with an enlisted person because it would erode the military hierarchy.

25|$|Collins and Feeney {{review a}} number of studies showing how each {{attachment}} style relates to the willingness to self-disclose, the willingness to rely on partners, and the willingness to engage in physical intimacy. The secure attachment style is generally related to more self-disclosure, more reliance on partners, and more physical intimacy than other attachment styles. However, the amount of intimacy in a <b>relationship</b> <b>can</b> vary due to personality variables and situational circumstances, and so each attachment style may function to adapt an individual to the particular context of intimacy in which they live.|$|E
25|$|The {{status of}} the {{indigenous}} groups in the subjugated <b>relationship</b> <b>can</b> be characterized in most instances as an effectively marginalized, isolated or minimally participative one, in comparison to majority groups or the nation-state as a whole. Their ability to influence {{and participate in the}} external policies that may exercise jurisdiction over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and land rights.|$|E

All About Soap's Laura Morgan reported that Grace would feel guilty and try to prove to Esther she has moved on from Trevor. But when Esther finds evidence to support Trevor was wrongly arrested for murder she is forced to hand the evidence {{to the police and}} secure his release.

Diane was previously a size six stripper and it was that image which first attracted Jim. Diane, now a size sixteen, is a self-conscious woman who hides her figure in tracksuits. After talking and observing, Woodall and Constantine quickly find that the spark that has been lost inside this <b>relationship</b> <b>can</b> be recovered. Diane and Jim are both given a totally new and fresh look and are reunited. Diane and Jim are also treated to some pampering from hair dresser, Richard Ward.|$|E
25|$|Kelly and Hauck's {{research}} found that divisions of labor within a same-sex <b>relationship</b> <b>can</b> {{not be viewed}} as setting a precedent as to what gender roles are normal. A female partner in a same-sex relationship may perform chores that are considered feminine, like cooking, cleaning, and child rearing. However, the other female partner may perform chores that are considered masculine, like outside work and employment outside of the home. The partners’ behaviors do not support gender roles because all the roles performed are done by women. There is not an inherent distinction made between masculine and feminine because women are performing both types of chores. This lack of gender role discrimination would be true in same-sex relationships between two men as well.|$|E
25|$|Race {{and health}} {{refers to the}} {{relationship}} between individual health and one's race and ethnicity. Differences in health status, health outcomes, life expectancy, and many other indicators of health in different racial and ethnic groups is well documented, referred to as health disparities. Race is a complex concept, and the two major competing theories of race use biological definitions and social construction to define racial difference. Although this <b>relationship</b> <b>can</b> vary depending on the definitions used, race is generally used in the context of health research as a fluid concept to group populations of people according to various factors that include {{but are not limited to}} ancestry, social identity, visible phenotype, and genetic makeup. Determinants of health include environmental, social, and genetic factors, as well as the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.|$|E
50|$|Intimacy {{in these}} <b>relationships</b> <b>can</b> develop {{only if the}} persons {{involved}} reciprocate disclosures. Intimacy will not develop if only one partner discloses and the other continues to reveal only superficial information. Reciprocity must be gradual and match the intimacy of the other's disclosures. Too rapid, too personal disclosure creates an imbalance in a <b>relationship</b> that <b>can</b> be discomfiting. This gradual process varies from relationship to <b>relationship</b> and <b>can</b> depend on the specific partner with whom one is communicating.|$|R
