40|$|Abstract. In {{distributed}} {{and mobile}} systems with volatile bandwidth and fragile connectivity, non-functional aspects like performance and reliability {{become more and}} more important. To formalise, measure, and predict these properties, stochastic methods are required. At the same time such systems are characterised by a high degree of architectural reconfiguration. Viewing the architecture of a distributed system as a graph, this is naturally modelled by graph transformations. To address these two concerns, stochastic graph transformation systems have been introduced associating with each rule its application rateâ€”the rate of the exponential distribution governing the delay of its application. Deriving continuous-time Markov chains, Continuous Stochastic Logic is used to specify reliability properties and verify them through model checking. In particular, we study a protocol for the reconfiguration of P 2 P networks intended to improve their reliability by adding <b>redundant</b> <b>connections.</b> The modelling <b>of</b> this protocol as a (stochastic) graph transformation system takes advantage of negative application and conditions path expressions. This ensuing high-level style of specification helps {{to reduce the number of}} states and increases the capabilities for automated analysis. ...|$|R

Capability for successive order assembling and splitting into assembly units depends on a set of the product design properties from which the main ones are position mechanical connections used to locate details within a product. An adequate mathematical model <b>of</b> the mechanical <b>connections</b> <b>of</b> technical system is a hyper graph.
