40|$|Abstract. In {{distributed}} {{and mobile}} systems with volatile bandwidth and fragile connectivity, non-functional aspects like performance and reliability {{become more and}} more important. To formalise, measure, and predict these properties, stochastic methods are required. At the same time such systems are characterised by a high degree of architectural reconfiguration. Viewing the architecture of a distributed system as a graph, this is naturally modelled by graph transformations. To address these two concerns, stochastic graph transformation systems have been introduced associating with each rule its application rate—the rate of the exponential distribution governing the delay of its application. Deriving continuous-time Markov chains, Continuous Stochastic Logic is used to specify reliability properties and verify them through model checking. In particular, we study a protocol for the reconfiguration of P 2 P networks intended to improve their reliability by adding <b>redundant</b> <b>connections.</b> The modelling <b>of</b> this protocol as a (stochastic) graph transformation system takes advantage of negative application and conditions path expressions. This ensuing high-level style of specification helps {{to reduce the number of}} states and increases the capabilities for automated analysis. ...|$|R

Capability for successive order assembling and splitting into assembly units depends on a set of the product design properties from which the main ones are position mechanical connections used to locate details within a product. An adequate mathematical model <b>of</b> the mechanical <b>connections</b> <b>of</b> technical system is a hyper graph.
