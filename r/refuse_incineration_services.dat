40|$|Combustion control plays a {{critical}} role in the normal operation of a refuse incinerating plant. A successful refuse incinerating process requires a robust combustion control in a stable state for a substantial amount of time. This can not only increase the power generation capacity, but also facilitate flue gas elimination in the future. Because of this reason, it is important to study the effect of relevant factors on combustion control and to find an efficient control method {{on the basis of a}} well-defined operation model. This paper focuses on an in-depth study of automatic-combustion control. Automatic-combustion control is the heart of a refuse incinerating plant. Complex control operation and inappropriate operating model are two main problems of the present ACC. We identify three major factors that contribute to the two aforementioned problems: they are (1) flue gases mixing chamber temperature (2) heat value (3) refuse incinerating rate. We carry out an analytical study of the three factors and their respective effect on ACC. Our study is based on the knowledge-based and fuzzy logic control theory. Two control models are designed for the control process of <b>refuse</b> <b>incineration.</b> Simulators are implemented to verify correctness and accuracy of our proposed models. The research results show that controllers designed on our model reveal two characteristic features: simplicity of operation and ease of adaptation. We compare lab data generated by the simulations against empirical data measured in some <b>refuse</b> <b>incineration</b> and improve the stability of cognation plants. The research efforts and results demonstrate that the proposed models are economically and technically feasible. 垃圾焚化的燃燒控制為整廠運轉操作中極重要的一環，因垃圾焚化處理過程如能長期維持在良好且穩定的狀態下，除有助於提高發電量外並有利於後續煙道污染物之去除。為達到此目的就必需對影響燃燒的相關因子加關因子加以探討研究及尋找更有效的控制方法來建立一套良好的操作模式。本研究針對垃圾焚化之操作大腦，即自動燃燒控制(Automatic-Combusion Control,簡稱ACC) 系統作深入探討後將現有操作控制不易且模式運用不佳之要項篩選出(1) 煙道氣體混合室溫度(2) 熱值(3) 垃圾焚化速率等三項進行研究分析，運用以知識庫(Knowledge-Base) 為基礎的模糊邏輯控制理論導入焚化盧之控制程序，並設計兩種控制模式進行模擬研究。該研究結果顯示，所設計之模糊邏輯控制器具有直接性並易於修改等特點，角時試驗所得資料與垃圾焚化廠氣有實際操作數據比較得知，對提昇垃圾焚化過程及汽電共生設備穩定度效果良好，因此預測該模式為可行且實用性...|$|R

40|$|During {{the period}} from September 1988 to October 1989, 23 flights were carried out over the Dutch Continental Shelf of the North Sea {{and a total of}} 108 aerosol filter samples were collected. The samples were {{analyzed}} for Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br and Pb using both particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF). The results from PIXE exhibited better precision and lower detection limits than those from EDXRF. Therefore the further discussion and interpretation was based on the PIXE data only. It was observed that Si, S, V, Mn, Ni, Cu and Pb were enriched with respect to the earth's crust. It was seen that winds from the sector Southeast-South contributed most significantly to the total aerosol concentration. The vertical profiles of several elements indicated that their concentration increases with proximity to the sea.

Prominent examples of such environmental contamination episodes are the Love Canal, into which ton quantities of chlorinated organic compounds containing substantial concentrations of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) were deposited; numerous sites in the State of Missouri which were contaminated by the dumping of chlorinated organic wastes containing various PCDDs and possibly PCDFs, and PCBs; and the environs of a 2, 4 -D/ 2, 4, 5 -T manufacturing plant site in Arkansas, which were contaminated with PCDDs. Environmental assessments of such sites have revealed extensive contamination of soils, waterways, fish and other biological species with these toxic compounds, which in turn could lead to human exposures.

It is a method for determining a consistent process image, taking closed mass, energy and materials balances into account. It takes the place of: • Cost-intensive acceptance and inspection measurements, • Part of the instrumentation within the processes. If it is installed online, it supplies a continuous stream of results, allowing impermissible developments during operation or in the plant to be quantitatively estimated. Data validation also yields information about operating states in non-instrumented or insufficiently instrumented parts of the plant. If {{data validation}} is integrated in the installation early on during the project planning phase, it is possible to reduce the number of measuring points compared with that considered necessary in the past. Since the saving per measuring point is approximately 15, 000 EURO, this can represent a substantial reduction in the cost for investments in the plant. Depending on the type and size of the plant, as much as 125, 000 EURO can be saved additionally every year because fewer key measuring points need to be calibrated.

Nickel alloy welding consumables are used to provide protection against the highly corrosive environments found inside these boilers. The superheater tubes and water walls in waste incineration boilers are often overlaid with high nickel chromium molybdenum (Ni-Cr-Mo) alloys to provide improved corrosion resistance compared to carbon manganese and low alloy steels. For this application, alloy 625 (AWS A 5. 14 ERNiCrMo- 3) is usually the alloy of choice.

Further emphasis was put on the formation processes of chlorinated and unchlorinated aromatics. Three full-scale and a pilot-scale combustion plant were investigated for chlorinated (PCDD/F, PCB, PCBz and PCPh) and unchlorinated (BTX and PAH) aromatics in the temperature range between approximately 700 C and 90 C. The total number of the analyzed samples was 108. The central questions of the work and the results of the data set and the REMPI-TOFMS measurements can be divided into four central points: 1. Investigation of the statistical relationships of chlorinated aromatic trace compounds in the flue gas of different combustion plants in order to identify surrogates for the indirect determination of the I-TEQ value of the PCDD/F with on-line laser-mass-spectrometry (REMPI-TOFMS). 2. Investigations of the formation of chlorinated and unchlorinated aromatic compounds downstream the flue gas channel to find an explanation for the relationship of the chlorinated aromatics statistical mentioned under point 1. 3. Investigation of the observed memory-effects for chlorinated and unchlorinated aromatics in order to find an explanation for their increased concentrations and for the shift in the patterns of the chlorinated aromatics. 4. Investigation of the formation of chlorinated aromatic compounds during wood combustion. Finally it can be concluded that the absolute concentrations of the chlorinated aromatics during wood combustion at similar sampling points were noticably lower than during domestic <b>refuse</b> <b>incineration.</b> This could be a result of the low chlorine as well as the low copper content (around some orders of magnitude) of the combustibles.
