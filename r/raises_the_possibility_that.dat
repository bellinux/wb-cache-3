5|$|The {{consensus}} view {{in contemporary}} palaeontology {{is that the}} flying theropods, or avialans, are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs, which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids. Together, these form a group called Paraves. Some basal members of this group, such as Microraptor, have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly. The most basal deinonychosaurs were very small. This evidence <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal, {{have been able to}} glide, or both. Unlike Archaeopteryx and the non-avialan feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, recent studies suggest that the first avialans were omnivores.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008 the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} that 2,200years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This {{was the biggest}} Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000years. The volcano is situated in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash (or tephra) {{over the surface of}} the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the future, to increases in the flow of the glacier.|$|E

25|$|While tetrachromatic {{vision is}} not {{exclusive}} to birds (insects, reptiles, and crustaceans are also sensitive to short wavelengths), some predators of UVS birds cannot see ultraviolet light.

However, recent evidence does not appear to support this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} this {{extremely}} small size limit of 0.01µm {{is because of the}} consideration of Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs). These randomly incorporate segments of the host genome and can transfer them to other evolutionarily distant hosts, and do that without killing the new host. In this way many archaea and bacteria can swap DNA with each other. This <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Martian life, if it has a common origin with Earth life in the distant past, could swap DNA with Earth micro-organisms in the same way.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of planets orbiting other star systems, including similar binary systems (Gamma Cephei), <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> additional planets may {{exist in the}} Alpha Centauri system. Such planets could orbit Alpha CentauriA or Alpha CentauriB individually, or be on large orbits around the binary Alpha Centauri AB. Because both the principal stars are fairly similar to the Sun (for example, in age and metallicity), astronomers have been especially interested in making detailed searches for planets in the Alpha Centauri system. Several established planet-hunting teams have used various radial velocity or star transit methods in their searches around these two bright stars. All the observational studies have so far failed to find any evidence for brown dwarfs or gas giants.|$|E
25|$|Identity synergy principle: The {{fact that}} the {{personal}} and social selves can be activated independently <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> they may combine synergistically to motivate pro-group behavior. Consistent with this possibility, {{studies have shown that}} the activation of either the personal self or social self amplifies the willingness of strongly fused persons to behave in a pro-group fashion. For example, activating the personal self by ostracizing participants from the group based on their personal preferences, or activating the social self by ostracizing participants based on their group membership, resulted in the amplification of endorsement of pro-group action for strongly, but not weakly, fused individuals. Thus, unlike social identity theory which assumes that the personal self does not play a role in pro-group behavior, fusion theory holds that pro-group behaviors are motivated by both the personal and social selves and these two types of self-knowledge may sometimes work together.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, Boston {{businessman}} and historian Charles Deane {{was the first}} scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest-surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating Queen Anne to treat Pocahontas with dignity. The time gap in publishing his story <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, in a recent book, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, {{there was no reason}} for him to write down the story until this point.|$|E

25|$|Convergent {{evolution}} is when distantly related species independently evolve similar {{solutions to the}} same problem. For example, fish, penguins and dolphins have each separately evolved flippers {{as a solution to}} the problem of moving through the water. What has been found between dogs and humans is something less frequently demonstrated: psychological convergence. Dogs have independently evolved to be cognitively more similar to humans than we are to our closest genetic relatives. Dogs have evolved specialized skills for reading human social and communicative behavior. These skills seem more flexible – and possibly more human-like – than those of other animals more closely related to humans phylogenetically, such as chimpanzees, bonobos and other great apes. This <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> convergent evolution has occurred: both Canis familiaris and Homo sapiens might have evolved some similar (although obviously not identical) social-communicative skills – in both cases adapted for certain kinds of social and communicative interactions with human beings.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{material}} launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately, which <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> high efficiency (but slower) engines could move SPS material from LEO to GEO at an acceptable cost. Examples include ion thrusters or nuclear propulsion. Power beaming from geostationary orbit by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required 'optical aperture' sizes are very large. For example, the 1978 NASA SPS study required a 1-km diameter transmitting antenna, and a 10km diameter receiving rectenna, for a microwave beam at 2.45GHz. These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although they have increased atmospheric absorption and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the thinned array curse, {{it is not possible}} to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. The large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an SPS will necessarily be high; small SPS systems will be possible, but uneconomic.|$|E

[...] Boghardt comments that [...] "his eagerness to display his honour may indicate a concern that others doubted this very quality in him.

500|$|Woese {{argued that}} the bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes {{represent}} separate lines of descent that diverged early on from an ancestral colony of organisms. One possibility is that this occurred before the evolution of cells, when {{the lack of a}} typical cell membrane allowed unrestricted lateral gene transfer, and that the common ancestors of the three domains arose by fixation of specific subsets of genes. It is possible that the last common ancestor of the bacteria and archaea was a thermophile, which <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> lower temperatures are [...] "extreme environments" [...] in archaeal terms, and organisms that live in cooler environments appeared only later. Since the Archaea and Bacteria are no more related to each other than they are to eukaryotes, the term prokaryotes only surviving meaning is [...] "not a eukaryote", limiting its value.|$|E
500|$|Although nothing {{remains of}} either the body or the bed, {{surviving}} artefacts and the 56 pieces of ironwork that held the bed together have enabled the burial to be reconstructed in considerable detail. The bed was made from ash wood, held together {{with a variety of}} iron plates, cleats, staples, nails, stays, and decorative scrolls. It measured [...] and may once have been roofed with an ornamental awning or canvas, perhaps made of cloth draped over timber posts. Traces of mineralised cloth and either grass or reed were found still attached to some of the nails, indicating the possible nature of the mattress. Two pieces of ironwork showed signs of repair and reuse, suggesting that the bed had been in use some time before the burial and was not specially made for the interment. This <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the bed was either that of the deceased woman or a significant bed of some other person. It may have been dismantled elsewhere, brought to the cemetery and reassembled and repaired so that it could be used for the burial.|$|E

500|$|Tresham {{has long}} been {{suspected}} as the letter's author.

[...] The two threatened to [...] "hang him", but [...] "with such oaths and emphatic assertions" [...] Tresham managed to convince the pair of his innocence, the next day urging them by letter to abandon the plot. [...] Antonia Fraser suggests that Catesby and Wintour's decision to believe him should not be disregarded. [...] While making his deathbed confession in the Tower of London, Tresham failed to mention the letter; an omission which in her opinion makes no sense if he is to be regarded as its author, especially considering that its recipient was by then being credited as the country's saviour.

After she was cast, Theron collaborated with director Ridley Scott and writer Damon Lindelof to create scenes developing the character's backstory and persona. She interpreted the character as a villain who maintains a secret agenda undermining {{that of the}} mission. Vickers was written, costumed and performed as dissociated from humanity. Her physical similarity to David suggests that his design mimicked Weyland's biological child and <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> she may be an android herself. However, when asked if Vickers is an android, Lindelof clarified that she is indeed human. Theron's performance was well-received, and she {{was nominated for a}} Choice Summer Movie Star– Female award by the Teen Choice Awards. Vickers failing to remove herself from the path of the rolling Juggernaut was an unpopular narrative decision, with film pundits like Robert Fure of Film School Rejects criticizing it for going against the judgment of an otherwise intelligent character.|$|E
500|$|It is {{not known}} how Morrell {{supported}} himself during his months in London; {{it is possible that}} Abby sent him funds from America. Somehow, in the autumn of 1837 {{he made his way to}} Havana in Cuba, after which his movements are unclear. [...] It appears that he eventually obtained command of a vessel, possibly the Christine, and that he sailed in September 1838, probably planning a return to the Pacific. He got no further than Mozambique on the East African coast; his ship was wrecked, and Morrell was stranded ashore. He is reported to have died, either of fever or during an insurrection, in late 1838 or early 1839. This story is complicated by an alternative account indicating that Christine was wrecked a year later, [...] early in 1840, although whether Morrell was alive and in command by that date is unrecorded. Christine was known as a slave ship, which <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> in his final years Morrell was engaged with the slave trade. [...] Fairhead suggests an alternative hypothesis: that Morrell staged his death in Mozambique, to evade Margaret Oakleys insurers. In this scenario he may have escaped to South America and lived out his days there. A letter dated August 11, 1843, to the editor of The New York Commercial Advertiser and signed [...] "Morrell" [...] could, Fairhead maintains, only have been written by someone with intimate knowledge of the Oakley voyage. Fairhead offers no explanation why Morrell, if alive, should break his silence other than: [...] "Perhaps, like many criminals, he could not resist flaunting himself".|$|E
