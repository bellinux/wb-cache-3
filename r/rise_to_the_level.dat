5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not actually do did not <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of a constitutional violation.|$|E

25|$|The Montana Supreme Court twice {{ruled on}} the Judicial Standards Commission's investigative procedures.

Following the Shea decision, the Montana Legislature clarified the procedural requirements, so that the JSC could engage in an initial investigation without a verified, written complaint. Beyond that, however, the legislature now required the JSC to obtain a verified, written complaint. In , the high court affirmed the JSC's power to subpoena documents. In that case, a preliminary JSC investigation uncovered evidence that the Montana Department of Justice was conducting a criminal investigation of a judge. The JSC obtained documents about the criminal investigation, and found they warranted a sanction against the judge.|$|E

25|$|The tracks from Glasgow {{enter at}} {{the east end of}} the wide {{concourse}} which is flanked to the north and south by high stone walls, each capped {{at the east}} end by a castellated turret. A glazed roof between these walls sheltered the concourse until recently, but it has been removed and small shelters introduced. The northernmost line stops as a bay platform and is not in use, and platform 1 serving eastbound trains opens directly to the top of Station Avenue which slopes down to Cathcart Street through stone archways marking the station entrance. The two tracks in use continue westwards through a tunnel which is capped by the parapet wall to Terrace Road, which leaves Cathcart Street further to the west and rises steeply towards the station before turning south over the tunnel entrance and continuing to <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of the Well Park. Doorways in the parapet wall lead to staircases down to each platform, and to a steel ramp down to Platform 2 serving westbound trains. Originally, there was only one doorway, which led to a sloping passageway which in turn connected with the (now removed) station's internal steel lattice footbridge.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} against Article 23 laws as {{drafted by the}} HK government has been given by John Kamm, who argues that the mechanism for banning organizations would {{have the effect of}} requiring that Mainland China be more repressive outside of Hong Kong. His argument is that since 1997, Mainland China has not had the legal concept of banning an organization on national security grounds, and that political repression in the PRC takes the form of government criminal charges against individual acts. He argues that the HK government's draft of Article 23 law requires the PRC to set up a system of banning organizations on national security grounds and this would greatly hurt members of politically sensitive organizations who are not leaders. He points out that the PRC currently typically imprisons only the leadership of an organization, and merely harasses lower-level members because their behavior does not <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of criminal charges. By passing Article 23 law, Hong Kong will require the PRC to develop the legal mechanisms to punish all members of a banned political organization, a power it now only has with respect to religious organizations such as Falun gong and students {{who were involved in the}} Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. For example, Macau, which has implemented the Article 23, identical to the article proposed for Hong Kong, in June 2009 refused transit to mainland China by a Tiananmen student leader Wu'er Kaixi.|$|E

500|$|Philosophy of {{economics}} is {{the branch of}} philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to economics.
