5|$|Like much of {{the rest}} of French West Africa, {{authorities}} enforced explicit <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to end slavery in the region. In 1903, the government instructed French administrators to not use slave as an administrative category anymore.

5|$|The offside {{rule was}} {{introduced}} to Sheffield <b>Rules</b> <b>in</b> 1863. Their version only required {{one member of the}} opposition between a player and the opposing goal to remain on side. Despite this the rule was only used sporadically in actual play. The FA version, which required a player to remain behind the ball at all times, was introduced during the 1865–66 season but was disliked {{due to the lack of}} goal scoring opportunities it caused. The one man offside was finally used a regular basis from 1867 until the adoption of FA <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> 1877.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the writing}} of unit names is language-specific, {{the writing of}} unit symbols and the values of {{quantities}} is consistent across all languages and therefore the SI Brochure has specific <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> respect of writing them.

During Cena's feud with Big Show, The Miz challenged him to a match on the April 27 episode of Raw, but as Cena was out due to injury, Miz claimed an unofficial win via forfeit and continued to do this over the following weeks, until Cena defeated him in a singles match at The Bash.|$|E

5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and <b>rules).</b> <b>In</b> psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E

50|$|In Chapter 31, we {{are told}} that Vortigern <b>ruled</b> <b>in</b> fear of Ambrosius. This is the first mention of Ambrosius in the work. According to Frank D.

The chapter relates events following the end of Roman <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> Britain and preceding Vortigern's alliance with the Saxons.|$|R

5|$|Hobbs {{was summoned}} to Surrey for a trial in April 1903, and {{subsequently}} offered {{a contract with the}} ground staff at the Oval on a basic wage during the season of 30 shillings a week. Hobbs could not immediately play for Surrey owing to the qualification <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> place at the time for the County Championship—a player had to be born in a county or to have lived there for two years in order to represent it. To achieve qualification, he moved to the Surrey area of London. Around this time he played football for local teams as a forward with some success, but struggled financially during the winter months and found it hard to find employment.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{a finite}} {{subdivision}} rule is a recursive way of dividing a polygon or other two-dimensional shape into {{smaller and smaller}} pieces. Subdivision <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> a sense are generalizations of fractals. Instead of repeating exactly the same design over and over, they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals. Subdivision rules {{have been used in}} architecture, biology, and computer science, {{as well as in the}} study of hyperbolic manifolds. Substitution tilings are a well-studied type of subdivision rule.|$|E
5|$|In the marginalia that El Greco {{inscribed in}} his copy of Daniele Barbaro's {{translation}} of Vitruvius' , he refuted Vitruvius' attachment to archaeological remains, canonical proportions, perspective and mathematics. He also saw Vitruvius' manner of distorting proportions {{in order to}} compensate for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms. El Greco was averse to {{the very idea of}} <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance.|$|E

5|$|Many of the <b>rules</b> <b>in</b> the Sheffield game {{were adopted}} by {{and are still}} {{featured}} in today’s association game. Twelve changes {{were made to the}} FA code between 1863 and 1870, of which eight were taken from Sheffield Rules. During this period the Sheffield FA had significant influence over the FA and encouraged it to continue when it was close to collapse in 1867. The corner kick was adopted by the FA in 1872 and they restricted handling of the ball to the goalkeeper's own half in 1873. In the final negotiations between Sheffield and London the latter agreed to allow throw-ins in any direction in exchange.|$|E
