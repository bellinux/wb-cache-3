25|$|In a {{creative}} career that extended up to 1913, Hiralal Sen made over forty films. Most {{of the films}} he made depicted scenes from theatrical productions played at Amarendra Dutta's Classic Theatre in Calcutta. At that time <b>raw</b> <b>film</b> was imported into the country. Between 1901 and 1904, he produced many films for Classic Theatre including Bhramar, Hariraj, and Buddhadev. His longest film, produced in 1903 and titled Alibaba and the Forty Thieves, was also based on an original Classic Theatre performance. However, not much is known about this feature film since it was never screened. He also produced a number of advertising films and newsfilms taking commissions. Having made two films advertising Jabakusum Hair Oil and Edwards Tonic, {{he may have been}} the first Indian to use film for advertising purposes.|$|E
2500|$|While in England, Kitty Hart-Moxon became {{interested}} in educating people about the Holocaust by telling her life story to the public. [...] This began with her first book I Am Alive (1961) (see References); this is an account of her life from the day in 1939 when, while away on holiday with her mother, they received a telegram from her father insisting they return at once, through the {{events that led to}} her incarceration in Auschwitz in 1942, to her liberation from Auschwitz on 13 April 1945. [...] Then, in 1978, Yorkshire Television (YTV) producer Peter Morley's team learned about Hart-Moxon while doing background research on a project about women who risked their lives to save others during the Nazi era, and convinced him to meet her. She didn't fit the parameters they'd set for Women of Courage, but after two visits, Morley was so impressed with Hart-Moxon, he submitted a proposal to YTV to accompany her to Auschwitz for her first visit in 33 years and film it, provided she brought along her eldest son, then a young doctor, for emotional support. In his memoirs, Morley wrote, [...] "This, no doubt, {{was going to be a}} very <b>raw</b> <b>film...</b> I felt this to be a unique opportunity to add fresh insight to the infamy of Auschwitz as had been portrayed in both fictional and non-fictional films and television programmes." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{reasons for}} The MPPC's decline are manifold. The first blow came in 1911, when Eastman Kodak {{modified}} its exclusive {{contract with the}} MPPC, to allow Kodak, which led the industry in quality and price, to sell its <b>raw</b> <b>film</b> stock to unlicensed independents. The number of theaters exhibiting independent films grew by 33 percent within twelve months, to half of all houses.|$|E

50|$|However, the MPPC also {{established}} {{a monopoly on}} all aspects of filmmaking. Eastman Kodak, which owned the patent on <b>raw</b> <b>film</b> stock, {{was a member of}} the Trust and thus agreed to sell stock only to other members. Likewise, the Trust's control of patents on motion picture cameras ensured that only MPPC studios were able to film, and the projector patents allowed the Trust to make licensing agreements with distributors and theaters - and thus determine who screened their films and where.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the {{formation}} of the MPPC, Thomas Edison owned most of the major patents relating to motion pictures, including that for <b>raw</b> <b>film.</b> The MPPC vigorously enforced its patents, constantly bringing suits and receiving injunctions against independent filmmakers. Because of this, a number of filmmakers responded by building their own cameras and moving their operations to Hollywood, California, where the distance from Edison's home base of New Jersey made it more difficult for the MPPC to enforce its patents.|$|E
