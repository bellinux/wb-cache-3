5|$|A general problem {{existed in}} powerplants. The He 111 was {{equipped}} with BMW VI glycol-cooled engines. The German aviation industry lacked powerplants that could produce more than 600 hp. Engines of suitable quality were kept for military use, frustrating German airline Luft Hansa and forcing it to <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> BMW VI or 132s.|$|E
5|$|Heterotic M-theory {{has been}} used to {{construct}} models of brane cosmology in which the observable universe is thought to exist on a brane in a higher dimensional ambient space.

5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{and the ability}} to attend to an aspect of one's environment are fundamental to normal relationships that <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sharing of experience and knowledge. Infants are highly motivated to share experience. An infant's motivation to engage in joint attention is strong enough that infants voluntarily turn away from interesting sights to engage in joint attention with others.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammals are aquatic mammals that <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{ocean and}} other marine {{ecosystems}} for their existence. They include {{animals such as}} seals, whales, manatees, sea otters and polar bears. They do not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping, but rather have a polyphyletic relation due to convergent evolution, as in {{they do not have}} an immediate common ancestor. They are also unified by their reliance on the marine environment for feeding.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, it is {{difficult}} to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about what actually happened. Once again the Allies chose their ground well in order to negate Persian numbers, but this time (unlike Thermopylae) had to <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Persians launching an unnecessary attack for their position to count.

5|$|Some proofs that 0.999... = 1 <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Archimedean {{property}} of the real numbers: {{that there are no}} nonzero infinitesimals. Specifically, the difference 1 − 0.999... must be smaller than any positive rational number, so it must be an infinitesimal; but since the reals do not contain nonzero infinitesimals, the difference is therefore zero, and therefore the two values are the same.|$|E
5|$|The French {{primarily}} {{viewed the}} colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed {{and had to}} <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dregs of the French civil service. Only the Sara of the south was governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.|$|E
5|$|To date, no high {{resolution}} structure of ssTnI has been solved.

5|$|Type I toxin-antitoxin systems <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> base-pairing of {{complementary}} antitoxin RNA {{with the}} toxin's mRNA.

The 5' or 3' overlapping region {{between the two}} genes is the area involved in complementary base-pairing, usually with between 19–23 contiguous base pairs.|$|E
5|$|Andretti {{found little}} success after 1978 in Formula One– {{he failed to}} win another grand prix. He had a {{difficult}} year in 1979, as the new Lotus 80 was not competitive, and the team had to <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Lotus 79 which had been overtaken by the second generation of ground effect cars. In 1980, he was paired with the young Italian Elio de Angelis, and briefly with test driver Nigel Mansell, but the team was again unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable to <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he {{was the target of}} a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E

5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and DNA extraction from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.|$|E
5|$|Homing pigeons use {{magnetic}} field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer to <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> direction of the sun, but switch to using a {{magnetic field}} cue {{when the sun is}} not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.|$|E

5|$|Lead(II) {{compounds}} {{are characteristic}} of the inorganic chemistry of lead. Even strong oxidizing agents like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only PbF2 and PbCl2. Lead(II) ions are usually colorless in solution, and partially hydrolyze to form Pb(OH)+ and finally Pb4(OH)4 (in which the hydroxyl ions act as bridging ligands), but are not reducing agents as tin(II) ions are. Techniques for identifying {{the presence of the}} Pb2+ ion in water generally <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> precipitation of lead(II) chloride using dilute hydrochloric acid. As the chloride salt is somewhat soluble in water, the precipitation of lead(II) sulfide, by bubbling hydrogen sulfide through the solution, is then attempted.|$|E
5|$|M. vitrata {{causes the}} most {{damage to the}} growing cowpea due to their large host range and {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It causes damage to the flower buds, flowers and pods of the plant with infestations resulting in a 20–88% loss of yield. While the insect can cause damage through all growth stages, most of the damage occurs during flowering. Biological control has had limited success, so most preventative methods <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of agrichemicals. Genetically modified cowpeas are being developed to express the cry protein from Bacillus thuringiensis, which is toxic to lepidopteran species including the Maruca.|$|E
5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> certification.|$|E
