The façade was remodelled by Mederico Blondel, {{and a third}} floor was {{constructed}} {{at the expense of}} Grand Master Gregorio Carafa. An ornate centrepiece with a trophy of arms containing a bust of Carafa was added above the main entrance. The trophy was sculpted by Raymond de La Fage out of marble taken from the ruins of the Temple of Proserpina, an ancient Roman temple in Mtarfa which had been discovered in 1613.|$|E
5|$|Although Herod's <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> the Second Temple was {{initiated}} in late 1st century BCE, excavations beneath the street near the arch revealed three oil lamps {{of a type}} common {{in the first century}} CE and 17 identifiable coins, several of which were struck by Valerius Gratus, Roman procurator of Judea, in the year 17/18 CE. This means that the arch and nearby sections of the Western Wall were constructed after this date.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{was popular}} with {{travelling}} vendors, particularly of small fancy goods, {{the maintenance of}} the market cross was costly and unpopular with Norwich's citizens. In 1732 the cross was demolished, and the stone was sold for £125.

Its site is now outlined in red stones embedded in the market floor.|$|E

5|$|Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), {{educated in}} Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway {{around the turn}} of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major {{achievement}} was the <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> the only seat of higher education in Christiania, the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. He added a classical portico to the front of an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.|$|E

As chairman, he was responsible for the <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> the old Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and he established the Morris Loeb Lectures in Physics. He also devoted a good deal of his time to improving the laboratory facilities for graduate students.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the AirTrain case appeal was decided in October 2000, two-thirds of the system's viaduct {{structures}} had been constructed already. The system was ready for its first test trains by December 2000. The state spent $75 million to renovate the Howard Beach station, which brought it into ADA compliance and facilitated passengers' transfers {{to and from the}} AirTrain. The new Howard Beach station was completed in May 2001. The Port Authority also contributed $100 million toward the <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> the Jamaica LIRR station, with the State of New York paying {{for the rest of the}} $387 million project. The purpose of this renovation was, in part, to facilitate AirTrain connections. The <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> the Jamaica station started in May 2001 upon the completion of the Howard Beach station. By this time, the system's guideway rails were complete and the guideways were being constructed. The first two AirTrain cars were delivered in March 2001 and were undergoing testing at the AirTrain maintenance facility near Lefferts Boulevard. The guideways were completed in August 2001. However, a parking structure, proposed near the Jamaica terminal as part of a long-term plan to redevelop downtown Jamaica, was largely unfunded by 2002, the year the AirTrain was originally supposed to open.|$|E
