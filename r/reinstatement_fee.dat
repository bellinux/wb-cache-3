40|$|The Act {{requires}} {{drivers to}} exchange {{the names of}} their liability insurance companies at the scene of an accident. It also requires defendants who plead nolo contendere to a DUI charge to complete a drug or alcohol program within 120 days to avoid suspension of their drivers 2 ̆ 7 licenses. Although proof of course completion must be submitted to both the court and the Department of Public Safety within 120 days to avoid a 200 license <b>reinstatement</b> <b>fee,</b> the Act gives the Department of Public Safety power to waive the 200 fee in certain circumstances. Finally, the Act requires drivers to bring their vehicles to a stop when a police officer gives a visual or an audible signal...|$|E

40|$|The Act {{provides}} for the mandatory suspension of the professional license of any individual who defaults on or breaches a repayment or service obligation under any federal educational loan. The Act requires that the licensee be given notice {{and an opportunity to}} appear before the Licensing Board prior to the suspension of the license.

50|$|Software {{licensing}} often {{also includes}} maintenance. This, usually with {{a term of}} one year, is either included or optional, but must often be bought with the software. The maintenance agreement (contract) contains minor updates (V.1.1 => 1.2), sometimes major updates (V.1.2 => 2.0) and is called e.g. update insurance, upgrade assurance. For a major update the customer has to buy an upgrade, if {{not included in the}} maintenance. For a maintenance renewal some manufacturers charge a <b>reinstatement</b> (reinstallment) <b>fee</b> retroactively per month, in case the current maintenance has expired. Maintenance normally doesn't include technical support. Here one can differentiate between e-mail and tel. support, also availability (e.g. 5x8, 5 days a week, 8 hours a day) and reaction time (e.g. three hours) can play a role. This is commonly named gold, silver and bronze support. Support is also licensed per incident as incident pack (e.g. five support incidents per year).|$|R
40|$|This Note {{argues that}} {{revocation}} of a driver 2 ̆ 7 s license under ALS proceedings {{is not a}} bar to subsequent criminal prosecution by the state. It discusses the potential double jeopardy implications surrounding ALS that is followed by criminal proceedings, {{as well as the}} reasoning employed by a majority of the courts that hold that an ALS is remedial and, therefore, not punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. It argues that with regard to determining whether an ALS is punitive, the appropriate test should balance the effect of the statute on the driver against the state 2 ̆ 7 s interest in protecting the public safety. This Note concludes that the punitive effects on drunken drivers by the imposition of a 90 -day driver 2 ̆ 7 s license suspension and a moderate <b>reinstatement</b> <b>fee</b> is not disproportionate to the perceived risk drunken drivers pose to society while they await trial, and thus the presumption that the government is acting in a non-punishing capacity is not rebutted. Thus, the typical 90 -day ALS is not punitive and may be accompanied by subsequent criminal prosecution...|$|E

Changes to education {{led to a}} ministerial meeting with three Church of Ireland bishops over what {{was viewed as a}} disproportionate level of cuts to be suffered by Protestant secondary schools. Separately, representatives of the Roman Catholic Church were assured by O'Keeffe that it would continue to be able to provide religious instruction to pupils in primary schools not under its patronage.|$|R
