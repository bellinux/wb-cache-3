40|$|Abbreviations {{are widely}} used in writing, and <b>the</b> {{understanding}} of <b>abbreviations</b> is important for natural language processing applications. Abbreviations are not always defined in a document and they are highly ambiguous. A knowledge base that consists of abbreviations with their associated senses and a method to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> ambiguities are needed. In this paper, we studied the UMLS coverage, textual variants of senses, and <b>the</b> ambiguity of <b>abbreviations</b> in MEDLINE abstracts. We restricted our study to three-letter abbreviations which were defined using parenthetical expressions. When grouping similar expansions together and representing senses using groups, we found that after ignoring senses where {{the total number of}} occurrences within the corresponding group was less than 100, 82. 8 % of the senses matched the UMLS, covered over 93 % of occurrences that were considered, and had an average of 7. 74 expansions for each sense. Abbreviations are highly ambiguous: 81. 2 % of <b>the</b> <b>abbreviations</b> were ambiguous, and had an average of 16. 6 senses. However, after ignoring senses with occurrences of less than 5, 64. 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>abbreviations</b> were ambiguous, and had an average of 4. 91 senses...|$|R
