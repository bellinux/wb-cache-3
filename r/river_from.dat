40|$|The study {{describes}} the trends of monthly mean water temperature (from May to October) {{and the annual}} maximum water temperature of the rivers in Latvia during the time period from 1945 to 2000. The results demonstrated that the mean water temperatures during the monitoring period from May to October {{were higher in the}} largest <b>rivers</b> (<b>from</b> 13. 6 °C to 16. 1 °C) compared to those in the smallest <b>rivers</b> (<b>from</b> 11. 5 °C to 15. 7 °C). Similar patterns were seen for the maximum water temperature: in large <b>rivers</b> <b>from</b> 22. 9 °C to 25. 7 °C, and in small <b>rivers</b> <b>from</b> 20. 8 °C to 25. 8 °C. Generally, lower water temperatures occurred in rivers with a high groundwater inflow rate, for example, in rivers of the Gauja basin, in particular, in the Amata River. Mann-Kendall test results demonstrated that during the monitoring period from May to October, mean water temperatures had a positive trend. However, the annual maximum temperature had a negative trend...|$|R
