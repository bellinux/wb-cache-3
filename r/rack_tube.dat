40|$|This paper {{considers}} the spectral {{properties of the}} Woodstock Gamelan, a 3 ‐octave set of tubular chimes built by Woodstock Percussion in upstate New York. One of the main features of the instrument is expandability, and it includes 75 microtones in the middle octave. The justly tuned instruments of Harry Partch inspired the instrument. The Woodstock Gamelan has two types of aluminum <b>tubes.</b> <b>Racks</b> support the <b>tubes</b> down to Eb 4, and these have a vibraphonelike timbre. The larger hanging tubes go down to G 3, and have larger diameters than the <b>rack</b> <b>tubes.</b> The sound of the hanging tubes {{is similar to that}} of orchestral chimes. The Woodstock Gamelan has five exponentially decaying partials, and their frequency ratios are the same in the low and high registers. The frequency ratios measured were about 1, 2. 69, 5. 15, 8. 38, and 12. 08. The ratios are close to the just ratios of 1, 2. 667, 5. 333, 8. 533, and 12. A Csound model for the Woodstock Gamelan has been developed. Listening tests show that the model produces tones nearly indistinguishable from the original. The model produces attractive related timbres by simple changes to the parameters...|$|R
50|$|Test <b>tube</b> <b>rack</b> is a {{laboratory}} equipment {{that is used}} to hold upright multiple test tubes at the same time.

40|$|Traditional and {{innovative}} laboratory procedures {{are used for}} biomarker discovery studies and for the appraisal of biomolecular markers correlated to possible determinants of clinical outcome. This objective is easily achievable in our Institution thanks to {{the availability of a}} Multidisciplinary InterInstitutional BioBank (BioBIM) fully equipped for the automation of sampling, processing, storage and tracking of biological samples and completely integrated with the diagnostic section through an informatics platform connecting the laboratory informatics with a pre-analytical robotic system. Biological samples and <b>tube</b> <b>racks</b> are identified by a linear bar code and then the <b>tube</b> <b>rack</b> is scanned on a 2 D reader, since each tube is assigned a unique 2 D identifier. After this procedure, the aliquoting is carried out on a robotic platform by using the previously identified tubes. Finally the <b>tube</b> <b>racks</b> are stored at – 80 °C. A Sample Tracking Software is utilized to track all the sample identification and physical storage information. A tracking of plates and boxes handling is performed by means of RFID technology. All samples are automatically recorded in databases with encoded identification. Decoding can only be done by the biobank responsible investigator or other authorized members of the research team. The entire process from bleeding to sample storage is controlled by an IT integrated platform. All personnel is using Standard Operating Procedures defined by international guidelines when available or internal standardized protocols...|$|R
50|$|Another type {{of solar}} {{collector}} is the evacuated tube collector, which {{are intended for}} cold climates that do not experience severe hail and/or applications where high temperatures are needed (i.e., over 200 F). Placed in a <b>rack,</b> evacuated <b>tube</b> collectors form a row of glass tubes, each containing absorption fins attached to a central heat-conducting rod (copper or condensation-driven). The evacuated description refers to the vacuum created in the glass tubes during the manufacturing process, which results in very low heat loss and lets evacuated tube systems achieve extreme temperatures, far in excess of water's boiling point.|$|R
50|$|Culture {{tubes are}} test tubes used in biology and related {{sciences}} for handling and culturing {{all kinds of}} live organisms, such as molds, bacteria, seedlings, plant cuttings, etc..

30|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the temperature effect on the liquid within the 384 tube sets, the datalogger was set to log single measurements from the eight probes at 200 ms intervals and the log started prior to filling the <b>racks.</b> Next, <b>tube</b> <b>racks</b> were filled with 70 μL of water. For the wells containing temperature probes the liquid may bridge across the well above the probe. It is necessary to use a disposable tip to break the surface tension below the probe so the liquid drops {{to the bottom of}} the <b>tube.</b> The filled <b>rack</b> was then transferred to the ALPS 3000 and heat sealed, while sealing the door of the instrument was held open to allow the wires to prevent the wires getting trapped. Two test runs were made sealing at 165 °C for 1 second and then for 2 seconds. The same rack was used with the foil removed for the second run. Further testing suggests sealing at 155 °C for 0.5 seconds provides adequate sealing without deforming the tubes unduly. Sealing at 165 for 1 second melted more of the tube than is desirable. Fine-tuning and adjustments can be made at site and optimized accordingly.|$|R

40|$|As {{a part of}} {{activities}} to improve the skills of technical staff members through exchange with staff in other disciplines, mechanical engineering staff members were assigned to a Chemistry and Materials Science Experiment Course (qualitative analysis) offered to first year students of the Department of Chemistry and Materials Science. Asking the mechanical engineering staff members to perform assignments as efficiently as experienced chemical engineering staff without any preparatory measures would have been unreasonable, {{in addition to the}} fact that the assignment already put mental pressure on both the group dispatching the mechanical engineering staff and the group receiving them and caused feelings of uneasiness in both groups. To dispel the uneasiness, various efforts were repeatedly made; for example, teaching staff members elucidated and explained in detail to the mechanical engineering staff members about the four themes of the experiment course, which they would work on over the course of a semester, and the mechanical engineering staff members conducted preparatory experiments with the teaching and chemical engineering staff members. By its nature, the experiment course required its participants to conduct extensive observations. It was felt that there were many experiment phenomena which could be noticed only after they had been explained. These included cases where, for example, observation was very difficult because barely visible precipitate formed in the solution inside a test tube, but became transparent when the test tube was shaken, or where after the precipitate had dissolved, it transformed into crystalline precipitate when it was recrystallized. Furthermore, the mechanical engineering staff members were taught that in some cases, it was very important to observe different deposits and compare them with each other. During the regular experiment classes, the staff members are very busy carrying out their duties, such as preparing chemical reagents, receiving reports, and monitoring and managing students’ safety and the progress of their experiments. Test <b>tube</b> <b>racks</b> for small test tubes used for the department’s student experiment classes were blackened, and some 3 mm long sections between test tube holes were corroded and had disappeared due to more than 30 years of aging deterioration and degradation by chemicals and other materials. However, the experiment staff members could not afford to take the time to solve the test tube racks’ problems due to being so busy and under budgetary constraints. The test <b>tube</b> <b>racks</b> were not commercially available goods, but hand-made products created by a craftsman. Therefore, even if a decision to replace them with new ones was made, arranging for the replacements would be problematic. According to the results of the preparatory experiments conducted by the staff members, it was hard to detect a minute amount of precipitate as well as to observe the colors, crystallization and other precipitate characteristics with the test <b>tube</b> <b>rack</b> because the rack’s upper plate creates a shade while the blackened bottom plate reduces reflectivity, leading to an insufficient amount of light reaching the test tubes inserted in the rack. While the wooden test <b>tube</b> <b>racks</b> were hand-made by a craftsman, the authors proposed new designs from the point of view of the mechanical engineering staff, using stainless steel, acrylic and other plates to produce prototypes, and a laser beam machining tool to finely process acrylic plates to mass produce new rack units to be used in class. In this report, the authors describe their activities to design and manufacture new acrylic test <b>tube</b> <b>racks,</b> and use them for an experiment class. Furthermore, the authors report that the acrylic test <b>tube</b> <b>racks</b> contributed to improving test tube observation results as expected and that this technical staff exchange between different disciplines was successful...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The antigens {{of eight}} strains of {{influenza}} virus were compared {{by a simple}} and economical complement-fixation technique in which drops on Perspex sheets replaced larger volumes of reagents in <b>racks</b> of <b>tubes.</b> By this means more extensive tests were made with a limited supply of material than by standard tube techniques. The specific antisera were prepared in mice, thus avoiding the elaborate isolation precautions necessary for ferrets, and sera from large groups were pooled to minimize individual variations between animals.

The comparison of the strains is presented in the form of index numbers, ranging from 0 to 1. 0; 1. 0 represents complete identity of two strains, while the smaller numbers are taken to represent the degree of antigenic relationship between strains. Of the six strains examined which were isolated in different years, all were serologically distinct though the two I 3 strains were closely similar and two of the A strains were fairly closely related.

40|$|The {{formation}} of floating sulphur biofilm {{was observed in}} the microbial ecology studies of tannery ponds undertaken by the Environmental Biotechnology Group at Rhodes University.

This study investigated the potential for applying these observations in developing a floating sulphur biofilm reactor for the removal of sulphide from sulphide-rich effluents produced in wastewater treatment systems. This was carried out in five sequential experimental phases. Where original studies had been undertaken using sulphide-rich water derived from sewage sludge as the carbon source, the successful establishment of a floating sulphur biofilm from effluent of lignocellulose-derived wastewaters had been shown. The effect of influent sulphide concentrations, flow rate and reactor dimensions on the sulphur biofilm formation were investigated for the optimization of elemental sulphur recovery and sulphide removal efficiency.

There is much about the modern computer that would have been familiar to the designers of the ENIAC and the EDVAC in the 1940 s. Indeed, computers seem to grow steadily more homogeneous as the years go by, crowding into one small corner of a multidimensional “design space. ” Perhaps there is a good reason for this trend toward uniformity—perhaps this one tight cluster of designs is where all the best ideas are found—but it seems worthwhile making at least a brief survey of some of the unpopulated wilderness areas elsewhere in the computer design space.

30|$|Biobank sample {{integrity}} is paramount for subsequent studies but also other factors {{are important for}} showing the community that we are acting responsibly. Today’s clinical scientist needs {{to be prepared to}} not only collect and validate their raw gene-and protein- data and to safe keep the stored samples, but also to establish and maintain a legal administration for documenting the position of every individual sample in the biobank by a process that de-identifies the actual personal information linked to a specific sample. Currently the sample processing of blood samples from patients is performed at short cycle times within hospitals, typically 2  h [12 – 15]. The 2  h include the collection from the patient, sample handling, centrifugations, and aliquoting into 384 <b>tube</b> <b>racks,</b> i.e., from the time the needle goes into the arm until the aliquoted blood fractions are stored at − 80 °C. The workflow of the semi-automated 384 -tube system processing and storage is depicted in Fig.  1. The protocol is used in cancer- and cardiovascular studies. In this workflow system, each 384 rack will hold one or two patients, depending on the number of primary tubes collected in the study. Here we typically use five primary tubes (6  mL) with blood containing various anticoagulants (EDTA, citrate, heparin). All blood fractions end up in the same rack {{due to the lack of}} time to distribute the aliquots into multiple 384 -racks.

40|$|Radiopacity is a {{critical}} property of materials that are used {{for a range of}} radiological applications, including the development of phantom devices that emulate the radiodensity of native tissues and the production of protective equipment for personnel handling radioactive materials. Three-dimensional (3 D) printing is a fabrication platform that is well suited to creating complex anatomical replicas or custom labware to accomplish these radiological purposes. We created and tested multiple ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) filaments infused with varied concentrations of bismuth (1. 2 – 2. 7 g/cm 3), a radiopaque metal that is compatible with plastic infusion, to address the poor gamma radiation attenuation of many mainstream 3 D printing materials. X-ray computed tomography (CT) experiments of these filaments indicated that a density of 1. 2 g/cm 3 of bismuth-infused ABS emulates bone radiopacity during X-ray CT imaging on preclinical and clinical scanners. ABS-bismuth filaments along with ABS were 3 D printed to create an embedded human nasocranial anatomical phantom that mimicked radiological properties of native bone and soft tissue. Increasing the bismuth content in the filaments to 2. 7 g/cm 3 created a stable material that could attenuate 50 % of 99 mTechnetium gamma emission when printed with a 2. 0 mm wall thickness. A shielded test <b>tube</b> <b>rack</b> was printed to attenuate source radiation as a protective measure for lab personnel.

40|$|Watergate {{made me a}} lawyer. On August 8, 1974, Richard Nixon {{resigned}} {{the office}} of President of the United States. 1 Three weeks later, I returned to college to begin my junior year. I was a pre-med biochemistry major scheduled {{to spend most of}} the fall semester surrounded by beakers, spectrophotometers, test <b>tube</b> <b>racks,</b> glass slides, and fumes of formaldehyde and acetone. During the summer, as the evidence against the President mounted and impeachment moved from the realm of the fantastic to virtual certainty, the prospect of a life among the petri dishes grew less and less alluring. I will confess that some of this disenchantment undoubtedly arose from a persistent inability, demonstrated in two passes through organic chemistry, to grasp the molecular configurations made possible by the hexagonal geometry of the carbon atom. Nonetheless, the most powerful source of my disquiet was the realization, growing for a year and more as I watched the televised hearings before Senator Sam Ervin 2 ̆ 7 s Watergate Committee, and then the proceedings of the House Judiciary Committee as it agonized toward a vote on articles of impeachment, that I was far more interested in what these men and women were doing than in all the cytosis, osmosis, and symbiosis of all the microorganisms ever spawned. 2 * 6 It was not merely the theater of Watergate that drew me in, though the drama of the thing was undeniable. After all, one can be mesmerized by the grisly spectacle of a train wreck without feeling any urge to become an engineer. What captivated me was the people of Watergate, principally the legislators on the Senate and House committees, but also members of the Watergate Special Prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s Office, and even members of the Nixon administration itself [...] elected or appointed officials, partisan politicians mostly, and certainly no saints [...] who, on balance, acted with firmness, integrity, and restraint. As a Democrat and no special fan of Richard Nixon, 3 my particular heroes were the obvious ones: Archibald Cox, Sam Ervin, Peter Rodino, Barbara Jordan. But I think even then I admired them as much for their caution and their obvious and unfeigned sense of the gravity of the task they had undertaken as for their investigative prowess, their rhetoric, their wit, or their ultimate success in forcing a flawed and corrupt president from office. And even back then, despite my instinctive rooting interest in the Democrats, I came away from Watergate with a deep respect for those Republicans in and out of Congress who [...] despite the personal and political cost [...] insisted on finding the truth, refused to blink at what they found, and finally, sadly, repudiated their own leader. 4 I wanted to be like these people, wanted a part, however small, in the high drama of American public life. The immediately obvious point was that nearly all of the players in Watergate (both the heroes and the villains) were lawyers. And so, in the fall of 1974, I abandoned the study of the natural world, took up the study of history and politics, and resolved to go to law school. Twenty-five years later, after law school, two decades of practice as a trial lawyer, and {{at the beginning of a}} second career as a legal academic, to my immense surprise, I found myself playing a (very) small part in the second presidential impeachment of my lifetime as the co-author of the official statement of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to the House Judiciary Committee on the meaning of “high Crimes and Misdemeanors. ” * 7 5 Of course, we know how that came out. President Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate. 6 By the time this Article reaches print, he will have completed his term. Irremediably stained, but defiant. Disgraced and diminished, but persistently, almost perversely popular. The fall of Richard Nixon was tragedy in the classic sense. A commanding personality clawed to the heights of power and was then brought low when crippling flaws in his character led him into conduct that was a serious affront to democratic government. The Clinton impeachment was vulgar farce. 7 A surpassingly agile politician with an adolescent sex drive and an urge for self-preservation that far outstripped any sense of personal honor was attacked by opponents who missed their quarry and destroyed or diminished themselves by trying to elevate a squalid extramarital sexual encounter into an affair of state. For me at least, the effect of watching Nixon 2 ̆ 7 s descent was all that the ancient Greek commentators on the drama could have wished for in the spectator of a tragedy: pity, terror, catharsis, enlightenment, an aspiration to nobler things. By contrast, the dominant emotion inspired by Bill Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s escape from early retirement was * 8 the urge to bathe with strong disinfectant soap [...] and then to retreat into the countryside to take up beekeeping, or some other occupation as removed as possible from the contemplation of American law and politics. This radical contrast in my reactions to the impeachment controversies that stand at either end of my life in the law so far has led me to ask three questions. First, were the Nixon and Clinton affairs truly as different as my memory makes them? Were the villains of Watergate as villainous and the heroes as heroic as I remember them? Were nearly all the players on both sides of l 2 ̆ 7 affaire Lewinsky as shallow and fatuous as they seemed? Or to put the question in broader historical context, was the impeachment of Bill Clinton truly distinct, not only from Watergate, but from all of the other (fortunately few) occasions on which a president was seriously threatened with removal from office? Second, if the Clinton impeachment really was as bizarre, unprecedented, and unsettling an event as it seemed, how could such a thing have happened? Finally, what are the implications for the future of the presidency, and more generally, for the project of governance in America, of the incredible but incontrovertible fact that a president of the United States was impeached and nearly stripped of his office for lying about sexual infidelity...|$|R
