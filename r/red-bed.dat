40|$|A {{diversity}} of scales capture facets of reward-related eating (RRE). These scales assess food cravings, uncontrolled eating, addictive behavior, restrained eating, binge eating, and other eating behaviors. However, these scales differ {{in terms of}} the severity of RRE they capture. We sought to incorporate the items from existing scales to broaden the 9 -item Reward-based Eating Drive scale (<b>RED-</b> 9; Epel et al., 2014), which assesses three dimensions of RRE (lack of satiety, preoccupation with food, and lack of control over eating), in order to more comprehensively assess the entire spectrum of RRE. In a series of 4 studies, we used Item Response Theory models to consider candidate items to broaden the <b>RED-</b> 9. Studies 1 and 2 evaluated the abilities of additional items from existing scales to increase the <b>RED-</b> 9 ’s coverage across the spectrum of RRE. Study 3 evaluated candidate items identified in Studies 1 and 2 in a new sample to assess {{the extent to which they}} accounted for more variance in areas less well-covered by the <b>RED-</b> 9. Study 4 tested the ability of the <b>RED-</b> 13 to provide consistent coverage across the range of the RRE spectrum. The resultant <b>RED-</b> 13 accounted for greater variability than the <b>RED-</b> 9 by reducing gaps in coverage of RRE in middle-to-low ranges. Like the <b>RED-</b> 9, the <b>RED-</b> 13 was positively correlated with BMI. The <b>RED-</b> 13 was also positively related to a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes as well as cravings for sweet and savory foods. In summary, the <b>RED-</b> 13 is a brief self-report measure that broadly captures the spectrum of RRE and may be a useful tool for identifying individuals at risk for overweight or obesity...|$|R
40|$|The ultrasonic, {{photocatalytic}} and sonophotocatalytic {{degradation of}} Basic <b>Red-</b> 2 accompanied by Nb 2 O 5 nano catalysts were studied. The structure and morphology of synthesized Nb 2 O 5 nano catalyst was investigated using scanning election microscopy (SEM), Electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effects of various experimental parameters {{such as the}} Basic <b>Red-</b> 2 concentration, catalyst dose, pH and addition of H 2 O 2 on the ultrasonic, photocatalytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation were investigated. Photocatalytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation of Basic <b>Red-</b> 2 was strongly affected by initial dye concentration, catalyst dose, H 2 O 2 addition and pH. Basic pH (pH- 10) was favored for the ultrasonic (US), photocatalytic (UV + Nb 2 O 5) and sonophotocatalytic (US + UV + Nb 2 O 5) degradation of Basic <b>Red-</b> 2 by using Nb 2 O 5 nano catalyst. The ultrasonic degradation of Basic <b>Red-</b> 2 was enhanced {{by the addition of}} photocatalyst. Then, the effect of Nb 2 O 5 dose on photocatalytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation were studied, and it was found that increase in catalyst dose increase in the percentage degradation of Basic <b>Red-</b> 2.

To investigate {{the role of}} -defensins in enteric host defenses in nonhuman primates, -defensin cDNAs were isolated, -defensin peptides were purified from rhesus macaque small bowel, and the bactericidal activities of the peptides were measured. Six rhesus enteric -defensin (RED) cDNAs, <b>RED-</b> 1 to <b>RED-</b> 6, were identified in a jejunum cDNA library; the deduced RED peptides exhibited extensive diversity relative to the primary structures of rhesus myeloid -defensins. <b>RED-</b> 4 was purified from monkey jejunum, and N-terminal peptide sequencing of putative <b>RED-</b> 4 peptides identified two N termini, RTCYCRTGR [...] . and TCYCRTGRC [...] .; these corresponded to alternative N termini for the <b>RED-</b> 4 molecules, as deduced from their molecular masses and RED cDNAs. In situ hybridization experiments localized RED mRNAs exclusively to small intestinal Paneth cells. Recombinant <b>RED-</b> 1 to <b>RED-</b> 4 were purified to homogeneity and shown to be microbicidal in the low micromolar range (< 10 g/ml) against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with individual peptides exhibiting variable target cell specificities. Thus, compared to myeloid -defensins from rhesus macaques, enteric -defensin peptides are highly variable in both primary structure and activity.

5000|$|The Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River is {{the southernmost}} {{of two major}} forks which form the {{headwaters}} of the Red River. It begins as an ephemeral stream on the level surface of the Llano Estacado in Randall County, about 4 mi northeast of Canyon, Texas. The stream initially runs northeastward then southeastward across Randall County, flowing through Palo Duro Canyon where it is fed by springs, providing a base flow that is often increased significantly by runoff from rainstorms. It provides the water for Lake Tanglewood and River Falls prior to flowing through the Palo Duro Canyon State Park. [...] The stream continues in a southeasterly direction through southern Armstrong and northeastern Briscoe County where it exits Palo Duro Canyon and starts across the rolling <b>red-bed</b> country of central Hall County, where it merges with the Little Red River. The stream continues across Hall and Childress counties, merging with Buck Creek and forming the Red River proper, 8 mi south-southwest of Hollis, Oklahoma. [...] When the Prairie Dog Town Fork crosses the 100th meridian at the eastern edge of Childress County, Texas, its south bank becomes the state boundary between Texas and Oklahoma.|$|E
40|$|Slaking <b>red-bed</b> soft {{rocks are}} widely {{distributed}} {{in the south of}} Anhui Province, China, and several highways will go through this area. It is important to evaluate their physical and mechanical characteristics for the purpose of using this kind of soft rocks as materials for road construction. In this paper, the compacting tests, the resilient modulus tests, the California bearing ratio (CBR) tests, and permeability tests have been carried out on crushed <b>red-bed</b> soft rock mixtures. The test results showed that, for a given degree of compaction, the resilient modulus decreases linearly with the increase of moisture content. For a given moisture content, the resilient modulus and CBR values increase linearly with the increase of compaction degree, while the soaking swelling, water absorption capacity, and permeability coefficient decrease linearly. In other words, the strength and water stability are enhanced with the increase of the degree of compaction. The results demonstrate that the crushed <b>red-bed</b> soft rock mixtures can be directly used as materials for the highway construction by taking corresponding measures...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{evidence}} suggests that the fluids forming stratiform and <b>red-bed</b> copper de-posits derived their Cu, Ag, and other metals from adjacent red sandstones and shales. Cop-per and Ag are soluble in moderately concentrated chloride brines at intermediate oxidation states, but published ata suggest that Cu is strongly adsorbed on goethite and hematite at pH near 7 and temperatures of 0 ø to 100 øC. Also, Pb, Zn, Co, and Ni are soluble in chloride brines, but are only present in some <b>red-bed</b> Cu deposits. To examine variability in relative adsorption of 0. 5 mg/l Ag, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn, adsorption on goethite (195 mS/l) has been measured as a function ofpH (5 - 9), CI- (0, 1 M, 4 M,), temperature (25 øC, 50 øC), and redox state (air, Fe+ 2 -goethite). Under oxidized conditions at 25 øC and 1 M C 1, the order of decreas-ing adsorption is Cu-Pb-Zn-Co-Ni-Ag, with Cu and Pb almost completely adsorbed at pH values greater than 6. However, in 1 M C 1 at 25 øC with Eh buffered by Fe+ 2 -goethite, the order of decreasing adsorption is Pb-Zn-Co-Ni-Cu(-Ag?), and less than 50 percent of the Cu is adsorbed at pH 7. An exploratory experiment with 3 M NaC 1 + 1 M Na 2 SO 4 at 25 øC with about 4, 000 m 2 /g of hematite as adsorbent and 75 mg/ 1 Cu, Ag, Zn, Pb, and Co and 40 mg/ 1 Fe +a was conducted to approximate conditions in a <b>red-bed</b> pore fluid during diagenesis. An appreciable fraction of the Cu and Ag remained in solution at pH 7, but Pb, Zn, and Co were completely adsorbed. Based on this data, the observed range of metal associations (Cu, Cu-Ag, Cu-Co, Cu-Zn-Ag, etc.) in <b>red-bed</b> and stratiform copper deposits eems explainable by variations among districts in pH, Eh, temperature, major element content of pore fluid, and Fe oxide character of the diagenetic environment. Similar adsorption phenomena may ac-count for varying metal ratios in other low-temperature ore deposits and in noneconomic metal enrichments...|$|E

40|$|The water-softening {{property}} of soft rocks {{is a key}} problem in geotechnical engineering. A typical <b>red-bed</b> soft rock (the Zigong argillaceous siltstones) with different weathering degree is selected as an example to study the water-softening property {{and the influence of}} degree of weathering. A series of mechanical and microstructure tests are carried out to analyze the weathering characteristics and mechanism of the Zigong argillaceous siltstones. The results of mechanical experiments reveal that the water content and the weathering degree of rock specimens both have a weakening effect on the compressive and shear strengths. According to the results of present microstructure tests, the mechanical properties of the Zigong argillaceous siltstones are closely correlated with their physical properties, including internal microstructure and material composition for highly weathered rocks or moderately weathered rocks (in both natural and saturation conditions). Finally, experimental results indicate that the changes of microstructure and internal materials are two main factors that influence rock strength parameters after contacting with water and that these properties reflect the rock weathering degree. In a word, when <b>red-bed</b> soft rocks are encountered in geotechnical engineering, special attention should be paid to presence of water...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{oil and gas}} {{reserves}} occur in so-called “barren red-beds ” in several regions around the world. Although red-beds occur throughout the geological timescale, examples with an economic interest are the Late Carboniferous, Permian and Early Triassic of Europe (Barren Measures, Rotliegendes, Bunter; Doornenbal and Stevenson, 2010), the Triassic of the United States, and the Permian–Carboniferous of the Middle East. These sediments are generally deposited in non-marine environments under arid climate conditions. In terrestrial basins, biostratigraphic analysis of plant microfossils (pollen and spores) is often effective in constraining static geological models. Unfortunately, such organic-walled microfossils are not preserved in <b>red-bed</b> deposits due to oxidation, hampering stratigraphic correlation on both local (field) and regional scale. In our research, a group of biogenic siliceous microfossils, termed phytoliths, has been applied as biostratigraphic tool in the Permian–Carboniferous <b>red-bed</b> sequences. Phytoliths, or biogenic silica particles (BSPs), originate in the cells of higher land plants. After organic matter decomposition, phytoliths can be preserved as siliceous bodies.

40|$|The {{volcanic}} Hartley Formation (part of the Olifantshoek Supergroup, {{which is}} dominated by red bed successions) in South Africa recorded depositional and tectonic conditions along the western Kaapvaal Craton during the late Palaeoproterozoic. It formed in association with red bed deposition elsewhere in the cratonic hinterland and along the craton’s northern margin. However, the exact correlation of the Olifantshoek Supergroup with these other <b>red-bed</b> successions is hindered by poor geochronological constraints. Herein, we refine the age and palaeopole of the Hartley Formation, and provide geochronological constraints for large-scale 1. 93 – 1. 91 Ga bimodal magmatism on the Kaapvaal Craton (herein named the Hartley large igneous province). We present new age constraints for the mafic and felsic phases of this event at 1923 ± 6 Ma and 1920 ± 4 Ma, respectively, which includes the first reported age dating of the Tsineng Dyke Swarm that {{has been linked to}} Hartley volcanism. A mean 1. 93 – 1. 91 Ga palaeomagnetic pole for the Hartley large igneous province at 22. 7 °N, 328. 6 °E with A 95 = 11. 7 ° represents a significant improvement on a previously published virtual geomagnetic pole. This improved pole is used to refine the late Palaeoproterozoic apparent polar wander path of the Kaapvaal Craton.

40|$|The <b>red-bed</b> {{deposits}} in northern Iraq are situated in an active foreland basin {{adjacent to the}} Zagros Orogenic Belt, bound to the north by the Iranian plate thrust {{over the edge of}} the Arabian plate. The <b>red-bed</b> successions are composed of alternating red and brown silty mudstones, purplish red calcareous siltstone, fine- to coarse-grained pebbly sandstone and conglomerate. The red beds in the current study can be divided into four parts showing a trend of upward coarsening with fine-grained deposits at the top. A detailed petrographic study was carried out on the sandstone units. The clastic rocks consist mainly of calcite cemented litharenite with rock fragments (volcanic, metamorphic and sedimentary), quartz and minor feldspar. The petrographic components reflect the tectonic system in the source area, laterally ranging from a mixed orogenic and magmatic arc in Mawat-Chwarta area to recycled orogenic material rich in sedimentary rock fragments in the Qandel area. The Cretaceous-Palaeogene foreland basin of northern Iraq formed to the southwest of the Zagros Suture Zone and the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone of western Iran. During Palaeogene time deposition of the red beds was caused by renewed shortening in the thrust sheets overlying the Arabian margin with uplift of radiolarites (Qulqula Formation), resulting in an influx of radiolarian debris in addition to continuing ophiolitic detritus. Mixed sources, including metamorphic, volcanic and sedimentary terranes, were present during deposition of the upper part of the red beds...|$|E
40|$|Regionally {{extensive}} core {{coverage in}} beds of the lowermost Upper Triassic Charlie Lake Formation — between the “A ” marker and underlying Middle Triassic Halfway or Doig beds — in the subsurface of west-central Alberta and adjacent northeast British Columbia facilitate {{the interpretation of}} a regional depositional setting. Three broad facies assemblages are identified: 1) red beds; 2) grey beds; and 3) sandstone beds. These three assemblages occur in geographically restricted areas. The <b>red-bed</b> assemblage occurs mostly along the eastern margin of the basin and is interpreted as predominantly intertidal to supratidal, sabkha deposits. The grey-bed assemblage is present between the <b>red-bed</b> and western sandstone assemblages and consists of predominantly intertidal to shallow subtidal beds deposited in a lagoon. Sandstones occur in two locations; in the west {{they are part of}} a linear belt, and at the second location they are associated with a local paleogeographic feature, the Beatton High, located within the grey-bed assemblage north of Fort St. John, in northeast British Columbia. The western sandstones are deposits of a barrier-island complex, whereas the sandstones associated with the Beatton High are local tidal channel and fan-delta deposits sourced from the Beatton High. The west-to-east facies changes and north-northwest alignment of the facies define a western, sandy barrier-island complex behind which (to the east) was a lagoon with sabkha deposits at its eastern margin.

40|$|The <b>red-bed</b> site of Kokkinopilos is an emblematic and {{yet also}} most enigmatic open-air Palaeolithic site in Greece, {{stimulating}} controversy ever since its discovery in 1962. While early research raised claims for stratigraphically in situ artifacts, later scholars considered the material reworked and of low archaeological value, {{a theory that}} was soon to be challenged again by the discovery of in situ lithics, including handaxes. Here we present results of a latest and long-term research that includes geoarchaeological assessments, geomorphological mapping and luminescence dating. We show that the site preserves an overall undisturbed sedimentary sequence related to an ephemeral lake, marked by palaeosols and stratigraphic units with Palaeolithic material that is geologically in situ and hence datable. Our study resolves the issues {{that have been the}} source of controversy: the depositional environment, stratigraphic integrity, chronological placement and archaeological potential of the site. Moreover, the minimum ages obtained through luminescence dating demonstrate that the lithic component with bifacial specimens considerably pre-dates the last interglacial and therefore comprises the earliest stratigraphically defined and radiometrically-assessed archaeological material in Greece. Kokkinopilos has served as a reference site for the interpretation of all other <b>red-bed</b> sites in north-west Greece, therefore our results have significantly wider implications: by analogy to Kokkinopilos, the open-air sites of Epirus should not anymore be considered ‘by default’ as inscrutable palimpsests with limited archaeological potential; rather, these sites can be excavated and chronologically constrained. This realization opens up new prospects for future research in Epirus, an area that is the most prolific in Palaeolithic remains in Greece. <br/...|$|E
