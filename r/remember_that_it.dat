25|$|Many women {{write to}} tell me that {{although}} their husbands may not like me, they do. It appears from the mail that the women have the say on what the household is watching. And we do <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the women who do the buying of products that we advertise. Bearing that in mind we try and design our commercials for them.|$|E
25|$|What {{has been}} lost beneath the clouds of myths {{surrounding}} this situation {{is the reason why}} many clubs were cautious about wholeheartedly supporting the road-racing movement. <b>Remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was wartime and the younger membership of most clubs was away engaged in a war. The older members left at home did not wish to risk damaging a sport which all had enjoyed, so they decided {{to maintain the status quo}} until the war ended. The rank and file of the NCU/RTTC membership was not anti-BLRC - all it wanted to do was preserve the sport until the service men returned to civvy street.|$|E
25|$|If {{you recall}} my would-be Sherlock Holmesian {{assessment}} of Professor Moriarty's – sorry , Professor Illingworth's – plan {{to recapture the}} Ashes, you will <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is in Sydney, in the Fourth Test, that this cricketing chess player is due to strike and then retire {{to the corner of}} his web and seal off reprisals. Those who command the condition of Sydney Cricket Ground and its accessories gave him just the pitch he needed. By this time, I fancy, they were nauseated by negation and demanded a win at any price – even at the price of Australian defeat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you {{inquired about}} it?" [...] Elsie asked, <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was the man}} with the red {{mustache}} who had dropped the envelope.|$|R
60|$|<b>Remembering</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a {{woman who}} lost the world, we should accept the act of cackling geese in saving Rome as partial reparation.|$|R
60|$|I <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Saturday. Perhaps Mariposilla {{had gone}} to the old church for confession. Arturo had the pony, and for a moment I was in despair.|$|R
500|$|In {{the movie}} Apollo 13, Glynn Lunney was portrayed by Marc McClure. However, McClure had a {{relatively}} minor role. Writer Charles Murray lamented the fact that Lunney was [...] "barely visible in the movie", being overshadowed by the focus on Lunney's fellow flight director Gene Kranz. [...] "Without slighting Kranz's role", Murray commented, [...] "the world should <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Glynn Lunney ... who orchestrated a masterpiece of improvisation that moved the astronauts safely to the lunar module while sidestepping a dozen potential catastrophes that could have doomed them." ...|$|E
500|$|Bughouse chess is {{controversial}} among chess teachers. While some instructors find beneficial learning outcomes for bughouse, most {{do not consider}} it {{to have a positive}} effect, especially for novice chess players. According to Susan Polgar, [...] "If your children want to play bughouse for fun, it is OK. But just <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not chess and it has no positive value for chess. In fact, I absolutely recommend no bughouse during a tournament." [...] Arguments supporting a negative view of bughouse include that it distorts typical chess pattern recognition and that it too heavily emphasizes tactical play at the expense of positional strategy. It also shares criticisms with speed chess in general, potentially encouraging a habit of moving too fast or playing unsoundly with the expectation that one's opponent will be moving quickly.|$|E

2500|$|... 2011: Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton: Around 5,000 Metropolitan Police {{officers}} were deployed {{to police the}} wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011. In advance of the event, assistant commissioner Lynne Owens said: [...] "People who {{want to come to}} London to peacefully protest can do that but they must <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a day of national celebration". Approximately one hundred people were pre-emptively arrested in advance of the wedding and were detained without charge {{for the duration of the}} wedding, with the apparent aim of suppressing protest. Other protestors were arrested on the day of the wedding; some were detained at railway stations on arrival. The Metropolitan Police said that one million people were present in London to watch the wedding procession.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the musicians}} all {{performing}} free, the promotion has drawn some {{criticism in the}} press. Adam Sherwin wrote in The Independent: [...] "With its message, that the BBC 'owns' the entire musical waterfront and licence-fee payers {{would do well to}} <b>remember</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> is the kind of propaganda film an autocratic regime sensing that its legitimacy is crumbling might produce." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Alex Petridis observed [...] "There's clearly something a little self-aggrandising about the BBC getting a raft of stars to sing an unambiguous song of undying devotion apparently to the corporation itself. ... perhaps we should forgive them three minutes of self-congratulation, particularly when it’s raising money for charity." [...] The Daily Telegraph, however, reported that the project cost less than the 1997 version of [...] "Perfect Day" [...] which drew much of the same criticism but went on to raise over £2 million for charity.|$|E
2500|$|... "Barmy Army" [...] was a {{football}} chant sung by fans at many grounds, originally sung at Hillsborough by Sheffield Wednesday {{in the early}} 1980s. This was because Howard Wilkinson, Sergeant Wilko, was manager at the time, and Sergeant Bilko's Barmy Army (shown on British TV at the time) inspired the chant, [...] "Sergeant Wilko's Barmy Army". Older fans may actually <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was originally sung 6 years earlier when Jack Charlton took charge and said that Wednesday's fans must be barmy to travel to an away match. The chant therefore originated as 'Jackie Charlton's Barmy Army'. [...] The chant moved up to Leeds in 1988 when Wilkinson moved to Leeds United. [...] In conjunction with the increasing appearance of English football shirts at cricket grounds in the early 1990s, the song's repetitive cry of [...] "Barmy Army, Barmy Army, Barmy Army" [...] transferred to domestic cricket arenas at Old Trafford and Headingley. It was particularly apparent during the 1993 Ashes tour.|$|E

2500|$|The Kanins {{rented a}} house in Malibu for their honeymoon, and after buying an A. J. Liebling New Yorker short story about a {{boarding}} house for boxers, they spent [...] {{the next six months}} writing the adaptation, Sunday Punch (1942). They knew they were on the track to a partnership when MGM bought the screenplay. [...] "We would make a story outline together with rather detailed descriptions of the scenes. Then we divided up the writing, each taking the scenes we felt strongly about. Then [...] {{one or the other of}} us would put it all together into a single draft. We did find a common voice, though we had different strengths. As an artist, Michael brought a great visual sense to the process. I was a people person who loved the characters and the dialogue. Through the collaboration, we learned a lot from each other and about each other. But the time came when I felt as if we were together 48 hours a day. Writing with someone else always requires some degree of compromise, as does marriage. When it came down to the question of which would survive, the marriage or the writing partnership, it was a pretty easy decision. But I [...] <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a challenge convincing the powers that be that we had been successful writers individually and would be again. We were hyphenated in people's minds: Fay-and-Michael Kanin. To again become Fay Kanin and Michael Kanin took some doing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed it will: her fortune now is considerable;--a deuced pretty thing, <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> {{all ready}} money, {{and that she}} can touch it the moment she's of age. She's entirely off with Ballindine, isn't she?" ...|$|R
