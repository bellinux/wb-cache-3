50|$|The Beryciformes are a poorly-understood {{order of}} {{carnivorous}} ray-finned fishes consisting of 7 families, 30 genera, and 161 species. They feed on small fish and invertebrates. Beyond this, {{little is known}} about the biology of most member species because of their nocturnal habits and deepwater habitats. All beryciform species are marine and most live in tropical to temperate, deepwater environments. Most live on the continental shelf and continental slope, with some species being found as deep as 2000 m. Some species move closer to the surface at night, while others live entirely in shallow water and are nocturnal, hiding in rock crevices and caves during the day. Several species are mesopelagic and bathypelagic. Beryciformes' bodies are deep and mildly compressed, typically with large eyes that help them see in darker waters. Colors range from red to yellow and brown to black, and sizes range from 8 - 61 cm. Member genera include the alfonsinos, squirrelfishes, flashlight fishes, fangtooth fishes, spinyfins, pineconefishes, <b>redfishes,</b> roughies, and slimeheads. A number of member species are caught commercially, including the alfonsino, the splendid alfonsino, and the orange roughy, the latter being much more economically important. Some species have bioluminescent bacteria contained in pockets of skin or in light organs near the eyes, including the anomalopids and monocentrids.|$|E

40|$|Bortom trawl {{data from}} the depth {{interval}} 300 - 2050 m on the slope off Norway were analysed to study distribution of fish biomass and the associated species assemblages. It is hypothesised that the pronounced hydrographic front between the warm Atlantic Waterrnass and the cold Norwegian Sea Deep-water, combined with a declining food supply with depth and distance from the shelf, structure the assemblages on the continental slope of the eastem Nmwegian Sea. From a high level at the shelf edge and upper slope, the fish biomass declined abruptly at about 720 m when crossing the 0 "C-isotherm associated with the hydrographic front. Beneath the frontal zone, the fish biornass was only 11 % of that above it and decreased further with increasing depth. In upper slope waters, the fish biornass increased with increasing latitude. Arctic species such as Lycodes frigidus and Paraliparis bathybius were dominant in the deep cold slope waters. The high fish biomass associated with the steep temperature gradient at 600 - 720 m was rnainly attributable to a few large and/or abundant boreo-arctic species, i. e.

The survey was conducted as a traditional bottom trawl survey with main focus on Greenland halibut, but also analyses were carried out for cod, redfish and long rough dab. The main results in 2003 were: - Ice conditions in 2003 were the worst in the survey history and this caused significant limitation of surveyed area. - Water temperature on the investigated area at surface was less than in 2002, and near bottom slightly lower in the eastern part and higher in the northern area. - Due to heavy ice conditions it had been impossible to conduct observations in the important areas where dense concentrations of young Greenland halibut had been found in previous years. - It leads to a decline in the abundance indices of all Greenland halibut length groups in comparison with estimates obtained in 2002. - Abundance index for cod in 2003 was four times less than in 2002 and interpreted as the second smallest in the time series, only the result from 1998 was lower.

40|$|Two {{species of}} <b>redfish</b> of {{commercial}} interest occur off West Greenland inshore and offshore, golden <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes marinus L.) and deep-sea <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella Travin). SSB and recruitment indices for golden <b>redfish</b> decreased drastically from 1982 and have remained significantly below the average level since 1989. Taking {{into account the}} recent very low SSB and the recruitment failure together with the absence of golden <b>redfish</b> in the Greenland surveys, the stock of golden <b>redfish</b> in Subarea 1 {{is considered to be}} severely depleted with no signs of recovery.

40|$|Three {{species of}} redfish (Sebastes) {{share a common}} pattern of {{mitochondrial}} DNA tandem repeat polymorphism and heteroplasmy in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. All three species exhibit 9 – 17 copies of an approximately 275 base pair (bp) tandem repeat situated within the 39 domain of the control region. Sequence analysis of cloned mtDNA from S. mentella revealed that the tandem array is adjacent to the tRNAphe gene, and that the repeat shares 53 % identity with the tRNAphe gene {{and part of the}} 12 S rRNA gene. These features, as well as potential secondary structure assumed by the repeat, are consistent with previously proposed models explaining tandem duplications in the 39 end of the control region. In a sample comprising 36 S. fasciatus, 52 S. mentella, and 13 S. marinus taken near Newfoundland, neither the mean number of repeats per fish (12. 2 – 12. 7) nor the frequency of heteroplasmy varied significantly among species. A total of 42 % of the <b>redfishes</b> were hetero-plasmic, bearing either two or three repeat variants (33 % and 9 %, respectively). The similarity of the frequency distributions of tandem repeat variants in the three species suggests either a common balance between mutation and selection in the three species, or mitochondrial gene flow between them. With a typical size of close to 16. 5 kilobas-es (kb), more than 90 % of which consists of coding sequences, the compactly orga-nized vertebrate mitochondrial genome is generally regarded as having been shaped by selection for efficiency of function and replication (Rand 1993). Nonetheless, nu-merous examples of larger genomes have been observed, particularly in fishes (re-viewed in Billington and Hebert 1991) and other poikilotherms.

40|$|In this work, I {{investigated}} genetic {{complexity in}} four commercially exploited species from the North Atlantic: saithe (Pollachius virens L.), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and beaked and golden redfish (Sebastes mentella and S. norvegicus). The results were used 1) {{to assess the}} consistency between current management units and units identified by results based on genetic data for each species, and 2) to assess the efficiency of SNP data compared to conventional markers in studying population genomics. Panels of nuclear genomic markers, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites, derived from modern genomic approaches, and data on species life history traits, were analyzed to explore genetic complexity within these highly migratory and continuously distributed species. The investigation reveals biologically distinct populations within each of these species. Four genetic clusters of saithe and two clusters of Greenland halibut {{were found in the}} North Atlantic. For beaked redfish, results using both the genome-wide SNP and microsatellite data supported one group (‘shallow’) throughout the North Atlantic and a second group (‘deep’) in the central North Atlantic and Canadian waters. A localized group (‘slope’) of beaked redfish was identified in Greenland and Icelandic waters. Microsatellite DNA supported three unrecognized cryptic species of golden redfish in Greenland and nearby waters. Genetic isolation in golden and beaked redfish was greater than in saithe and Greenland halibut, which is possibly associated with unique life history features of <b>redfishes.</b> The results indicate a correlation between genetic differentiation and life history differences in the studied species. These findings imply that distinct genetic heterogeneity can exist in different marine species and may be influenced by different biotic and abiotic factors. The results highlight that in most cases the current management units of these species are comprised of multiple biological populations. The new definition of gene pools may serve to define biologically meaningful management units to ensure their sustainable exploitation and preserve evolutionary legacies. This study provides the first SNP-based population genomic investigation in saithe, Greenland halibut and beaked redfish. Comparative analyses of SNP and conventional marker systems demonstrate a higher resolution for SNP markers. Results from genome-wide SNP data identified the three genetic groups of beaked redfish from a much smaller sample set, and the estimated genetic differentiation was much greater than that found by other marker. Both in beaked redfish and Greenland halibut a sub-set of outlier SNPs were identified, implying possible signals of selection in these loci or nearby genomic sites. These outliers may provide increased power in population assignment of the species. The present work illustrates outstanding opportunities of SNP marker system for investigating population genomics of non-model organisms...|$|E

The <b>redfish</b> habitat corresponds in a temperature–salinity (TS) diagram to a mixing triangle between East Greenland Current Water (EGCW), Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and Irminger Current Water (ICW). The geographical centre of mass of the <b>redfish</b> distribution (as revealed by acoustic fish density) indicates displacements from year to year. Changes in hydrographic conditions were investigated in detail for possible reasons for these displacements. Empirical Orthogonal Analysis reveals that maximum variations of water mass volume on an interannual time-scale in the study region correspond to ICW and LSW changes, while EGCW remains comparatively stable. Indices of <b>redfish</b> geographical centroid, LSW volume, ICW temperature and Subpolar Gyre (SPG) intensity suggest that the geographical <b>redfish</b> displacements are closely related to interannual changes of ICW modulated by the SPG intensity with a lag of 1 or 2 years.
