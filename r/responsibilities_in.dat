40|$|The {{newly created}} {{position}} of assistant superintendent {{of education in}} the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador was the focus of this study. The objective was to define the role of the assistant superintendent in Newfoundland and Labrador. [...] There were 53 assistant superintendents employed in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and all of these were included in the study. A questionnaire was devised and piloted containing 105 possible tasks which could be performed by an assistant superintendent. Each assistant superintendent was asked to rank each task as a major responsibility, a medium responsibility, a minor responsibility, or a non-responsibility. All assistant superintendents replied to the questionnaire. [...] Profiles of the assistant superintendents were drawn for small school districts, and medium and large school districts. Small school districts employ one assistant superintendent, whereas medium and large school districts employ two, three or four assistant superintendents. [...] One profile was drawn for small school districts, and three profiles were drawn for medium and large school districts. These were: assistant superintendent responsible for curriculum and instruction, assistant superintendent responsible for personnel administration, and assistant superintendent responsible for the general administration of a unit in the district. [...] The major findings of this study were: [...] 1. The assistant superintendent in small school districts has major <b>responsibility</b> <b>in</b> the areas of curriculum and instruction and personnel administration, minor <b>responsibility</b> <b>in</b> the areas of pupil services and school-community relations, and no responsibility for business administration. [...] 2. The assistant superintendent responsible for curriculum and instruction has major <b>responsibility</b> <b>in</b> the area of curriculum and instruction, with minor <b>responsibility</b> <b>in</b> the areas of personnel administration, school-community relations, and pupil services; and no <b>responsibility</b> <b>in</b> the area of business administration. [...] 3. The assistant superintendent responsible for personnel administration has major <b>responsibility</b> <b>in</b> the area of personnel administration, medium <b>responsibility</b> <b>in</b> the area of curriculum and instruction, and minor <b>responsibility</b> <b>in</b> the areas of pupil services, school-community relations, business administration.

Schmid also brought Guatemalan forward Carlos Ruiz to the team; Ruiz won league Most Valuable Player(MVP) award that year. Amidst criticism for failing to win in previous years, the franchise won its first MLS Cup with a 1–0 overtime victory against New England.

5|$|The {{loss of his}} son was a major blow to Tiberius, {{personally}} and politically.

5|$|At {{some point}} in 1940 or early 1941, Treloar {{requested}} that he be appointed to command the War Records Section, which formed part of the Second Australian Imperial Force's administrative headquarters. The Cabinet agreed to this during February 1941. Treloar's <b>responsibilities</b> <b>in</b> this role were to coordinate and control the collection of material {{to be included in}} the AWM as well as to supervise the official war artists and photographers; these duties were similar to those he and Bean had undertaken during World War I. While Treloar was appointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel, he primarily worked for the AWM, which reimbursed the Army for his salary and allowances. This arrangement gave Treloar less influence with the Army than he had enjoyed as head of the AWRS during World War I. General Thomas Blamey, the commander of the AIF, subsequently redesignated the War Records Section the Military History and Information Section (MHIS) on the grounds that its original name had not adequately described the unit's role. In contrast to the DOI's propaganda activities, the MHIS focused on collecting records, images and items that would be useful to historians.|$|E
5|$|At the Magic Box, Giles {{recognizes that}} he must stand aside if Buffy is to face her <b>responsibilities</b> <b>in</b> caring for Dawn instead of relying on him ("Standing") and Tara finds {{a picture of the}} {{forget-me-not}} flower Willow used to cast a spell on her in a book of magic. Giles and Tara separately resolve to leave the people they love, respectively Buffy and Willow — Giles wants to leave Buffy for her own good, while Tara wants to leave Willow because she has become horrified by Willow’s magical manipulation of their relationship ("Under Your Spell / Standing—Reprise"). Captured by Spike outside the store, one of Sweet’s minions conveys a challenge from Sweet for Buffy to rescue Dawn from The Bronze. Giles forbids the gang to assist Buffy, so she goes alone, despite having no will to do so; eventually Giles and the Scoobies change their minds and leave to catch up. Although Spike initially thinks that things would be better for him if Buffy was dead, he also changes his mind and decides to help Buffy; Sweet opines that Buffy is drawn to danger ("Walk Through the Fire").|$|E

5|$|Gregory faced {{opposition}} to his reign in Nyssa, and, in 373 Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium had {{to visit the}} city to quell discontent. In 375 Desmothenes of Pontus convened a synod at Ancyra to try Gregory on charges of embezzlement of church funds and irregular ordination of bishops. He was arrested by imperial troops {{in the winter of}} the same year, but escaped to an unknown location. The synod of Nyssa, which was convened in the spring of 376, deposed him. However, Gregory regained his see in 378, perhaps due to an amnesty promulgated by the new emperor Gratian. In the same year Basil died, and despite the relative unimportance of Nyssa, Gregory took over many of his brother's former <b>responsibilities</b> <b>in</b> Pontus.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, the bailliage (bailiwick) of Metz elected Custine to the Estates-General; {{upon his}} election, he {{resigned}} his military commission, judging that his <b>responsibilities</b> <b>in</b> {{the national assembly}} required his full attention. In July 1789, as the French Revolution gained momentum, he remained in the National Constituent Assembly. There, he supported {{the creation of a}} constitution espousing the principles of representative government and often voted with such liberal (constitutional) nobility as the Marquis de Lafayette. Although he supported the abolition of some seigniorial rights, he strongly defended royal prerogative and the rights of the nobility who fled during the Great Fear, especially their rights of property. He offered limited support of the nineteen decrees that abolished game-laws, seigniorial courts, the purchase and sale of posts in the magistracy, pecuniary immunities, favoritism in taxation, surplice money, first-fruits, pluralities, and unmerited pensions.|$|E

On July 27, pressured by Franciszka z Krasińskich, he declared he would from then on strictly adhere to orders from the Confederacy that he had previously habitually disregarded. In October his <b>responsibilities</b> <b>in</b> the War Council were increased, and the same month he became involved with the plan to kidnap King Poniatowski. Pulaski was initially opposed to this plan but later supported it {{on the condition that}} the king would not be harmed. The attempt failed, weakening the international reputation of the Confederates, and when Pulaski's involvement with the attempted kidnapping became known, the Austrians expelled him from their territories. He spent the following winter and spring in Częstochowa, during which time several of his followers were defeated, captured or killed.|$|E

5|$|Smith was a benefactor {{during the}} period of reconstruction. He became {{frustrated}} that, during a time when the Hospital was so clearly in need of financial assistance, the trustees of his Irish munificence were choosing to procrastinate in their remittances of the annual grant. By the mid-1670s he had determined to use the powers granted to him {{under the terms of the}} Royal Charter in order to divert surplus funds from the Trust to the Hospital, and by 1681 relations between Smith and the trustees were so strained that both the governments in London and in Dublin were involved in attempts to determine who had responsibility both for the administration and collection of income and for the distribution thereof. One such involved person was Sir John Temple, the Solicitor-General for Ireland, who asserted that anomalies between the stipulations of 1667 and the Charter of 1669 showed that the revenue should stay in Ireland, and also that there was in fact no surplus available in any event because the Trust had not at that time met with all of its <b>responsibilities</b> <b>in</b> Ireland under the terms of the Charter.|$|E

5|$|The rise {{of provincial}} {{men to the}} senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social {{mobility}} {{in the first three}} centuries of the Empire. Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and unlike later European nobility, a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands. Admission to the higher ordines brought distinction and privileges, but also a number of <b>responsibilities.</b> <b>In</b> antiquity, a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works, events, and services (munera), rather than on tax revenues, which primarily supported the military. Maintaining one's rank required massive personal expenditures. Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire, as the ranks of the town councils became depleted, those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged by the central government to give up their seats and return to their hometowns, in an effort to sustain civic life.|$|E

5|$|Hammond {{was posted}} to a {{training}} {{wing of the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) at Hastings in Sussex before he moved with his unit to Torquay. He had mainly administrative duties, including instructing recruits, for whom he made life hard. He played some games of cricket in 1940 for various teams before being posted to Cairo in December. His <b>responsibilities</b> <b>in</b> Egypt included organising, promoting and playing in cricket matches. Posted there until 1943, {{he was promoted to}} flight lieutenant and then to squadron leader. While Hammond may have helped to raise morale, Cairo was an easy posting during the war and he was not involved directly in combat. He also spent much time in South Africa, where he played cricket and was reunited with Sybil Ness-Harvey. At the beginning of 1944, Hammond was posted back to England, where he lectured and drilled cadets. Playing as captain in many one-day cricket matches, he was praised by Wisden for encouraging exciting contests. Others applauded his batting, including his hitting of many sixes, fitting the games' relaxed atmosphere. In December 1944, Hammond, suffering from fibrositis, was discharged from the RAFVR on health grounds and returned to work at Marsham Tyres. Once the war ended in Europe in May 1945, several first-class matches were organised. Hammond played in six, scoring 592 runs at an average of 59.20 with two centuries. In a match for an England team against the Dominions at Lord's, he made a century in each innings, becoming the first man to do this seven times.|$|E
