Results: Twelve studies were identified, including three cohort studies and nine cross-sectional studies. The subgroup analyses revealed that the sub-overall incidence estimates were 3. 5 % (95 % CI, 1. 7 %– 5. 3 %) and 6. 7 % (95 % CI, 4. 8 %– 8. 6 %) for cohort and cross-sectional studies, respectively (difference between the sub-overalls, Q = 5. 54, p = 0. 02); and 8. 3 % (95 % CI, 6. 9 %– 9. 7 %) and 4. 6 % (95 % CI, 2. 4 %– 6. 9 %) for studies in Chongqing and other areas, respectively (difference between the sub-overalls, Q = 7. 58, p, 0. 01).

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate fractures among people with schizophrenia compared to people without mental illness. Method We systematically searched major electronic databases from inception till 10 / 2014. Articles were included that reported the number of fractures in people with schizophrenia and a control group. Two independent authors conducted searches, completed methodological assessment and extracted data. Data was narratively synthesised and a <b>random</b> effects <b>incidence</b> rate ratio (IRR) meta-analysis was performed. Results Eight studies were included encompassing 48, 384 people with schizophrenia (49. 9 - 75. 2 years, 41 - 100 % female) and 3, 945, 783 controls. The pooled adjusted rate of fractures per 1000 person years was 5. 54 (95 % CI 4. 92 - 5. 57) in people with schizophrenia and 3. 48 (95 % CI 3. 39 - 3. 64) in control participants. The comparative meta-analysis showed that people with schizophrenia experience rate of fractures compared to control participants (IRR 1. 72, 95 % CI = 1. 24 to 2. 39, I 2 = 49 %; n= 168, 914). There was insufficient data to conduct a robust moderator analysis, but the narrative review consistently highlighted antipsychotic medication was an important risk factor for fractures. Conclusion People with schizophrenia are at significantly increased risk of fractures.

Here, we assigned paternity to quantify effective pollen dispersal over 9 years of mating, contrasted this to seed dispersal and examined their effects on fine-scale spatial genetic structure, within the bird-pollinated shrub Banksia hookeriana (Proteaceae). We used 163 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to assess genetic structure and pollen dispersal in a spatially discrete population of 112 plants covering 0. 56 ha. Spatial autocorrelation analysis detected spatial genetic structure in the smallest distance class of 0 - 5 m (r= 0. 025), with no significant structure beyond 8 m. Experimentally quantified seed-dispersal distances for 337 seedlings showed a leptokurtic distribution around a median of 5 m, reaching a distance of 36 m. In marked contrast, patterns of pollen dispersal for 274 seeds departed strikingly from typical near-neighbour pollination, with a distribution largely corresponding to the spatial distribution of plants.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{treatment}} of hepatitis C (HCV) infections has significantly {{changed in the}} past few years due to the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). DAAs could improve the sustained virological response compared to pegylated interferon with ribavirin (PR). However, there has been no evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compare the efficacy among the different regimens of DAAs. AIM: Therefore, we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis aiming to compare the treatment efficacy between different DAA regimens for treatment naïve HCV genotype 1. METHODS: Medline and Scopus were searched up to 25 th May 2015. RCTs investigating the efficacy of second generation DAA regimens for treatment naïve HCV genotype 1 were eligible for the review. Due to the lower efficacy and more side effects of first generation DAAs, this review included only second generation DAAs approved by the US or EU Food and Drug Administration, that comprised of simeprevir (SMV), sofosbuvir (SOF), daclatasvir (DCV), ledipasvir (LDV), and paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir plus dasabuvir (PrOD). Primary outcomes were sustained virological response at weeks 12 (SVR 12) and 24 (SVR 24) after the end of treatment and adverse drug events (i. e. serious adverse events, anemia, and fatigue). Efficacy of all treatment regimens were compared by applying a multivariate <b>random</b> effect meta-analysis. <b>Incidence</b> rates of SVR 12 and SVR 24, and adverse drug events of each treatment regimen were pooled using 'pmeta' command in STATA program. RESULTS: Overall, 869 studies were reviewed and 16 studies were eligible for this study. Compared with the PR regimen, SOF plus PR, SMV plus PR, and DVC plus PR regimens yielded significantly higher probability of having SVR 24 with pooled risk ratios (RR) of 1. 98 (95 % CI 1. 24, 3. 14), 1. 46 (95 % CI: 1. 22, 1. 75), and 1. 68 (95 % CI: 1. 14, 2. 46), respectively. Pooled incidence rates of SVR 12 and SVR 24 in all treatment regimens without PR, i. e. SOF plus LDV with/without ribavirin, SOF plus SMV with/without ribavirin, SOF plus DCV with/without ribavirin, and PrOD with/without ribavirin, (pooled incidence of SVR 12 ranging from 93 % to 100 %, and pooled incidence of SVR 24 ranging from 89 % to 96 %) were much higher than the pooled incidence rates of SVR 12 (51 %) and SVR 24 (48 %) in PR alone. In comparing SOF plus LDV with ribavirin and SOF plus LDV without ribavirin, the chance of having SVR 12 was not significantly different between these two regimens, with the pooled RR of 0. 99 (95 % CI: 0. 97, 1. 01). Regarding adverse drug events, risk of serious adverse drug events, anemia and fatigue were relatively higher in treatment regimens with PR than the treatment regimens without PR. The main limitation of our study is that a subgroup analysis according to dosages and duration of treatment could not be performed. Therefore, the dose and duration of recommended treatment have been suggested in range and not in definite value. CONCLUSIONS: Both DAA plus PR and dual DAA regimens should be included in the first line drug for treatment naïve HCV genotype 1 because of the significant clinical benefits over PR alone. However, due to high drug costs, an economic evaluation should be conducted in order to assess the value of the investment when making coverage decisions...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of hepatitis C (HCV) infections has significantly {{changed in the}} past few years due to the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). DAAs could improve the sustained virological response compared to pegylated interferon with ribavirin (PR). However, there has been no evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compare the efficacy among the different regimens of DAAs. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis aiming to compare the treatment efficacy between different DAA regimens for treatment naïve HCV genotype 1. Medline and Scopus were searched up to 25 th May 2015. RCTs investigating the efficacy of second generation DAA regimens for treatment naïve HCV genotype 1 were eligible for the review. Due to the lower efficacy and more side effects of first generation DAAs, this review included only second generation DAAs approved by the US or EU Food and Drug Administration, that comprised of simeprevir (SMV), sofosbuvir (SOF), daclatasvir (DCV), ledipasvir (LDV), and paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir plus dasabuvir (PrOD). Primary outcomes were sustained virological response at weeks 12 (SVR 12) and 24 (SVR 24) after the end of treatment and adverse drug events (i. e. serious adverse events, anemia, and fatigue). Efficacy of all treatment regimens were compared by applying a multivariate <b>random</b> effect meta-analysis. <b>Incidence</b> rates of SVR 12 and SVR 24, and adverse drug events of each treatment regimen were pooled using 'pmeta' command in STATA program. Overall, 869 studies were reviewed and 16 studies were eligible for this study. Compared with the PR regimen, SOF plus PR, SMV plus PR, and DVC plus PR regimens yielded significantly higher probability of having SVR 24 with pooled risk ratios (RR) of 1. 98 (95 % CI 1. 24, 3. 14), 1. 46 (95 % CI: 1. 22, 1. 75), and 1. 68 (95 % CI: 1. 14, 2. 46), respectively. Pooled incidence rates of SVR 12 and SVR 24 in all treatment regimens without PR, i. e. SOF plus LDV with/without ribavirin, SOF plus SMV with/without ribavirin, SOF plus DCV with/without ribavirin, and PrOD with/without ribavirin, (pooled incidence of SVR 12 ranging from 93 % to 100 %, and pooled incidence of SVR 24 ranging from 89 % to 96 %) were much higher than the pooled incidence rates of SVR 12 (51 %) and SVR 24 (48 %) in PR alone. In comparing SOF plus LDV with ribavirin and SOF plus LDV without ribavirin, the chance of having SVR 12 was not significantly different between these two regimens, with the pooled RR of 0. 99 (95 % CI: 0. 97, 1. 01). Regarding adverse drug events, risk of serious adverse drug events, anemia and fatigue were relatively higher in treatment regimens with PR than the treatment regimens without PR. The main limitation of our study is that a subgroup analysis according to dosages and duration of treatment could not be performed. Therefore, the dose and duration of recommended treatment have been suggested in range and not in definite value. Both DAA plus PR and dual DAA regimens should be included in the first line drug for treatment naïve HCV genotype 1 because of the significant clinical benefits over PR alone. However, due to high drug costs, an economic evaluation should be conducted in order to assess the value of the investment when making coverage decisions...|$|R
40|$|There is no {{consensus}} on whether a publicly funded medical savings account (MSA) program can generate net savings for government. We develop an analytical framework and demonstrate that the savings/cost implications of such a program depend critically on six factors: the size distribution of health-care expenditures, the MSA incentive effect, health-care expenditure expectations and whether they are fixed or flexible, the <b>random</b> <b>incidence</b> of illness, and optimally differentiated MSA allowances. Using the 1999 size distribution of health-care expenditures for the 45 ­ 64 year-old Manitoba population, we show that MSA allowances save the government $ 42 per capita under the most favourable assumptions, but that, under more realistic assumptions, they are consistently more costly than medicare. ...|$|E
