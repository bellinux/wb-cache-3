40|$|Satellite viruses encode {{structural}} proteins {{required for}} the formation of infectious particles but depend on helper viruses for completing their replication cycles. Because of this unique property, satellite viruses that infect plants, arthropods, or mammals, as well as the more recently discovered satellite-like viruses that infect protists (virophages), have been grouped with other, so-called "sub-viral agents. " For the most part, satellite viruses are therefore not classified. We argue that possession of a coat-protein-encoding gene and the ability to form virions are the defining features of a bona fide virus. Accordingly, all satellite viruses and virophages should be consistently classified within appropriate taxa. We propose to create four new genera - Albetovirus, Aumaivirus, Papanivirus, and Virtovirus - for positive-sense single-stranded (+) <b>RNA</b> <b>satellite</b> viruses that infect plants and the family Sarthroviridae, including the genus Macronovirus, for (+) <b>RNA</b> <b>satellite</b> viruses that infect arthopods.

Two green house experiments were conducted in Gedong Meneng Bandar Lampung during June—November 2004.   The treatments of the the first experiment were arranged in a completely randomized design with five replications.   The treatments were hot pepper plant inoculated with CMV-satRNA, severe strain CMV-G, and control uninoculated plant.

40|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> variant-Q {{associated}} with cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) {{is a highly}} structured single-stranded RNA molecule of 336 nucleotides in length. <b>Satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> is an important subviral pathogen in agriculture because it modulates symptom expression in CMV-infected plants. In the agricultural industry, CMV is economically very important since it exhibits a broad host range comprising over 1200 plant species world-wide. Although <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> has no sequence homology with CMV genome, <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> replication is thought to occur entirely in the cytoplasm and is exclusively dependent upon CMV replicase. Chapter 1 of this dissertation describes an Agrobacterium-mediated transient gene expression system that allows the expression of individual viral and <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> uncoupled from the virus replication in vivo, and by utilizing this system we demonstrate that CMV coat protein expressed independently of replication can enhance the accumulation of an individual CMV RNA. Virions formed by the CMV coat protein {{in the absence of}} virus replication encapsidates some host <b>RNAs,</b> and the <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> can accumulate to a detectable level {{in the absence of the}} helper CMV. Chapter 2 describes a novel finding that satRNA expressed in the absence of its helper CMV is amplified by the host. By using immunostaining with antibody against double strand RNA, and confocal microscopy to identify the subcellular distribution of double stranded <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> in situ, we have found that in the absence of the helper virus, satRNA can amplify in the nucleus. Furthermore, sequence analysis of satRNA oligomers formed in the absence of CMV replication showed that the junction between two monomeric forms have a unique heptanucleotide sequence GGGAAAA, which is not present in the junction of satRNA oligomers formed in the presence of CMV. Finally in chapter 3, by using agroinfiltration system, we demonstrate that the negative-sense strand of <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> is not amplified by the host cell because it is not recruited into the nucleus. However, consistent with the previously published results, the negative-sense <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> is replicated by the helper CMV but only to a low-level.

For most of these species, it is generally accepted that characteristics such as cell movement, replication, host specificity and pathogenicity are encoded in their RNA sequences and their resulting RNA structures. Although many sequences are indexed in publicly available databases, these sequence annotation databases do not provide the advanced searches and data manipulation capability for identifying and characterizing subviral RNA motifs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> usually reduces the yield of accumulated helper virus, although {{more so in}} solanaceous than in cucurbit hosts. The accumulation of viral RNA and viral-encoded proteins of two strains of CMV (Fny- and Sny-) known to differ {{in their ability to}} support <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> in zucchini squash was examined in squash and tobacco to determine the effect of <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> on the accumulation of viral-associated components. In the absence of <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA,</b> Fny- and Sny-CMV showed similar levels of accumulation of RNA at 7 days postinoculation (p. i.), but by 14 days p. i, the Fny-CMV RNAs accumulated to lower levels than did both strains at 7 days p. i., in either host. The levels of accumulated Sny-CMV-encoded proteins were higher than those encoded by Fny-CMV in tobacco, but not squash plants, at 7 days p. i. At 14 days p. i., for Fny-CMV vs Sny-CMV, there were differences in the levels of accumulation of most CMV-encoded proteins in both hosts, more exacerbated in tobacco vs squash. The effect of <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> was to intensify these differences; that is, by 7 days p. i., <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> reduced the accumulation of Fny-CMV RNAs 1 and 2 and their encoded proteins in both tobacco and squash but had little or no effect on the accumulation of Sny-CMV RNAs or encoded proteins. By 14 days p. i., the levels of accumulation of all Fny-CMV RNAs and encoded proteins were severely reduced in both hosts, and the levels of accumulation of Sny-CMV RNAs 1 and 2 and their encoded proteins were also reduced in tobacco, but not squash, Sny-CMV did not support <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> accumulation in squash plants or protoplasts. <b>Satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> did not appear to have a direct effect on the movement of either CMV strain.

The ORF 3 protein enters the cell nucleus targeting the nucleolus.

Two subviral <b>RNAs,</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> C (satC) and defective interfering RNA G (diG) intensify the symptoms of their helper, turnip crinkle virus (TCV). However, when the coat protein (CP) of TCV was replaced with that of the related Cardamine chlorotic fleck virus (CCFV), both subviral RNAs attenuated symptoms of the hybrid virus TCV-CPCCFV. In contrast, when the translation initiation codon of the TCV CP was altered to ACG and reduced levels of CP were synthesized, satC attenuated symptoms while diG neither intensified nor attenuated symptoms. The determi-nants for this differential symptom modulation were previously localized to the 3 *-terminal 100 bases of the subviral RNAs, which contain six positional differences (Q. Kong, J. -W.

This author addressed GFLV biology by studying the least understood aspect of GFLV: its <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA.</b> This author sequenced a new GFLV <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> variant and compared it with other <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> sequences. Forensic tracking of the <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> revealed that it originated from an ancestral nepovirus and was likely introduced from Europe into North America.

This author engineered GFLV into a biotechnology tool by cloning infectious GFLV genomic cDNAs into binary vectors, with or without further modifications, and using Agrobacterium tumefaciens delivery to infect Nicotiana benthamiana. Tagging GFLV with fluorescent proteins allowed tracking of the virus within N. benthamiana and Chenopodium quinoa tissues, and imbuing GFLV with partial plant gene sequences proved the concept that endogenous plant genes can be knocked down. Infectivity of the viral vector depended on {{the identity of the}} GFLV strains or reassortants, on coapplication of heterologous silencing suppressors and on lower ambient temperatures. No natural sources of resistance to GFLV exist within Vitis spp., but certain herbaceous hosts such as N. tabacum (tobacco) are resistant. This author used tobacco, its wild relatives, and hybrids between tobacco and wild relatives to evaluate the genomic and physiological basis of resistance. Resistance to GFLV in tobacco is governed by systemic recovery from virus infection that is additively inherited and likely multi-allelic. This research has opened new avenues to understand virus and plant evolution, and furnishes geneticists with a new tool to functionally characterize host genes. This dissertation also includes a history of pathogen-derived resistance with specific reference to plant virus resistance...|$|R
40|$|The genome of Xenopus laevis {{contains}} two large families of class III genes (oocyte 5 S <b>RNA</b> and <b>satellite</b> I DNA) that are repressed in somatic cells. Both gene families are actively transcribed in a soluble extract of X. laevis oocyte nuclei, using chromatin deficient in histone H 1 as a template. The addition of histone H 1, to this transcriptionally active chromatin, {{results in the}} dominant and selective repression of oocyte 5 S <b>RNA</b> genes and <b>satellite</b> I DNA. Somatic 5 S RNA genes remain active following histone H 1 addition. Changes in chromatin structure could have a dominant role in the regulation of class III gene expression during Xenopus embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn RNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} purified from tobacco {{infected with}} cucumber mosaic virus catalyses {{the synthesis of}} (−) and (+) strands of the viral <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA,</b> CARNA 5, but fails to replicate the <b>satellite</b> <b>RNA</b> of peanut stunt virus (PSV). The enzyme replicates the genomic RNAs of the three principal cucumoviruses CMV. PSV and tomato aspermy virus (TAV) with varying efficiencies. The specificity with which CMV RdRp replicates different sequence-unrelated RNA templates suggests that the site of their recognition requires secondary or higher level structural organization...|$|R
