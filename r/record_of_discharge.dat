40|$|Rome {{has been}} plagued by {{flooding}} since its foundation, and, in December 2008, the largest flood event over the past 20 years caused a fatality and more than (sic) 150 million in economic damage. Meteorological conditions associated with the December 2008 flooding are shown to be typical of flooding in the Tiber. The long <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> measurements of the Tiber River at the Ripetta station in downtown Rome was used to examine flood frequency for the Tiber, including assessment of the return interval of the December 2008 flood. Particular attention is given to examination of the stationarity assumption for flood peaks through change-point and trend analyses, quantile regression, and statistical modelling of the flood-peak distribution. Once anthropogenic changes linked to reservoir regulation of the Tiber River have been accounted for, the stationarity assumption holds and can be used for flood frequency analysis. We highlight the difficulties in detecting departures from the stationarity assumption due to climate change. In the current regime, the December 2008 flood event has a return period of the order of 10 20 years...|$|E
40|$|The {{northern}} {{sector of}} the Subbetic Domain in the Betic Cordillera is formed by an olistostrome unit known as the Chaotic Subbetic Complex (CSC). This megabreccia is basically made of Triassic (Keuper) clays and evaporites (gypsum, anhidrite and halite) as well as blocks of other lithologies (limestones, dolostones, sandstones, etc). Despite that low permeability has been traditionally assumed for these materials, water flow and storage through them is likely derived of their aquitard behavior, {{but also because of}} the highly permeable conduits generated by dissolution/karstification processes within the evaporite rocks. The geological complexity of the CSC materials determines their hydrogeological heterogeneity, with groundwater flow systems of different length and various scales from recharge areas to discharge zones. Three springs draining the CSC outcrops have been identified around an evaporitic karst plateau located between the Anzur River (to the North) and the Genil River (to the South), in the province of Cordoba (Spain). Data logger devices have been installed in two of them, located at the Anzur River (left margin), providing an hourly <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge,</b> electrical conductivity and water temperature. Water samples have been collected fortnightly for subsequent chemical analysis. After two years of record, the results obtained show that the response of the springs to rainfall events is completely different between them. One has a clearly karstic behavior, with a rapid response to recharge whereas the other one is more inertial, and variations in its waters occur in a yearly scale. This is an evidence of the aforementioned hydrogeological heterogeneity of the CSC. Universidad de Málaga. Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech...|$|E

40|$|The Lake C 2 {{watershed}} at Taconite Inlet (82 ∘ 50 'N; 78 ∘ 00 'W) was {{the site}} of a three year project (1990 - 92), to investigate hydrological processes in the context of contemporary climate. The watershed is 21 km 2 in area, and 9 percent glacierized. This study was done in conjunction with a larger research effort, aiming to reconstruct paleoclimate using laminated lake sediments. ^ A continuous <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge,</b> determined by stage-discharge relations, and short-interval sampling of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), permitted the production of hourly time series. In addition, two weather stations logged hourly temperature, humidity, wind and complete radiation data at 7 m and 520 m a. s. l. The upper station was located close to the median watershed elevation. ^ Mean daily air temperatures were rarely higher than 5 ∘C during the study periods, and the two weather stations revealed frequent temperature inversions. Precipitation events were small in magnitude (3 ̆c 13 mm d- 1), and primarily in the form of snowfall. Streamflow began June 9, 4 and 22 for the three years, respectively. Discharge followed a pronounced diurnal rhythm, especially during the brief nival flood. Maximum discharge was 4. 0 m 3 s- 1. SSC fluctuated in close correspondence with discharge, and the highest measured concentration was 555 mg L- 1. Each year, approximately 50 percent of the suspended sediment discharge (SSQ) occurred during only 10 percent of the field season. Daily SSQ was strongly associated with air temperature at the median watershed elevation (r = 0. 70, 0. 92; entire field seasons 1991, 1992). These results demonstrate that sediment transfer to Lake C 2 is a response to snowmelt. ^ Among meteorological variables measured at weather station Alert (ca. 225 km east), rawinsonde sounding temperatures at 600 m were most closely associated with daily SSQ into Lake C 2. Accordingly, an exponential equation, based on pooled 1990 and 1992 data, was used to predict daily watershed SSQ for the period of record (1951 - 89). The series of annual predicted sediment loads were found to be in excellent agreement with a normalized varve thickness series. This study indicates that laminated sediments in Lake C 2 contain a high-resolution record of regional summer temperature. ...|$|E
40|$|Floods are {{a global}} problem and are {{considered}} the most frequent natural disaster world-wide. Many {{studies show that the}} severity and frequency of floods have increased in recent years and underline the difficulty to separate the effects of natural climatic changes and human influences as land management practices, urbanization etc. Flood risk analysis and assessment is required to provide information on current or future flood hazard and risks in order to accomplish flood risk mitigation, to propose, evaluate and select measures to reduce it. Both components of risk can be mapped individually and are affected by multiple uncertainties as well as the joint estimate of flood risk. Major sources of uncertainty include statistical analysis of extremes events, definition of hydrological input, channel and floodplain topography representation, the choice of effective hydraulic roughness coefficients. The classical procedure to estimate flood discharge for a chosen probability of exceedance is to deal with a rainfallrunoff model associating to risk the same return period of original rainfall, in accordance with the iso-frequency criterion. Alternatively, a flood frequency analysis to a given <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> data is applied, but again the same probability is associated to flood discharges and respective risk. Moreover, since flood peaks and corresponding flood volumes are variables of the same phenomenon, they should be, directly, correlated and, consequently, multivariate statistical analyses must be applied. This study presents an innovative approach to obtain flood hazard maps where hydrological input (synthetic flood design event) to a 2 D hydraulic model has been defined by generating flood peak discharges and volumes from: a) a classical univariate approach, b) a bivariate statistical analysis, through the use of copulas. The univariate approach considers flood hydrographs generation by an indirect approach (rainfall-runoff transformation using input rainfall hydrographs derived from IDF curves) and a direct approach (statistical inference on measured flood peaks). In the bivariate approach synthetic hydrographs were generated by means two different approaches: an indirect one, where rainfall were generated by a stochastic bivariate rainfall generator to be entered a distributed conceptual rainfall-runoff model that consisted of a soil moisture routine and a flow routing routine; and a direct one, where stochastic generation of flood peaks and flow volumes have been obtained via copulas, which are capable to describe and model the correlation between these two variables. Finally, to highlight the advantages of the presented approach, probabilistic flood hazard maps (including uncertainty) derived by bivariate models are compared to maps from univariate analysis. The procedure is applied to a real case study located {{in the southern part of}} Sicily, Italy, where flood hazard and risk maps have been obtained and compared...|$|E
40|$|All water {{recharging}} a catchment {{begins as}} precipitation. Some of this water moves directly to rivers (runoff) {{and leaves the}} catchment {{within a few days}} or months, unless held back (stored) by dams. A large proportion of the water returns to the atmosphere via evaporation from surface water bodies or transpiration from plants. A much smaller portion migrates downwards to recharge aquifers where it can be stored for periods of between weeks to many thousands of years. These components form a part of the local hydrological cycle. To understand and manage water movement in the various parts of the hydrological cycle, extensive monitoring of rainfall, evapotranspiration, river flow, dam storage changes (both government and on-farm), groundwater levels, and water usage by all sectors is required. The collection of such an extensive data set requires the collaboration of many government departments, farmers and industries. In {{order to be able to}} allocate water on a timely ongoing basis, managers are guided by models that predict how much water will be available at various times throughout the catchment. These models depend on good quality data and accurate conceptualisation of the various hydrological processes within a catchment. Recent advances in instrumentation and software allow for far more detailed information to be collected and analysed than has been possible in the past. Data loggers are now easy to install in boreholes and this enables data collection on a time scale that can be used to analyse pulse events like storm recharge, or deep drainage recharge from irrigation. Advances in water chemistry techniques, particularly isotope chemistry, allow for better quantification of how waters from various sources are mixing and where they are going. All these data can now be stored and visualised in interactive 3 D geological models which provide a better environment to process, analyse and communicate the information. To demonstrate the integration of these advances, the National Water Commission, Namoi Catchment Management Authority, Cotton Catchment Communities CRC and the Cotton Research and Development Corporation have funded a collaborative project to show how detailed climate, river flow, recharge, irrigation usage, water chemistry, geological and geophysical data sets can be combined to improve our understanding of the processes surrounding the movement of water through a catchment. The project is being led by the Connected Waters Initiative at the University of New South Wales, collaborating with farmers and the NSW Department of Water and Energy. The large scale movement of water through a catchment is relatively well understood and can be readily modelled. Given enough time (many years), all catchments approach a long-term steady state where the water flows are balanced. What comes into the catchment is balanced by what moves out. Water levels in aquifers stabilize and there is little variation in storage. However, over the shorter term, significant changes occur that we need to understand. For example, when groundwater is abstracted for irrigation or other purposes, the water table elevation frequently falls. If the level is reduced in the vicinity of a river, then space is created in the aquifer for recharge to occur by draining downward through the bed of the river. The CSIRO, in their recent (December 2007 report on the Namoi, have indicated that as much as 99 GL/year could be recharged into the aquifers beneath the River Namoi by this process. Clearly, this means that the flow in the river will be reduced by a similar amount and that this water will not be available for downstream diversion or to support environmental uses such as flow to wetlands. The Maules Creek project being undertaken by the CWI team at UNSW aims to better characterize these important processes and to develop an integrated method for the investigation of surface and groundwater connectivity. A great deal of instrumentation has been installed in the Maules Creek catchment to help address some of these questions. Figure 1 shows installation of a multi-level chemical sampler that will be used to detect the movement of river water into the aquifer. Figures 2 and 3 show the construction of a specialized weir below the outlet of a pumping well so that an accurate <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> can be established. A major component of the project is to develop better visualization tools. The new data collected by the team is combined with historical and current government data and integrated into 3 D geological models. Preliminary 3 D geological models are shown in Figures 4 to 6. The first model (Fig. 4) shows the simplified 3 D geology with two layers, one for the alluvium and the other for the rock. In Figure 5, the alluvium has been removed to display the prehistoric river valleys at depth. In Figure 6, the water quality in the alluvium, indicated by the fluid electrical conductivity, is presented. These 3 D geological models will provide the framework for coupled surface and ground water flux models that will be generated as the third stage of the demonstration project. The presentation of the data in 3 D greatly facilitates the communication of otherwise complicated geological and hydrogeological concepts...|$|E
