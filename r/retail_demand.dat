40|$|Large {{shifts in}} {{domestic}} beef demand have had substantial {{impacts on the}} beef industry. Before the late 1970 s, growth in the U.

However, starting about 1980, domestic <b>retail</b> beef <b>demand</b> weakened and subsequently declined every year through 1998. The long-run decline in <b>retail</b> beef <b>demand</b> contributed {{to a reduction in}} cattle industry size, particularly in relation to competing meat sectors such as poultry and pork.

40|$|This paper models {{the price}} and income {{elasticity}} of retail finance in Australia using aggregate quarterly data and an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. We particularly focus {{on the impact of}} the global financial crisis (GFC) from 2007 onwards on <b>retail</b> finance <b>demand</b> and analyse four submarkets (period analysed in brackets) : owneroccupied housing loans (Sep 1985 -June 2010), term loans (for motor vehicles, household goods and debt consolidation, etc.) (Dec 1988 -Jun 2010), credit card loans (Mar 1990 -Jun 2010), and margin loans (Sep 2000 -Jun 2010). Other than the indicator lending rates and annual full-time earnings respectively used as proxies for {{the price and}} income effects, we specify a large number of other variables as demand factors, particularly reflecting the value of the asset for which <b>retail</b> finance <b>demand</b> is derived. These variously include the yield on indexed bonds as a proxy for inflation expectations, median housing prices, consumer sentiment indices as measures of consumer confidence, motor vehicle and retail trade sales, housing debt-to-housing assets as a measure of leverage, the proportion of protected margin lending, the available credit limit on credit cards, and the All Ordinaries Index. In the long run, we find significant price elasticities only for term loans and margin loans, and significant income elasticities of demand for housing loans, term loans and margin loans. We also find that the GFC only significantly affected the longrun demand for term loans and margin loans. In the short run, we find that the GFC has had a significant effect on the price elasticity of demand for term loans and margin loans. Expected inflation is also a key factor affecting <b>retail</b> finance <b>demand.</b> Overall, most of the submarkets in the analysis indicate that <b>retail</b> finance <b>demand</b> is certainly price inelastic but more income elastic than conventionally thought.

40|$|Problem statement: The aim of {{this study}} is to create a GIS {{application}} for retail facilities&# 13; planning in Saudi Arabia. Jeddah city has been selected as a case study representing a major&# 13; commercial city in Saudi Arabia. Approach: The crated application covers several retail planning&# 13; analysis issues. These issues are divided in to two major groups called the city scale retail planning and&# 13; the retail center market area. The former covers defining the location and the distribution of all retail&# 13; centers in Jeddah city and classifying retail centers based on size and area. Meanwhile, the latter&# 13; includes defining the spatial distribution of <b>retail</b> <b>demand</b> of selected centers and identifying the&# 13; primary catchment area of the selected retail centers. In order to build this application, a survey is&# 13; made for selected <b>retail</b> <b>demand</b> and GIS address geocoding function is used to convert the address&# 13; data of <b>retail</b> <b>demand</b> into points features. In addition, GIS network analysis is used in this application&# 13; to produce drive time based trade areas for the selected retail centers. Results: Retail centers were&# 13; classified in Jeddah city as three groups called small centers (has less than 100 shops), medium centers&# 13; (has 100 - 200 shops) and large centers (has more than 200 shops). Conclusion: Based on this&# 13; application, retail planner in Jeddah city can easily identify the pattern and trends of all retail centers in&# 13; Jeddah city. The created application can be used by retail planners in Jeddah city for evaluating retail&# 13; market and for identifying market segments that the retail centers are under-serving. </div...|$|E

40|$|Â© 2017 by the authors. It {{has been}} a {{challenging}} task to manage perishable food supply chains because of the perishable product's short lifetime, the possible spoilage of the product due to its deterioration nature, and the <b>retail</b> <b>demand</b> uncertainty. All of these factors {{can lead to a}} significant amount of shortage of food items and a substantial retail loss. The recent development of tracing and tracking technologies, which facilitate effective monitoring of the inventory level and product quality continuously, can greatly improve the performance of food supply chain and reduce spoilage waste. Motivated by this recent technological advancement, our research aims to investigate the joint decision of pricing strategy, shelf space allocation, and replenishment policy in a single-item food supply chain setting, where our goal is to maximize the retailer's total expected profit subject to stochastic <b>retail</b> <b>demand.</b> We prove the existence of optimality for the design of the perishable food supply chain. We then extend the single-item supply chain problem to a multi-item setting and propose an easy-to-implement searching algorithm to produce the optimal allocation of shelf space among these items for practical implementation. Finally, we provide numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the aim is}} {{to develop}} a {{population}} model based approach to optimize fruit harvesting strategies with regard to fruit quality and its derived economic value. This approach was applied to the case of tomato fruit harvesting under Vietnamese conditions. Fruit growth and development of tomato (cv. “Savior”) was monitored in terms of fruit size and color during both the Vietnamese winter and summer growing seasons. A kinetic tomato fruit growth model was applied to quantify biological fruit-to-fruit variation in terms of their physiological maturation. This model was successfully calibrated. Finally, the model was extended to translate the fruit-to-fruit variation at harvest into the economic value of the harvested crop. It can be concluded that a model based approach to the optimization of harvest date and harvest frequency with regard to economic value of the crop as such is feasible. This approach allows growers to optimize their harvesting strategy by harvesting the crop at more uniform maturity stages meeting the stringent <b>retail</b> <b>demands</b> for homogeneous high quality product. The total farm profit would still depend on the impact a change in harvesting strategy might have on related expenditures. This model based harvest optimisation approach can be easily transferred to other fruit and vegetable crops improving homogeneity of the postharvest product streams...|$|R
