5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were lost in this manner. The main reason for this was the high state of <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> RAF units during daylight. The command depended on radar and the Observer Corps warning them in advance, giving them {{plenty of time to}} get airborne. The successful strafing attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended on a combination of circumstances and chance which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Generals Alfred Keller and Adolf Galland had {{scheduled}} {{an inspection}} at Achmer {{for the afternoon}} of 7November1944.

40|$|PEKA {{physics is}} a School Based Assessment which plays an {{important}} role in the education system in Malaysia. The purpose of this study was to find out the perception, <b>readiness</b> level <b>of</b> physics teachers in implementing the PEKA from the aspect of knowledge and skills in the management and assessment of PEKA as well as problems faced by physics teachers in the implementation of PEKA. A total of 30 physics teachers from 10 secondary schools in Pontian were selected as the respondents. An instrument in the form of questionnaire was used to collect data. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics only. The study found that physics teachers showed a positive perception on the implementation of PEKA possessed a high level <b>of</b> <b>readiness</b> in term <b>of</b> knowledge and a moderate level <b>of</b> <b>readiness</b> in term <b>of</b> skills. Besides, the main problems faced by the physics teachers were inadequate apparatus and materials as well as difficult to get the references on reference about PEKA assessment. Hence, this study can help to enlighten teachers to raise the level <b>of</b> <b>readiness</b> in terms <b>of</b> knowledge and skills in implementing the PEKA at school through attending courses and workshops related to PEKA...|$|R

5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E

The JNA evacuated itself from Split by 4 January 1992, pursuant to agreements ending the Battle of the Barracks.|$|E

5|$|As AOC Training Command in 1954, Murdoch {{headed a}} program to {{determine}} aircraft purchases for the RAAF; his recommendations included the C-130 Hercules transport, {{considered one of the}} most important acquisitions in the Air Force's history. His term as CAS coincided with increased commitment to the Vietnam War, and he came into conflict with Australian Army commanders over the employment of helicopters in battle. He was also involved in assessing the <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the General Dynamics F-111C for RAAF service. Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1960 and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1966, Murdoch was the fourth in a series of CASs who had been cadets at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. He retired from the Air Force in December 1969, and died in 1984.|$|E

Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test the <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> a (pig) ham as it cures.

Davis was beginning to treat McClellan almost as a protégé, and his next assignment was to assess the logistical <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> various railroads in the United States, once again with an eye toward planning for the transcontinental railroad. In March 1855, McClellan was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment.|$|E

5|$|The Texian {{army was}} {{a force of}} 810 volunteers and staff at this point, but few had any {{military}} training and experience. Faced with past desertions, discipline flaws, and individual indecisiveness of volunteers in training, Houston knew they were {{not yet ready to}} engage the Mexican army. Compounding the situation were the civilian refugees dependent upon the army for their protection. The news of Fannin's capture, combined with his doubts about the <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the Texian army, led Houston to order a retreat on March 26. Some of the troops viewed the decision as cowardice with Sesma sitting just {{on the other side of}} the Colorado, and several hundred men deserted.|$|E

After completing his mission Cooke decided to investigate the state of <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> Spanish forces in Manila himself. He was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila, which would make a valuable prize.

5|$|In 1948, with {{demobilisation}} of Australia's wartime army complete, {{the decision}} was made to re-raise the part-time forces of the Militia, albeit with the new name of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), and on a reduced establishment of two infantry divisions, an armoured brigade and various corps-level support units. During this time the 3rd Division was re-raised and based around a nucleus of three infantry brigades—the 4th, 6th and 9th Brigades—it was once again based in central Victoria, although subunits were also based in South Australia and Tasmania. Once again the division's component units bore little resemblance to those that had fought with it during the two World Wars. Service in the post war CMF was initially on a voluntary basis and recruitment remained poor until 1951 when conscription was introduced once again in an effort to improve the <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the Australian military during the Korean War. The 3rd Division was not deployed during this time, however, and although national service was instituted, service in Korea was undertaken on a voluntary basis, and conscription was used only as a means to expand the CMF and provide a base upon which mobilisation could be achieved if it proved necessary.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1930s {{the number}} of active {{personnel}} remained low and out of necessity training opportunities were limited. After 1936, however, the Army attempted to improve the conditions of service for its members and to reinvigorate the training program, while individual units began to undertake their own recruiting campaigns. Nevertheless, {{it was not until}} 1938, as tensions grew in Europe and the prospect of war became more likely, that an attempt was made to expand the establishment of the Militia. At this time an effort was made to determine the <b>readiness</b> <b>of</b> the Militia to expand if mobilised. During the continuous training camps undertaken throughout 1938, each component unit was assessed with mixed results. The following year, 1939, saw further expansion {{and by the end of}} April of that year, the division's posted strength had grown to 9,589 personnel. As a part of this expansion, the divisional artillery was expanded by the re-raising of the batteries that had been disbanded in 1922.|$|E
