5|$|Vmax is {{only one}} of several {{important}} kinetic parameters. The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> is also important. This is given by the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic Km for a given substrate. Another useful constant is kcat, also called the turnover number, which is the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.|$|E
5|$|One might {{believe that}} sodium or {{potassium}} hydride {{would be the}} ideal base for deprotonating these precursor salts. The hydride should react irreversibly {{with the loss of}} hydrogen to give the desired carbene, with the inorganic by-products and excess hydride being removed by filtration. In practice this reaction is often too slow, requiring the addition of DMSO or t-BuOH. These reagents generate soluble catalysts, which increase the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> of this heterogeneous system, via the generation of tert-butoxide or dimsyl anion. However, these catalysts have proved ineffective for the preparation of non-imidazolium adducts as they tend to act as nucleophiles towards the precursor salts and in so doing are destroyed. The presence of hydroxide ions as an impurity in the metal hydride could also destroy non-aromatic salts.|$|E

5|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{this process}} {{is the amount of}} energy that is released through fusion, which is dependent on the binding energy that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. In addition, from carbon-burning onwards, energy loss via neutrino production becomes significant, leading to a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> than would otherwise take place. This continues until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 {{over the course of a}} few months. As iron and nickel have the highest binding energy per nucleon of all the elements, energy cannot be produced at the core by fusion, and a nickel-iron core grows. This core is under huge gravitational pressure. As there is no fusion to further raise the star's temperature to support it against collapse, it is supported only by degeneracy pressure of electrons. In this state, matter is so dense that further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states. However, this is forbidden for identical fermion particles, such as the electron – a phenomenon called the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E

25|$|Temperature: Usually {{conducting}} a reaction {{at a higher}} temperature delivers more energy into the system and increases the reaction rate by causing more collisions between particles, as explained by collision theory. However, the main reason that temperature increases the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> is that more of the colliding particles will have the necessary activation energy resulting in more successful collisions (when bonds are formed between reactants). The influence of temperature is described by the Arrhenius equation.|$|E
25|$|Temperature {{usually has}} a major effect on the rate of a {{chemical}} reaction. Molecules at a higher temperature have more thermal energy. Although collision frequency is greater at higher temperatures, this alone contributes {{only a very small}} proportion to the increase in <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction.</b> Much more important {{is the fact that the}} proportion of reactant molecules with sufficient energy to react (energy greater than activation energy: E>E'a) is significantly higher and is explained in detail by the MaxwellBoltzmann distribution of molecular energies.|$|E

25|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} is always positive. A negative sign is present {{to indicate that}} the reactant concentration is decreasing.)

The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> differs from the rate of increase of concentration of a product P by a constant factor (the reciprocal of its stoichiometric number) and for a reactant A by minus the reciprocal of the stoichiometric number. The stoichiometric numbers are included so that the defined rate is independent of which reactant or product species is chosen for measurement. For example, if a = 1 and b = 3 then B is consumed three times more rapidly than A, but v = -d/dt = -(1/3)d/dt is uniquely defined.|$|E

Gravitational transformation of Boltzmann constant and energy spacing between permitted quantum levels of molecules has been quantum mechanically proved. Gravitational transformation of thermodynamic state functions has been developed to explain quasiequilibrium existing between reactants and activated complex at different gravitational fields.

500|$|Enzyme assays are {{laboratory}} {{procedures that}} measure {{the rate of}} enzyme reactions. Because enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyse, enzyme assays usually follow changes in the concentration of either substrates or products to measure the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction.</b> There are many methods of measurement. Spectrophotometric assays observe change in the absorbance of light between products and reactants; radiometric assays involve the incorporation or release of radioactivity to measure the amount of product made over time.

Although radiometric assays require the removal and counting of samples (i.e., they are discontinuous assays) they are usually extremely sensitive and can measure very low levels of enzyme activity.
