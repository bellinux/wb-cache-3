5|$|Strombid {{gastropods}} {{were widely}} accepted as carnivores by several authors in the 19th century, {{a concept that}} persisted until {{the first half of}} the 20th century. This erroneous idea originated in the writings of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who classified strombids with other supposedly carnivorous snails. This idea was subsequently repeated by other authors, but were not supported by observation. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Lobatus gigas is a specialized herbivore, that feeds on macroalgae (including <b>red</b> <b>algae,</b> such as species of Gracilaria and Hypnea), seagrass and unicellular algae, intermittently also feeding on algal detritus. The green macroalgae Batophora oerstedii is one of its preferred foods.|$|E
5|$|Pigments are {{coloured}} chemicals (such as melanin) {{in animal}} tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a white coat in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), {{an example of}} seasonal camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, are unable to synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones. For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid pigments synthesized by plants. In {{the case of the}} flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic <b>red</b> <b>algae,</b> which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both carotenoids and (green) chlorophyll. Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as chlorophyll does not survive digestion.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{interest}} on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence; in particular, {{he was looking for}} confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths. FitzRoy's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20fathoms (37m), and taking into account numerous observations by others, Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30fathoms (55m). Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100m, still {{a small fraction of the}} depth of the ocean floor at 3000–5000m. Darwin recognised the importance of <b>red</b> <b>algae,</b> and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build the reefs. He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths, but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s. Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef. He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level. He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity. These ecological ideas are still current, and research on the details continues.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the oldest}} fossils {{identified}} as a <b>red</b> <b>alga</b> is also the oldest fossil eukaryote that belongs to a specific modern taxon.

Although {{classified}} as a <b>red</b> <b>alga,</b> C. merolae is blue-green: it makes little {{if any of the}} red pigment phycoerythrin, and hence only displays the second red-algal pigment, phycocyanin, and the green pigment chlorophyll.|$|R
25|$|Algae is {{also found}} in the Marine Park, and in {{particular}} Sargassum, the rare <b>red</b> <b>algae</b> (Rodriguezella), and the brown algae(Ecklonia radiata).|$|E
25|$|Rhodoplasts have {{a double}} {{membrane}} with an intermembrane space and phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes on the thylakoid membranes, preventing their thylakoids from stacking. Some contain pyrenoids. Rhodoplasts have chlorophyll a and phycobilins for photosynthetic pigments; the phycobilin phycoerytherin is responsible for giving many <b>red</b> <b>algae</b> their distinctive red color. However, since they also contain the blue-green chlorophyll a and other pigments, many are reddish to purple from the combination. The red phycoerytherin pigment is an adaptation to help <b>red</b> <b>algae</b> catch more sunlight in deep water—as such, some <b>red</b> <b>algae</b> that live in shallow water have less phycoerytherin in their rhodoplasts, and can appear more greenish. Rhodoplasts synthesize a form of starch called floridean starch, which collects into granules outside the rhodoplast, in the cytoplasm of the red alga.|$|E

50|$|Other organisms whose {{evolutionary}} history suggests secondary endosymbiosis of a <b>red</b> <b>alga</b> also use storage polymers similar to floridean starch, for example, dinoflagellates and cryptophytes. The presence of floridean starch-like storage in some apicomplexan parasites is {{one piece of}} evidence supporting a <b>red</b> <b>alga</b> ancestry for the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic organelle.|$|R

25|$|Multicellularity {{has evolved}} {{independently}} at least 25 times, including in some prokaryotes, like cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, actinomycetes, Magnetoglobus multicellularis or Methanosarcina. However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, fungi, brown algae, <b>red</b> <b>algae,</b> green algae, and plants. It evolved repeatedly for plants (Chloroplastida), {{once or twice}} for animals, once for brown algae, and perhaps several times for fungi, slime molds, and <b>red</b> <b>algae.</b> Multicellularity may have evolved from colonies of interdependent organisms, from cellularization, or from organisms in symbiotic relationships.|$|E
25|$|Though {{chloroplast}} DNA is {{not associated}} with true histones, in <b>red</b> <b>algae,</b> similar proteins that tightly pack each chloroplast DNA ring into a nucleoid have been found.|$|E
25|$|Glaucocystophytic algae contain muroplasts, {{which are}} similar to chloroplasts except {{that they have a}} {{peptidoglycan}} cell wall that {{is similar to that of}} prokaryotes. Rhodophytic algae contain rhodoplasts, which are red chloroplasts that allow the algae to photosynthesise to a depth of up to 268 m. The chloroplasts of plants differ from the rhodoplasts of <b>red</b> <b>algae</b> in their ability to synthesize starch, which is stored in the form of granules within the plastids. In <b>red</b> <b>algae,</b> floridean starch is synthesized and stored outside the plastids in the cytosol.|$|E

25|$|In {{primitive}} <b>red</b> <b>algae,</b> the chloroplast DNA nucleoids {{are clustered}} {{in the center}} of the chloroplast, while in green plants and green algae, the nucleoids are dispersed throughout the stroma.|$|E
25|$|Chlorophyll c {{is mainly}} found in {{secondary}} endosymbiotic chloroplasts that originated from a red alga, {{although it is}} not found in chloroplasts of <b>red</b> <b>algae</b> themselves. Chlorophyll c is also found in some green algae and cyanobacteria.|$|E
25|$|Mannans: They form microfibrils in {{the cell}} walls {{of a number of}} marine green algae {{including}} those from the genera, Codium, Dasycladus, and Acetabularia {{as well as in the}} walls of some <b>red</b> <b>algae,</b> like Porphyra and Bangia.|$|E

25|$|The {{gelling agent}} in agar is an {{unbranched}} polysaccharide {{obtained from the}} cell walls of some species of <b>red</b> <b>algae,</b> primarily from the genera Gelidium and Gracilaria. For commercial purposes, it is derived primarily from Gelidium amansii. In chemical terms, agar is a polymer made up of subunits of the sugar galactose.|$|E
25|$|Heterokont chloroplasts {{appear to}} derive from those of <b>red</b> <b>algae,</b> rather than {{directly}} from prokaryotes as occurred in plants. This suggests they had a more recent origin than many other algae. However, fossil evidence is scant, and only with {{the evolution of the}} diatoms themselves do the heterokonts make a serious impression on the fossil record.|$|E
25|$|Agar {{is derived}} from the {{polysaccharide}} agarose, which forms the supporting structure in the cell walls of certain species of algae, and which is released on boiling. These algae are known as agarophytes and belong to the Rhodophyta (<b>red</b> <b>algae)</b> phylum. Agar is actually the resulting mixture of two components: the linear polysaccharide agarose, and a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called agaropectin.|$|E

25|$|In populations {{found in}} Benthic ecosystems, amphipods play an {{essential}} role in controlling brown algae growth. The mesograzer behaviour of amphipods greatly contributes to the suppression of brown algal dominance in the absence of amphipod predators. Amphipods display a strong preference for brown algae in Benthic ecosystems, but due to removal of mesograzers by predators such as fish, brown algae is able to dominate these communities over green and <b>red</b> <b>algae</b> species.|$|E
25|$|Phycobilins are a {{third group}} of {{pigments}} found in cyanobacteria, and glaucophyte, red algal, and cryptophyte chloroplasts. Phycobilins {{come in all}} colors, though phycoerytherin {{is one of the}} pigments that makes many <b>red</b> <b>algae</b> red. Phycobilins often organize into relatively large protein complexes about 40 nanometers across called phycobilisomes. Like photosystem I and ATP synthase, phycobilisomes jut into the stroma, preventing thylakoid stacking in red algal chloroplasts. Cryptophyte chloroplasts and some cyanobacteria don't have their phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes, and keep them in their thylakoid space instead.|$|E
25|$|Importantly, diatom {{genomics}} brought {{much information}} about the extent and dynamics of the endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) process. Comparison of the T. pseudonana proteins with homologs in other organisms suggested that hundreds have their closest homologs in the Plantae lineage. EGT towards diatom genomes can be illustrated {{by the fact that}} the T. pseudonana genome encodes six proteins which are most closely related to genes encoded by the Guillardia theta (cryptomonad) nucleomorph genome. Four of these genes are also found in red algal plastid genomes, thus demonstrating successive EGT from red algal plastid to red algal nucleus (nucleomorph) to heterokont host nucleus. More recent phylogenomic analyses of diatom proteomes provided evidence for a prasinophyte-like endosymbiont in the common ancestor of chromalveolates as supported by the fact the 70% of diatom genes of Plantae origin are of green lineage provenance and that such genes are also found in the genome of other stramenopiles. Therefore, it was proposed that chromalveolates are the product of serial secondary endosymbiosis first with a green algae, followed by a second one with a <b>red</b> <b>algae</b> that conserved the genomic footprints of the previous but displaced the green plastid. However, phylogenomic analyses of diatom proteomes and chromalveolate evolutionary history will likely take advantage of complementary genomic data from under-sequenced lineages such as <b>red</b> <b>algae.</b>|$|E
