The single-point cutting tools or taps and dies used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult.

40|$|<b>Relief</b> <b>angles</b> and rake {{angles of}} end mills, reamers and thread taps are often formed by {{surfaces}} with a width {{of less than}} one millimeter. Sample inspection using a contour projector, which up to now has been applied in the manufacturing process of these tools, requires a destruction of the sample.

An optical detector configuration is {{used to determine the}} direction of the reflected beam. This direction describes the angular position of the surface against the measuring system. The relation between coordinate system of the tool in the illuminated spot and the reference system of the optical measuring device is determined by a second setup.

40|$|Face-hobbing is the {{dominant}} and the most productive machining process for manufacturing bevel and hypoid gears. Bevel gears {{are one of the}} most important power transmission components, in automobile to aerospace industries, where the power is transmitted between two non-parallel axes. In current industries, the face-hobbing process confronts two major challenges, the tool wear and trial and error experiments to select machining parameters. In the present work, these two problems are targeted. The tool wear in face-hobbing happens at the tool corners of the cutting blades due to the multi-flank chip formation and large gradient of working rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> along the cutting edge at the corners. In addition, the cutting fluid absence contributes in the tool wear phenomena. In the present work, a cutting tool design method is proposed in order to improve the tool wear characteristics especially at the tool corners. The rake and relief surfaces of the conventional cutting blades are re-designed in such a way that normal rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> during the face-hobbing process are kept constant and consequently the gradients of these two angles are minimized, theoretically to zero. Using mathematical tool wear characterization relationship and also FEM simulation, the improvements in tool wear are approved. In addition, in the present thesis, semi-analytical methods are proposed to optimize the face-hobbing process in order to select appropriate machining settings. The optimization problem is constructed in such a way that the machining time is minimized subject to the tool rake wear or cutting force related constraints. In order to predict the tool rake wear (crater wear depth), methods are proposed to calculate un-deformed chip geometry, cutting forces, normal stresses, interface cutting temperature and chip sliding velocity. The un-deformed chip geometry is obtained using two proposed methods numerically and semi-analytically. In the numerical method, the workpiece in-process model is obtained and then the un-deformed chip geometry is approximated using the in-process model. In the semi-analytical method, an un-deformed chip boundary theory is constructed in such a way that the boundary curves of the un-deformed chip are formulated by closed form equations. The obtained un-deformed chip geometry is discretized along the cutting edge of the blades. Each infinitesimal element is considered as a small oblique cut. The differential cutting forces are predicted for each individual element using oblique cutting transformation theory. The total cutting forces are derived by integrating the differential cutting forces along the cutting edge. The proposed methods are applied on case studies of non-generated face-hobbing of gears to show the capability of the methods to find the un-deformed chip geometry, predict cutting forces and finally find the optimum machining parameters in non-generated face-hobbing...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of shear textures and band-like {{features in the}} microstructure of commercially pure (CP) aluminum have been studied {{as a function of}} backpressure and die <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> during equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) through a die with a 90 ◦ die channel angle. Microtexture data were acquired by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) following one pass and four repetitive passes by route A. In a 90 ◦ die with zero <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> the microtexture data indicate that ECAP involves simple shear on a shear plane and in a shear direction that are rotated away from the plane of the die channel intersection toward the die exit channel. This rotation reflects the spreading of shear deformation through a fan-shaped region around the plane of the die channel intersection. The superposition of backpressure suppresses this spreading and the texture data indicate that deformation is confined to the plane of the die channel intersection, while the introduction of a <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> at the outer corner of the die channel intersection promotes spreading and leads to further rotation of the shear plane and shear direction toward the axis of the die exit channel. Splitting of shear texture components is observed after the initial ECAP pass. Such splitting appears in the microstructure as band-like features separated by sub-grains. Band-like features became apparent in the microstructure after the initial pass and persisted through four ECAP passes by route A; these features become more prominent with increasing die <b>relief</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R

Assuming that the workpiece profile consists of sinusoidal-wave components, the amplitude ratio between the workpiece profile and the tool motion is defined as copying rate rC.

Shaping of slot profiles was carried out to investigate the influences of depth of cut, rake <b>angle</b> and <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> on the copying characteristic.

40|$|The green {{processing}} {{technology has}} {{been brought to the}} focus of attention around the world. The development and application of green cutting depend on the machine and cutting tool technology progress, in so far as the development of cutting tool technology has quite a big influence. The study was focused on the simulation analysis model for micro milling SKD 61 tool steel developed by the finite element method. First, because the impact of the effective rake angle on the oblique cutting model is equivalent to that of the rake angle on the orthogonal cut model, the complex tool geometry of an end-mill will be simplified to the orthogonal cutting model. Using the Taguchi method, the FEM simulation of orthogonal cutting operation was performed under different cutting speeds, cutting depths, effective rake angles and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> were modified. The cutting force, tool maximum temperature, tool maximum temperature and tip distance, and the contact length of tool and chip are the major performance indexes of micro milling process. Finally, the multiple cutting performance characteristic resulting from the grey relational analysis reveals that the influencing priority ranks for micro end-mills made of SKD 61 tool steel are cutting speed, effective rake angle, relief angle, and cutting depth. The FEM model is suitable for simulating the cutting performance of micro cutting process, and can also be used as a design base for micro endmills...|$|E
40|$|Crystals of Sr_ 2 (Si_ Ge_x) O_x with 0 ?×? 1 were {{prepared}} and examined by powder XRD, optical microscopy, and AFM. The crystals with 0. 3 ?x? 0. 6 were composed {{of both the}} α' (orthorhombic) - and twinned β (monoclinic) -phases. On {{the basis of the}} lattice correspondence between the two phases and their cell parameters, the phenomenological crystallographic theory has been applied to determine the habit planes and shape deformations upon α'-to-β martensitic transformation. The habit planes, which define the coherent interphase boundaries between α and β, were nearly parallel to either (100) or (001). Because the transformation was accompanied by a small volumetric shrinkage of ～ 0. 3 %, the parent α'-phase would elastically accommodate the strains upon the polysynthetic twin formation of the β-phase. At 293 K, the crystals with x= 0. 6 were composed of ～ 92. 5 mass% α' and ～ 7. 5 mass% β. During further cooling in liquid nitrogen, the α'-to-β transformation proceeded which increases the phase composition of β up to ～ 56. 3 %. The transformation is accompanied by the formation of plate-like surfaee reliefs. The surface <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> have been determined from both observations (7. 4 ± 0. 2 °) and calculations based on a phenomenological analysis (7. 55 °). The fair agreement of these values indicates that the transformation is martensitic and mainly governed by a shear mechanism. The shape memory effect has been demonstrated by the reproducibility of the surface reliefs. The coherency at the interface boundaries between the α'- and β-phases as well as the effective strain accommodation substantially account for the thermoelasticity of the solid solutions...|$|E

It is highly relevant to properly and periodically maintain the most important sites of electric traction equipment, which are of vital importance to the entire system of electric traction; these are the places which are significant in ceaseless operation of the entire system. Maintenance of {{the condition of the}} pantograph is one of such sites. It is relevant and highly important because the pantograph facilitates the supply to train engines. Since electricity supply to train engines proceeds also at a high speed of the train, the mechanical impact may inevitably damage the pantograph. This happens when the train moves at a high speed; also it is impacted by friction and other causes: meteorological phenomena, alteration of railway <b>relief,</b> <b>angles</b> of railway tilt etc. Regular examination is required to identify the condition of the pantograph. The aim of the research: grounding on analysis of theoretical and practical materials and the results of investigation of possibilities for diagnostics of the pantograph, to process the signal caused by oscillations of the pantograph, which is received from a testing stand, and to identify it by attributing to different classes of the condition of the pantograph. The object of the research: an automated system of identification of defects in electric traction pantographs. Objectives of the research: 1. 	to create a method of signal identification and classification, which is suitable for the automated system of detection of defects in pantographs; 2. 	to select an algorithm of signal transformation, which allows proper identification of characteristics of the signals of oscillations caused by pantographs; 3. 	to investigate precision of a suggested method of classification in identifying a defect and separating signals of defectless pantographs from signals of damaged pantographs.

5000|$|The cutters {{most often}} used to cut spotfaces are {{counterbore}} cutters and endmills. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills.|$|R

During the tests, the tool rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> {{and the depth of}} cut t were varied, whereas the cutting direction was held parallel to the fibre orientation. The trend of the principal forces recorded during cutting clearly showed the so-called `size effect': the unit cutting force (also known as `specific energy') was a decreasing function of the depth of cut, tending to infinity for vanishingly small values of t. A previous force scheme, assuming a significant influence of the friction generated by the work material sliding along the tool flank on the overall cutting forces, was utilized to interpret the cutting data, and to differently define the unit cutting force. According to the model, the unit cutting force and the coefficient of friction were independent of both the <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> and the depth of cut, although the former, as expected, sensibly decreased with increasing the rake angle...|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{establish}} and analyze the mathematical models of the plowing force and trajectory curve for tiller blades and cultivation blades of a rotary. Both blades are widely used in Taiwan. To ensure good efficiency and uniform resistance of the plow to soil, the blade must be protected from intertwisting. The theoretical and calculated cutting angles are 85. 88 and 85. 10, the edge-curve angles are 55. 00 and 56. 18. The rear of well designed plowing blade does not cause any friction with the soil. The curve of plowing shows that when the relief angle of the tiller blades is 25, the turning and the throwing have good performance. When the relief angle of the plowing blade is 10, the impact force and the crashing force of the blade into the soil will be minimized during plowing. Under the same condition of soil, the different accelerations agree with the curves drew by different <b>relief</b> <b>angles.</b> The tiller blades developed by local companies are suitable to the plowing environment in Taiwan. The high attrition causes too much operation cost for soil preparation. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} apply alloy powder spray-welding technology to improve the attrition as well as to increase the stability of materials, and then the lift of the blade can be extended. Consequently, the quality of the soil can be maintained. The high attrition causes too much operation cost for soil preparation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to apply the Nickel-Base alloy powder welding technique to the blades of tillers. In order to measure surface temperature of coated blade, this research tried to use designed alloy powder spray-welding mechanism to precede the surface hardening for the blades, and to use the infrared thermal imager to collect the instant heat image and its radiant temperature. Experimental results showed that, at the measure spots, both the instant heat image displayed in the thermal imager and the surface temperature of the heat radiation collected after eight seconds consistent with the conclusions addressed by other foreign researchers. At the same time, two sets of heat radiant temperatures obtained from the thermal imager were uniformly distributed over two pieces of tiller blades. Therefore, it can be proved that the coating surface of the tiller blades treated with alloy powder welding would have more uniform, precise and stability when using the alloy powder spray-welding mechanism developed in this study. In the SRV experiment, the duration of attrition for the coating and the abrasive parameter has shown that SUP-HF behaves better than SUP-F. The SUP-HF also has better reaction to the anti-oxidize function. The hardness parameter (Hv) on the coating is 691 - 702. The adherence after compression has a grade of A-class on the SEM chart. There is no significant difference on overall parameters for both specimens. The results have shown that, the SUP-HF blades performed excellently to the sandy-loam 45 ha and stone gravel soil 65 ha plowing; by replacement of 168 tiller blades at the basis of same abrasives. The plowing capacity sandy and stone of SUP-HF is 2. 6 larger than SUP-H. Respectively the iron residues remained in the soil is less than 24, 360 g and 24, 347 g. The efficiency of the SUP-HF blades is undoubtedly confirmed. 本研究針對台灣廣泛使用的迴轉犁所配置耕耘刀及開墾刀建立耕耘土壤的力學模式，結果顯示：為發揮良好的耕耘性能及其均一耕耘抵抗，預防草桿纏繞現象，最佳切入角之理論與計算值得知為 88. 58 º、 85. 10 º 及最佳耕起角為 55. 00 º、 56. 18 º，兩者結果均符合文獻數據。為使刀背不與土壤摩擦，能順利切削翻轉及拋擲土壤，由耕耘軌跡極座標曲線得知，耕耘刀間隙角 25 º時，翻轉及拋擲效果較強；開墾刀間隙角 10 º時，刃端耕土突入衝擊力最小，耕作土壤時破碎作用力最小，且在不同耕土移動的加速度對應於不同型式的間隙角，所得之極座標軌跡曲線圖均相符合，這驗證台灣廠商所開發的耕耘刀適用於台灣耕地環境。考慮耐磨耗性造成田間整地作業成本過高，應用鎳基合金粉末噴銲系統之技術檢驗噴銲機構之作業性能，經紅外線熱像儀檢測結果：在相同測溫點，熱像儀所擷取噴銲瞬間熱影像及經八秒表面散發出之溫度值均與國外學者所研究之結論相符合；同時當測試六組耕耘刀時，其熱輻射影像相對應點溫度約略相同且皆呈現均勻分佈。因此，可證實使用所研發之合金粉末噴銲機構鍍層時確能達到耕耘刀噴銲鍍層表面溫度的均勻性、精密性與穩定性。其次，鎳基合金鍍層的磨耗特性，經往覆式滑移磨耗試驗機(SRV) 磨耗實驗結果顯示：鍍層耐磨耗性及摩擦係數的表現均以底材鍍層+熱處理(SUP-HF) 為佳，且鎳基合金抗氧化性良好，鍍層的硬度值(Hv) 維持於 691 - 702 之間，另由掃描式電子顯微鏡(SEM) 圖得知，壓痕附著性由均在A等級。田間試驗結果顯示：每台車在相同的磨耗下，耕作於砂質土壤 45 公頃與石礫土壤 65 公頃後，總共更換 168 支耕耘刀(SUP-HF有 42 支，底材+熱處理(SUP-H) 有 126 支) ，其耕作量經SUP-HF之耕耘刀，多於SUP-H者均有 2. 6 倍，且存留於兩類土壤中的鐵質分別少於 24, 360 公克及 24, 347 公克，在效率上來說，應該值得肯定。目 錄 謝誌 [...] I 摘要 [...] .

From the {{definition}} of logarithmic spiral and its particular characteristics, logarithmic spiral is discussed and adopted as the tooth back curve of the relieving shaped milling cutter under the new manufacturing conditions.

Due to {{the complex}} {{structures}} of aviation products made of titanium alloy TC 4, residual stress can be generated by the high speed cutting process at their surface which has an important influence on their fatigue strength and also service life. Therefore, in this paper, a 3 D finite element model is built to analyze the cutting process with different tool parameters and to investigate the residual stress inside the processed surface. By the numerical study, when the cutting speed is 140 m/min, the residual tensile stress can be generated in the inner cutting surface, while the compressive residual stress in the outer cutting surface. Residual compressive stress can be enhanced by choosing the smaller tool rake angle, the bigger tool <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> and the bigger cutting edge radius properly...|$|R
