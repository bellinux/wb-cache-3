40|$|Frequent pattern mining is {{a heavily}} {{researched}} {{area in the}} field of data mining with wide range of applications. Mining frequent patterns from large scale databases has emerged as an important problem in data mining and knowledge discovery community. A number of algorithms has been proposed to determine frequent pattern. Apriori algorithm is the first algorithm proposed in this field. With the time a number of changes proposed in Apriori to enhance the performance in term of time and number of database passes. In this paper three different frequent pattern mining approaches (<b>Record</b> <b>filter,</b> Intersection and Proposed Algorithm) are given based on classical Apriori algorithm. In these approaches <b>Record</b> <b>filter</b> approach proved better than classical Apriori Algorithm, Intersection approach proved better than <b>Record</b> <b>filter</b> approach and finally proposed algorithm proved that it is much better than other frequent pattern mining algorithm.

40|$|Different from a {{centralized}} database system, distributed query processing involves data transmission among distributed sites, which makes reducing transmission cost a major goal for distributed query optimization. A Positionally Encoded <b>Record</b> <b>Filter</b> (PERF) has attracted research attention as a cost-effective operator to reduce transmission cost. A PERF {{is a bit}} array generated by relation tuple scan order instead of hashing, so that it inherits the same compact size benefit as a Bloom filter while suffering no loss of join information caused by hash collisions. Our proposed algorithm PERF_C (Compressed PERF) further reduces the transmission cost in algorithm PERF by compressing both the join attributes and the corresponding PERF filters using arithmetic coding. We prove by time complexity analysis that compression is more efficient than sorting, which was proposed by earlier research to remove duplicates in algorithm PERF. Through the experiments on our synthetic testbed with 36 types of distributed queries, algorithm PERF_C effectively reduces the transmission cost with a cost reduction ratio of 62...|$|E
40|$|Data mining or {{knowledge}} discovery {{is the process}} of discovering patterns in large data sets. In data mining each algorithm has adifferent objective and to obtain meaningful and previously unknown patterns from large dataset is an emerging and challenging problem. Association rule mining is a technique for discovering unsuspected data dependencies {{and is one of the}} best known data mining techniques. The basic Idea to identify from a given database, consisting of item sets (e. g. shopping baskets), whether the occurrence of specific items, implies also the occurrence of other items with a relatively high probability. Apriori algorithm is one of the popular approaches which are used to extract association rules from data sets. One of the most popular data mining approaches is to find frequent item sets from a transaction dataset and derive association rules. In this paper, we describe the association rules which are descriptive data mining technique.

40|$|Abstract—We formalize {{ideas of}} {{orthogonality}} and inner products {{implicit in the}} development of a number of figures of merit (FOM, [1]) of color <b>recording</b> <b>filters.</b> We show that, in negligible measurement noise, the data dependence of each FOM based on linear color correction is equivalent to a choice of inner product (and hence of orthogonality). Further, we show that optimal sensors with respect to noise sensitivity are simply defined as orthogonal with respect to this inner product. We also develop the idea of a generalized-factor by generalizing the Euclidean inner product to include all inner products. Simulations demonstrate the utility of our analytical results.

The recognition rate of approximately 85 percent correct for untrained speakers and 94 percent correct for trained speakers was not considered adequate for flight systems use.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel and {{efficient}} method, {{that we shall}} call TopRank in the following paper, for detecting change-points in high-dimensional data. This issue is of growing concern to the network security community since network anomalies such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks lead to changes in Internet traffic. Our method consists of a data reduction stage based on <b>record</b> <b>filtering,</b> followed by a nonparametric change-point detection test based on U-statistics. Using this approach, we can address massive data streams and perform anomaly detection and localization on the fly. We show how it applies to some real Internet traffic provided by France-Télécom (a French Internet service provider) {{in the framework of}} the ANR-RNRT OS-CAR project. This approach is very attractive since it benefits from a low computational load and is able to detect and localize several types of network anomalies. We also assess the performance of the TopRank algorithm using synthetic data and compare it with alternative approaches based on random aggregation. 1. Introduction. Recen...|$|R
40|$|Joining {{multiple}} datasets in MapReduce may {{amplify the}} disk and network overheads because intermediate join results {{have to be}} written to the underlying distributed file system, or map output records have to be replicated multiple times. This paper proposes a method for applying filters based on the processing order of input datasets, which is appropriate for {{the two types of}} multiway joins: common attribute joins and distinct attribute joins. The number of redundant <b>records</b> <b>filtered</b> depends on the processing order. In common attribute joins, the input records {{do not need to be}} replicated, so a set of filters is created, which are applied in turn. In distinct attribute joins, the input records have to be replicated, so multiple sets of filters need to be created, which depend on the number of join attributes. The experimental results showed that our approach outperformed a cascade of two-way joins and basic multiway joins in cases where small portions of input datasets were joined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Magneto-rheological (MR) fluid damper is a semiactive {{control device}} that has {{recently}} received more attention by the vibration control community. But inherent hysteretic and highly nonlinear dynamics of MR fluid damper {{is one of}} the challenging aspects to employ its unique characteristics. The combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy logic system (FLS) have been used to imitate more precisely the behavior of this device. However, the derivative-based nature of adaptive networks causes some deficiencies. Therefore, in this paper, a novel approach that employ genetic algorithm, as a free-derivative algorithm, to enhance the capability of fuzzy systems, is proposed. The proposed method used to model MR damper.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} "Positionally Encoded <b>Record</b> <b>Filters</b> " (PERFs) {{and describes}} {{their use in}} a distributed query processing technique called PERF join. A PERF is a novel two-way join reduction implementation primitive.

Hence it doesn't suffer any loss of join information incurred by hash collisions. Using the query response time measured in terms of network cost as a comparison criterion, we demonstrate through analytical studies that PERF join performs significantly better than two-way Bloomjoin and two-way semijoin variants under a wide range of relevant cost parameter values. For the large number of distributed query processing algorithms relying on Bloomjoin or semijoin variants to reduce their network cost, we can sometimes gain an instant improvement in their response time by switching to PERF join instead.
