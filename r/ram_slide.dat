5000|$|The {{most common}} Mechanical Presses use an {{eccentric}} drive {{to move the}} press's <b>ram</b> <b>slide,</b> length of stroke or slide travel depends on the crankshaft or eccentric, whereas hydraulic cylinders are used in hydraulic presses. The nature of drive system determines the force progression during the ram's stroke. Mechanical presses have a full tonnage rating point above BDC / Bottom Dead Center, normal full tonnage rating points are [...]187", [...]25" [...] & [...]5". Hence a mechanical press has a tonnage curve and should be operated within the press capacity limits. Link Motion mechanical is yet another option, this provides a slide slow down near BDC / bottom dead center for soft touch tooling. This link feature can improve die life and reduce reverse-snap thru tonnage for blanking operations.|$|E

50|$|The Marform process, for example, {{operates}} {{using the}} principle of rubber pad forming techniques. Deep-recessed parts with either vertical or sloped walls can be formed. In this type of forming, the die rig employs a rubber pad as one tool half and a solid tool half, similar to the die in a conventional die set, to form a component into its final shape. Dies are made of cast light alloys and the rubber pad is 1.5-2 times thicker than the component to be formed. For Marforming, single-action presses are equipped with die cushions and blank holders. The blank is held against the rubber pad by a blank holder, through which a punch is acting as in conventional deep drawing. It is a double-acting apparatus: at first the <b>ram</b> <b>slides</b> down, then the blank holder moves: this feature allows it to perform deep drawings (30-40% transverse dimension) with no wrinkles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{workpiece}} mounts on a rigid, box-shaped {{table in}} front of the machine. The height of the table can be adjusted to suit this workpiece, and the table can traverse sideways underneath the reciprocating tool, which is mounted on the ram. Table motion may be controlled manually, but is usually advanced by an automatic feed mechanism acting on the feedscrew. The <b>ram</b> <b>slides</b> back and forth above the work. At {{the front end of the}} ram is a vertical tool slide that may be adjusted to either side of the vertical plane along the stroke axis. This tool-slide holds the clapper box [...] and tool post, from which the tool can be positioned to cut a straight, flat surface on the top of the workpiece. The tool-slide permits feeding the tool downwards to deepen a cut. This adjustability, coupled with the use of specialized cutters and toolholders, enable the operator to cut internal and external gear tooth ...|$|R
50|$|The {{bolster plate}} {{is mounted on}} top of the press bed and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the bolster plate is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the {{automotive}} industry) may be equipped die cushions integrated in the bolster plate to apply blank holder or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The <b>ram</b> / <b>slide</b> is the moving or reciprocating member that the upper die is mounted to. <b>Ram</b> or <b>Slide</b> guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of slide guides are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length slide guides on larger straight side frame presses. With the dies and material be fed into the die between the bolster and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as defection when frame design and loads are considered.|$|R

If the drill pipe is in the well, the pipe <b>rams</b> <b>slide</b> perpendicular to the pipe, closing around it to form a tight seal. The annular preventers also close around the pipe, but have more of a vertical motion, so they loosen slightly if the drill pipe is being pushed downward, as might be necessary in a [...] "snubbing" [...] or [...] "well kill" [...] operation. [...] Shear rams may be used as a last resort to cut through the drill pipe and shut off everything, including whatever might be coming up inside the drill pipe.|$|R

50|$|Sue can shape her psionic force fields into {{invisible}} constructs, usually simple shapes such as barriers, columns, cones, cylinders, darts, discs, domes, platforms, <b>rams,</b> ramps, <b>slides</b> and spheres. By generating {{additional force}} behind her psionic constructs, Sue can {{turn them into}} offensive weapons, ranging from massive invisible battering rams to small projectiles such as spheres and darts. She can generate solid force constructs {{as small as a}} marble or as large as 100 ft in diameter, and her hollow projections such as domes can extend up to several miles in area. By forming one of her force fields within an object and expanding the field, Sue can cause her target to explode. She can also travel atop animated constructs such as ramps, stairs, slides, columns and stepping discs, enabling her to fly. She can manipulate the energy of her force fields around other objects to simulate telekinetic abilities. It has been said on numerous occasions, including by the Fantastic Four's greatest opponent, Doctor Doom, that Sue is the single-most powerful member of the quartet and {{she is one of the}} few beings able to rupture the shell of a Celestial. She is capable of generating and manipulating multiple force fields simultaneously. This power is only limited by her concentration; once she stops concentrating on a field, it simply ceases to exist.|$|R
40|$|FEM-analysis of {{dynamics}} in the bearing system of a heavy-duty machine tool {{has been carried}} out in the paper. This is a prospective variant for a large-size multi-purpose machine tool with a horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>ram.</b> A saddle and a ram are moving vertically along a subtle mono-column. A rigid double-column is used in the existing analog machine tool. A static, modal and harmonic analysis of the bearing system with the mono-column has been made in the paper. It has been done with the help of FEM-simulation prior to fabrication of a prototype sample. Previously conducted calculations for the analog machine tool have shown good compatibility of FEM-calculation with experiments. Six common machine tool resonances have been revealed for the bearing system. Their oscillating cutting forces are actively exciting three-four resonance modes. Ranges of a flexure-torsion resonance (20 – 40 Hz) and nose-diving resonances (70 – 90 Hz) have been determined in the paper. The paper shows that the range of multi-wave resonances starts significantly higher from 140 Hz. These resonances are interconnected with bending oscillations of the ram and bucklings of the column walls which are matched with the oscillations. The paper demonstrates stability in resonance pattern. The torsional resonance of the column on the frequency of nearly 40 Hz is considered as the more dangerous one. Spindle rigidity goes down up to 3. 8 Н/μm. It is possible to observe self-stabilization of the torsional resonance. Frequency of the torsional oscillations is practically unchangeable when there is a lifting or lowering down of the saddle and the ram. It is related to the migration of dynamical axis of torsion. Frequency-response characteristics of the bearing system have been constructed for various saddle positions on the column. Three frequency intervals that make it possible to carry out machining operation have been determined in the paper. The first interval is a static one. The machine tool with a mono-column comes short of the analog machine tool in this interval. The main reason of it is low static rigidity of the subtle column. The second interval is narrow and it is located between flexure-torsion and nose-diving resonances. The third interval is considered as the most efficient one. The interval contains a section of inter-range pause between general machine tool and multi-wave resonances. In this case it is possible to observe a significant increase of the dynamic rigidity on the spindle that compensates the column subtility. High potential of the dynamic rigidity has been revealed {{in the direction of the}} ram axis (> 2000 Н/μm). The paper shows liability of the machine tool to displacement crossings during oscillations. Peculiar features of this effect have been discussed in the paper. The diagram with a mono-column is recommended for practical application. The main condition is a transition to high-speed drive within the framework of concept on high-speed machining. It is necessary to ensure rigidity of the axial feed drive system. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the studies {{reported}} in this Thesis was to increase our understanding of two aspects of the reproductive system in farm animals: the andrological evaluation and the follicular fluid composition. The final aim was to give some tools that {{can be helpful in}} optimizing the application of assisted reproductive technologies. Studies were conducted in bulls, rams, alpacas, lamas and dairy buffalo cows. The first study was designed to investigate the efficacy of scrotal thermographic monitoring in the evaluation of young bulls with low semen production after GnRH administration. Yearling bulls with low semen quality were selected. Scrotal surface temperature (SST) and serum testosterone (T) were evaluated before and after administration of 10. 5 µg Buserelin Acetate IV. Bulls were divided in two groups: LowTemp bulls had a decreased SST at 60 minutes; HighTemp bulls had an increased SST. After 60 minutes from Buserelin administration, LowTemp bulls had higher T values compared to HighTemp bulls: 14. 32 ± 0. 53 ng/ml vs. 10. 30 ± 1. 37 ng/ml respectively (mean ± SEM) (P< 0. 05). Reproductive performances in both groups improved after Buserelin administration, but the improvement was more marked in LowTemp bulls. In conclusion a decreased SST after GnRH administration was associated with better testicles functionality. The second study was done to assess the predicting value of trans-scrotal ultrasonography (TSUS) and testicular fine-needle aspiration cytology (TFNAC) on sperm production in rams. TSUS and TFNAC were performed on eighteen adult rams {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. After evaluation, semen was collected twice with electroejaculation from each ram, and then epididymal spermatozoa were collected after slaughtering. Ultrasonography appearance of testicular parenchyma was analyzed to create a four classes division of the animals. Relative percentages of spermatogenic cells and Spermatic Index (SI = percentage of spermatozoa on the total of spermatogenic cells) were calculated after obsersation of TFNAC <b>slides.</b> <b>Rams</b> having a better echogenicity had a higher SI and a higher total sperm and number of straws per ejaculate either with electroejaculation or epididymal spermatozoa than the worst groups. Several cytological parameters were correlated with sperm production: the most interesting correlation was between SI and number of straws obtained by epididymal collection (0. 667; P= 0. 003. In conclusion, TSUS and TFNAC can be usefully integrated in breeding soundness evaluation of rams, as these techniques had a potential as a marker of semen production. The third study documents the variability of follicular fluid (FF) composition of South American camelids, in different stages of ovarian activity. In the first experiment, ovaries of alpacas were collected at slaughterhouse and FF was aspirated dividing sample on the base of ovarian cycle stage and follicular dimension. Follicle size affected FF composition, either by biochemical analysis or electrophoresis. Conversely, the influence of corpus luteum was minimal. In the second study, ovaries of thirty lamas were scanned ultrasonographically to identify wave emergence. FF was aspirated trans-vaginally at three different stage of development (growing, static and regressing phase). The electrophoresis analysis revealed differences between groups in 4 classes of weight (250 KDa, 75 KDa, 25 KDa, 15 KDa). This study offers new information concerning the biochemical composition of follicular fluid in South American camelids, suggesting that oocytes grow and mature in an environment that changes in function of the follicle stage, while is minimally influenced by the presence of the corpus luteum. The aim of the forth study was to characterize the biochemical and fatty acids composition of the follicular fluid (FF) in water buffalo. Ovaries of buffalo were collected after slaughtering during breeding season. Fluid was aspirated from follicles of small and large follicles (6 mm respectively) and dividing females in those in luteal or follicular phase of estrous cycle. Biochemical analysis and gas chromatography were performed. Biochemical and fatty acids compositions were influenced by both follicular dimension and phase of ovarian cycle. Biochemical composition and its variation was in agreement with previously study conducted in buffalo and other species. Twenty-two fatty acids were identified in FF; nine were saturated fatty acids, six monounsatured fatty acids and seven polyunsatured fatty acids. The most dominant fatty acids were linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid and arachidonic acid. All the identified fatty acids concentrations varies at least because of follicle dimension or phase, with the exception of γ-linoleic acid and arachidonic acid which concentrations remain stable in all classes. The fifth study was designed to investigate the effect of different diets on the testicular fine-needle aspiration cytology (TFNAC) in rams. Eighteen rams were fed with three different diets since 8 months of age up to 1 year. The diets were: 1 - pasture (N= 6); 2 - hay and commercial concentrate (N= 6); 3 - hay, commercial concentrate and a supplementation of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) containing equal parts of cis- 9, trans- 11 and trans- 10, cis- 12 isoforms (N= 6). After slaughtering, testes were collected to perform TFNAC. No statistical differences were observed in live weight and testicular weight between groups. CLA supplemented rams had higher relative percentage of early spermatogenic cells (primary spermatocytes and AB spermatids) and lower percentage of CD spermatids and SI compared to other groups. Total CLA concentration in diets was similar in pasture and CLA supplemented groups, but rams graze at pasture receive almost all cis- 9, trans- 11 isomer. Rams fed with hay and concentrate received a lower quantity of CLA in the diet. In conclusion, CLA supplementation and in particular the trans- 10, cis- 12 isomer affected negatively the TFNAC results in peripubertal rams probably because it returded the onset of puberty. ...|$|R
