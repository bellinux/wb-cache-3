A single-story wood frame ell extends to the rear.|$|R
50|$|After the {{dramatic}} {{years of the}} Great Northern War, August the Strong decided to reorganize his troops and renew their equipment. A military review of the 27,000-men-strong army was scheduled for June 1730, requiring an encampment near Zeithain north-west of Dresden with large tents. The biggest tent in the current exhibition was brought to Dresden specifically for this event in 1729. Originally, it consisted of a large <b>roof</b> section, two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> and parts of an awning. One of the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> {{and parts of the}} awning have been missing since the end of World War II. Nevertheless, {{it is one of the}} most magnificent surviving Ottoman tents in the world.|$|R
5000|$|The {{body of the}} {{locomotives}} in use {{is different}} from the prototypes in details. There are three basic types of locomotive bodies where the main differences are the size and placement of the side windows, air intakes and ventilation grids. From ET22-013 big grids on the left side for resistors' cooling were moved from upper part to lower part of the body. From ET22-242 air intakes for engines' cooling were moved from a <b>roof</b> edge to <b>side</b> <b>walls,</b> on both <b>sides,</b> which is most popular configuration.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of {{construction}} type, the snow must be consolidated {{so that it}} retains its structure. The walls and roof {{should be at least}} 1 ft thick. A small pit may be dug deeper into one part of the cave floor to provide a place for the coldest air to gather, away from the occupant(s), and the entrance may be partially blocked with chunks of snow to deflect wind and retain heat, although it is vital to prevent drifting snow from completely plugging the rest of the entrance in order to maintain a constant air supply. Some prefer to place a ski pole or a ski up from the cave out through the <b>roof</b> or <b>side</b> <b>wall.</b> This can provide an emergency air hole should the main entrance become blocked.|$|R

40|$|To study common failure {{characteristics}} of gateways, {{a total of}} 55 typical gateways at coal mines, in Sichuan Province, China, were selected for investigating the rules of broken widths based on the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technique and numerical model. Results indicated that the broken width values around the gateways were larger than 1. 5 m, {{and those in the}} <b>roof</b> and high <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> were larger than those in the low <b>side</b> <b>wall,</b> as a whole. The width values had close relationships with the thickness of the coal seam and immediate roof, angle of the coal seam, and depth of the gateways. Furthermore, combined with the plastic zone of numerical models in 3 -Dimensional Distinct Element Code (3 DEC) and the broken width, we obtained the excavation broken zone (EBZ) cross-section diagram for each gateway and determined that the EBZ appeared to have a basically elliptical shape—with the long axis along the seam inclination direction and the short axis along the vertical direction of the rock layer—and that this elliptical shape was only slightly affected by the gateway cross-section shape. It was observed that the failure extent was greater in the seam inclination direction than in the vertical direction of the rock layer. Obviously, the gateways presented asymmetric failure characteristics and implied that an asymmetric support system should be provided when using bolts, cables, and shotcrete combined with steel mesh and steel belts. Such a support system could improve material parameters and form a combined arch structure in surrounding rocks, with arch crown and arch springing thicknesses that are larger in the <b>roof</b> and high <b>side</b> <b>wall...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{ventilation}} flux {{was calculated}} for single span greenhouses with single longitudinal roof opening and with bothlongitudinal <b>roof</b> and vertical <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> openings.

For the single roof window, the temperatureeffect, proportional to the square root of the temperature difference, becomes negligible when compared to the wind effect,proportional to the wind speed, as soon as this is higher than 1. 5 m. s- 1. When a vertical <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> opening was added to theroof window, the temperature effect was enhanced by the so called chimney effect, linked with the vertical distance betweenthe two openings, {{in such a way that}} it becomes negligible only for an external wind speed higher than 4 m. s- 1...|$|R
5000|$|On January 16, 1992, the United States Department of the Interior used {{a thermal}} imaging device outside of Danny Lee Kyllo's home in Florence, Oregon. According to the District Court that presided over Kyllo's evidentiary hearing, the device could not [...] "penetrate walls or windows to reveal conversations or human activities. The device {{recorded}} only heat being emitted from the home." [...] The device {{showed that there}} was an unusual amount of heat radiating from the <b>roof</b> and <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> of the garage compared {{with the rest of his}} house. (The assumption is that to grow marijuana indoors, one needs to provide a large amount of light in order for the plants to photosynthesize.) This information was subsequently used to obtain a search warrant, where federal agents discovered over 100 marijuana plants growing in Kyllo's home. Kyllo was charged with growing marijuana in his Oregon home. Kyllo first tried to suppress the evidence obtained from the thermal imaging search, but then he pleaded a conditional guilty.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} a report on {{assessing}} the thermal environment in an atrium with air-conditioning by studying the air temperature at the occupied zone. By surveying the general shapes of the atrium buildings in Hong Kong, {{it is found that}} most of the atria have a glazed roof and a lower occupant zone cooled by installing air-conditioning systems. A three-zone model is proposed to study the air temperature in the atrium. The upper zone is hot due to solar radiation heating up the glazed <b>roof,</b> interior <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> and building contents; a middle zone is an intermittent region; and the lower zone is cooled by an air-conditioning system. Heat transfer between the zones through convection is proposed. Air temperature is predicted by solving the system of heat balance equations numerically. Further, a closed form expression on the air temperature at the lower zone is derived by assuming a constant upper layer temperature. The result is useful at the initial stage in designing thermal environmental control systems for atria. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|Reconstructions of the {{appearance}} of the hof at Uppåkra have assumed it looked like a stave church. In 2004 the Foteviken Museum published a reconstruction with the four central columns interpreted as the framework for a tower. The roof was clad in wood shakes, which indicate a fairly steep <b>roof.</b> From the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> to the tower wall, {{there must have been a}} rise of a good two meters. The two-meter-deep postholes indicate a very strong construction, not least since the four columns formed a square, which made possible effective cross-bracing (as depicted in the above illustration). With a suggested height of ten meters for its columns, the roof of the tower would have protruded a full three meters over the roof ridge of the nave.|$|R
50|$|After the war {{the cave}} was {{considered}} as a military installation by the Allies due to its production facilities. In 1946 they had all the access galleries blown up. The cave suffered heavy damage {{as a result of}} <b>roof</b> and <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> collapses. From 1953 the Heimkehle was opened up. New entry and exit galleries were driven and the structures that had not already been destroyed were removed. Hardly any traces of buildings may be seen in the cave today. The concreted lakes could not be uncovered because the thickness and quality of the concrete used by the Nazis did not allow it to be removed. More demolition work would have caused further destruction of the Heimkehle. So the cave may now be visited on foot. In 1954 it was re-opened as a show cave. In the small cathedral (Kleiner Dom), where there had also been production facilities, East German authorities built a memorial to the concentration camp inmates. In the Great Cathedral (Großer Dom), in which only a few traces of the production site can still be see, a laser show was installed in 1990. The formal opening of the karst museum took place in 1979.|$|R
50|$|The Calvary Methodist Church {{is located}} on the {{southwest}} side of Massachusetts Avenue, southeast of Arlington center. It is a rectangular wood frame structure, with a projecting vestibule and tower. The main block has a hipped <b>roof,</b> and its <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> have four round-arch windows. The projecting is fronted by four Ionic columns, with a square stage above that houses a clock with a single face facing front, and small round windows on the other three sides. This stage is topped by a balustrade, and a flush-boarded stage with wide projecting sections and a dentillated cornice. Above this is an octagonal belfry, with four wide sides housing round-arched louvered openings with engaged columns at the corners.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of vent type (<b>side,</b> <b>roof</b> or both) and of an anti-aphid insect screen on airflow and temperature distribution of a mono span greenhouse round arch <b>roof</b> with vertical <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> The greenhouse was equipped with two side roll-up vents and a flap roof vent. A tomato crop planted in double rows was cultivated inside the greenhouse. The three components of air velocity were measured by a 3 -D sonic anemometer and simultaneously air temperature and relative humidity were recorded in several positions inside the greenhouse. Concerning the effect of insect screens, {{it was found that}} the mean value of the normalised air velocity was 65 % lower in the greenhouse with insect screens in the side vent openings than without the screens. Furthermore, with the screen in the openings, the spatial heterogeneity of microclimate variables was reduced. As far as the vent opening is concerned, it was found that in the case of side openings only, the air velocity inside the greenhouse was characterized by a strong air current near the greenhouse ground and low air velocity near the roof while the combination of <b>roof</b> and <b>side</b> openings increased air velocity and decreased air temperature inside the greenhouse but increased also the spatial heterogeneity of the greenhouse microclimate. The most homogeneous climate conditions were achieved by roof only openings...|$|R
