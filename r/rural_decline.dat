5|$|Often farmers {{would leave}} a solitary cabbage tree—or even groves of trees—standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because {{livestock}} eat the seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees. When a cabbage tree {{is the only}} shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in {{the centre of the}} stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die. Other factors thought to contribute to <b>Rural</b> <b>Decline</b> include wood-rotting fungi like Phanerochaete cordylines, micro-organisms which cause saprobic decay and leaf-feeding caterpillars.|$|E
25|$|The deep {{agricultural}} crisis {{lasted from}} the 1650s through the 1720s. Under {{the plight of}} constant warfare and adverse economic conditions the peasants were being increasingly burdened with excessive obligations. Their communities suffered population losses and many villages disappeared altogether. The serf labor force was displaced and their plots taken over under estate consolidation schemes (to further increase the already dominant folwark portion of the rural economy), or manorial duties were replaced by feudal rent arrangements if that seemed more profitable to landlords. Those and many other measures amounting to extreme exploitation and imposition of hardship had not resulted in increased production, but rather made the crisis more acute by ruining the peasant farming operation. Not all the regions suffered equally, as northern Poland's (Gdańsk Pomerania and Greater Poland) agriculture maintained moderate profitability, while southern Poland (Lesser Poland) experienced the greatest <b>rural</b> <b>decline,</b> and correspondingly the greatest decrease {{in the percentage of}} farms under peasant family hereditary holding.|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{have long}} sought to {{understand}} the relationship between <b>rural</b> population <b>decline</b> and the factors causing variations {{from time to time and}} from place to place (Albrecht, 2010). However, few studies have made comparisons at the local level or developed appropriate regional or place-based metrics. The purpose of this project was to determine which local-level factors and variables correlate with <b>rural</b> population <b>decline</b> and to provide recommendations based on those findings. This project analyzed the relationships between 2000 - 2010 population trends and a variety of demographic, economic, and biophysical factors specific to rural communities throughout the state of Utah. A community-level natural amenity index was developed in order to investigate the relationship between population change and the presence or absence of place-specific natural amenities. Findings suggest that planning for <b>rural</b> population <b>decline</b> should be comprehensive and systematic, recognize the joint influence of factors and variables, understand that factors are time dependent, promote physical and social geographic linkages, and acknowledge the leading role of economics...|$|R

Jefferson's republicanism focused on direct citizen involvement in decision making, with an implicit belief that people could rise above their own interests to pursue a common good. The federalists feared the instability of republican governments and concentrated on institutionalizing politics as the business of balancing interests, with the Constitution as a framework protecting the working of a "commercially competitive civil society.
