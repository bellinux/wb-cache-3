25|$|The {{most common}} type of valve seen for valve {{attachments}} is the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve.</b> Some trombones have piston valves used instead of rotary valves for valve attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> have been invented in the past half-century such as the Thayer valve or axial-flow Valve, the Hagmann valve, the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> would allow. Many of these new trombone valve designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> remains the most common for trombone valve attachments.|$|E
25|$|The 618 {{features}} liquid-cooled {{cylinder heads}} and cylinders with a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> inlet and an exhaust valve. Cooling is via {{one or two}} externally mounted radiators. Lubrication is by use of pre-mixed fuel and oil at 50:1 or oil injection. The 618 has dual Ducati capacitor discharge ignition systems and is equipped with two piston-type carburetors. It uses a manifold-driven pneumatic fuel pump to provide fuel pressure.|$|E
25|$|The flugelhorn {{is built}} in the same B pitch as many {{trumpets}} and cornets. It usually has three piston valves and employs the same fingering system as other brass instruments, but four-piston valve and <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> variants also exist. It can thus be played without too much trouble by trumpet and cornet players, though some adaptation to their playing style may be needed. It is usually played with a more deeply conical mouthpiece than either trumpets or cornets (though not as conical as a horn mouthpiece).|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of brass instruments, <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> are found on horns, trumpets, trombones, flugelhorns, and tubas. Many European trumpet players tend to favor <b>rotary</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} for loading samples on columns used for liquid or gas chromatography. The valves used in these methods are usually 6-port, 2-position <b>rotary</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>valves</b> are {{potentially}} highly suitable for high-revving engines, {{such as those}} used in racing sportscars and F1 racing cars, on which traditional poppet valves with springs can fail due to valve float and spring resonance and where the desmodromic valve gear is too heavy, large in size and too complex to time and design properly. <b>Rotary</b> <b>valves</b> could allow for a more compact and lightweight cylinder head design. They rotate at half engine speed and lack the inertia forces of reciprocating valve mechanisms. This allows for higher engine speeds, offering approximately perhaps 10% more power. The 1980s MGN W12 F1 engine used <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> but never raced. Between 2002 and 2004 the Australian developer Bishop Innovation and Mercedes-Ilmor tested <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> for a F1 V10 engine.|$|R
25|$|The {{trombone}} is {{a musical}} instrument in the brass family. Like all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies {{the length of the}} instrument to change the pitch. Many modern trombone models also utilize a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> as a means to lower pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves like those on the trumpet.|$|E
25|$|A superbone uses a {{full set}} of valves and a slide. These differ from trombones with triggers. Some slide trombones have one or (less frequently) two rotary valves {{operated}} by a left-hand thumb trigger. The single <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is part of the F attachment, which adds a length of tubing to lower the instrument's fundamental pitch from B to F. Some bass trombones have a second trigger with a different length of tubing. The second trigger facilitates playing the otherwise problematic low B. A buccin is a trombone with a round, zoomorphic bell section. They were common in 19th-century military bands.|$|E
25|$|The eternal {{problem with}} {{compounds}} is starting: for all cylinders {{to take their}} weight, it is advisable to have some way of short-circuiting the HP cylinders and getting steam at a reduced pressure directly to the LP cylinder(s); hence many of the patented compound systems are associated with particular starting arrangements. The de Glehn 4-cylinder system is probably still the most sophisticated of all with independent HP & LP cut-off and a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve,</b> called a lanterne allowing independent working or combinations of HP and LP groups. Most other systems employ starting valves of various kinds. Another criterion is whether the valve gears {{of the two groups}} are wholly independent or linked together in some way.|$|E

50|$|From 1911 to 1914 Scott's Tourist Trophy racers used <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> {{to control}} the inlet and {{transfer}} phases of the two-stroke cycle. In 1911 the engine was controlled by advancing or retarding the valve timing and not by the throttle. Scott reverted to throttle control in 1912, giving the <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> a fixed gear drive in the same year.|$|R
50|$|Tubas {{are made}} with either piston or <b>rotary</b> <b>valves.</b> <b>Rotary</b> <b>valves,</b> invented by Joseph Riedl, {{are based on a}} design {{included}} in the original valve patents by Friedrich Blühmel and Heinrich Stölzel in 1818. Červeny of Graslitz was the first to use true <b>rotary</b> <b>valves,</b> starting in the 1840s or 1850s. Modern piston valves were developed by François Périnet for the saxhorn family of instruments promoted by Adolphe Sax around the same time. Pistons may either be oriented to point {{to the top of the}} instrument (top-action, as pictured in the figure at the top of the article) or out the front of the instrument (front-action or side-action). There are advantages and disadvantages to each valve style, but assertions concerning sound, speed, and clarity are difficult to quantify. German players generally prefer <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> while British and American players favor piston valves — the choice of valve type remains up to the performer.|$|R

50|$|On <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> engines {{the process}} is similar except instead of a reed, a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is used (incorporated in the crankshaft), which opens and closes as the piston moves up and down. The <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is more {{efficient}} and adjustable (at design time) {{as there is a}} larger and clearer path to the crankcase than in the reed valve setup, but such engines can run in only one direction; pusher configurations require a special propeller, sometimes difficult to find.|$|E

50|$|The {{valve train}} is the {{mechanical}} system responsible for {{operation of the}} valves. Valves are usually of the poppet type, although many others have been developed such as sleeve, slide, and <b>rotary</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Cox line of {{reed valve}} engines {{designed}} prior to 1960 used a rear reed valve induction system. In the late 1950s they played around with rear <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> induction (as {{used in the}} RR1) before moving forward with front <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> induction for their Tee Dee and Medallion lines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>valve</b> engines can be {{tailored}} to deliver power over a wider speed range or higher power over a narrower speed range than either piston port or reed valve engine. Where {{a portion of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is a portion of the crankcase itself, it is particularly important that no wear is allowed to take place.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is that it enables the two-stroke engine's intake timing to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port type engines. The piston-port type engine's intake timing opens and closes before and after top dead center at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> allows the opening to begin and close earlier.|$|E

50|$|Spool is of {{two types}} namely sliding and rotary. Sliding spool is {{cylindrical}} in cross section, and the lands and grooves are also cylindrical. <b>Rotary</b> <b>valves</b> have sphere-like lands and grooves {{in the form}} of holes drilled through them.|$|R
2500|$|The {{two major}} types of <b>valve</b> {{mechanisms}} are <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> and piston valves. [...] The first piston valve instruments were developed {{just after the}} start of the 19th century. The Stölzel valve (invented by Heinrich Stölzel in 1814) was an early variety. In the mid 19th century the Vienna valve was an improved design. However many professional musicians preferred <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> for quicker, more reliable action, until better designs of piston valves were mass manufactured {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. Since the early decades of the 20th century, piston valves have been the most common on brass instruments except for the orchestral horn and the tuba.
