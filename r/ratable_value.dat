50|$|Lancashire {{adopted the}} Public Libraries Act, 1919, in 1924. Library {{services}} {{were slow to}} develop as the average <b>ratable</b> <b>value</b> of the area outside the county boroughs and the other local authorities which had already adopted the act was relatively low. In 1938/39 the average expenditure on urban libraries per head was 1s. 9d., but that on county libraries was only 8 1/4d. (about two fifths of the former amount). Another disadvantage was that government of libraries was by a libraries sub-committee of the education committee of the council (the librarian having {{to report to the}} education officer who might not have been sympathetic to libraries). The central administration of the county library is at Preston where there are special services, special collections and staff to maintain a union catalogue.|$|E
5000|$|The council {{gained the}} Hundred of Skurray on 7 September 1933 from the {{abolished}} District Council of Swan Reach, which added {{the town of}} Blanchetown. An additional ward, Skurray Ward, was established, electing one councillor. In 1936, the council covered a total area of 190,382 acres, {{with a population of}} 892 residing in 450 houses. The council area had a <b>ratable</b> capital <b>value</b> of £292,360, resulting in an annual income for the council of £791/16/2. In that year, it was responsible for 30 miles of main roads and 434 miles of district roads.|$|R
50|$|In 1923, it was {{responsible}} for a chiefly grazing and farming district of 595,200 acres. It was reported in that year that of the five officially surveyed townships in the municipality, three now had no residents, with the surviving towns being Penn (30 residents) and Dawson (20 residents). The total population was 970, residing in 226 dwellings, with the total <b>ratable</b> capital <b>value</b> of the district being £230,000. The council was abolished in 1935 following a Local Government Commission report that advocated cutting the number of municipalities in South Australia from 196 to 142: the report saw the Coglin council merge with the District Council of Yongala and a severed portion of the Corporate Town of Peterborough to form the District Council of Peterborough.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} council chamber burnt down in 1917, {{resulting in}} the destruction of all early council records. A new council chamber was built in 1918. In 1923, the total area under its control was 553,440 acres, with a <b>ratable</b> capital <b>value</b> of £175,600. It included 241 areas of parklands, an oval and a square, with the total amount of roads being 30 miles. A fifth ward was gazetted in 1925 to cover the influx of soldier settlers to the Cadell Irrigation Area. In the 1960s, there was a boundary dispute between the Morgan council and the District Council of Waikerie over the previously unincorporated Hundreds of Markaranka and Pooginook: they were added to Waikerie as the new Taylorville Ward on 4 July 1960, severed and attached to Morgan on 18 April 1963, but returned to Waikerie on 1 July 1965 following further controversy.|$|R
5000|$|It was proclaimed on 23 August 1877, {{comprising}} the cadastral Hundred of Finniss, [...] "situated between the eastern {{fringe of the}} Mount Lofty Ranges and the Murray River." [...] The first meeting of the council was held on 1 September 1877 at the Bogan Hotel (now the Mannum Hotel). It had 120 ratepayers in its first year, with a <b>ratable</b> property <b>value</b> of £2,910. In the early 1880s, the council area had a population of 773. It expanded in January 1888 under the District Councils Act 1887, gaining the Hundred of Younghusband on the eastern bank of the Murray River; it also gained the northern section of the adjacent Hundred of Burdett in the same year. The council was unsubdivided until 1888, when it was divided into wards for the first time: the West, North and Central Wards (for Finniss) had two councillors each, while the South and East (for Younghusband and Burdett) had one each. A council chamber was built in 1896. There were two subsequent changes to the ward system: in 1900, when Central Ward was narrowed to only the township of Mannum, and again in 1956, when it gained an extra councillor, taking the council {{to a total of}} nine members.|$|R
