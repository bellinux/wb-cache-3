25|$|The {{control system}} is complex {{due to the}} sheer size of the {{aircraft}} and the need to compensate for aeroelastic deformation of the structure, as well as the very large friction loads of the control <b>rods,</b> <b>levers</b> etc. To keep control forces felt by the pilots to a minimum, the control system is in three distinct phases. Phase one is direct mechanical control from pilot inputs which is fed into phase two. Phase two is the intermediate powered control system with low-powered hydraulic boosters transferring commands to the third phase. Phase three is the high-powered rapid action control actuators at the main gearboxes operating the swashplates directly.|$|R

50|$|In {{a simple}} paddle wheel, where the paddles are fixed around the periphery, power is lost due to {{churning}} {{of the water}} as the paddles enter and leave the water surface. Ideally, the paddles should remain vertical while under water. This ideal can be approximated by use of levers and linkages connected to a fixed eccentric. The eccentric is fixed slightly forward of the main wheel centre. It is coupled to each paddle via a <b>rod</b> and <b>lever.</b> The geometry is designed such that the paddles are kept almost vertical for the short duration {{that they are in}} the water.|$|R
50|$|Older model {{helicopters}} use three independent servos {{to manipulate}} the swashplate. The elevator servo is used to tilt the swashplate forward and aft (longitudinal cyclic), varying the aircraft's pitch. The aileron servo is used to tilt the swashplate left and right (lateral cyclic), varying the aircraft's roll. The collective pitch servo raises and lowers the entire swashplate, varying the collective, and hence the pitch of all the rotor blades collectively. An intermediate mechanical mixing system is used to transfer the control inputs from the servos to the swashplate, therefore the name of mechanical CCPM (mCCPM). This requires an elaborate system of control <b>rods</b> and <b>levers,</b> which often contains many ball bearings.|$|R
50|$|For 1966, the twin-cable {{shift and}} park control {{mechanism}} (a holdover from the push-button operation) {{was replaced by}} a solid shift control linkage consisting of a series of pushrods, rotating <b>rods</b> and <b>levers.</b> The rear pump was eliminated, which simplified and cost-reduced the transmission but rendered push-starting impossible; Chrysler engineers reasoned that improved electrical and fuel systems reduced the need to push-start vehicles, and safety concerns weighed against doing so. The gated shift quadrants also permitted the deletion of the reverse safety blocker valve which, in TorqueFlites made through 1965, had shifted the transmission harmlessly into Neutral if the Reverse position were selected with the vehicle moving forward above approximately 3 mph.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} availability of electricity, switches at heavily travelled junctions were operated from a signal box constructed near the tracks through an elaborate system of <b>rods</b> and <b>levers.</b> The levers {{were also used}} to control railway signals to control the movement of trains over the points. Eventually, mechanical systems known as interlockings were introduced {{to make sure that}} a signal could only be set to allow a train to proceed over points when it was safe to do so. Purely mechanical interlockings were eventually developed into integrated systems with electric control. On some low-traffic branch lines, in self-contained marshalling yards, or on heritage railways, switches may still have the earlier type of interlocking.|$|R

Using a system of hydraulic dampers, mass balances, <b>rods</b> and <b>levers</b> the flaps can be adjusted automatically to cater for stick movement, in pitch, and 'g'. Initial problems with sensitivity were resolved by changes to the hydraulic damper. For the initial application the FVA was donated a VFW-Fokker FK-3 two-seat glider, into which the system was fitted.

40|$|A convenient, portable, {{hand-operated}} surface-sediment sampler for use {{in shallow}} water is described. Collection of replicable, undisturbed surface sediment samples from shallow-water locations is made simple. The sampler is highly portable for use at remote sites and can be operated by one person. It is especially useful for sampling in the 0. 3 – 1. 3 m water depth range where other samplers are often unsuccessful. This sampler consists of a PVC tube (about 33 -cm length, 7. 1 -cm diameter) attached to a 1 -m-long supporting <b>rod.</b> A <b>lever</b> system is used to close off the PVC core tube. In the open position, the core tube is inserted into the sediment to an optimal depth (typically 1 -cm) so that a 1 -cm disc of surface sediment is enclosed. This disc is then isolated by operating the lever and tube closure plate.

5000|$|A dive from steam-powered surface {{operation}} normally required 30 minutes. [...] Minimum {{time needed to}} secure the main engines, shift to battery motors and dive under emergency conditions was nearly 5 minutes, which though better than the 15 minutes of the Swordfish prototype was considered barely adequate. The boiler fires were first extinguished to prevent submerged buildup of fumes: a complicated series of hydraulics and mechanical <b>rods</b> and <b>levers</b> lowered the twin funnels {{away from each other}} to a horizontal position in wells in the superstructure as well as simultaneously closing hatches over the funnel uptakes. The main intake ventilators were likewise closed along with sea water connections for condensers and boiler feed. It was considered that with their 24 kn of speed the submarines could turn and outrun almost any threat if they were attacked on the surface, dispensing with a need for a rapid dive. This was perhaps wishful thinking, and just excused the fact that the record breaking 'crash dives' of the conventional boats (particularly the later World War II U boats) was unattainable.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from its}} ability to alter its camber, each low-mounted wing of the AL5 was {{externally}} unremarkable, with a rectangular plan out to broadly rounded tips. There were two spars, rigidly and conventionally joined together. The plywood covered {{leading and trailing edges}} were each rigid structures but they were hinged on duralumin tubes which ran through the lower parts of the forward and rear spars respectively. Their angular positions were controlled together via <b>rod</b> and <b>lever</b> linkages and determined the profile of the surfaces between the spars. As the edges were rotated downwards, the underside surface bent upwards; spacers kept the local thickness constant so the upper surface curvature also increased, as did the overall camber. As a result, the upper side surface path between the spars increased, so extra skin was allowed to slide out from under the upper side of the trailing edge. There were three wing settings, one for take-off, one for speed and a third for landing. [...] Lachassagne estimated that the camber-changing features added about 15% to the weight of the wing. Broad chord ailerons occupied about 40% of the span. Each wing was wire braced with two pairs of long Vs from the spars at about mid-span, one to the upper fuselage and the other to the landing gear.|$|R
50|$|To fire, the gunner first {{removes the}} safety pin {{located at the}} rear of the tube, which unblocks the firing rod. He then takes a firing {{position}} ensuring that no one is present in the back blast area. If firing from the prone position, he must also place his legs well to the side to avoid burning himself. Then the gunner moves back the front and rear sight covers, allowing the sights to pop up into their firing positions. The AT4 has iron sights that were originally developed for the cancelled Viper, and are similar in concept and use to those on assault rifles. He then removes the first of two safeties by moving the firing <b>rod</b> cocking <b>lever</b> (located on the left side) forward and then over the top to the right side. The gunner takes aim, while at the same time holding down the red safety lever located in front of the cocking lever, and then fires by pressing forward the red firing button with his right thumb. Both the red safety lever and the firing button must be pressed down at the same time to fire the AT4. The red firing button has a similar resistance to the trigger pull of an assault rifle, so the gunner does not have to jab at the firing button, which could throw his aim off.|$|R

The TS3 engine used a single crankshaft beneath the cylinders, each piston driving it through a connecting <b>rod,</b> a rocker <b>lever</b> and a second connecting rod. The crankshaft had six crankpins and there were six rockers. The engine was a two-stroke, compression-ignition diesel engine with uniflow-ported cylinders. Scavenging was performed by a Roots blower. which was mounted on the front of the engine and driven by a long quill shaft from a chain drive at the rear of the engine. Although the engines gained a reputation for good performance, this quill shaft was somewhat prone to breaking if over-worked.|$|R
40|$|A {{latching}} {{device is}} disclosed which is lever operated sequentially to actuate {{a set of}} collet fingers to provide a radial expansion and to actuate a force mechanism to provide a compressive gripping force for attaching first and second devices to one another. The latching device includes a body member having elongated collet fingers which, in a deactuated condition, is insertable through bores on {{the first and second}} devices so that gripping terminal portions on the collet fingers are proximate {{to the end of the}} bore of the first device while a spring assembly on the body member is located proximate to the outer surface of a second device. A lever is rotatable through 90 deg to move a latching rod to sequentially actuate and expand collet fingers and to actuate the spring assembly by compressing it. During the first 30 deg of movement of the lever, the collet fingers are actuated by the latching rod to provide a radial expansion and during the last 60 deg of movement of the lever, the spring assembly acts as a force mechanism and is actuated to develop a compressive latching force on the devices. The latching <b>rod</b> and <b>lever</b> are connected by a camming mechanism.

40|$|The present work {{concerns}} the dynamic simulation of a control {{system for a}} rotary wing RPAS in autonomous flight. The study has been conducted in the MATLAB and Simulink environment: the former is used to load {{the parameters of the}} reference helicopter and the dimensions of the <b>rods</b> and <b>levers</b> used in the system; the latter is used to execute the dynamic simulation itself. It is worth noticing the parametric nature of the SW which has been used allows the analysis to be extended to any helicopter sharing the same architecture. The references for this study are Newton’s second law of dynamics for translation and acceleration and the studies of Hohenemenser and Sissingh on the dynamics of the rotor. The starting point of this paper are previous dissertations on the dynamics of the rotorcraft with an ideal control system: these are studied, analyzed and commented; then an introduction to the relevant components of the rotor and to the architecture of the system installed to change the pitch angle of the aerodynamic surfaces is provided. This architecture has been defined {{on the basis of a}} kinematic analysis which can be found in Appendix B. Then, once the architecture is defined, the dynamics of the components of the actuation system are studied and the necessary equations are expressed. Subsequently the dynamics of the actuation system are studied in the Simulink environment and the results of the simulation are analyzed. If the performance of the actuation system proves to be suitable for the task, it is implemented into the helicopter model. In the end the results of the simulation of the helicopter flight are compared to the original model which has been taken as a starting point and the differences are then discussed and commented...|$|R
50|$|The long {{horizontal}} slats {{are held}} one above {{the other by}} the rungs of ladder cords shaped like a ladder. The lower ends of {{the legs of the}} ladder cords are secured to the long rail under the slats. Their upper ends are attached to the drive rod in the housing, the elongated box above the slats. As the drive rod rotates, one leg of each ladder cord moves up while the other moves down, causing the angle of the slats to change. In one design, this rotation is achieved by pushing up or pulling down on a long handle called a tilt wand connected to the drive <b>rod</b> by a <b>lever.</b> Lift cords along the ladder cords are also attached to the rail. They pass through holes in the slats and into the housing above, where they go over pulleys, combine and exit through the cord lock. For safety it's important that the lock always works. A downward pull on the main lift cord raises the slats by the cords pulling up the rail below the slats. The cord lock holds the main lift cord to keep the slats up until the cord is pulled to release the lock. The safety lock made the cord lock easier to use.|$|R
500|$|Holcroft’s {{valve gear}} design {{was also an}} attempt to address the {{problems}} associated with Gresley’s conjugated valve gear, which was prone to variations in valve events caused by heat expansion of the valve spindles within the pistons. The design utilised the motion of the outside valve rods (the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves, such as the combination lever) instead, although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate the rocking arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity. Holcroft’s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the pony truck and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside valve <b>rods</b> with extension <b>levers,</b> which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances. This necessitated a new design of cylinder block whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards {{and the size of the}} cylinders reduced to [...] stroke and diameter. [...] The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2-cylinder locomotives, thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the extension levers. The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front pony truck, leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft’s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service.|$|R

5000|$|Water clocks have a {{long history}} of use in Korea with the first mention of one in the records of the Samguk Sagi during the Three Kingdoms era. In 1434, during the reign of King Sejong the Great a water clock was made by Jang Yeong-sil which would mark the hour {{automatically}} with the sounds of a bell, gong, and drum. That clock, Jagyeokru ("self-striking water clock"), was used to keep the standard of time in the Joseon Dynasty. The clock was not preserved well and so in 1536, King Jungjong ordered the clock remade and improved which was done by Yu Jeon. Today, only three water bowls and two cylindrical water containers survive from the 1434 version of the clock, and no records mentioning its existence. Extensive records of 1536 version remain, and it is believed that the two clocks were very similar. In its current configuration the large bronze cylindrical water containers are 93.5 centimeters in diameter and 70 centimeters in height. The smaller ceramic vessels are 46.0 centimeters and 40.5 centimeters in height. The two bases for the ceramic vessels still survived in the Myeongjeonjeon Hall of Changgyeonggung Palace. A third version of the clock was built in 2007. The water clock worked by having water poured into the largest bronze vessel which flowed into the smaller vessels which the flowed into the long water tanks. When the water level rose to the appropriate level, a floating <b>rod</b> touched a <b>lever</b> device which caused a ball to roll and hit another ball at the other end. The rolling ball would trigger the gong, bell, drum, and even a wooden puppet which marked the hour with a placard. [...] The clepsydra does not work today because only the water holding vessels have survived. However, it is valuable because of the scientific and cultural information it holds and because there are only few examples of ancient automatic water clocks. It is the oldest and largest surviving clock of its kind.|$|R
40|$|The design {{requirements}} and initial design concept for the AXAF-I Science Instrument Module (SIM) were reviewed at Ball on September 29, 1993. The concept design SIM focus mechanism utilizes a planetary gearset, with redundant motors, {{to drive a}} large ring (called 'main housing bearing') via a spur gearset. This large drive ring actuates three tangent bar links (called 'push rods'), which in turn actuate three levers (called 'pin levers'). Each of the three pin levers rotates an 'eccentric pin,' which in turn moves {{the base of a}} bipod flexure in both the radial (normal to optical axis) and axial (focus along optical axis) directions. Three bipod flexures are employed, equally spaced at 120 degrees apart, the base of each being translated in the two directions as described above. A focus adjustment is made by rotating the drive ring, which drives the push rods and therefore the pin levers, which in turn rotate the eccentric pins, finally imparting the two motions to the base of each of the bipod flexures. The axial translation (focus adjustment) of the focused structure is the sum of the direct axial motion plus axial motion which comes from uniformly squeezing the three bipod bases radially inward. SAO documented the following concerns regarding the focus mechanism in memo WAP-FY 94 - 001, dated October 7, 1993 : (1) The focus adjustment depends, in large part, on the structural properties (stiffnesses and end fixities) of the bipod flexures, push <b>rods,</b> pin <b>levers</b> and eccentric pins. If these properties are not matched very well, then lateral translations as well as unwanted rotations of the focussed structure will accompany focus motion. In addition, the stackup of linkage tolerances and any nonuniform wear in the linkages will result in the same unwanted motions. Thermal gradients will also affect these motions. At the review Ball did not present supporting analyses to support their choice of this design concept. (2) The proposed 'primary' method of measuring focus is by counting motor steps. The 'backup' method is by a pot mounted on the drive ring. Neither method provides for a direct measurement of the quantity desired (focus position). This is of concern because of the long and indirect relationship between focus and the sensed quantity (drive ring rotation). There are three sinusoidal relationships and structural stiffness in the path, and the resulting calibration is likely to be highly nonlinear. These methods would require an accurate ground calibration. (3) Ground calibration (and verification) of focus vs. drive position must be done in 1 -g on the ground. This calibration will be complicated by both the structural characteristics of the bipods {{and the fact that the}} CG of the translating portion of the SIM is not on the optical axis (thereby causing unwated rotations and changing the focus position vs. motor step and pot readout relationships). The SIM translating weight could be offloaded, but the calibration then becomes sensitive to any errors in offloading (both magnitude and direction). There are concerns as to whether a calibration to the required accuracy can be accomplished on the ground. (4) The choice of a potentiometer as the focus position sensor is questionable in terms of reliability for a five year mission. The results of SAO's study of items 1, 2 and 3 described above are presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|A robot {{should be}} able to {{autonomously}} modify and utilize its environment to assist its task completion. While mobile manipulators and humanoid robots have both locomotion and manipulation capabilities, planning systems typically just consider one or the other. In traditional motion planning the planner attempts to find a collision free path from the robot's current configuration to some goal configuration. In general, this process entirely ignores the fact that the robot has manipulation capabilities. This is in contrast to how humans naturally act - utilizing their manipulation capabilities to modify the environment to assist locomotion. If necessary, humans do not hesitate to move objects, such as chairs, out of their way or even place an object, such as a board, on the ground to reach an otherwise unreachable goal. We argue that robots should demonstrate similar behavior. Robots should use their manipulation capabilities to move or even use environment objects. This thesis aims at bringing robots closer to such capabilities. There are two primary challenges in developing practical systems that allow a real robotic system to tightly couple its manipulation and locomotion capabilities: the inevitable inaccuracies in perception as well as actuation that occur on physical systems, and the exponential size of the search space. To address these challenges, this thesis first extends the previously introduced domain of Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO), which allows a robot to move obstacles out of its way. We extend the NAMO domain to handle the underlying issue of uncertainty. In fact, this thesis introduces the first NAMO framework that allows a real robotic systems to consider sensing and action uncertainties while reasoning about moving objects out of the way. However, the NAMO domain itself has the shortcoming that it only considers a robot's manipulation capabilities in the context of clearing a path. This thesis therefore also generalizes the NAMO domain itself to the Navigation Using Manipulable Obstacles (NUMO) domain. The NUMO domain enables a robot to more generally consider the coupling between manipulation and locomotion capabilities and supports reasoning about using objects in the environment. This thesis shows the relationship between the NAMO and NUMO domain, both in terms of complexity as well as solution approaches, and presents multiple realizations of the NUMO domain. The first NUMO realization enables a robot to use its manipulation capabilities to assist its locomotion by changing the geometry of the environment for scenarios in which obstructions can be overcome through the usage of a single object. The system led a real humanoid robot to autonomously build itself a bridge to cross a gap and a stair step to get on a platform. A second NUMO realization then introduces reasoning about force constraints using knowledge about the mechanical advantages of a lever and battering ram. The discussed system allows a robot to consider increasing its effective force though the use of objects, such as utilizing a <b>rod</b> as a <b>lever.</b> Finally this thesis extends the NUMO framework for geometric constraints to scenarios in which the robot is faced with a substantial lack of initial state information and only has access to onboard sensing. In summary, this thesis enables robots to autonomously modify their environment to achieve task completion in the presence of lack of support for mobility, the need to increase force capabilities and partial knowledge.
