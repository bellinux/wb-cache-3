25|$|The {{radar beam}} has a width of about 10 degrees, and pulses 2.5 degrees, so a target will {{not produce a}} single blip, {{but a number of}} them. For targets located far from the centreline, the radar would produce 4 or 5 {{individual}} blips as the scanner rotated, causing a short arc about 10 degrees wide to show on the display. A somewhat more complex interaction occurs as the target aircraft approaches the centre of the <b>radar</b> <b>scan.</b> Any target within ten degrees of the centreline will always have some radar energy falling on it no matter where the dish is pointed; a target five degrees {{to the right of the}} aircraft would still be reflecting the outer edge of the broadcast even when the scanner is pointed five degrees to the left. In this case the target will create blips throughout the entire rotation, drawing a complete ring on the display instead of a short arc. Because the antenna is more sensitive in the middle than the edges, the ring on the display will vary in brightness as the dish scans, reaching its maximum when the dish is aimed at the target, and a minimum, or disappearing entirely, when it is pointed the other direction. A target that is dead ahead will produce a complete uninterrupted circle on the display.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, shortly after Nasser's death, Omm Sety {{disclosed}} {{that she believed}} she knew the location of Nefertiti's tomb, but showed some reluctance in disclosing its [...] "most unlikely place" [...] because Seti I didn't like Akhenaten for his attempt to suppress traditional Egyptian religious practices. [...] "We don't want anything more of this family to be known." [...] She described {{the location of the}} tomb as being close to Tutankhamun's, which was counter to the then-prevailing opinion that no more new tombs would be found in the Valley of the Kings. In 1998 the ARPT group led by Nicholas Reeves began exploring in the area of Tutankhamun's tomb, based on two anomalies found during a sonar sounding in 1976. During the dig two undisturbed seals of the 20th dynasty scribe Wen-nefer, a well-known person whose seal has been found on many Valley tombs, were discovered. A <b>radar</b> <b>scan</b> in 2000 produced evidence of two empty chambers, but the work was halted pending an investigation into the theft of antiquities. In 2006 Otto Shaden, on a completely unrelated dig, accidentally burst into one of the [...] "anomalies" [...] (later numbered KV63), which contained particularly fine examples of mummification supplies used for a royal burial, presumably nearby. Reeves' opinion is that the second [...] "anomaly" [...] is likely to be an undisturbed tomb. In August 2015 a new paper was published by the egyptologist Nicholas Reeves, likely confirming the finding.|$|E

Weather radars resemble search radars, but use radio waves with circular polarization and a wavelength to reflect from water droplets. Some weather radar use the Doppler effect to measure wind speeds.|$|R

50|$|This is {{the first}} terrain-following radar for use on manned aircraft, {{designed}} by Mr. Bart Bechtel, a former Navy engineer, who had designed a <b>radar</b> <b>scan</b> template control technique that permitted safe aircraft descent in adverse weather. The concept was the basis of winning a $750,000 US Army contract to develop a radar system to automatically guide a drone aircraft. The US Army did not pursue the project to production, but the US Air Force became interested and believed that Bechtel's innovation would protect the low-flying planes.|$|E

While the crew is in hibernation en route, the just-arrived second wave of probes commence a compounded <b>radar</b> <b>scan</b> of the subsurface of Burns-Caulfield, but this immediately causes the object to self-destruct. Theseus is re-routed mid-flight to the new-found destination of the signal: a previously undetected gas-giant deep in the Oort Cloud, dubbed 'Big Ben'.|$|E
30|$|It is {{difficult}} for a jammer to deceive radar in real time due to the fast scanning speed of the radar antenna.

50|$|The missile is {{fitted with}} a multi-element IIR seeker capable of +/-90 degree off {{boresight}} angles. The missile seeker can be slaved to a Helmet Mounted Display (HMD), allowing the pilot to track a target beyond the aircraft's <b>radar</b> <b>scan</b> envelope using the missile's high off-boresight capability, achieved by the pilot turning his head towards the target to lock-on, better known as “look and shoot”. Flight is controlled by a thrust-vector controlled solid rocket motor and free-moving type control wings on the missile's tail. The central portion of the missile has long, thin strakes, which help maintain missile maneuverability in the terminal homing stage after the rocket motor stops firing.|$|E

The missile can then be launched and can immediately pull extreme g-force to reverse its course to engage a target behind the aircraft, sometimes called an [...] "over-the-shoulder". Engage modes include Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) capability to engage targets outside its seeker's acquisition range, and Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) capability where the target is identified and designated before launch. The two colour thermal imaging technology and a laser proximity fuse fitted on the missile provide multiple Electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) techniques with targeting algorithms including advanced spatial filtering techniques and velocity profiling.|$|E
50|$|For {{visualization}} on {{a modern}} computer screen the polar coordinates {{have to be}} converted into Cartesian coordinates. This process called <b>radar</b> <b>scan</b> conversion is presented with more detail in the next section.The second problem to solve arises {{from the fact that}} a radar system is placed in the real world and measures real world echo positions. These echoes have to be displayed together with other real world data like object positions, vector maps and satellite images in a consistent way. All this information refers to the curved earth surface but is dis-played on a flat computer display. Building a link from real world earth positions to dis-play pixels is commonly called geographical referencing or in short geo-referencing.Part of the geo-referencing process is to map the 3D earth surface onto a 2D display. This process of a geographical projection can be performed in many ways, but different data sources have their own ‘natural’ projection. E.g. Cartesian radar video data from a radar source on the earth surface are geo-referenced by a so-called radar projection. When using this radar projection the Cartesian radar video pixels can directly displayed on a computer screen (only being linearly transformed according to the current position on the screen and e.g. the current zoom level).A problem now arises if e.g. also a satellite map shall be shown together with the radar video data. The ‘natural’ geographical projection of a satellite image would be a satellite projection which depends on the satellite orbit, position and further parameters. Now either the satellite image has to be reprojected to a radar projection or the radar video has to use the satellite projection. This geographical re-projection is also called geographical warping or Geo Warping where each image pixel has to be transformed from one projection into another.This article describes in further detail the Geo Warping of radar video images in real time. It will also show that radar video Geo Warping is done most efficiently when it is integrated with the <b>radar</b> <b>scan</b> conversion process.|$|E

50|$|From October 1, 1979 to July 1991, KOKH aired two-minute-long newsbriefs each hour, branded as Newstouch 25, from 6:00 a.m. until {{sign-off}} (usually around 1:30 a.m.); some {{morning and}} late night updates were pre-recorded. Among those who anchored the updates were Mike Monday, Karie Ross, Felicia Ferguson (who won the Miss Oklahoma pageant in 1985), Janis Walkingstick and Kelly Ogle (now evening anchor at KWTV). Until the late 1980s, the station also produced Weathertouch 25, two-minute-long weather updates that aired on the half-hour during the broadcast day; the segments (featuring weathercasters such as Ross Dixon, Dan Satterfield and Kevin Foreman) utilized the first colorized <b>radar</b> <b>scan</b> converter and satellite picture colorizer in Oklahoma, and used live radar {{data from the}} National Weather Service Terminal Doppler site at Will Rogers World Airport. The station also produced several public affairs and interview programs including Meet The Mayor (an interview program featuring discussions and viewer questions with the Mayor of Oklahoma City), Woman to Woman (which featured discussions about women's issues) and Sunday PM (a weekly talk show focusing on prominent people, issues and events in Oklahoma City).|$|E
50|$|The {{radar sensor}} is {{positioned}} {{on the earth}} surface with a height h above the ground. It measures the direct distance d to the target (and not e.g. the distance the target is away from the radar if one would move on the earth surface). This distance is then used in the display plane after adjustment to the current display zoom level by the <b>radar</b> <b>scan</b> converter (RSC).Now {{it has to be}} clarified how the radar video data is geo referenced. This basically means, that if we want to display a geographical real world object (like e.g. a light house) which is at the same real world position as the radar target, that it also shall appear at the same position in the display plane. This is realized by calculating the distance from the radar sensor to the respective real world object and use that distance in the display plane. The position of the real world object is typically given in geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude and height above the earth surface).In other words, using a radar projection with geographical data is done by simulating a radar measurement process with the real world objects and use the resulting range and azimuth in the display plane.|$|E
