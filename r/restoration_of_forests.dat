Some analysts have blamed the expansion of rubber for greatly contributing to the conversion of mature tropical forest in both Indonesia and Malaysia. The paper critically examines to what extent smallholder rubber production actually led to forest conversion in West Kalimantan (Indonesia) and neighbouring Sarawak (Malaysia). The paper concludes that the introduction of rubber in West Kalimantan contributed little to encroachment into primary forest. Rather, it apparently favoured the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> in areas where land use became less intensive. This happens only where specific conditions in the local context allowed this to take place. The findings suggest that tree technologies should be preferred when trying to improve local agriculture.

40|$|Governance {{of forest}} {{restoration}} is significantly impacted by {{who are the}} owners of and rights holders to the forest. We review two cases, Paraguay’s Atlantic forest and Madagascar’s forests and shrublands, where forest restoration is a priority and where forest ownership and rights are having direct repercussions on forest restoration. In Paraguay where {{a large proportion of}} forests {{are in the hands of}} private landowners, specific legislation, government incentives, costs and benefits of forest restoration, and the role of international markets for commodities are all key factors, among others, that influence the choice of private landowners to engage or not in forest restoration. On the other hand, in Madagascar’s co-managed state forests, while some similar challenges exist with forest restoration, such as the pressures from international markets, other specific challenges can be identified notably the likely long term impact of investment in forest restoration on land rights, traditional authority, and direct links to elements of human wellbeing. In this paper, we explore and contrast how these different drivers and pressures affect the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> under these two different property regimes...|$|E
40|$|Inclusion of {{improved}} forest management {{as a way}} to enhance carbon sinks in the Copenhagen Accord of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (December 2009) suggests that forest restoration will play a role in global climate change mitigation under the post-Kyoto agreement. Although discussions about restoration strategies often pertain solely to severely degraded tropical forests and invoke only the enrichment planting option, different approaches to restoration are needed to counter the full range of degrees of degradation. We propose approaches for <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> that range from being slightly to severely degraded. Our methods start with ceasing the causes of degradation and letting forests regenerate on their own, progress through active management of natural regeneration in degraded areas to accelerate tree regeneration and growth, and finally include the stage of degradation at which re-planting is necessary. We argue that when the appropriate techniques are employed, forest restoration is cost-effective relative to conventional planting, provides abundant social and ecological co-benefits, and results in the sequestration of substantial amounts of carbon. For forest restoration efforts to succeed, a supportive post-Kyoto agreement is needed as well as appropriate national policies, institutional arrangements, and local participation...|$|E

40|$|Because {{ecosystem}} services {{are generally not}} produced and {{used in the same}} place, their assessment should consider the flows of services from ecosystems to users. These flows depend on the characteristics and spatial distribution of ecosystems and users, the spatial relationships between them, and the presence of filters or barriers between ecosystems and users. The objective {{of this paper is to}} map the {{ecosystem services}} provided to the Costa Rican and Nicaraguan hydroelectric sectors, which are crucial sectors for national sustainable development and depend directly on hydrological ecosystem services. The paper presents an approach for modelling the flows of multiple services from diverse ecosystems to diverse users through different kinds of filters in a landscape. The approach uses expert knowledge and fuzzy numbers to handle uncertainties. The analyses for Costa Rica and Nicaragua show how the approach helps identify priority areas for the conservation and <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> for the services they provide to the hydroelectric sector. As such, it is a useful tool for defining spatially targeted policies for the conservation of ecosystem services and for involving the users of ecosystem services in ecosystem management.

40|$|Payments for {{environmental}} services (PES) are globally a highly promising {{tool for the}} conservation and <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> and other environmental assets. In developing countries, a series of experiments with this emerging instrument are underway. Is Vietnam one of the countries where important PES experiences have been made? This report clearly answers this question with “no”. Based on field work in four provinces of Northern and Central Vietnam and interviews in Hanoi, the authors found important domestic concerns {{for environmental}} services in Vietnam, in particular the protection of watersheds. But {{there are a number}} of major obstacles to the use of PES. First and foremost, the State has so far allocated little forestland to households – much less areas that are critical in terms of environmental services. There is thus no real land-use choice whether or not to ‘provide ’ environmental services, since protection is ensured by quite effective command-and-control policies, thus conflicting with the voluntary nature of PES agreements. Second, those conservation-oriented payments that do exist, notably Programme 327 and its successor Programme 661, are designed to cover the opportunity costs of labour in the protection of State forests; they are basically forest-guard salary payments. But they typically mak...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{managers}} are often required to restore forest stands following natural disturbances, {{a situation that}} may become more common and more challenging under global change. In parts of Central Europe, particularly in mountain regions dominated by mixed temperate forests, the use of relatively low intensity, uneven-aged silviculture is a common management approach. Because this type of management is based on mimicking less intense disturbances, the restoration of more severe disturbance patches within forested landscapes has received little attention. The goal {{of this paper is}} to synthesize research on the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> damaged by disturbances in temperate forests of Slovenia and neighbouring regions of Central Europe, where uneven-aged silviculture is practiced. Research indicates that active management aimed at favouring mixed uneven-aged forest reduces the risk of disturbance and improves the resilience of stands. Salvage logging may have positive or negative effects on regeneration, much of which is due to the method applied and the quality of work. The most prominent factors that negatively affect restoration are: lack of advanced regeneration and decomposed woody debris, high altitude, steep slopes, dense ground vegetation, and overbrowsing. Planting or sowing should be applied in post-disturbance forests where many negative factors interact and where a high demand for sustainability of forest ecosystem services is present...|$|E

40|$|Plant invasions {{and land}} cover changes are two {{important}} threats to biodiversity. River valleys, which are considered as hotspots of biodiversity, {{have been subjected}} to the both threats for centuries. Here we examined the impact of river bed proximity and land cover heterogeneity on the species richness of native, red-listed and invasive plants as well as the spatial associations between the three plant groups for alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity. Surveys were conducted in 140 plots (1 km^{ 2 } each) in the San River Valley (SE Poland). Our study showed that proximity to the river bed and land cover diversity was positively associated with both native and invasive plant species richness. The species richness of all three plant groups in the studied plots (alpha-diversity) was positively correlated across space. However, invasive plant species richness was negatively linked to beta- and gamma-diversity of native and red-listed species. In contrast, native plant species richness correlated neither with beta- nor with gamma-diversity of invasive species, thus, the hampering effect of high species richness on invasions was not confirmed. We conclude that studies of invasive plants should include multiple diversity levels as the effects may be hidden when evaluations are only made at the local spatial scale (alpha-diversity). Our study suggests that maintenance and <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> close to the river may hamper alien plant invasions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractManagement of {{ecological}} conditions and processes in multiownership landscapes requires cooperation by diverse stakeholder groups. The structure of organizational networks – {{the extent to}} which networks allow for interaction among organizations within and across ideological and geographic boundaries – can indicate potential opportunities for cooperation on landscape-scale problems. In the arid landscapes of the western United States, where increasingly large wildfires burn irrespective of property boundaries and land designations, organizations involved in the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> and the protection of property from wildfire could benefit from working together to share information and coordinate strategies. We investigated patterns of interaction among organizations concerned with increasingly uncharacteristic wildfire risk in the Eastern Cascades Ecoregion of Oregon for evidence of structural conditions that create opportunity for cooperation. Through social network analysis of interview data, we found that despite sharing concern about wildfire risk in an area with a common set {{of ecological}} conditions, organizations with forest restoration and fire protection goals comprised distinct networks, as did organizations that focused on different geographic areas of the ecoregion. When interpreted through the lens of social capital and organizational theory these findings raise questions about {{the extent to which}} the structure of the organizational network reflects capacity to address wildfire risk in fire-prone forests on the ecoregion-scale.

40|$|Questions: How are {{the early}} {{survival}} {{and growth of}} seedlings of Everglades tree species planted in an experimental setting on artificial tree islands affected by hydrology and substrate type? What {{are the implications of}} these responses for broader tree island restoration efforts? Location: Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment (LILA), Boynton Beach, Florida, USA. Methods: An experiment was designed to test hydrological and substrate effects on seedling growth and survivorship. Two islands – a peat and a limestone-core island representing two major types found in the Everglades – were constructed in four macrocosms. A mixture of eight tree species was planted on each island in March of 2006 and 2007. Survival and height growth of seedlings planted in 2006 were assessed periodically during the next two and a half years. Results: Survival and growth improved with increasing elevation on both tree island substrate types. Seedlings 2 ̆ 7 survival and growth responses along a moisture gradient matched species distributions along natural hydrological gradients in the Everglades. The effect of substrate on seedling performance showed higher survival of most species on the limestone tree islands, and faster growth on their peat-based counterparts. Conclusions: The present results could have profound implications for <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> on existing landforms and artificial creation of tree islands.
