5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E

5|$|As a <b>result,</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{attempt to}} avoid a naval {{conflict}} with the superior British Royal Navy, Portugal adjusted the borders of her colony and the modern borders of Mozambique were established in May 1881. Control of Mozambique was left to various organisations such as the Mozambique Company, the Zambezi Company and the Niassa Company which were financed and provided with cheap labour by the British Empire to work mines and construct railways. These companies penetrated inland from the coastline, setting up plantations and taxing the local populace who had until then resisted encroachment by the colonists.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Cochrane has {{completed}} {{the first two}} steps introducing his interest-based rights approach; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Peter Singer, is rejected because of its failure to take individuals seriously enough; Cochrane desires an account which takes well-being seriously but is not purely aggregative. This, he suggests, is one based on interest rights. After explicating {{the details of his}} interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unworkably large number of rights, and that rights approaches are too rationalistic.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, he conducted experiments which showed that in the fission process, neutrons were emitted. In early 1939 he envisaged {{that a large number}} of fissions could occur and if this happened within a sufficiently short time, then considerable amounts of energy could be released. He went on to calculate that this process could occur in less than a microsecond, and as a consequence would <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> explosion.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|In a {{practical}} implementation, the variables {{used to represent}} the indices will often be of fixed size, and this can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> arithmetic overflow for very large arrays.

If L and R are nonnegative, this can be avoided by calculating the midpoint as L + (R minus& L) / 2.|$|E

50|$|A {{change to}} any of this {{information}} might <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different premium being charged if the change <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different actuarial class or risk level for that variable.

However, <b>a</b> change <b>in</b> driver age from 38 to 45 may <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different premium because the records of the insurer indicate <b>a</b> difference <b>in</b> risk associated with those ages and, therefore, the age difference <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> change <b>in</b> actuarial class or assigned risk level.|$|R

5|$|Nixon {{approved}} a secret B-52 carpet bombing campaign of North Vietnamese (and, later, allied Khmer Rouge) positions in Cambodia in March 1969 (code-named Operation Menu), {{without the consent}} of Cambodian leader Norodom Sihanouk. In mid-1969, Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese, sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders, and peace talks began in Paris. Initial talks, however, did not <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> agreement. In May 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam provided North Vietnam also did so and for South Vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with Viet Cong participation.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{within the}} Labour Party there was {{disagreement}} {{about whether or}} not to build the Hardanger Bridge. In addition to crossing the Hardangerfjord, there were concerns that the bridge would increase the traffic through Hardangervidda National Park, and that it subsequently would <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> all-year road being built with subsequent negative impact on nature and wildlife. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of the Labour Party stated on 10 October 1995 that the government was in favor of the Triangle Link and opposed to the Hardanger Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Reflections in {{more complex}} scenarios, such as {{found on a}} network of cables, can result in very {{complicated}} and long lasting waveforms on the cable. Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as they are known persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E

25|$|This <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loss of {{function}} of the cycle, and <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> accumulation of glutamate. This glutamate further stimulates the NMDA receptors, thus acting synergistically with quinolinic acid to increase its neurotoxic effect by increasing the levels of glutamate, as well as inhibiting its uptake. In this way, quinolinic acid self-potentiates its own toxicity. Furthermore, quinolinic acid <b>results</b> <b>in</b> changes of the biochemistry {{and structure of the}} astrocytes themselves, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> apoptotic response. A loss of astrocytes <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pro-inflammatory effect, further increasing the initial inflammatory response which initiates quinolinic acid production.|$|R
5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E

5|$|The {{back was}} also reconstructed {{in a more}} or less {{horizontal}} orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> elevated position of the head.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea behind}} the episode came from the {{financial}} crisis of Northern Rock in late 2007; the producers wanted {{to set up a}} story about a bank collapse so severe it could <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> economic collapse. The episode was filmed in May 2008, with a lot taking place in London's Blue Fin building. About six million viewers saw the episode from both BBC One and Three broadcasts; the BBC One ratings were steady despite heavy competition from I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! on ITV1. Critical reactions towards the episode were positive for including a change in plot.|$|E
