40|$|Abstract Background Freon {{includes}} {{a number of}} gaseous, colorless chlorofluorocarbons. Although freon is {{generally considered to be}} a fluorocarbon of relatively low toxicity; significantly detrimental effects may occur upon over exposure. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate whether occupational exposure to fluorocarbons can induce arterial hypertension, myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias, elevated levels of plasma lipids and renal dysfunction. Methods This comparative cross-sectional study was conducted at the cardiology clinic of the Suez Canal Authority Hospital (Egypt). The study included 23 apparently healthy male workers at the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>services</b> workshop who were exposed to fluorocarbons (FC 12 and FC 22) and 23 likewise apparently healthy male workers (unexposed), the control group. All the participants were interviewed using a pre-composed questionnaire and were subjected to a clinical examination and relevant laboratory investigations. Results There were no significant statistical differences between the groups studied regarding symptoms suggesting arterial hypertension and renal affection, although a significantly higher percentage of the studied <b>refrigeration</b> <b>services</b> workers had symptoms of arrhythmias. None of the workers had symptoms suggesting coronary artery disease. Clinical examination revealed that the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>services</b> workers had a significantly higher mean pulse rate compared to the controls, though no significant statistical differences were found in arterial blood pressure measurements between the two study groups. Exercise stress testing of the workers studied revealed normal heart reaction to the increased need for oxygen, while sinus tachycardia was detected in all the participants. The results of Holter monitoring revealed significant differences within subject and group regarding the number of abnormal beats detected throughout the day of monitoring (p Conclusions Unprotected occupational exposure to chlorofluorocarbons can induce cardiotoxicity in the form of cardiac arrhythmias. The role of chlorofluorocarbons in inducing arterial hypertension and coronary artery diseases is unclear, although significantly elevated serum cholesterol and urinary β 2 -microglobulin levels raise a concern. </p...|$|R

In this thesis, an automated safety suit was implemented with integrated sensors for monitoring the safety of ﬁeld <b>service</b> <b>engineers.</b> The basic idea of the prototype is to ensure safety for the ﬁeld <b>service</b> <b>engineers</b> who are working in adverse environmental conditions. This safety suit includes embedded devices which can communicate with mobile devices and by means of that provides aid for the people working in several ﬁelds such as conﬁned spaces, high altitudes etc. In this prototype, a different type of sensors are proposed for monitoring environmental and health conditions like temperature, CO gas levels, relative humidity, body temperature and heartbeat. A mobile application is proposed to monitor and control the automated safety suit, which also identiﬁes the environmental changes and provide prompt alerts to the user. Keeping the usage of automated safety suit in mind, the system is designed in a user friendly manner and all the key elements are considered and implemented accordingly for the requirements of <b>service</b> <b>engineers</b> who are working in conﬁned spaces and hazardous places...|$|R
