6000|$|But seamen learnt--what landsmen know-- [...] That neither gifts nor gain Can hold a winking Light o' Love [...] Or Fancy's flight restrain, When Anne of Austria <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> [...] On Hans the blue-eyed Dane.|$|E
60|$|She <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{round the}} young men, {{with a long}} sweep of her painted eyelashes, and flashed her yellow teeth at them. She spoke with a cockney accent, but with an {{affectation}} of refinement which made every word a feast of fun.|$|E
60|$|The yelling Ghost {{before him}} stands, See! she <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> around, Now {{she lifts her}} bony hands, Now her {{footsteps}} shake the ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "They notice nothing, these others," [...] he remarked, with {{a little}} wave of the hand. [...] "It is always the woman who counts. You are right, monsieur. She dances like a stick. She has good calves and she <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The canaille applaud. It is always like that. Your health, monsieur!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Snoopy is less helpful, however, when Patty {{complains}} that {{her hair is}} a [...] "mousey blah" [...] style. Snoopy brings in a large red gift box, and inside is a large red curly-haired wig that makes Patty look like Little Orphan Annie. After trying it on, Patty <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and dumps the wig on Snoopy's head.|$|R
60|$|When {{the girls}} had perched {{themselves}} on any available article of furniture, they waited with respectful eagerness, while Sally retired to the hall for a moment, and Julia <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> with her finger on her lips, looking {{as if she could}} tell much if she dared.|$|E
6000|$|Was {{there ever}} {{anything}} so lucky as this? Pamela's situation was fast becoming the cook's situation. The bosom of the vigourous little woman {{began to show}} signs of tender agitation--distributed over a large surface. She <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> amorously. Benjulia puffed out another mouthful of smoke. [...] "Well," [...] he repeated, [...] "who rewards Pamela?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Beneath {{the lamp}} the lady bowed, [...] 245 [...] And slowly <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> around; [...] Then drawing {{in her breath}} aloud, [...] Like one that shuddered, she unbound [...] The {{cincture}} from beneath her breast: [...] Her silken robe, and inner vest, [...] 250 [...] Dropt to her feet, and full in view, [...] Behold! her bosom and half her side-- [...] A sight to dream of, not to tell! [...] O shield her! shield sweet Christabel! ...|$|E
50|$|Highlander: The Search For Vengeance {{contains}} two Quickenings {{that occur in}} the same manner as those in the first original Highlander movie. A Japanese woman in the fields undergoes vibrations in her head and slightly <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as she becomes immortal. Colin MacLeod's Quickening by lightning takes place inside an old Stonehenge-like structure and is very similar to Connor MacLeod's Quickening in the Highlands of Scotland.|$|R
50|$|Pain of the Task: Allie and Roxanne did {{not like}} Tammy's theme {{and they were not}} {{focusing}} on the task. Tammy had a discussion with the two in order to get them focused, but Tammy could not control them. When Bill Rancic checked Synergy's progress, Allie meant to <b>roll</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in front of him; which it did not look good as Bill brought up that statement.|$|R
5000|$|Ana <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and goes}} inside her parentsâ€™ bedroom. Carmen asks Ana to come nearer, {{whispering}} {{that she needs}} Ana to cook for the family that day because she is sick. Ana erupts and says she absolutely refuses to miss her last day {{of high school and}} stomps out of the room. Moments later, Carmen gets out of bed and is apparently quite alright.|$|R
60|$|Teeka <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in his {{direction}} and strained the squirming mite still closer to her. Tarzan came nearer. Teeka drew away and bared her fangs. Tarzan was nonplussed. In all his experiences with Teeka, never before had she bared fangs at him other than in play; but today {{she did not look}} playful. Tarzan ran his brown fingers through his thick, black hair, cocked his head upon one side, and stared. Then he edged a bit nearer, craning his neck to have a better look at the thing which Teeka cuddled.|$|E
60|$|When Anna Brangwen {{heard the}} news, she pressed back {{her head and}} <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> as if {{something}} were reaching forward to bite at her throat. She pressed back her head, her mind was driven back to sleep. Since she had married and become a mother, the girl she had been was forgotten. Now, the shock threatened to break in upon her and sweep away all her intervening life, make her as a girl of eighteen again, loving her father. So she pressed back, away from the shock, she clung to her present life.|$|E
60|$|A strained, anguished look {{came into}} Mrs. Smethurst's face and was {{reflected}} in the faces of {{the other members of the}} circle. The eminent Russian had sprung two entirely new ones on them, and they felt that their ignorance was about to be exposed. What would Vladimir Brusiloff think of the Wood Hills Literary Society? The reputation of the Wood Hills Literary Society was at stake, trembling in the balance, and coming up for the third time. In dumb agony Mrs. Smethurst <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> about the room searching for someone capable of coming to the rescue. She drew blank.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she would}} <b>roll</b> <b>her</b> big <b>eyes</b> and become {{in a way}} magnificent, so that Godfrey forgot her ugliness and the {{repulsion}} with which she inspired him.|$|R
50|$|The betrothal of Evangeline Brackett to Angus McTavish is built, {{in large}} part, {{on the way}} she bites <b>her</b> lip and <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> when she tops her drive, says the Oldest Member. But when Legs Mortimer takes up {{residence}} in the Clubhouse, Evangeline's mind wanders from her golf, and Angus worries that she is losing her form for the Ladies' Medal. But the scales fall from Evangeline's eyes when Legs does the unthinkable on the links.|$|R
6000|$|No further {{does she}} say, but {{lingering}} all the day, [...] Her high-borne turban'd head she wags, and <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> darkling <b>eye,</b> [...] And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving by.|$|R
6000|$|At this especial meeting they {{intended}} {{to draw up a}} petition to the school trustees, humbly praying that a fence be put around the school grounds; and a plan was also to be discussed for planting a few ornamental trees by the church, if the funds of the society would permit of it [...] . for, as Anne said, there was no use in starting another subscription as long as the hall remained blue. The members were assembled in the Andrews' parlor and Jane was already on her feet to move the appointment of a committee which should find out and report on the price of said trees, when Gertie Pye swept in, pompadoured and frilled within an inch of her life. Gertie had a habit of being late [...] "to make her entrance more effective," [...] spiteful people said. Gertie's entrance in this instance was certainly effective, for she paused dramatically on the middle of the floor, threw up her hands, <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and exclaimed, [...] "I've just heard something perfectly awful. What DO you think? Mr. Judson Parker IS GOING TO RENT ALL THE ROAD FENCE OF HIS FARM TO A PATENT MEDICINE COMPANY TO PAINT ADVERTISEMENTS ON." ...|$|E
60|$|Little Bows, the house-friend of the family, was {{exceedingly}} wroth at {{the notion}} of Miss Fotheringay's marriage with a stripling seven or eight years her junior. Bows, who was a cripple, and owned that he was a little more deformed even than Bingley the manager, so that he could not appear on the stage, was a singular wild man of no small talents and humour. Attracted first by Miss Fotheringay's beauty, he began to teach her how to act. He shrieked out in his cracked voice the parts, and his pupil learned them from his lips by rote, and repeated them in her full rich tones. He indicated the attitudes, and set and moved those beautiful arms of hers. Those who remember this grand actress on the stage can recall how she used always precisely the same gestures, looks, and tones; how she stood on the same plank of the stage in the same position, <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> at the same instant and to the same degree, and wept with precisely the same heart-rending pathos and over the same pathetic syllable. And after she had come out trembling with emotion before the audience, and looking so exhausted and tearful that you fancied she would faint with sensibility, she would gather up her hair the instant she was behind the curtain, and go home to a mutton-chop and a glass of brown stout; and the harrowing labours of the day over, she went to bed and snored as resolutely and as regularly as a porter.|$|E
6000|$|Gabriel Nash {{introduced}} the new-comers to his companions; but the younger {{of the two}} ladies gave no sign of lending herself to this transaction. The girl was very white; she huddled there, silent and rigid, frightened to death, staring, expressionless. If Bridget Dormer had seen her at this moment she might have felt avenged for the discomfiture of her own spirit suffered at the Salon, the day before, under the challenging eyes of Maud Vavasour. It was plain at the present hour that Miss Vavasour would have run away had she not regarded the persons present as so many guards and keepers. Her appearance made Nick feel as if the little temple of art {{in which they were}} collected had been the waiting-room of a dentist. Sherringham had seen a great many nervous girls tremble before the same ordeal, and he liked to be kind to them, to say things that would help them to do themselves justice. The probability in a given case was almost overwhelmingly in favour of their having any other talent one could think of in a higher degree than the dramatic; but he could rarely refrain from some care that the occasion shouldn't be, even as against his conscience, too cruel. There were occasions indeed that could scarce be too cruel to punish properly certain examples of presumptuous ineptitude. He remembered what Mr. Nash had said about this blighted maiden, and perceived that though she might be inept she was now anything but presumptuous. Gabriel fell to talking with Nick Dormer while Peter addressed himself to Mrs. Rooth. There was no use as yet for any direct word to the girl, who was too scared even to hear. Mrs. Rooth, with her shawl fluttering about her, nestled against her daughter, putting out her hand to take one of Miriam's soothingly. She had pretty, silly, near-sighted eyes, a long thin nose, and an upper lip which projected over the under as an ornamental cornice rests on its support. [...] "So much depends--really everything!" [...] she said in answer to some sociable observation of Sherringham's. [...] "It's either this," [...] and she <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> expressively about the room, [...] "or it's--I don't know what!" ...|$|E
5000|$|James Poniewozik {{talked about}} the {{controversy}} saying that it [...] "will blow over quickly" [...] and that {{the best part of}} the episode was Claire's plot. [...] "...if not for the controversy, I probably would hardly have paid attention to this subplot. For my money {{the best part of the}} episode was Claireâ€™s preparation and debate for the council election, which featured some fine physical comedy from Julie Bowen as Claire physically fought <b>her</b> instinct to <b>roll</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and point <b>her</b> finger." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mike {{is happy}} {{he no longer}} has to pay alimony since Susan is getting remarried. Susan drags Jackson aside {{to tell him how}} much she needs Mike's money, saying, [...] "I'm sorry, but I can't marry you." [...] He points out that he'll be sent back to Canada and she <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and says, [...] "It's Canada, not Iran. It's like America with free health insurance." [...] She {{promises}} to talk to Mike {{to see if they can}} [...] "work something out." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{time will}} come, when a diviner flame[8] [...] Shall warm my breast to sing of CÃ¦sar's fame: [...] Meanwhile permit, that my preluding muse [...] In Theban wars an humbler theme may chuse: [...] 50 [...] Of furious hate {{surviving}} death, she sings, [...] A fatal throne to two contending kings, [...] And fun'ral flames that, parting wide in air, [...] Express the discord of the souls they bear:[9] [...] Of towns dispeopled, and the wand'ring ghosts [...] 55 [...] Of kings unburied in the wasted coasts; [...] When Dirce's fountain blushed with Grecian blood,[10] [...] And Thetis, near Ismenos'[11] swelling flood, [...] With dread beheld the rolling surges sweep, [...] In heaps, his slaughtered sons into the deep.[12] [...] 60 [...] What hero, Clio! wilt thou first relate?[13] [...] The rage of Tydeus,[14] or the prophet's fate?[15] [...] Or how, with hills of slain on ev'ry side, [...] Hippomedon repelled the hostile tide?[16] [...] Or how the youth[17] with ev'ry grace adorned [...] 65 [...] Untimely fell, {{to be for}} ever mourned? [...] Then to fierce Capaneus thy verse extend, [...] And sing with horror his prodigious end.[18] [...] Now wretched Oedipus, deprived of sight, [...] Led a long death in everlasting night; [...] 70 [...] But while he dwells where not a cheerful ray [...] Can pierce the darkness, and abhors the day, [...] The clear reflecting mind presents his sin [...] In frightful views, and makes it day within; [...] Returning thoughts in endless circles roll, [...] 75 [...] And thousand furies haunt his guilty soul: [...] The wretch then lifted to th' unpitying skies [...] Those empty orbs from whence he tore his eyes, [...] Whose wounds, yet fresh, with bloody hands he strook,[19] [...] While from his breast these dreadful accents broke. [...] 80 [...] "Ye gods! that o'er the gloomy regions reign, [...] Where guilty spirits feel eternal pain; [...] Thou, sable Styx! whose livid streams are rolled [...] Through dreary coasts, which I though blind behold: [...] Tisiphone,[20] that oft hast heard my pray'r, [...] 85 [...] Assist, if Oedipus deserve thy care!

[...] The fury heard, while on Cocytus'[30] brink [...] Her snakes untied, sulphureous waters drink; [...] 125 [...] But at the summons <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> around, [...] And snatched the starting serpents from the ground. [...] Not half so swiftly shoots along in air [...] The gliding lightning, or descending star. [...] Through crowds of airy shades she winged her flight, [...] 130 [...] And dark dominions of the silent night; [...] Swift as she passed the flitting ghosts withdrew,[31] [...] And the pale spectres trembled at her view: [...] To th' iron gates of TÃ¦narus[32] she flies, [...] There spreads her dusky pinions to the skies. [...] 135 [...] The day beheld, and sick'ning at the sight, [...] Veiled her fair glories in the shades of night. [...] Affrighted Atlas, on the distant shore, [...] Trembled, and shook the heav'ns and gods he bore.[33] [...] Now from beneath Malea's[34] airy height [...] 140 [...] Aloft she sprung, and steered to Thebes her flight; [...] With eager speed the well-known journey[35] took, [...] Nor here regrets the hell she late forsook. [...] A hundred snakes her gloomy visage shade, [...] A hundred serpents guard her horrid head, [...] 145 [...] In her sunk eye-balls dreadful meteors glow:[36] [...] Such rays from Phoebe's bloody circle flow, [...] When lab'ring with strong charms, she shoots from high [...] A fiery gleam, and reddens all the sky. [...] Blood stained her cheeks, and from her mouth there came [...] 150 [...] Blue steaming poisons, and a length of flame: [...] From ev'ry blast of her contagious breath [...] Famine and drought proceed, and plagues, and death. [...] A robe obscene was o'er her shoulders thrown, [...] A dress by fates and furies worn alone. [...] 155 [...] She tossed her meagre arms; her better hand[37] [...] In waving circles whirled a fun'ral brand: [...] A serpent from her left was seen to rear [...] His flaming crest, and lash the yielding air.[38] [...] But when the fury took her stand on high, [...] 160 [...] Where vast CithÃ¦ron's top salutes the sky, [...] A hiss from all the snaky tire went round: [...] } [...] The dreadful signal all the rocks rebound, [...] } [...] And through th' Achaian cities send the sound. } [...] Oete, with high Parnassus, heard the voice; [...] 165 [...] Eurotas' banks remurmured to the noise; [...] Again Leucothea shook at these alarms, [...] And pressed PalÃ¦mon closer in her arms.[39] [...] Headlong from thence the glowing fury springs, [...] And o'er the Theban palace spreads her wings,[40] [...] 170 [...] Once more invades the guilty dome, and shrouds [...] Its bright pavilions in a veil of clouds. [...] Straight with the rage of all their race possessed, } [...] Stung to the soul, the brothers start from rest, [...] } [...] And all their furies wake within their breast. [...] } [...] 175 [...] Their tortured minds repining envy tears, [...] And hate, engendered by suspicious fears; [...] And sacred thirst of sway; and all the ties [...] Of nature broke;[41] and royal perjuries; [...] And impotent desire to reign alone, [...] 180 [...] That scorns the dull reversion of a throne;[42] [...] Each would the sweets of sov'reign rule devour, [...] While discord waits upon divided power. [...] As stubborn steers by brawny plowmen broke, [...] And joined reluctant to the galling yoke, [...] 185 [...] Alike disdain with servile necks to bear [...] Th' unwonted weight, or drag the crooked share, [...] But rend the reins, and bound[43] a diff'rent way, [...] And all the furrows in confusion lay: [...] Such was the discord of the royal pair, [...] 190 [...] Whom fury drove precipitate to war. [...] In vain the chiefs contrived a specious way, [...] To govern Thebes by their alternate sway: [...] Unjust decree! while this enjoys the state, [...] That mourns in exile his unequal fate, [...] 195 [...] And the short monarch of a hasty year [...] Foresees with anguish his returning heir. [...] Thus did the league their impious arms restrain, [...] But scarce subsisted to the second reign. [...] Yet then, no proud aspiring piles were raised, [...] 200 [...] No fretted roofs with polished metals blazed; [...] No laboured columns in long order placed, [...] No Grecian stone the pompous arches graced; [...] No nightly bands in glitt'ring armour wait[44] [...] Before the sleepless tyrant's guarded gate; [...] 205 [...] No chargers[45] then were wrought in burnished gold, [...] Nor silver vases took the forming mold; [...] Nor gems on bowls embossed were seen to shine, [...] Blaze on the brims, and sparkle in the wine.[46] [...] Say, wretched rivals! what provokes your rage? [...] 210 [...] Say, to what end your impious arms engage? [...] Not all bright Phoebus views in early morn, [...] Or when his ev'ning beams the west adorn, [...] When the south glows with his meridian ray, [...] And the cold north receives a fainter day; [...] 215 [...] For crimes like these, not all those realms suffice,[47] [...] Were all those realms the guilty victor's prize! [...] But fortune now (the lots of empire thrown) [...] Decrees to proud Eteocles the crown: [...] What joys, oh tyrant! swelled thy soul that day, [...] 220 [...] When all were slaves thou couldst around survey,[48] [...] Pleased to behold unbounded power thy own, [...] And singly fill a feared and envied throne! [...] But the vile vulgar, ever discontent,[49] [...] Their growing fears in secret murmurs vent; [...] 225 [...] Still prone to change, though still the slaves of state, [...] And sure the monarch whom they have, to hate; [...] New lords they madly make, then tamely bear, [...] And softly curse the tyrants whom they fear.[50] [...] And {{one of those who}} groan beneath the sway [...] 230 [...] Of kings imposed, and grudgingly obey, [...] (Whom envy to the great, and vulgar spite [...] With scandal armed, th' ignoble mind's delight,) [...] Exclaimed--"O Thebes! for thee what fates remain, [...] What woes attend this inauspicious reign?

[...] Thou sire of gods and men, imperial Jove! [...] Is this th' eternal doom decreed above? [...] On thy own offspring hast thou fixed this fate, [...] 245 [...] From the first birth of our unhappy state; [...] When banished Cadmus, wand'ring o'er the main, [...] For lost Europa searched the world in vain, [...] And fated in Boeotian fields to found [...] A rising empire on a foreign ground, [...] 250 [...] First raised our walls on that ill-omened plain, [...] Where earth-born brothers were by brothers slain?[52] [...] What lofty looks th' unrivalled[53] monarch bears! [...] How all the tyrant in his face appears! [...] What sullen fury clouds his scornful brow! [...] 255 [...] Gods! how his eyes with threat'ning ardour glow! [...] Can this imperious lord forget to reign, [...] Quit all his state, descend, and serve again? [...] Yet, who, before, more popularly bowed? [...] Who more propitious to the suppliant crowd? [...] 260 [...] Patient of right, familiar in the throne? [...] What wonder then? he was not then alone. [...] O wretched we, a vile, submissive train, [...] Fortune's tame fools, and slaves in ev'ry reign! [...] As when two winds with rival force contend, [...] 265 [...] This way and that, the wav'ring sails they bend, [...] While freezing Boreas, and black Euros blow, [...] Now here, now there, the reeling vessel throw: [...] Thus on each side, alas! our tott'ring state [...] Feels all the fury of resistless fate, [...] 270 [...] And doubtful still, and still distracted stands, [...] While that prince threatens, and while this commands." [...] And now th' almighty father of the gods [...] Convenes a council in the blest abodes: [...] Far in the bright recesses of the skies, [...] 275 [...] High o'er the rolling heav'ns, a mansion lies, [...] Whence, far below, the gods at once survey [...] } [...] The realms of rising and declining day, [...] } [...] And all th' extended space of earth, and air, and sea. } [...] Full in the midst, and on a starry throne, [...] 280 [...] The majesty of heav'n superior shone; [...] Serene he looked, and gave an awful nod,[54] [...] And all the trembling spheres confessed the god. [...] At Jove's assent the deities around [...] In solemn state the consistory crowned.[55] [...] 285 [...] Next a long order of inferior pow'rs [...] Ascend from hills, and plains, and shady bow'rs; [...] Those from whose urns the rolling rivers flow; [...] And those that give the wand'ring winds to blow: [...] Here all their rage, and ev'n their murmurs cease,[56] [...] 290 [...] And sacred silence reigns, and universal peace. [...] A shining synod of majestic gods [...] Gilds with new lustre the divine abodes; [...] Heav'n seems improved with a superior ray, [...] And the bright arch reflects a double day. [...] 295 [...] The monarch then his solemn silence broke, [...] The still creation listened while he spoke, [...] Each sacred accent bears eternal weight, [...] And each irrevocable word is fate. [...] "How long shall man the wrath of heav'n defy, [...] 300 [...] And force unwilling vengeance from the sky! [...] Oh race confed'rate into crimes, that prove [...] Triumphant o'er th' eluded rage of Jove![57] [...] This wearied arm can scarce the bolt sustain, [...] And unregarded thunder rolls in vain: [...] 305 [...] Th' o'erlaboured Cyclops from his task retires, [...] Th' Ã†olian forge exhausted of its fires.[58] [...] For this, I suffered Phoebus' steeds to stray, [...] And the mad ruler to misguide the day; [...] When the wide earth to heaps of ashes turned, [...] 310 [...] And heaven itself the wand'ring chariot burned. [...] For this, my brother of the wat'ry reign [...] } [...] Released th' impetuous sluices of the main: [...] } [...] But flames consumed, and billows raged in vain. } [...] Two races now, allied to Jove, offend; [...] 315 [...] To punish these, see Jove himself descend. [...] The Theban kings their line from Cadmus trace, [...] From godlike Perseus those of Argive race. [...] Unhappy Cadmus' fate who does not know, [...] And the long series of succeeding woe? [...] 320 [...] How oft the furies, from the deeps of night, [...] Arose, and mixed with men in mortal fight: [...] Th' exulting mother, stained with filial blood;[59] [...] The savage hunter and the haunted wood; [...] The direful banquet why should I proclaim,[60] [...] 325 [...] And crimes that grieve the trembling gods to name? [...] Ere I recount the sins of these profane, } [...] The sun would sink into the western main, } [...] And rising, gild the radiant east again. } [...] Have we not seen (the blood of Laius shed) [...] 330 [...] The murd'ring son ascend his parent's bed, [...] Through violated nature force his way, [...] And stain the sacred womb where once he lay? [...] Yet now in darkness and despair he groans, [...] And for the crimes of guilty fate atones.

[...] Thy curse, oh Oedipus, just heav'n alarms, [...] And sets th' avenging thunderer in arms.

[...] Adrastus[61] soon, with gods averse, shall join [...] In dire alliance with the Theban line; [...] Hence strife shall rise, and mortal war succeed; [...] The guilty realms of Tantalus shall bleed; [...] 345 [...] Fixed is their doom; this all-rememb'ring breast [...] Yet harbours vengeance for the tyrant's feast."[62] [...] He said; and thus the queen of heav'n returned; [...] (With sudden grief her lab'ring bosom burned) [...] "Must I, whose cares Phoroneus'[63] tow'rs defend, [...] 350 [...] Must I, oh Jove, in bloody wars contend? [...] Thou know'st those regions my protection claim, [...] Glorious in arms, in riches, and in fame: [...] Though there the fair Egyptian heifer fed, [...] And there deluded Argus slept, and bled;[64] [...] 355 [...] Though there the brazen tower was stormed of old,[65] [...] When Jove[66] descended in almighty gold: [...] Yet I can pardon those obscurer rapes, [...] Those bashful crimes disguised in borrowed shapes; [...] But Thebes, where shining in celestial charms [...] 360 [...] Thou cam'st triumphant to a mortal's arms, [...] When all my glories o'er her limbs were spread, [...] And blazing light'nings danced around her bed;[67] [...] Cursed Thebes the vengeance it deserves, may prove: [...] Ah why should Argos feel the rage of Jove? [...] 365 [...] Yet since thou wilt thy sister-queen control, [...] Since still the lust of discord fires thy soul, [...] Go, raze my Samos, let Mycene fall, [...] And level with the dust the Spartan wall;[68] [...] No more let mortals Juno's pow'r invoke, [...] } [...] 370 [...] Her fanes no more with eastern incense smoke, } [...] Nor victims sink beneath the sacred stroke; [...] } [...] But to your Isis all my rites transfer, [...] Let altars blaze and temples smoke for her; [...] For her, through Egypt's fruitful clime renowned [...] 375 [...] Let weeping Nilus hear the timbrel sound. [...] But if thou must reform the stubborn times, [...] Avenging on the sons the father's crimes, [...] And from the long records of distant age [...] Derive incitements to renew thy rage; [...] 380 [...] Say, from what period then has Jove designed [...] To date his vengeance; to what bounds confined? [...] Begin from thence, where first Alpheus hides [...] } [...] His wand'ring stream, and through the briny tides } [...] Unmixed to his Sicilian river glides.[69] [...] } [...] 385 [...] Thy own Arcadians there the thunder claim, [...] Whose impious rites disgrace thy mighty name;[70] [...] Who raise thy temples where the chariot stood [...] Of fierce Oenomaus, defiled with blood:[71] [...] Where once his steeds their savage banquet found, [...] 390 [...] And human bones yet whiten all the ground. [...] Say, can those honours please; and canst thou love [...] Presumptuous Crete that boasts the tomb of Jove?[72] [...] And shall not Tantalus's kingdoms share [...] Thy wife and sister's tutelary care? [...] 395 [...] Reverse, O Jove, thy too severe decree, [...] Nor doom to war a race derived from, thee;[73] [...] On impious realms and barb'rous kings impose [...] Thy plagues, and curse 'em with such sons[74] as those." [...] Thus, in reproach and pray'r, the queen expressed [...] 400 [...] The rage and grief contending in her breast; [...] Unmoved remained the ruler of the sky, [...] And from his throne returned this stern reply: [...] "'Twas thus I deemed thy haughty soul would bear } [...] The dire, though just, revenge which I prepare [...] } [...] 405 [...] Against a nation thy peculiar care: [...] } [...] No less Dione might for Thebes contend, [...] Nor Bacchus less his native town defend; [...] Yet these in silence see the fates fulfil [...] Their work, and rev'rence our superior will. [...] 410 [...] For by the black infernal Styx I swear, [...] (That dreadful oath which binds the thunderer) [...] 'Tis fixed; th' irrevocable doom of Jove; [...] No force can bend me, no persuasion move. [...] Haste then, Cyllenius,[75] through the liquid air; [...] 415 [...] Go, mount the winds, and to the shades repair; [...] Bid hell's black monarch my commands obey, [...] And give up Laius to the realms of day, [...] Whose ghost yet shiv'ring on Cocytus' sand, [...] Expects its passage to the further strand: [...] 420 [...] Let the pale sire revisit Thebes, and bear [...] These pleasing orders to the tyrant's ear;[76] [...] That from his exiled brother, swelled with pride [...] Of foreign forces, and his Argive bride, [...] Almighty Jove commands him to detain [...] 425 [...] The promised empire, and alternate reign: [...] Be this the cause of more than mortal hate: [...] The rest, succeeding times shall ripen into fate." [...] The god obeys, and to his feet applies [...] Those golden wings that cut the yielding skies. [...] 430 [...] His ample hat his beamy locks o'erspread, [...] And veiled the starry glories of his head. [...] He seized the wand that causes sleep to fly, [...] Or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye; [...] That drives the dead to dark Tartarean coasts, [...] 435 [...] Or back to life compels the wand'ring ghosts. [...] Thus, through the parting clouds, the son of May [...] Wings on the whistling winds his rapid way; [...] Now smoothly steers through air his equal flight, [...] Now springs aloft, and tow'rs th' ethereal height; [...] 440 [...] Then wheeling down the steep of heav'n he flies, [...] And draws a radiant circle o'er the skies. [...] Meantime the banished Polynices roves [...] (His Thebes abandoned) through th' Aonian groves, [...] While future realms his wand'ring thoughts delight, [...] 445 [...] His daily vision and his dream by night; [...] Forbidden Thebes appears before his eye, [...] From whence he sees his absent brother fly, [...] With transport views the airy rule his own, [...] And swells on an imaginary throne. [...] 450 [...] Fain would he cast a tedious age away, [...] And live out all in one triumphant day.[77] [...] He chides the lazy progress of the sun, [...] And bids the year with swifter motion run. [...] With anxious hopes his craving mind is tost, [...] 455 [...] And all his joys in length of wishes lost. [...] The hero then resolves his course to bend [...] } [...] Where ancient Danaus' fruitful fields extend,[78] } [...] And famed Mycene's lofty towers ascend, [...] } [...] (Where late the sun did Atreus' crimes detest, [...] 460 [...] And disappeared in horror of the feast.)[79] [...] And now by chance, by fate, or furies led, [...] From Bacchus' consecrated caves he fled, [...] Where the shrill cries of frantic matrons sound, [...] And Pentheus' blood enriched the rising ground.[80] [...] 465 [...] Then sees CithÃ¦ron tow'ring o'er the plain, [...] And thence declining gently to the main. [...] Next to the bounds of Nisus' realm repairs, [...] Where treach'rous Scylla cut the purple hairs:[81] [...] The hanging cliffs of Sciron's rock explores, [...] 470 [...] And hears the murmurs of the diff'rent shores:[82] [...] Passes the strait that parts the foaming seas, [...] And stately Corinth's pleasing site surveys. [...] 'Twas now the time when Phoebus yields to night,[83] [...] And rising Cynthia sheds her silver light, [...] 475 [...] Wide o'er the world in solemn pomp she drew [...] Her airy chariot hung with pearly dew;[84] [...] All birds and beasts lie hushed; sleep steals away [...] The wild desires of men, and toils of day, [...] And brings, descending through the silent air, [...] 480 [...] A sweet forgetfulness of human care.[85] [...] Yet no red clouds, with golden borders gay, [...] Promise the skies the bright return of day; [...] No faint reflections of the distant light [...] Streak with long gleams the scatt'ring shades of night: [...] 485 [...] From the damp earth impervious vapours rise, [...] Encrease the darkness, and involve the skies. [...] At once the rushing winds with roaring sound [...] Burst from th' Ã†olian caves, and rend the ground, [...] With equal rage their airy quarrel[86] try, [...] 490 [...] And win by turns the kingdom of the sky: [...] But with a thicker night black Auster shrouds [...] The heav'ns, and drives on heaps the rolling clouds, [...] From whose dark womb a rattling tempest pours, [...] Which the cold north congeals to haily show'rs. [...] 495 [...] From pole to pole the thunder roars aloud, [...] And broken lightnings flash from ev'ry cloud. [...] Now smoaks with show'rs[87] the misty mountain-ground, [...] And floated fields lie undistinguished round. [...] Th' Inachian streams with headlong fury run, [...] 500 [...] And Erasinus[88] rolls a deluge on: [...] The foaming Lerna swells above its bounds, [...] And spreads its ancient poisons[89] o'er the grounds: [...] Where late was dust, now rapid torrents play, [...] Rush through the mounds, and bear the dams away: [...] 505 [...] Old limbs of trees from crackling forests torn, [...] Are whirled in air, and on the winds are borne: [...] The storm the dark LycÃ¦an groves displayed, [...] And first to light exposed the sacred shade.[90] [...] Th' intrepid Theban hears the bursting sky, [...] 510 [...] Sees yawning rocks in massy fragments fly,[91] [...] And views astonished, from the hills afar, [...] The floods descending, and the wat'ry war,[92] [...] That, driv'n by storms, and pouring o'er the plain, [...] Swept herds, and hinds, and houses to the main.[93] [...] 515 [...] Through the brown horrors of the night he fled, [...] Nor knows, amazed, what doubtful path to tread; [...] His brother's image to his mind appears, [...] Inflames his heart with rage, and wings his feet with fears.[94] [...] So fares a sailor on the stormy main, [...] 520 [...] When clouds conceal BoÃ¶tes' golden wain, [...] When not a star its friendly lustre keeps, [...] Nor trembling Cynthia glimmers on the deeps; [...] He dreads the rocks, and shoals, and seas, and skies, [...] While thunder roars, and lightning round him flies. [...] 525 [...] Thus strove the chief, on every side distressed, [...] Thus still his courage, with his toils increased; [...] With his broad shield opposed, he forced his way [...] Through thickest woods, and roused the beasts of prey, [...] Till he beheld, where from Larissa's[95] height [...] 530 [...] The shelving walls reflect a glancing light: [...] Thither with haste the Theban hero flies; [...] } [...] On this side Lerna's pois'nous water lies, [...] } [...] On that Prosymna's grove and temple rise:[96] } [...] He passed the gates, which then unguarded lay, [...] 535 [...] And to the regal palace bent his way; [...] On the cold marble, spent with toil, he lies, [...] And waits till pleasing slumbers seal his eyes. [...] Adrastus here his happy people sways, [...] Blest with calm peace in his declining days; [...] 540 [...] By both his parents of descent divine, [...] Great Jove and Phoebus graced his noble line: [...] Heaven had not crowned his wishes with a son, [...] But two fair daughters heired[97] his state and throne. [...] To him Apollo (wondrous to relate! [...] 545 [...] But who can pierce into the depths of fate?) [...] Had sung--"Expect thy sons[98] on Argos' shore, [...] A yellow lion and a bristly boar." [...] This long revolved in his paternal breast, [...] Sate heavy on his heart, and broke his rest; [...] 550 [...] This, great Amphiaraus, lay hid from thee, [...] Though skilled in fate, and dark futurity. [...] The father's care and prophet's art were vain, [...] For thus did the predicting god ordain.[99] [...] Lo hapless Tydeus, whose ill-fated hand [...] 555 [...] Had slain his brother, leaves his native land,[100] [...] And seized with horror in the shades of night, [...] Through the thick deserts headlong urged his flight: [...] Now by the fury of the tempest driv'n, [...] He seeks a shelter from th' inclement heav'n, [...] 560 [...] Till, led by fate, the Theban's steps he treads, [...] And to fair Argos' open court succeeds.[101] [...] When thus the chiefs from diff'rent lands resort [...] T' Adrastus' realms, and hospitable court; [...] The king surveys his guests with curious eyes, [...] 565 [...] And views their arms and habit with surprise. [...] A lion's yellow skin the Theban wears, [...] Horrid his mane, and rough with curling hairs; [...] Such once employed Alcides' youthful toils, [...] Ere yet adorned with Nemea's dreadful spoils.[102] [...] 570 [...] A boar's stiff hide, of Calydonian breed, [...] Oenides' manly shoulders overspread. [...] Oblique his tusks, erect his bristles stood, [...] Alive, the pride and terror of the wood. [...] Struck with the sight, and fixed in deep amaze, [...] 575 [...] The King th' accomplished oracle surveys, [...] Reveres Apollo's vocal caves, and owns [...] The guiding godhead, and his future sons [...] O'er all his bosom secret transports reign, [...] And a glad horror[103] shoots through ev'ry vein. [...] 580 [...] To heav'n he lifts his hands, erects his sight, [...] And thus invokes the silent queen of night. [...] "Goddess of shades, beneath whose gloomy reign [...] Yon spangled arch glows with the starry train: [...] You who the cares of heav'n and earth allay, } [...] 585 [...] Till nature quickened by th' inspiring ray [...] } [...] Wakes to new vigour with the rising day: [...] } [...] Oh thou who freest me from my doubtful state, [...] Long lost and wildered in the maze of fate! [...] Be present still, oh goddess! in our aid; [...] 590 [...] Proceed, and firm[104] those omens thou hast made. [...] We to thy name our annual rites will pay, [...] And on thy altars sacrifices lay; [...] The sable flock shall fall beneath the stroke, [...] And fill thy temples with a grateful smoke. [...] 595 [...] Hail, faithful Tripos! hail, ye dark abodes [...] Of awful Phoebus: I confess the gods!" [...] Thus, seized with sacred fear, the monarch prayed; [...] Then to his inner court the guests conveyed; [...] Where yet thin fumes from dying sparks arise, } [...] 600 [...] And dust yet white upon each altar lies, [...] } [...] The relics of a former sacrifice. [...] } [...] The king once more the solemn rites requires, [...] And bids renew the feasts, and wake the fires.[105] [...] His train obey, while all the courts around [...] 605 [...] With noisy care and various tumult sound. [...] Embroidered purple clothes the golden beds; [...] This slave the floor, and that the table spreads; [...] A third dispels the darkness of the night, [...] And fills depending lamps with beams of light. [...] 610 [...] Here loaves in canisters are piled on high, [...] And there in flames the slaughtered victims fry.[106] [...] Sublime in regal state Adrastus shone, [...] Stretched on rich carpets on his iv'ry throne; [...] A lofty couch receives each princely guest; [...] 615 [...] Around, at awful distance, wait the rest. [...] And now the king, his royal feast to grace, [...] Acestis calls, the guardian[107] of his race, [...] Who first their youth in arts of virtue trained, [...] And their ripe years in modest grace maintained; [...] 620 [...] Then softly whispered in her faithful ear, [...] And bade his daughters at the rites appear. [...] When from the close apartments of the night, [...] The royal nymphs approach divinely bright; [...] Such was Diana's, such Minerva's face; [...] 625 [...] Nor shine their beauties with superior grace, [...] But that in these a milder charm endears, [...] And less of terror in their looks appears. [...] As on the heroes first they cast their eyes, [...] O'er their fair cheeks the glowing blushes rise, [...] 630 [...] Their downcast looks a decent shame confessed, [...] Then on their father's rev'rend features rest. [...] The banquet done, the monarch gives the sign [...] To fill the goblet high with sparkling wine, [...] Which Danaus used in sacred rites of old, [...] 635 [...] With sculpture graced, and rough with rising gold. [...] Here to the clouds victorious Perseus flies, [...] } [...] Medusa seems to move her languid eyes, [...] } [...] And, ev'n in gold, turns paler as she dies.[108] } [...] There from the chace Jove's tow'ring eagle bears, [...] 640 [...] On golden wings, the Phrygian to the stars:[109] [...] Still as he rises in th' ethereal height, [...] His native mountains lessen to his sight; [...] While all his sad companions upward gaze, [...] Fixed on the glorious scene in wild amaze; [...] 645 [...] And the swift hounds, affrighted as he flies, [...] Run to the shade, and bark against the skies. [...] This golden bowl with gen'rous juice was crowned, [...] The first libations sprinkled on the ground, [...] By turns on each celestial pow'r they call; [...] 650 [...] With Phoebus' name resounds the vaulted hall. [...] The courtly train, the strangers, and the rest, [...] Crowned with chaste laurel, and with garlands dressed, [...] While with rich gums the fuming altars blaze, [...] Salute the god in num'rous hymns of praise. [...] 655 [...] Then thus the king: [...] "Perhaps, my noble guests, [...] These honoured altars, and these annual feasts [...] To bright Apollo's awful name designed, [...] Unknown, with wonder may perplex your mind. [...] Great was the cause; our old solemnities [...] 660 [...] From no blind zeal, or fond tradition rise; [...] But saved from death, our Argives yearly pay [...] These grateful honours to the god of day. [...] "When by a thousand darts the Python slain [...] With orbs unrolled lay cov'ring all the plain,[110] [...] 665 [...] (Transfixed as o'er Castalia's streams he hung, [...] And sucked new poisons with his triple tongue)[111] [...] To Argos' realms the victor god resorts, [...] And enters old Crotopus' humble courts. [...] This rural prince one only daughter blest, [...] 670 [...] That all the charms of blooming youth possessed; [...] Fair was her face, and spotless was her mind, [...] Where filial love with virgin sweetness joined. [...] Happy! and happy still she might have proved, [...] Were she less beautiful, or less beloved! [...] 675 [...] But Phoebus loved, and on the flow'ry side [...] Of Nemea's stream, the yielding fair enjoyed: [...] Now, ere ten moons their orb with light adorn, [...] Th' illustrious offspring of the god was born; [...] The nymph, her father's anger to evade, [...] 680 [...] Retires from Argos to the sylvan shade; [...] To woods and wilds the pleasing burden bears, [...] And trusts her infant to a shepherd's cares. [...] "How mean a fate, unhappy child! is thine? [...] Ah how unworthy those of race divine? [...] 685 [...] On flow'ry herbs in some green covert laid, [...] His bed the ground, his canopy the shade,[112] [...] He mixes with the bleating lambs his cries, } [...] While the rude swain his rural music tries } [...] To call soft slumbers on his infant eyes. [...] } [...] 690 [...] Yet ev'n in those obscure abodes to live, [...] Was more, alas! than cruel fate would give, [...] For on the grassy verdure as he lay, [...] And breathed the freshness of the early day, [...] Devouring dogs the helpless infant tore, [...] 695 [...] Fed on his trembling limbs, and lapped the gore. [...] Th' astonished mother, when the rumour came, [...] Forgets her father, and neglects her fame; [...] With loud complaints she fills the yielding air, [...] And beats her breast, and rends her flowing hair; [...] 700 [...] Then wild with anguish to her sire she flies: [...] Demands the sentence, and contented dies. [...] "But touched with sorrow for the dead too late, [...] The raging god prepares t' avenge her fate. [...] He sends a monster, horrible and fell,[113] [...] 705 [...] Begot by furies in the depths of hell.[114] [...] The pest a virgin's face and bosom bears; [...] } [...] High on a crown a rising snake appears, [...] } [...] Guards her black front, and hisses in her hairs: } [...] About the realm she walks her dreadful round, [...] 710 [...] When night with sable wings o'erspreads the ground, [...] Devours young babes before their parents' eyes, [...] And feeds and thrives on public miseries.[115] [...] "But gen'rous rage the bold Choroebus warms, [...] Choroebus, famed for virtue, as for arms; [...] 715 [...] Some few like him, inspired with martial flame, [...] Thought a short life well lost for endless fame. [...] These, where two ways in equal parts divide, [...] } [...] The direful monster from afar descried; [...] } [...] Two bleeding babes depending at her side; [...] } [...] 720 [...] Whose panting vitals, warm with life, she draws, [...] And in their hearts embrues her cruel claws. [...] The youths surround her with extended spears; [...] But brave Choroebus in the front appears, [...] Deep in her breast he plunged his shining sword, [...] 725 [...] And hell's dire monster back to hell restored. [...] Th' Inachians[116] view the slain with vast surprize, [...] Her twisting volumes and her rolling eyes, [...] Her spotted breast, and gaping womb embrued [...] With livid poison, and our children's blood. [...] 730 [...] The crowd in stupid wonder fixed appear, [...] Pale ev'n in joy, nor yet forget to fear. [...] Some with vast beams the squalid corpse engage, [...] And weary all the wild efforts of rage. [...] The birds obscene, that nightly flocked to taste, [...] 735 [...] With hollow screeches fled the dire repast; [...] And rav'nous dogs, allured by scented blood, [...] And starving wolves ran howling to the wood. [...] "But fired with rage, from cleft Parnassus' brow } [...] Avenging Phoebus bent his deadly bow, [...] } [...] 740 [...] And hissing flew the feathered fates below: [...] } [...] A night of sultry clouds involved around [...] The tow'rs, the fields, and the devoted ground: [...] And now a thousand lives together fled, [...] } [...] Death with his scythe cut off the fatal thread,[117] } [...] 745 [...] And a whole province in his triumph led. [...] } [...] "But Phoebus, asked why noxious fires appear, [...] And raging Sirius blasts the sickly year, [...] Demands their lives by whom his monster fell, [...] And dooms a dreadful sacrifice to hell. [...] 750 [...] "Blest be thy dust, and let eternal fame [...] Attend thy manes, and preserve thy name, [...] Undaunted hero![118] who divinely brave, [...] In such a cause disdained thy life to save; [...] But viewed the shrine with a superior look, [...] 755 [...] And its upbraided godhead thus bespoke: [...] "With piety, the soul's securest guard, [...] And conscious virtue, still its own reward, [...] Willing I come, unknowing how to fear; [...] Nor shalt thou, Phoebus, find a suppliant here. [...] 760 [...] Thy monster's death to me was owed alone, [...] And 'tis a deed too glorious to disown. [...] Behold him here, for whom, so many days, [...] Impervious clouds concealed thy sullen rays; [...] For whom, as man no longer claimed thy care, [...] 765 [...] Such numbers fell by pestilential air! [...] But if th' abandoned race of human kind [...] From gods above no more compassion find; [...] If such inclemency in heav'n can dwell, } [...] Yet why must unoffending Argos feel [...] } [...] 770 [...] The vengeance due to this unlucky steel? } [...] On me, on me, let all thy fury fall, [...] Nor err from me, since I deserve it all: [...] Unless our desert cities please thy sight, [...] Or fun'ral flames reflect a grateful light. [...] 775 [...] Discharge thy shafts, this ready bosom rend, [...] And to the shades a ghost triumphant send; [...] But for my country let my fate atone, [...] Be mine the vengeance, as the crime my own. [...] "Merit distressed, impartial heav'n relieves: [...] 780 [...] Unwelcome life relenting Phoebus gives; [...] For not the vengeful pow'r, that glowed with rage, [...] With such amazing virtue durst engage. [...] The clouds dispersed, Apollo's wrath expired, [...] And from the wond'ring god th' unwilling[119] youth retired. [...] 785 [...] Thence we these altars in his temple raise, [...] And offer annual honours, feasts, and praise; [...] These solemn feasts propitious Phoebus please; [...] These honours, still renewed, his ancient wrath appease." [...] "But say, illustrious guest," [...] adjoined the king, [...] 790 [...] "What name you bear, from what high race you spring? [...] The noble Tydeus stands confessed, and known [...] Our neighbour prince, and heir of Calydon. [...] Relate your fortunes, while the friendly night [...] And silent hours to various talk invite." [...] 795 [...] The Theban bends on earth his gloomy eyes, [...] Confused, and sadly thus at length replies: [...] "Before these altars how shall I proclaim, [...] O gen'rous prince! my nation, or my name, [...] Or through what ancient veins our blood has rolled? [...] 800 [...] Let the sad tale for ever rest untold! [...] Yet if propitious to a wretch unknown, [...] You seek to share in sorrows not your own; [...] Know, then, from Cadmus I derive my race, [...] Jocasta's son, and Thebes my native place." [...] 805 [...] To whom the king (who felt his gen'rous breast [...] Touched with concern for his unhappy guest) [...] Replies: [...] "Ah! why forbears the son to name [...] His wretched father, known too well by fame? [...] Fame, that delights around the world to stray, [...] 810 [...] Scorns not to take our Argos in her way. [...] Ev'n those who dwell where suns at distance roll, [...] In northern wilds, and freeze beneath the pole; [...] And those who tread the burning Lybian lands, [...] The faithless Syrtes and the moving sands; [...] 815 [...] Who view the western sea's extremest bounds, [...] Or drink of Ganges in their eastern grounds; [...] All these the woes of Oedipus have known, [...] Your fates, your furies, and your haunted town.

[...] } [...] But see! the stars begin to steal away, [...] 825 [...] And shine more faintly at approaching day; [...] Now pour the wine; and in your tuneful lays [...] Once more resound the great Apollo's praise."
