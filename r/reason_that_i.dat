The deal was: would I be willing to go to Mexico?... and I said 'Si!'..." [...] It proved to be a solid learning period for Williamson, as he credits Prentice with teaching him many fundamental illustration methods. According to Prentice: [...] "...he was terrific. He's the best guy I ever had by far." [...] During that time, Williamson assisted John Cullen Murphy on the Big Ben Bolt boxing strip and Don Sherwood on the strip Dan Flagg. He produced some sample pages for a proposed Sunday strip version of Modesty Blaise.|$|E

Gosnell received his medical degree at the Jefferson Medical School in 1966. It has been reported that he spent four decades practising medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia near where he grew up, and a teen aid program. He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua.

2500|$|According to Dr. John Lane, {{director}} of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in 1997, although Van Vliet's work has associations with mainstream abstract expressionist painting, more importantly he was a self-taught artist and his painting [...] "has {{that same kind of}} edge the music has". [...] Curator David Breuer asserts that in contrast to the busied, bohemian urban lives of the New York abstract expressionists, the rural desert environment Van Vliet was influenced by is a distinctly naturalistic one, making him a distinguished figure in contemporary art, whose work will survive in canon. Van Vliet stated of his own work, [...] "I'm trying to turn myself inside out on the canvas. I'm trying to completely bare what I think at that moment" [...] and that, [...] "I paint for the simple <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have to. I feel a sense of relief after I do." [...] When asked about his artistic influences he stated that there were none. [...] "I just paint like I paint and that's enough influence." [...] He did however state his admiration of Georg Baselitz, the De Stijl artist Piet Mondrian, and Vincent van Gogh; after seeing van Gogh's paintings in person, Van Vliet quoted himself as saying that, [...] "The sun disappoints me so." ...|$|E

[...] Adams and Klinghoffer librettist Alice Goodman criticized the decision, and Adams rejected a request to substitute a performance of Harmonium, saying: [...] "The <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> asked them not to do 'Harmonium' was that I felt that 'Klinghoffer' is a serious and humane work, and it's also a work about which many people have made prejudicial judgments without even hearing it. I felt that if I said, 'OK, [...] "Klinghoffer" [...] is too hot to handle, do [...] "Harmonium,"' that in a sense I would be agreeing with the judgment about 'Klinghoffer.'" [...] In response to an article by San Francisco Chronicle David Wiegand denouncing the BSO decision, musicologist and critic Richard Taruskin accused the work of catering to [...] "anti-American, anti-Semitic and anti-bourgeois" [...] prejudices.|$|E

Giuliani led among primary voters in Florida receiving 38%, ahead of his closest rival, Mitt Romney by 21%. However, in head to head matchups, Giuliani was losing his lead.
