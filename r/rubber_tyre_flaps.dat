50|$|Smaller {{gantry cranes}} are also {{available}} running on <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> so that tracks are not needed. <b>Rubber</b> <b>tyred</b> gantry cranes are essential for moving containers from berths {{throughout the rest of}} the yard. For this task they come in large sizes, as pictured to the right, that are used for moving to straddle multiple lanes of rail, road, or container storage. They also are capable of lifting fully loaded containers to great heights. Smaller <b>rubber</b> <b>tyred</b> gantry cranes come in the form of straddle carriers which are used when moving individual containers or vertical stacks of containers.|$|R

In addition, <b>rubber</b> <b>tyred</b> container stacking crane has been modeled by using Autodesk INVENTOR 2010 program. Stress, deformation and buckling analysis have been compared with calculations. The aim of this work is to consider the new possibilities and the gains of finite element method over conventional calculation methods on <b>rubber</b> <b>tyred</b> container stacking crane design. When we examine the results, deformation formed on crane system is not significant when considering geometric dimensions of model and it was observed that the stress values remain under the yield strength of the steel which is used for crane brigde and legs...|$|R

40|$|Community {{awareness}} of environmental noise has increased {{and there is}} a higher expectation for local government to reduce noise levels. In order to solve the noise problem, many engineers develop different types of material for sound absorption. Rubbersoil is one of the developing materials. It is a kind of lightweight geo-material, which incorporates rubber chips derived from scrap <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> and bonded with cementitious material. Fine rubber powder and large rubber chips have their specific characteristics towards sound adsorption. Fine <b>rubber</b> <b>tyre</b> powder undergoes porous absorber mechanism and absorbs high frequency sound, while large and higher proportion of <b>rubber</b> <b>tyre</b> chips provide air gaps and enhance sound absorption at low frequencies. A proper combination of these two types of <b>rubber</b> <b>tyre</b> would give satisfactory sound absorption for noises at a wide range of frequencies. With the potential benefits of rubber powder and rubber chips for sound absorption, Rubbersoil can be developed as an effective noise absorption material. Moreover, high damping property of Rubbersoil allows it to form barrier trenches around vibration sensitive foundations and structures (such as factories for sensitive, precision, and high-tech electronic industries) in order to insulate it from strong ground excitation induced from various dynamic sources. This research involves laboratory testing, panel modeling and possibly field testing in verifying and understanding the vibration and noise absorption characteristics of Rubbersoil...|$|R
