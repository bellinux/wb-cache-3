40|$|Panel surveys {{generally}} {{suffer from}} “seam bias” [...] too few transitions observed within <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> {{and too many}} reported between interviews. Seam bias is likely to affect duration models severely since both the start date and the end date of a spell may be misreported. In this paper we examine the employment dynamics of disadvantaged single mothers in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) while correcting for seam bias in reported employment status. We develop parametric misreporting models for use in multi-state, multi-spell duration analysis; the models are identified if misreporting parameters are the same for fresh and left-censored spells of the same type. We extend these models to allow misreporting to depend on individual characteristics and for a certain fraction of the sample never to misreport. These extensions are informative about misreporting, but do not affect estimates of the hazard functions. We compare our results to two approaches used previously: i) using only data on the last month of <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> and ii) adding a dummy variable for the last month of the <b>reference</b> <b>periods.</b> We find that there are important differences between our estimates and those obtained from ii), and very important differences between our estimates and those obtained from i). Finally, we also consider three alternative models of misreporting {{and are able to}} reject them based on aggregates of our micro data. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES. In July 1988, a fire {{destroyed}} a huge supermarket warehouse in Richmond, Calif, sending smoke into residential neighborhoods {{for nearly a}} week. There was no organized public health response. To evaluate the respiratory health impact on the general population, a survey of emergency room visits and hospital admissions to the two acute-care hospitals serving the population downwind was conducted. METHODS. Medical records of 489 patients meeting specified diagnostic criteria {{during the week of}} the fire and several <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> were abstracted. Ratios of proportions for respiratory diagnoses (i. e., emergency room visits for a given diagnosis/total emergency room visits) were calculated, comparing the fire week with the <b>reference</b> <b>periods,</b> and 1988 mortality data for the area were reviewed. RESULTS. Ratios of proportions for emergency room visits for asthma and all lower respiratory conditions increased significantly during the fire. Respiratory-related hospitalizations also increased. However, there was no observable increase in respiratory mortality. CONCLUSIONS. This fire was found to have had a moderate impact on the respiratory health of local residents. Public health intervention is indicated to prevent respiratory morbidity when extended exposure to structural fire smoke is predictable...|$|R

40|$|During winter 2013 – 2014 aerosol mass {{spectrometer}} (AMS) measurements were {{conducted for the}} first time with a novel PM 2. 5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter [*]≤ 2. 5 µm) lens in two major cities of China: Xi'an and Beijing. We denote the periods with visibility below 2 km as extreme haze and refer to the rest as <b>reference</b> <b>periods.</b> During the measurements in Xi'an an extreme haze covered the city for about a week and the total non-refractory (NR) -PM 2. 5 mass fraction reached peak concentrations of over 1000 µg m − 3. During the measurements in Beijing two extreme haze events occurred, but the temporal extent and the total concentrations reached during these events were lower than in Xi'an. Average PM 2. 5 concentrations of 537 ± 146 and 243 ± 47 µg m − 3 (including NR species and equivalent black carbon, eBC) were recorded during the extreme haze events in Xi'an and Beijing, respectively. During the <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> the measured average concentrations were 140 ± 99 µg m − 3 in Xi'an and 75 ± 61 µg m − 3 in Beijing. The relative composition of the NR-PM 2. 5 evolved substantially during the extreme haze periods, with increased contributions of the inorganic components (mostly sulfate and nitrate). Our results suggest that the high relative humidity present during the extreme haze events had a strong effect on the increase of sulfate mass (via aqueous phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide). Another relevant characteristic of the extreme haze is the size of the measured particles. During the extreme haze events, the AMS showed much larger particles, with a volume weighted mode at about 800 to 1000 nm, in contrast to about 400 nm during <b>reference</b> <b>periods.</b> These large particle sizes made the use of the PM 2. 5 inlet crucial, especially during the severe haze events, where 39 ± 5...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Since 1995 the CONECOFOR {{programme}} is {{collecting data}} {{on a number of}} attributes of forest ecosystems in 20 permanent plots in Italy. In this paper, different multivariate methods were used to detect possible changes and deviations in the overall biological and chemical-physical status of the CONECOFOR plots as compared to defined <b>reference</b> <b>periods.</b> The <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> were set-up taking into account the data availability and were as follows: 1997 - 1999 for biological status; 1999 - 2002 for chemical-physical status. Changes of the biological conditions of the plots were identified only in a few cases over the period 2000 - 2004 and were due to low values in transparency and basal area increment of the intermediate and dominated layer. On the other hand, several changes were detected in relation to the chemical and physical status over the period 2003 - 2005. Some few regularities were identified: (i) change/deviations con-centrated on few plots; (ii) high ozone (O 3), low sulphur deposition and low precipitation were the attributes more consistently related to changes/deviations; (iii) most deviations were due to changes in the correlation structure of the attributes; and (iv) there is no consistent timing of change/deviations among plots. These findings emphasise the need to evaluate the data at the plot level and this indicate the importance of obtaining a time series long enough to enable plot-wise integrated analysis...|$|R
