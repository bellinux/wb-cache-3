5|$|<b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Memphis-Misraïm Proceeding from Cagliostro's rite, the <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Misraïm (from Arabic مصر Miṣr = Egypt) {{continued}} {{as a form}} of mixed, esoteric masonry. Banned in 1817, it was reformulated as the <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Memphis in 1838, and in spite of fluctuating fortunes in its French home, began to spread internationally {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. During the 1880s the two rites were fused by Giuseppe Garibaldi into the <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Memphis-Misraïm. The modern order now boasts up to 99 degrees, not all of which actually worked.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to discuss}} Nina Sayers 2 ̆ 7 <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage which are portrayed {{through the use}} of many kinds of symbols. Each stage <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage is {{represented}} by symbols. Thus, I will use the theory <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage to match the symbols with characteristics of each stage and the concept of symbols to analyze the symbols so that the meanings are appropriate to the contexts and able to show the ways Nina Sayers 2 ̆ 7 <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage are symbolized. The analysis shows that each stage <b>of</b> the <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage is symbolized by many forms of symbols. It also shows that symbols <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage can actually hold more than one meaning as they can change meanings in each stage <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage. In the end, it can be concluded that symbols in Black Swan have been effectively used to strongly reveal the <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rites</b> <b>of</b> passage, being {{significant}} markers in a {{human life}} time, have, due to processes of secularization been diminished in Dutch society. This article investigates how different contemporary Pagan movements have affected modern civil society in the Netherlands in finding new expressions <b>of</b> celebrating <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage. Contemporary Pagans have, since the movement's emergence, been conscious about cycles of change and accordingly of the importance <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage. The most important Pagan "liturgy" of the seasonal calendar of the Wheel of the Year incorporates in its symbolism changes in the human life cycle. The relationship between the Wheel of the Year and <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage will thus be discussed for five Dutch Pagan traditions, examining how Dutch contemporary Pagans have inspired non-Pagans in celebrating their <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage. © Equinox Publishing Ltd 2014...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage are {{no longer}} {{familiar}} to many people as lifestyle becomes fast-paced. When changes happen in life, many {{people are more likely}} to feel distressed and confused as they do not have time anymore to conduct <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage to help them focus through the changes. Therefore, this study is conducted to reintroduce the archetypal process <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage. Rise of the Guardians is one of literary works that feature the archetypal process <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage. Jack Frost’s <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage to join the Guardians in Rise of the Guardians film are analyzed in this study since film is the manifestation of social consciousness and constitutes a reflection of reality and therefore can be subjected to an academic study. Rise of the Guardians portrays Jack Frost’s process to be a member of the Guardians, a group of mythical figures whose job is protecting children’s wonder, hopes, and dreams. Archetypal approach is used in this study as the process <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage is universal. This study mainly uses Arnold van Gennep’s and William Bridges’ theories to identify the archetypal pattern of the process <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage experienced by Jack Frost. The results show that Jack Frost experiences the three archetypal phases of the process <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> passage, which are separation, transition, and incorporation. The resuls also show that another archetypal separation-transition- incorporation process can happen in each phase...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to proposing that circumcision {{was taken up}} by the Israelites purely as a religious mandate, scholars have suggested that Judaism's patriarchs and their followers adopted circumcision to make penile hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as a <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> passage into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.|$|E

The Pleyel version of The <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Spring was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson recorded the work in this form in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Films of {{the time}} {{typically}} used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War. Thus, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and Godzilla (1954; American release 1956) portray monstrous dinosaur-like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by atomic bomb tests. An alternative appears in Disney's animated Fantasia (1940), in its The <b>Rite</b> <b>of</b> Spring sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods living at the same time) and also in Karel Zeman's Cesta do praveku (1955;Journey to the Beginning of Time) Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.|$|E

The case was debated in Oswiu's presence at the Synod of Whitby in 664, with Colmán, Hild and Cedd defending the Celtic rite and the tradition inherited from Aidan, and Wilifred speaking for the Roman position. The Roman cause prevailed and the former division of ecclesiastical authorities was set aside. Those who could not accept it, including Colmán, departed elsewhere.|$|E
