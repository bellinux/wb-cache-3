50|$|Kyanite is a {{typically}} blue silicate mineral, {{commonly found in}} aluminium-rich metamorphic pegmatites and/or sedimentary rock. Kyanite in metamorphic rocks generally indicates pressures higher than four kilobars. Although potentially stable at lower pressure and low temperature, the activity of water is usually high enough under such conditions that it is replaced by hydrous aluminosilicates such as muscovite, pyrophyllite, or kaolinite. Kyanite {{is also known as}} disthene, <b>rhaeticite</b> and cyanite.|$|E
