50|$|Site {{directed}} mutagenesis {{is a valuable}} technique that allows for the replacement of a single base in an oligonucleotide or gene. The basics of this technique involve the preparation of a primer {{that will be a}} complementary strand to a wild type bacterial plasmid. This primer will have a base pair mismatch at the site where the replacement is desired. The primer must also be long enough such that the primer will anneal to the wild type plasmid. After the primer anneals, a DNA polymerase will complete the primer. When the bacterial plasmid is replicated, the mutated strand will be replicated as well. The same technique can be used to create a gene insertion or deletion. Often, an antibiotic <b>resistant</b> <b>gene</b> is inserted along with the modification of interest and the bacteria are cultured on an antibiotic medium. The bacteria that were not successfully mutated will not survive on this medium, and the mutated bacteria can easily be cultured.|$|E

50|$|Zwittermycin A {{biosynthesis}} is {{a hybrid}} of polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide synthetic pathways. Most likely, all of the synthases are located on one megasynthase much like a type I fatty acid synthase. Based on mutant studies, the biosynthetic cluster involved in zwittermicin production has been identified and the pathway has been proposed. The genes responsible {{for the production of}} zwittermicin A are located on a 16 kb cluster containing nine orfs and a self <b>resistant</b> <b>gene</b> zmaR, a gene that encodes an acylation enzyme that deactivate zwittermicin A. The hybrid synthase used in zwittermicin A production utilizes modified extender units such as hydroxymalonyl-ACP, aminomalonyl-ACP and 2,3-diaminopropionate. Therefore, many of the genes in the biosynthetic cluster encode for enzymes responsible for the synthesis of these extender units used in the hybrid synthase. For example, orf5 encodes ZWA5A, an enzyme that is responsible for the PLP mediated amination that converts L-serine to 2,3-diaminopropionate. It has also been shown that orf5, orf7, orf4 and orf6 participate in the biosynthesis of aminomalonyl-ACP and orf3, orf2 and orf1 synthesize hydroxymalonyl-ACP.|$|E

From the eleven tested markers, the Xgwm 633 marker and Xgwm 114 marker identified polymorphism on parental forms.

40|$|The {{individual}} use {{of single}} race-specific resistance genes with major phenotypic effects has rarely provided lasting resistance. However, breeding and combining or pyramiding of resistance genes into individual cultivars has had considerable success, particularly in {{situations in which}} the pathogen does not reproduce sexually, {{as in the case}} of wheat leaf rust pathogen. In European-Mediterranean region perfomed international investigations of wheat leaf rust proved that breeding of new lines of wheat resistant to Puccinia triticina Eriks. for differentiation of pathogen population, as well as for sources of durable resistance is necessary. Breeding of such resistant lines has proved necessary due to the unsatisfatory survey results of these regions on standard isogenic Lr lines. It has become clear that these regions needed new, more efficient differential resistance genes, as well as sources of resistance. In the beginning, after extensive screening tests of several International Rust Nurseries, 18 donors of resistance had been selected as crosses with recurrent parents' varieties Princ and Starke. These hybrid lines had been comparatively tested with twenty six Lr single gene lines using twenty especially virulent cultures of P. triticina in order to check the presence of these known Lr genes in our hybrid lines. Considerable influence of recurrent parent to the number of <b>resistant</b> <b>genes</b> in used donors was demonstrated. On the other hand, considerable influence of the pathogen culture was established to the number of resistance genes in used donors.
