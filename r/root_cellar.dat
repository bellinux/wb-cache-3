50|$|Before {{the era of}} {{mechanical}} refrigeration, cooling for food storage occurred in the forms of <b>root</b> <b>cellars</b> and iceboxes. Rural people often did their own ice cutting, whereas town and city dwellers often relied on the ice trade.

50|$|Since it is {{functionally}} just {{an underground}} bunker, storm cellars {{can also be}} used as improvised bomb shelters or fallout shelters (although they are not usually dug as deeply or equipped with filtered ventilation).

2500|$|These villages {{were located}} on higher ground and {{consisted}} of several scattered houses. [...] A modest temple may {{have been associated with}} the larger villages.

50|$|Potatoes {{were planted}} in Idaho {{as early as}} 1838; by 1900 the state's {{production}} exceeded a million bushels (about 27,000 tonnes). Prior to 1910, the crops were stored in barns or <b>root</b> <b>cellars,</b> but, by the 1920s, potato cellars or barns came into use. U.S. potato production has increased steadily; two-thirds of the crop comes from Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Maine, and potato growers have strengthened their position in both domestic and foreign markets.|$|R
2500|$|Initially, the Buckner family only {{lived on}} the ranch during the summer, moving back to California in the fall to avoid Stehekin’s harsh winters. [...] However the family {{returned}} each spring to work their farm. [...] Over the next few years, they constructed a variety of buildings for protecting animals, sheltering farm equipment, and preserving food. [...] Eventually, the Buckner ranch {{had more than a}} dozen structures including a barn, workshop, milk house, smokehouse, <b>root</b> <b>cellar,</b> chicken coop, outhouse, sleeping cabins for guests or hired hands, and several general-purpose sheds. [...] They also built a mile of wooden fence to enclose their entire property.|$|E
2500|$|Tombaugh {{was born}} in Streator, Illinois, son of Muron Dealvo Tombaugh, a farmer, and his wife Adella Pearl Chritton. After {{his family moved to}} Burdett, Kansas in 1922, Tombaugh's plans for {{attending}} college were frustrated when a hailstorm ruined his family's farm crops. Starting in 1926, he built several telescopes with lenses and mirrors by himself. To better test his telescope mirrors, Tombaugh, with just a pick and shovel, dug a pit 24 feet long, 8 feet deep, and 7 feet wide. This provided a constant air temperature, free of air currents, and was also used by the family as a <b>root</b> <b>cellar</b> and emergency shelter. [...] He sent drawings of Jupiter and Mars to the Lowell Observatory, which offered him a job. Tombaugh worked there from 1929 to 1945.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, Rasputin had {{developed}} a small circle of acolytes, primarily family members and other local peasants, who prayed with him on Sundays and other holy days {{when he was in}} Pokrovskoye. Building a makeshift chapel in Efim's <b>root</b> <b>cellar</b> - Rasputin was still living within his father's household at the time - the group held secret prayer meetings there. These meetings were the subject of some suspicion and hostility from the village priest and other villagers. It was rumored that female followers were ceremonially washing him before each meeting, that the group sang strange songs that the villagers had not heard before, and even that Rasputin had joined the Khlysty, a religious sect whose ecstatic rituals were rumored to included self-flagellation and sexual orgies. According to historian Joseph Fuhrmann, however, [...] "repeated investigations failed to establish that Rasputin was ever a member of the sect," [...] and rumors that he was a Khlyst appear to have been unfounded.|$|E
5000|$|Some privy diggers also {{research}} excavation {{sites where}} old houses and other buildings, such as factories, saloons, and hotels once were. The use of heavy machinery {{can lead to}} indications of stone or brick structures and other subterranean anomalies being unearthed. This in turn can lead to discoveries of privies, cisterns, <b>root</b> <b>cellars,</b> and trash pits. Managers and owners of construction sites may not accommodate privy diggers on their missions to salvage on these sites.|$|R
50|$|Root cellaring {{has been}} vitally {{important}} in various eras and places for winter food supply. Although present-day food distribution systems and refrigeration have rendered <b>root</b> <b>cellars</b> unnecessary {{for many people}}, they remain important for many people who value self-sufficiency, whether by economic necessity or by choice and for personal satisfaction. Thus they are popular among diverse audiences, including gardeners, organic farmers, DIY fans, homesteaders, preppers, subsistence farmers, and enthusiasts of local food, slow food, heirloom plants, and traditional culture.|$|R
5000|$|This {{construction}} {{technique is}} one of the most versatile natural building methods and can be used for benches, freestanding walls, emergency shelters, temporary or permanent housing, or barns and commercial buildings. Earthbag is frequently chosen for many small-to-medium-sized institutional structures in the developing world. Subgrade structures including underground and bermed dwellings (such as Earthships), cisterns, spring boxes, <b>root</b> <b>cellars,</b> and retaining walls can be built with stabilized soil fill or with additional reinforcement and water-resistant gravel or sand fill.|$|R
