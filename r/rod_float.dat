A <b>rod</b> <b>float</b> method is most prevailing for discharge measurement in natural rivers. However accuracy of this method is not good because the float could not always follow the mainstream and subjectivity of observer can't completely be removed. Here we report development of AUV (Autonomous-Underwater-Vehicle) designed to measure mean velocity in an open-channel flow.

The effect that each discharge mechanism has on the flashover voltage and time to crest of the gap is shown. Time interval photographs are presented showing the formation of a discharge channel due to the streamer mechanism.

50|$|Essential {{for good}} catches is regular feeding {{to keep the}} shoal active and feeding around the bait. Mostly fixed <b>rods</b> and <b>floats</b> are used for a {{controlled}} presentation of the bait, and for larger distances and specimens, match rods and swim feeders are used. The line doesn't need to be thicker than 0.12 mm and the hook not more than a size 12. Thinner lines and smaller hooks produce more fish especially when the roach are of small size. The best catches with fixed float fishing are often made when the bait is presented just a few centimeters above the bottom.|$|R
50|$|In {{areas with}} {{high-resistance}} soil, {{the resistance of}} the soil wastes energy. Another issue is that the resistance may be high enough that insufficient current flows into the earth neutral, causing the grounding <b>rod</b> to <b>float</b> to higher voltages. Self-resetting circuit breakers usually reset because of a difference in voltage between line and neutral. Therefore, with dry, high-resistance soils, the reduced difference in voltage between line and neutral may prevent breakers from resetting. In Australia, locations with very dry soils need the grounding rods to be extra deep.Experience in Alaska shows that SWER needs to be grounded below permafrost, which is high-resistance.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} motion of a <b>rod</b> <b>floating</b> in a weightless {{environment}} in space when a force is applied at some point on the rod in a direction perpendicular to its length. If the force applied is at the centre of mass, then the rod gets a linear motion perpendicular to its length. However, if the same force is applied at a point other than the centre of mass, say, near {{one end of the}} rod, thereby giving rise to a torque, then there will also be a rotation of the rod about its centre of mass, in addition to {{the motion of}} the centre of mass itself. If the force applied is for a very short duration, but imparting nevertheless a finite impulse, like in a sudden (quick) hit {{at one end of the}} rod, then the centre of mass will move with a constant linear speed and superimposed on it will be a rotation of the rod with constant angular speed about the centre of mass. However, if force is applied continuously, say by strapping a tiny rocket at one end of the rod, then the rod will spin faster and faster about the centre of mass, with angular speed increasing linearly with time. As the direction of the applied force, as seen by an external (inertial) observer, will be changing continuously with the rotation of the rod, the acceleration of the centre of mass would also be not in one fixed direction. However, it turns out that the locus of the velocity vector of the centre of mass will describe a Cornu spiral, with the velocity vector reaching a final constant value with time. The mean motion of the centre of mass will be in a straight line, with superposed initial oscillations that soon die down. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, to appear in Physics Educatio...|$|R

40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} occurring {{within the}} vadose zone, especially in heterogeneous soils and tills {{typical of the}} Canadian shield, are not well understood. This research investigates {{the importance of the}} vadose zone in a small headwater basin (Harp 4 - 21) in the Canadian shield with respect to the generation of stream runoff quantity and quality during episodic rainfall and snowmelt events. The study focused specifically on: ﬁrstly the effect of variable antecedent moisture conditions on water-table and stream response, secondly, the significance of the stored vadose water in water extracted from a rising water-table, and thirdly the significance of preferential flowpathways in the vadose zone as a means of rapidly rotating, stored vadose water to the stream during runoff events. The instrumentation of the Harp 4 - 21 basin includes three v-notch weirs along the stream, numerous piezometers and wells, several soil lysimeters, and three tensiometer nests. Much of the data used in this study was obtained from five sites located along a hillslope transect. Soil water content at each of the hillslope sites was accurately determined using time domain reflectometry (TDR), whereas water table elevations were measured using both electronic water level tapes and calibrated <b>rod</b> <b>ﬂoats.</b> Preferential flowpath data was derived from ﬂow gauging and chemical analyses of water samples. Results obtained from the near-stream and lower slope reaches of the hillslope transect indicated that soil water content in the vadose zone is maintained at a high level of saturation by shallow water-table depths. Further analysis of simultaneously measured soil water content and depth to water—table data clearly showed that the existence of a thick essentially saturated zone overlying the water table (capillary fringe) was responsible for the large and rapid water-table responses observed during many of the nine studied precipitation events. On a basin scale, the seasonal variability of the area in which the capillary fringe extended to the ground surface was largely responsible for the observed trend in basin yield (runoff volume/ rainfall volume) for the nine runoff events. Chemical tracing results using silica, pH and DOC showed that the large vadose water reservoir in the near-stream and lower slope areas was a dominant component in water extracted from a rising water-table during most precipitation events. Silica results from the near-stream vadose zone showed that only the massive groundwater recharge associated with spring snowmelt could completely replace the vadose water reservoir with shorter residence time snowmelt/rainfall water. The rapid routing of stored near-stream capillary fringe vadose water through preferential pathways (macropores, soil pipes) was a significant source of runoff to the stream during runoff events. The presence of soil pipes, along with the significant vadose water reservoir in near-stream and lower slope areas are sufficient to explain the large phreatic/vadose water component typically identified in two component flow separation models, and constitutes the basis of a physically-based conceptual runoff model for the Harp 4 - 21 basin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{identification}} {{and understanding of}} material properties influencing the float zone process is important to crystallize high purity silicon for high efficiency solar cells. Also the knowledge of minimal requirements to crystallize monocrystalline silicon with the float zone process is of interest from an economic point of view. In the present study, feed <b>rods</b> for the <b>float</b> zone process composed of a central slim rod and the deposited silicon from the Siemens process are investigated. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the slim rod has a significant impact on the purity and suitability for further crystallization processes. In particular, contaminations like substitutional carbon and the presence of precipitates as well as the formation of oxide layers play an important role and are investigated in detail. For this purpose different slim rod materials were used in deposition and float zone crystallization experiments. Samples were prepared by cross sectioning and core drilling of Siemens rods, which were recrystallized with the float zone process. Recrystallized drilled cores are analyzed with FT-IR spectrometry concerning the carbon and oxygen content. To estimate the grain growth behavior on the slim rod surface in dependence of the used slim rod material, EBSD mappings inside a SEM are performed on squared and circular slim rods. TEM analysis was used to investigate the presence of an oxide layer at the interface between slim rod and deposited polycrystalline silicon.

5000|$|Water clocks have a {{long history}} of use in Korea with the first mention of one in the records of the Samguk Sagi during the Three Kingdoms era. In 1434, during the reign of King Sejong the Great a water clock was made by Jang Yeong-sil which would mark the hour {{automatically}} with the sounds of a bell, gong, and drum. That clock, Jagyeokru ("self-striking water clock"), was used to keep the standard of time in the Joseon Dynasty. The clock was not preserved well and so in 1536, King Jungjong ordered the clock remade and improved which was done by Yu Jeon. Today, only three water bowls and two cylindrical water containers survive from the 1434 version of the clock, and no records mentioning its existence. Extensive records of 1536 version remain, and it is believed that the two clocks were very similar. In its current configuration the large bronze cylindrical water containers are 93.5 centimeters in diameter and 70 centimeters in height. The smaller ceramic vessels are 46.0 centimeters and 40.5 centimeters in height. The two bases for the ceramic vessels still survived in the Myeongjeonjeon Hall of Changgyeonggung Palace. A third version of the clock was built in 2007. The water clock worked by having water poured into the largest bronze vessel which flowed into the smaller vessels which the flowed into the long water tanks. When the water level rose to the appropriate level, a <b>floating</b> <b>rod</b> touched a lever device which caused a ball to roll and hit another ball at the other end. The rolling ball would trigger the gong, bell, drum, and even a wooden puppet which marked the hour with a placard. [...] The clepsydra does not work today because only the water holding vessels have survived. However, it is valuable because of the scientific and cultural information it holds and because there are only few examples of ancient automatic water clocks. It is the oldest and largest surviving clock of its kind.|$|R
40|$|This work reports {{theoretical}} {{studies and}} experimental proofs of the propulsion of mini-/micro-scale floating objects that propel on air-liquid interface by using two different principles. The devices are extremely simple {{and do not}} include any moving parts. The first principle takes advantage of three-phase contact line oscillation that is activated by AC electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) to propel the floating object. The capillary wave that is generated by the free surface oscillation is visualized by using the Free-Surface Synthetic Schlieren (FS-SS) method. A 3 -D flow field sketch is constructed based on the flow visualizations and PIV measurements. The flow field and trajectories of seeded particles suggest that Stokes drift is the responsible mechanism for the propulsion. The propulsion speed of the floating object highly depends on the amplitude, frequency, {{and shape of the}} EWOD signal. These phenomena are also explained by the measured oscillation amplitudes and Stokes drift relations. Additionally, it is shown that a wider EWOD electrode generates a faster propelling speed. Finally, with stacked planar receiver coils and an amplitude modulated signal, a wirelessly powered AC EWOD propulsion is realized. The second principle of floating object propulsion is the Cheerios effect, which is also generally known as lateral capillary force. Four common physical configurations (interactions between two infinite vertical walls, two vertical circular cylinders, two spheres, and a sphere and a vertical wall) are reviewed. Through theoretical analysis, it has been revealed that not the wettability of the surface but the slope angle of the object is the most important parameter for the Cheerios effect. A general rule for this effect is that the lateral capillary force is attractive if the slope angles of the interacting objects have the same sign, otherwise the force is repulsive. In addition to the surface wettability, the size and the density of floating spheres are also important for the slope angle. Active control of the Cheerios effect is achieved by implementing EWOD and dielectrowetting methods to adjust the surface wettability. By sequentially activating micro-fabricated EWOD/dielectrowetting electrodes, linear translations of floating objects in the small scale channel are accomplished. A continuous rotational motion of the <b>floating</b> <b>rod</b> is achieved in a circular container by the EWOD method...|$|R
