40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the dynamic and static {{behaviour}} of reinforced concrete beams built using high-strength concrete and high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> As part of this study, a total of 8 high-strength concrete beams, built with and without steel fibres, and reinforced with high strength ASTM A 1035 bars are tested under simulated blast loading using the University of Ottawa shock-tube, with an additional 3 companion beams tested under quasi-static loading. The variables considered in this study include: concrete type, fibre content, <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> ratio and <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> type. The behaviour of the beams with high-strength steel bars is compared to a companion set of beams reinforced with conventional <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The criteria {{used to evaluate the}} blast performance of the beams includes: overall blast capacity, maximum and residual displacements, secondary fragmentation and crack control. The dynamic results show that high strength concrete beams reinforced with high-strength steel are able to resist higher blast loads and reduce displacements when compared to companion beams with conventional <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The results also demonstrate that the addition of steel fibres is effective in controlling crack formation, minimizing secondary blast fragments, reducing displacements and further increasing overall blast capacity. However, the use of high-strength steel and high-strength concrete also shows potential for brittle failures under extreme blast pressures. The static results show that specimens with high-strength steel bars do not increase beam stiffness, but significantly increase peak load carrying capacity when compared to beams with the same ratio of conventional <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The analytical research program aims at predicting the response of the test beams using dynamic inelastic single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) analysis and includes a sensitivity analysis examining the effect of various modelling parameters on the response predictions. Overall the analytical results demonstrate that SDOF analysis can be used to predict the blast response of beams built with high-strength concrete and <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> with acceptable accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Composite {{concrete}} {{consists of}} two elements cast at different times which are the concrete base and concrete topping. To achieve composite action, interface shear strength must be sufficient to resist the sliding motion between the two concrete surfaces in contact. The interface shear strength is mainly depended on concrete cohesion, friction and dowel action. A total of 36 “push-off” tests were performed to study the interface shear strength and to assess the influence of surface texture and <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> crossing the interface. Three different concrete base surfaces are prepared which include smooth or “left as-cast”, roughened by wire-brushing in the transverse direction and <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> projecting from the concrete base. Eurocode 2 provides design equations for determining the interface shear strength with different surface textures and also the one where projecting <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> crosses the interface. The experimental {{results show that the}} transverse roughened surface produced the highest interface shear strength of 1. 89 N/mm 2 (sn = 0 N/mm 2), 4. 69 N/mm 2 (sn = 0. 5 N/mm 2), 5. 97 N/mm 2 (sn = 1. 0 N/mm 2) and 6. 42 N/mm 2 (sn = 1. 5 N/mm 2) compared with the other surface textures. This proves that the increase in the degree of roughness contributes to higher concrete cohesion and friction coefficient. However, for the surface with projecting <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> the failure is not sudden as experienced by the surface without one. This is due to the contribution of the clamping stress from the dowel action of the <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> Meanwhile, for specimens without any projecting <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcements,</b> the interface shear strength depended solely on friction and concrete cohesion of the surface textures. The interface shear strength of surface with and without the projecting <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> can be predicted using the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope. This paper also proposed design expressions for concrete-to-concrete bond on surfaces provided with and without projecting <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> that can be adopted in Eurocode 2...|$|R

50|$|On 16 May 1968, the 22-story {{residential}} tower Ronan Point in the London Borough of Newham collapsed when {{a relatively}} small gas explosion on the 18th floor caused a structural wall panel to be blown away from the building. The tower was constructed of precast concrete, {{and the failure of}} the single panel caused one entire corner of the building to collapse. The panel was able to be blown out because there was insufficient <b>reinforcement</b> <b>steel</b> passing between the panels. This also meant that the loads carried by the panel could not be redistributed to other adjacent panels, because there was no route for the forces to follow. As a result of the collapse, building regulations were overhauled to prevent disproportionate collapse and the understanding of precast concrete detailing was greatly advanced.

50|$|Albert Kahn Associates is an {{architectural}} design firm in Detroit, Michigan {{with a second}} office located in São Paulo, Brasil. It was established in 1895 and is still active today. It introduced a new technology in industrial building involving a unique reinforced concrete method {{referred to as the}} Kahn System of construction using proprietary patented <b>reinforcement</b> <b>steel</b> manufactured by Trussed Concrete Steel Company. The building of automobile factories and other types of factories were revolutionized from wooden timber framing construction. Besides being an advanced technology in strength that led to wider open interior spaces, it featured a high degree of fire resistance and larger window space for light. The firm started by Albert Kahn built factories for Chrysler for over a decade, Ford Automobile for 30 years and Packard Automobile for 35 years. Other important clients of the firm were Republic Steel and General Motors. The firm was awarded a $40 million dollar contract to build a tractor factory in Russia in 1928. The firm's output was over a million dollars worth of work per week by 1929. By 1939, the firm designed 19 percent of all industrial buildings in the United States and had designed some $800 million of buildings worldwide. Currently, Albert Kahn Associates is still making history with state-of-the-art projects. Recent projects include creating the world's largest penguin conservatory,located at the Detroit Zoo, which opened in 2016.|$|E
