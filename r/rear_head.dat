The icon {{represents}} Vishnu as the Supreme Being. He has a human head, a lion head, a boar head and a demonic head.

Though iconographical treatises describe him to eight-armed, he is often depicted with four. Generally, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is shown standing but sometimes he is depicted seated on his vahana (mount) Garuda.|$|E
