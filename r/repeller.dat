2500|$|Fusion One Corporation is a US {{organization}} {{founded in}} 2015 by Dr. Paul Sieck, Dr. Scott Cornish and Randall Volberg. They {{are developing a}} magneto-electrostatic reactor named [...] "F1" [...] that is based in-part on the polywell. It introduces a system of externally mounted electromagnet coils with internally mounted cathode <b>repeller</b> surfaces that provide a new means of preserving energy and particle losses {{that would otherwise be}} lost through the magnetic cusps. In response to Todd Rider's 1995 power balance conclusions, a new analytical model was developed based on this recovery function as well as a more accurate quantum relativistic treatment of the bremmstralung losses that was not present in Rider's analysis, which relied on interpolation. The new model demonstrated ample multiples of net gain with D-T and sufficient multiples with D-D to be used for generating electricity. Prior to building a scale reactor, they are developing an HPC simulation and benchtop test device using a modified spindle cusp to validate these results. Fusion One presented their work at the ARPA-E ALPHA 2017 Annual Review Meeting.|$|E

Quick signals now shot up in jets of black smoke from the <b>repeller,</b> and {{in a very short time}} afterward the speed of the Lenox slackened so much that the <b>repeller</b> was able to come up with her.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} study for adhesion-induced lateral phase separation for a membrane with short stickers, long stickers and <b>repellers</b> confined between two hard walls. The effects of confinement and <b>repellers</b> on lateral phase separation are investigated. We {{find that the}} critical potential depth of the stickers for lateral phase separation increases as {{the distance between the}} hard walls decreases. This suggests confinement-induced or force-induced mixing of stickers. We also find that stiff <b>repellers</b> tend to enhance, while soft <b>repellers</b> tend to suppress adhesion-induced lateral phase separation...|$|R

60|$|The crabs might disable some men-of-war, the <b>repeller</b> {{might make}} her {{calculations}} and discharge her bomb at a ship or a fort, {{but what would}} {{the main body of}} the navy be doing meanwhile?

60|$|As {{soon as the}} British ships came in sight, {{the four}} crabs cast off from <b>Repeller</b> No. 11. Then {{with the other two}} they {{prepared}} for action, moving considerably in advance of the <b>repeller,</b> which now steamed forward very slowly. The wind was strong from the north-west, and the sea high, the shining tops of the crabs frequently disappearing under the waves.|$|E
60|$|Shortly {{before the}} sailing of <b>Repeller</b> No. 11, the Syndicate had {{received}} news {{that one of}} the largest transatlantic mail steamers, loaded with troops and with heavy cannon for Canadian fortifications, and accompanied by the Craglevin, one of the largest ironclads in the Royal Navy, had started across the Atlantic. The first business of the <b>repeller</b> and her attendant crabs concerned these two vessels.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper surveys {{some recent}} results about chaos induced by snap-back <b>repellers</b> and its {{applications}} to anti-control of chaos (or, chaotification). Several criteria of chaos induced by snap-back <b>repellers</b> in finite and infinite dimensional dynamical systems are introduced. Some successful applications {{are given to}} chaotification problems for finite and infinitedimensional discrete dynamical systems. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{bifurcation}} {{theory of}} snap-back <b>repellers</b> in hybrid dynamical systems is developed. Infinite sequences of bifurcations are shown to arise {{due to the}} creation of snap-back <b>repellers</b> in non-invertible maps. These are analogous to the cascades of bifurcations known to occur close to homoclinic tangencies for diffeomorphisms. The theoretical results are illustrated with reference to bifurcations in the normal form for border-collision bifurcations...|$|R
60|$|This net, {{which was}} {{intended}} to protect the <b>repeller</b> against the approach of submarine torpedoes, which might be directed from the shore, was anchored at each end, two very small buoys indicating its position. The crabs then falling astern, <b>Repeller</b> No. 1 lay to, with the sunken net {{between her and the}} shore, and prepared to project the first instantaneous motor-bomb ever used in warfare.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain of}} the Craglevin was a very {{different}} man from the {{captain of the}} Adamant. He was quite as brave, but he was wiser and more prudent. He saw that the transport had been captured and forced to lay to; he saw that the <b>repeller</b> mounted two heavy guns at her bow, and whatever might be the character of those guns, there could be no reasonable doubt that they were sufficient to sink an ordinary mail steamer. His own vessel was entirely out of his control, and even if he chose to try his guns on the spring armour of the <b>repeller,</b> it would probably result in the <b>repeller</b> turning her fire up on the transport.|$|E
6000|$|The {{vessels of}} the Syndicate had no {{individual}} names. The spring-armoured ships were termed [...] "repellers," [...] and were numbered, and the crabs were {{known by the}} letters of the alphabet. Each <b>repeller</b> was in charge of a Director of Naval Operations; and the whole naval force of the Syndicate was under the command of a Director-in-chief. On this momentous occasion this officer was on board of <b>Repeller</b> No. 1, and commanded the little fleet.|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} the <b>repeller,</b> preceded by two crabs, bearing between them a {{submerged}} net {{similar to that used}} at the Canadian port, appeared off the eastern end of the Isle of Wight. The anchors of the net were dropped, and behind it the <b>repeller</b> took her place, and shortly afterward she sent a flag-of-truce boat to Portsmouth harbour. This boat carried a note from the American War Syndicate to the British Government.|$|E
60|$|Signals were {{exchanged}} {{between the two}} English vessels, and {{in a very short}} time they were steaming toward the <b>repeller.</b> It was a dangerous thing for two vessels of their size to come close enough together for both to ram an enemy at the same time, but it was determined to take the risks and do this, if possible; for the destruction of the <b>repeller</b> was obviously the first duty in hand.|$|E
60|$|The {{director}} of <b>Repeller</b> No. 7 had been considering the situation. There {{was only one}} gun on the Adamant which could {{be brought to bear}} upon Crab K, and it would be the part of wisdom to interfere with the persistent use of this gun. Accordingly the bow of the <b>repeller</b> was brought to bear upon the Adamant, and her motor gun was aimed at the boom from which the cannon was suspended.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} combinatorial multivector fields, {{associate with}} them multivalued dynamics and study their topological features. Our combinatorial multivector fields generalize combinatorial vector fields of Forman. We define isolated invariant sets, Conley index, attractors, <b>repellers</b> and Morse decompositions. We provide a topological characterization of attractors and <b>repellers</b> and prove Morse inequalities. The generalization aims at algorithmic analysis of dynamical systems through combinatorialization of flows given by differential equations and through sampling dynamics in physical and numerical experiments.

60|$|As {{soon as the}} Adamant {{was brought}} up with {{her head to the}} wind she opened fire upon the <b>repeller.</b> The latter vessel could easily have sailed out of the range of a {{motionless}} enemy, but her orders forbade this. Her director had been instructed by the Syndicate to expose his vessel to the fire of the Adamant's heavy guns. Accordingly the <b>repeller</b> steamed nearer, and turned her broadside toward the British ship.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not yet}} noon {{when the}} {{bombardment}} ceased. No more puffs of black smoke came up from the distant <b>repeller,</b> and the vast spreading mass of clouds moved seaward, dropping down upon St. George's Channel in a rain of stone dust. Then the <b>repeller</b> steamed shoreward, {{and when she was}} within three or four miles of the coast she ran up a large white flag in token that her task was ended.|$|E
60|$|When {{nearly every}} one {{had left the}} Craglevin, a boat was sent from the <b>repeller,</b> which lay near by, with a note {{requesting}} the captain and first officer of the British ship to come on board <b>Repeller</b> No. 11 and witness the method of discharging the instantaneous motor-bomb, after which they would be put on board the transport. This invitation struck {{the captain of the}} Craglevin with surprise, but a little reflection showed him that {{it would be wise to}} accept it. In the first place, it was in the nature of a command, which, in the presence of six crabs and a <b>repeller,</b> it would be ridiculous to disobey; and, moreover, he was moved by a desire to know something about the Syndicate's mysterious engine of destruction, if, indeed, such a thing really existed.|$|E
40|$|Given {{a set of}} attractors and <b>repellers,</b> the {{cohesion}} query re-turns {{the point}} in database that {{is as close to}} the attractors and as far from the <b>repellers</b> as possible. Cohesion queries find applications in various settings, such as facility location problems, location-based services. For example, when at-tractors represent favorable plases, e. g., tourist attractions, and <b>repellers</b> denote undesirable locations, e. g., competitor stores, the cohesion query would return the ideal location, among a database of possible options, to open a new store. These queries are not trivial to process as the best loca-tion, unlike aggregate nearest or farthest neighbor queries, may be far from the optimal point in space. Therefore, to achieve sub-linear performance in practice, we employ novel best-first search and branch and bound paradigms that take advantage of the geometrical interpretation of the problem. Our methods are up to orders of magnitude faster than linear scan and adaptations of existing aggregate nearest/farthest neighbor algorithms...|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} Labeling RAAM (LRAAM) can be {{exploited}} to generate `on the fly' neural networks for associative access of labeled structures. The topology of these networks, {{that we call}} Generalized Hopfield Networks (GHN), depends on the topology of the query used to retrieve information, and the weights on the networks' connections are the weights of the LRAAM encoding the structures. A method for incremental discovering of multiple solutions to a given query is presented. This method is based on terminal <b>repellers,</b> which are used to `delete' known solutions from the set of admissible solutions to a query. Terminal <b>repellers</b> are also used to implement exceptions at query level, i. e., when a solution to a query must satisfy some negative constraints on the labels and/or substructures. Besides, the proposed model solves very naturally the connectionist variable binding problem at query level. Some results for a tree-like query are presented. Finally, we define a parallel mode of execution, exploiting terminal <b>repellers,</b> for the GHN, and we propose to use terminal attractors for implementing shared variables and graph queries...|$|R

The most accurate observations, the most careful calculations, were made and re-made, the point to be aimed at being about the centre of the fort.|$|E
60|$|The line of torpedo-boats, {{slightly}} curving inward, {{had advanced}} about a mile, when <b>Repeller</b> No. 11 awoke from her seeming sleep, {{and began to}} act. The two great guns at her bow were trained upward, so that a bomb discharged from them would fall into the sea {{a mile and a}} half ahead. Slowly turning her bow from side to side, so that the guns would cover a range of nearly half a circle, the instantaneous motor-bombs of the <b>repeller</b> were discharged, one every half minute.|$|E
60|$|When <b>Repeller</b> No. 7 had {{sustained}} the heavy fire of the Adamant {{for about half}} an hour, it was considered that the strength of her armour had been sufficiently demonstrated; and, with a much lighter heart than when he had turned her broadside to the Adamant, her director gave orders that she should steam out {{of the range of}} the guns of the British ship. During the cannonade Crab J had quietly slipped away from the vicinity of the Adamant, and now joined the <b>repeller.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for {{unconstrained}} global function optimization, acronymed TRUST, is introduced. This method formulates optimization {{as the solution}} of a deterministic dynamical system incorporating terminal <b>repellers</b> and a novel subenergy tunneling function. Benchmark tests comparing this method to other global optimization procedures are presented, and the TRUST algorithm is shown to be substantially faster. The TRUST formulation leads to a simple stopping criterion. In addition, {{the structure of the}} equations enables an implementation of the algorithm in analog VLSI hardware, in the vein of artificial neural networks, for further substantial speed enhancement.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{contains}} {{four main}} results {{associated with an}} attractor of a projective iterated function system (IFS).

In the third theorem the classical duality between points and hyperplanes in projec-tive space leads to connections between attractors that avoid hyperplanes and <b>repellers</b> that avoid points, as well as hyperplane attractors that avoid points and <b>repellers</b> that avoid hyperplanes. Finally, an index is defined for attractors which avoid a hyperplane. This index is {{shown to be a}} nontrivial projective invariant. 1...|$|R
