Typical examples are wireless charging of mobile phone batteries and car batteries. Thanks to the advent of power electronics {{in the past few}} decades, some wireless charging systems are now emerging in the commercial sector.

40|$|Using a {{high-temperature}} superconducting (HTS) coil as the transmitting coil is {{an optional}} {{way to increase}} the efficiency and the distance of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system. In practical cases, receiving coils might be not only one, or not convenient to get a low-temperature environment, or not in the same sizes with the transmitting coil. Thus, we constructed a WPT system from one HTS coil to two copper coils, and one of the copper receiving coils had a different size from the HTS transmitting coil. In addition, we placed one HTS <b>relaying</b> <b>coil</b> between the transmitting coil and the receiving coils {{to increase the efficiency}} and the distance. Based on this system, we conducted several experiments and analyzed the results. We found that a denser coil could obtain more power in an HTS WPT system and that WPT from one HTS coil to two copper coils was more efficient than WPT from the same HTS coil to one of the two copper coils.

50|$|The {{most common}} way to {{determine}} whether a section of line is occupied is by use of a track circuit. The rails at either end of each section are electrically isolated from the next section, and an electrical current is fed to both running rails at one end. A relay at the other end is connected to both rails. When the section is unoccupied, the <b>relay</b> <b>coil</b> completes an electrical circuit, and is energized. However, when a train enters the section, it short-circuits the current in the rails, and the relay is de-energized.

5000|$|When {{the current}} flowing is DC, a simple {{rectifier}} diode is often employed as a snubber. [...] The snubber diode is wired in parallel with an inductive load (such as a <b>relay</b> <b>coil</b> or electric motor). The diode is installed {{so that it does}} not conduct under normal conditions. When the external driving current is interrupted, the inductor current flows instead through the diode. The stored energy of the inductor is then gradually dissipated by the diode voltage drop and the resistance of the inductor itself. One disadvantage of using a simple rectifier diode as a snubber is that the diode allows current to continue flowing for some time, causing the inductor to remain active for slightly longer than desired. Circuit designs must consider this delay in the dropping-out of the actuator.|$|E

Electromechanical components known as vibrators were used in a circuit similar to modern solid state inverter circuits to provide a pulsating DC which could be converted to a higher voltage with a transformer, rectified, and filtered to create higher-voltage DC. This [...] "vibrator" [...] is essentially a relay using normally closed contacts to supply power to the <b>relay</b> <b>coil,</b> thus immediately breaking the connection, only to be reconnected very quickly through the normally closed contacts. It happens so rapidly it vibrates, and sounds like a buzzer.

50|$|The {{switching}} in TXE2s {{was carried}} out by reed relays and a typical TXE2 contained about 100,000 reeds. A 'reed' was actually two over-lapping ferromagnetic blades hermetically sealed within an inert-gas-filled glass capsule. The blades were gold-plated and separated by just a few thousandths of an inch. The reeds were fast in operation (about 1 millisecond), with a life expectancy of more than 10 million operations. The glass capsules were about an inch (25 mm) in length and about an eighth of an inch (3 mm) in diameter. Four reeds were generally present inside each <b>relay</b> <b>coil,</b> two for the speech-path, one for holding the path and one for metering. Switching with these reeds held out the prospect of much greater reliability compared with the Strowger system, where switching {{was carried out}} by base metal wipers moving through banks of metal contacts. The Strowger switches required routines to be carried out on them to clean the banks: they also required oiling and occasional adjustment. Reed relays required none of this. However, in practice, and particularly {{in the early years of}} the system's service, the performance of the reeds proved to be less good than had been expected.|$|E

Moreover, the usage of multiple resonant MI <b>relay</b> <b>coils</b> in MI-based WUSNs brings more reliability concerns.
