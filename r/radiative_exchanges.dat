The method is extended to approximate a sphere-to-plane geometric configuration via an asymptotic method. The asymptotic method {{calls for an}} iterative {{process by which the}} <b>radiative</b> <b>exchange</b> is continuously calculated up to convergence as the radii of one microsphere is increased. These results are compared to previously published theoretical approximations and experimental data. A theoretical method for cylinder-to-cylinder <b>radiative</b> heat <b>exchange</b> is formulated. The method utilizes {{a modified version of the}} numerical method for near-field sphere-to-sphere <b>radiative</b> <b>exchange.</b> Modifications were made to the numerical procedure to make it applicable to cylindrical geometry of nanorods. Nanorods investigated had length to diameter ratios of 3 : I and 7 : 1. The heat exchange of nanorods is plotted vs. gap to assess the impact of near-field radiative transfer as gap decreases. Graphical results of energy vs. nanorod radii are also presented. A nanorod-to-plane configuration is estimated utilizing a nanorod asymptotic ii method. The nanorod-to-nanorod method approximates a nanorod-to-plane geometric configuration when one nanorod radii is held constant, and the second nanorod radii is iteratively increased until the corresponding <b>radiative</b> <b>exchange</b> converges. A theoretical method for cylinder-to-cylinder <b>radiative</b> heat <b>exchange</b> is formulated by utilizing a sphere approximation method. The sphere approximation method calls for dividing the cylinders into smaller connected spheres and applying a previously published numerical method for near-field sphere-to-sphere <b>radiative</b> <b>exchange.</b> The overall <b>radiative</b> power <b>exchange</b> is obtained by an additive ray tracing assumption. These results are compared to results produced by a rigorous cylinder-to-cylinder <b>radiative</b> heat <b>exchange</b> method. The heat exchange of nanorods is plotted vs. gap to assess the impact of near-field radiative transfer as gap decreases. The unit sphere method is applied to nanorod configurations having length to diameter ratios of 3 : 1, 5 : 1, 7 : 1. Graphical results of energy vs. nanorod radii are presented. A nanoradii/gap dimensionless relationship caused by geometric effects is found and related to power for nanorods of different aspect ratios and temperatures. A V -shaped configuration is considered with the results plotted for heat exchange vs. angle. An assessment of the number of spheres required to produce an accurate approximation of the V -shaped configuration of nanorods is presented. An error analysis of this method based on a ray blocking assumption from neighboring spheres is discussed.

The validity of the method is demonstrated in two steps. First, cases with simple geometry are considered and results are compared to results generated by direct numerical integration. Results are also generated by MODRAY, which is a source project based on an original method called the flux-planes approximation, and are shown to be equally accurate.

40|$|International audienceA full {{coupling}} between a CFD code, a thermo-radiative model and a building energy simulation model enables Solene-microclimat software to calculate both building thermal behavior and urban microclimate with the retroaction of buildings on microclimate. However, this {{full coupling}} is time consuming {{and it is}} legitimate to wonder if it is always necessary to perform such detailed simulations. In {{the framework of the}} MERUBBI project, simulations were carried out to answer this question. A set of simulations was designed to explore different kinds of configurations: three cities in France (Nantes, Paris and Strasbourg), three levels of density (from an isolated building to an implementation in the dense city center) and three kinds of buildings (an individual house in Paris, a residential building in Nantes and an office building in Strasbourg). To study the sensitivity of energy demand to the coupling detail, for each thermal flux at the external surfaces of the building, several levels of details were taken into account. For the impact of wind on convection, three modalities were considered: a constant convective heat transfer coefficient, calculated from the wind velocity at 10 m; a convective heat transfer coefficient calculated from a vertical wind profile; a convective heat transfer coefficient calculated from the local wind velocity simulated with a CFD code. For the impact of air temperature on convection, two modalities are considered the use of the temperature measured at the nearest meteorological station; a local temperature calculated with the CFD simulation. For the impact of long-wave <b>radiative</b> <b>exchanges,</b> three modalities: the building exchanges with the sky without taking into account the masks of the environment and the long-wave <b>radiative</b> <b>exchanges</b> with the other surfaces; the building exchanges with the sky, taking into account the mask effects but not the exchanges with the surrounding surfaces; long-wave exchanges are taken into account with all kinds of surfaces in function of view factors. For the impact of shortwave radiations, two modalities: only direct and diffuse solar fluxes are taken into account; inter-reflections are considered. The results indicate that if the calculation of air temperature and convective heat transfer coefficient have few impacts in all the cases, the way of calculating long-wave and short wave radioactive fluxes has to be carefully considered, in winter as in summer. More detailed recommendations are given according to the density of the site in which the building will be implemented...|$|E
