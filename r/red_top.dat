5|$|JIVE Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{for the song}} to be directed by Billie Woodruff. It was produced under Geneva Films, while the choreography was created by Wade Robson. The narrative of the video shows Spears dreaming as she sleeps in her room. As the dream begins, Spears is shown in a blue and silver futuristic room with several different levels, where she sings and walks around, and puts {{her feet on the}} wall while wearing a shiny silver outfit. MTV news reporter Ellen Thompson considered it the sexiest moment of the music video. As the video continues, Spears is seen on top of the apartment building she lives in, performing a dance segment in a <b>red</b> <b>top</b> and black skirt with a few backup dancers. The following scenes shows the singer wearing white clothes and singing in the room in which she is sleeping, while her love interest comes into her room to see her. Together, they start a pillow fight that shortly ends after Spears is shown again in her room still sleeping, however, now with a smile upon her face. A longer dance segment intercalates with all the scenes during the whole video.|$|E
5|$|The {{services}} sought different {{characteristics in}} their aircraft – the RAF desired a single-seat fighter with secondary intercept capability, while the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) sought a two-seat interceptor capable of secondary low-level strike capability. Accordingly, HSA's submission involved {{the development of}} two distinct variants of the same P.1154 aircraft, each aimed towards a particular service and its stated requirements. Although financially and politically committed to a joint requirement with the Royal Navy, the RAF's single-seat design took precedence over the two-seat version of the Royal Navy. However, RAF P.1154s would have to accommodate the Navy's large airborne intercept (AI) radar. When HSA submitted the design on 8August, the Royal Navy criticised the proposal, which had a tandem undercarriage layout incompatible with catapult operations; consequently, a tricycle undercarriage design was investigated and accepted as practical. The aircraft would have been armed with the <b>Red</b> <b>Top</b> missile.|$|E

A {{total of}} 70 built (at least nine {{were converted to}} F.6 standard).|$|E
2500|$|Within the army, {{particularly}} notable are the kepis of the French Foreign Legion, {{whose members}} are sometimes called Képis blancs (white kepis), because of the unit's regulation white headgear. Former cavalry units wear light blue kepis with <b>red</b> <b>tops</b> and silver braid (for officers) and insignia. Other colours include all dark blue with red piping (for artillery units), dark blue with <b>red</b> <b>tops</b> (line infantry) and crimson with <b>red</b> <b>tops</b> (medical).

25|$|Single-seat fighter (an {{improved}} longer-range {{variant of}} the F.3). It featured new wings with better efficiency and subsonic performance, overwing fuel tanks and a larger ventral fuel tank, reintroduction of 30mm cannon (initially no cannon but later in the forward part of the ventral pack {{rather than in the}} nose), use of <b>Red</b> <b>Top</b> missiles. A total of 39 built (also nine converted from F.3 and 15 from F.3A).|$|E

25|$|Originally rowed on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, it {{has since}} moved to the Thames River, near New London, Connecticut. Although other {{locations}} for the race have included the Connecticut River at Springfield, Massachusetts, and Lake Quinsigamond at Worcester, Massachusetts, the Thames has hosted The Race on all but five occasions since 1878 and both teams have erected permanent training camps on the Thames at Gales Ferry for Yale and at <b>Red</b> <b>Top</b> for Harvard.|$|E
25|$|Baltics 282-foot wooden hull {{was built}} from yellow pine, with keel and frames of white oak and chestnut. Like her three sister ships, Baltic had {{straight}} stems, a single smokestack, three square-rigged masts for auxiliary power, and a flat main deck with two single-story cabins, one fore and one aft. The ships were painted in Collins Line colors—black hull {{with a dark}} red stripe running {{the length of the}} ship, and a black stack with a dark <b>red</b> <b>top.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} seven years, the Tops had {{unsuccessful}} tenures at Chess, <b>Red</b> <b>Top,</b> Riverside Records and Columbia Records. Without any hit records to their name, they toured frequently, developing a polished stage presence and an experienced supper club act, as well as supporting Billy Eckstine. In 1963, Berry Gordy, Jr., {{who had worked with}} Roquel Davis as a songwriter in the late 1950s, convinced the Tops to join the roster of his growing Motown record company.|$|E

25|$|In February 1925 the Kuna revolted vigorously against Panamanian {{suppression}} of their culture, and in 1930 they assumed autonomy. The flag they adopted {{at that time}} {{is based on the}} swastika shape, and remains the official flag of Kuna Yala. A number of variations on the flag have been used over the years: <b>red</b> <b>top</b> and bottom bands instead of orange were previously used, and in 1942 a ring (representing the traditional Kuna nose-ring) was added {{to the center of the}} flag to distance it from the symbol of the Nazi party.|$|E
25|$|Early {{versions}} of the Lightning were equipped with the Ferranti-developed AI.23 monopulse radar, which was contained right {{at the front of}} the fuselage within an inlet cone at the centre of the engine intake. Radar information was displayed on an early head-up display and managed by onboard computers. The AI.23, an immediate predecessor of the AI.24 Foxhunter, supported several operational modes, which included autonomous search, automatic target tracking, and ranging for all weapons; the pilot attack sight provided gyroscopically-derived lead angle and backup stadiametric ranging for gun firing. The radar and gunsight were collectively designated the AIRPASS: Airborne Interception Radar and Pilot Attack Sight System. The radar would be successively upgraded with the introduction of more capable Lightning variants, such as to provide guidance for the <b>Red</b> <b>Top</b> missile.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} its service, the Lightning was {{increasingly}} outclassed by newer fighters, mainly due to the avionics and armaments being obsolete. The radar had a limited range and no track while scanning capability, and it could detect targets only in a fairly narrow (40 degree) arc. While an automatic collision course attack system was developed and successfully demonstrated by English Electric, it was not adopted due to cost concerns. Plans were mooted to supplement or replace the obsolete <b>Red</b> <b>Top</b> and Firestreak missiles with modern AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles to help rectify some of the obsolescence, but these ambitions were never realised due to lack of funding. An alternative to the modernization of existing aircraft would have been the development of more advanced variants; a proposed Variable-sweep wing Lightning would have likely involved the adoption of a new powerplant and radar and was believed by BAC to significantly increase performance, but ultimately was not pursued.|$|E

500|$|Benson {{followed}} Gardner's {{pattern of}} setting Bond {{in the contemporary}} timeframe of the 1990s and, according to Jeremy Black, had more echoes of Fleming's style than John Gardner, he also changed Bond's gun back to the Walther PPK, put him {{behind the wheel of}} a Jaguar XK8 and made him swear more. James Harker noted that [...] "whilst Fleming's Bond had been an Express reader; Benson's is positively <b>red</b> <b>top.</b> He's the first to have group sex... and the first to visit a prostitute", whilst Black notes an increased level of crudity lacking in either Fleming or Gardner.

500|$|Liverpool {{made their}} European debut in 1964–65, {{competing}} in the European Cup reaching the semi-finals. In the second round the club was drawn against the formidable Anderlecht. Immediately before the match, Shankly decided to experiment with the Liverpool kit. Liverpool played in red shirts with white shorts and white sock with <b>red</b> <b>top</b> but Shankly and Ian St John had {{the idea of an}} all-red kit that would give the impression the players were taller. Liverpool played in all-red only for European matches but quickly adopted the colour permanently. Three days after winning the FA Cup, Liverpool defeated European champions Internazionale 3–1 at Anfield in the semi-final first leg with a performance that was saluted by Inter's coach Helenio Herrera. The second leg at the San Siro, however, was according to Shankly [...] "a war", which Liverpool lost 3–0 and so were knocked out of the competition 4–3 on aggregate. Eleven years later, Shankly maintained that two of Inter's goals were illegal. Even today, the Liverpool website describes the match by saying that [...] "(Liverpool were) only denied at the semi-final stage due to a dishonest referee in Milan". According to Kelly, however, video evidence shows that the two disputed goals were actually legitimate. Shankly said after the defeat in Milan that the Inter fans were going mad because they were [...] "so pleased to have beaten Liverpool" [...] and insisted that this proved the high standard [...] "you (the team) have raised yourselves up to".|$|E

[...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] begins playing approximately 17 seconds into the video. Each character is again seen in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen followed by a shot of a pair of hands holding a strip of photos of that particular person during which red text is displayed showing the character's name. A woman with short blonde hair and a <b>red</b> <b>top,</b> seen holding {{her head in her hands}} is introduced as [...] "The wife"; a bald man with blood on his head is [...] "The husband"; a woman in a white jacket with a blonde mullet hairstyle is [...] "The mistress"; a man with thick-rimmed glasses, a white jacket, and red polo neck sweater is [...] "The voyeur"; and a man in a red and black tracksuit top with a large scar running from his left eye to right cheek is [...] "The stalker". The five characters are all seen singing along to the track individually, again framed in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen. [...] "The wife" [...] is twice shown ripping a photograph of her and [...] "The husband", while [...] "The mistress" [...] is seen sitting on the lap of [...] "The husband" [...] in two shots. After 1 minute and 6 seconds the Super Furry Animals are shown playing along to the track on a rotating dancefloor surrounded by photo booths and several dancers in dark clothes. During an instrumental break in the song, at 1 minute 38 seconds, two masked men are shown playing table tennis on another rotating dancefloor with two large fluorescent purple circles in the background. The five characters are then seen walking around the band and stepping into the photo booths that surround them. The text [...] "Act 1: The kiss" [...] is shown, after which footage of the Super Furry Animals playing along to the track is intercut with shots of the characters. [...] "The husband" [...] and [...] "The mistress" [...] kiss while a strip of photos is seen being passed through a pair of hands and [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown using a video camera. The characters move to different photo booths and the title [...] "Act 2: The stalking" [...] is displayed. Shots of [...] "The stalker" [...] and [...] "The wife" [...] are then intercut with shots of the band. The characters again change booths and the title [...] "Act 3: The murder" [...] is shown. After quick jump cuts between shots of the band, the masked men playing table tennis and the five characters, [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown pointing his video camera at the motionless body of [...] "The mistress" [...] which is laid in a bathtub covered in film stock. More footage of the band follows before [...] "The husband" [...] is shown motionless of the floor, surrounded by a white tape outline. The video ends with more jump cuts between the band, the masked table tennis players and the five named characters.|$|E
