5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of <b>running</b> blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer <b>running</b> blades {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their <b>running</b> times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened <b>running</b> strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a <b>running</b> blade.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Determination of the {{economic}} grounded sizes of motion of freight trains between the areas of railway direction with parallel <b>runnings.</b> A research task is distribution in the operative terms of train work at admission of freight trains between the areas of railway direction with parallel <b>runnings.</b> Methodology. Research is executed {{with the use of}} classic methods and methods of the linear programming. Findings. The rational train traffic volume distribution on a railway infrastructure with parallel <b>runnings</b> is presently carried out by an expert method on the basis of information about the before executed volumes of transportations without application of feasibility study. For the task solution of train traffic volume distribution between parallel <b>runnings</b> of railway direction a linear model and methods of the linear programming are used in operative terms. At a design all train traffic volume on a direction part on undistributed train traffic volume – which remaines unchanging for all variants of operative management and distributed – which it is possible to redistribute in some limits between parallel <b>runnings</b> of railway direction. Originality. From the scientific point of view the work is interesting and important by the methods of the linear programming, which allow conducting train traffic volume distribution between parallel <b>runnings</b> in operative terms. Practical value. The practical value of this research is in applying of the described economic and mathematical modeling methods of train traffic volume distribution between parallel <b>runnings</b> on direction Znamenka - Odessa. 10 pairs transmission of freight trains from basic direction Pomoshnaya – Kolosovka – Odessa on parallel direction Pomoshnaya - Kotovsk – Separate is Odessa can be included with the optimum variant...|$|R
