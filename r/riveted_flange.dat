40|$|AbstractSelf-piercing {{riveting}} is {{a high-speed}} mechanical fastening technique for joining sheet-material components. In recent years, {{the development of}} the self-piercing riveting technology has broadened the application of the technology in the automobile industry. In this paper, a new method of joining metal sheets using a short pipe <b>rivet</b> with inner <b>flange</b> is proposed. Self-pierce <b>riveting</b> with inner <b>flange</b> pipe <b>rivet</b> is used to joint Al 6063 aluminum alloy sheets. Riveting process is presented. Different parameters of rivet height, rivet diameter, rivet end angle and rivet wall thickness are combined to obtain forming laws and static mechanical performance. Tensile tests of the lap joints, coach peel joints and cross joints of self-piercing <b>riveting</b> with inner <b>flange</b> pipe <b>rivet</b> are carried out. The effects of rivet heights, diameters, end angle and rivet wall thickness on tensile strength are explored...|$|R
5000|$|The joint {{consists}} {{of a piece of}} doughnut shaped rubber with reinforcing cords vulcanized in it, similar to a tire. This disc is bolted or <b>riveted</b> to <b>flanges</b> mounted on the ends of the shafts to connect the steering wheel shaft to the steering gear. The ragged cords can be seen on the edge of this piece of rubber, hence the term [...] "rag joint". The bolt holes themselves are often reinforced by steel tubes moulded into the doughnut.|$|R
50|$|A steel {{safety net}} has been {{installed}} since {{construction of the}} new bridge in the two-foot (60 cm) gap between the bridges. The original bridge has 20 plate girder spans supported by nine tapered steel piers. Two deep deck girders, iron plate webs with <b>riveted</b> angle <b>flanges</b> and web stiffeners, carry the road. The piers {{are made up of}} two bents, their legs made of two back-to-back steel channels with cover plate and double lacing. They are braced by tiers of compression beams and tension eyebars. At the ground they are supported by masonry piers.|$|R
5000|$|The Planter Road - Jackson Creek Bridge is a 52 ft {{long and}} 20 ft wide [...] steel plate girder bridge; {{a variety of}} bridge that was {{commonly}} used in states such as Pennsylvania and New York, but is relatively rare in Michigan. The superstructure contains two 50-foot through girders, made from a steel plate with <b>riveted</b> angle <b>flanges</b> and web stiffeners. The deck of the bridge supported by I-beam stringers, over which concrete is laid. The bridge is a strictly utilitarian structure, with no architectural detailing of any kind. No alterations {{have been made to}} the bridge, and it is in the original, well-preserved condition.|$|R
5000|$|With his {{following}} design, the HP-17, Schreder {{developed a}} new, more cost-effective method for making wing spars. These spars featured a rectangular box section consisting of machined C-channels {{for the upper}} and lower caps, joined by shear web panels <b>riveted</b> to the <b>flanges</b> of the spar cap channels. These channels were again manufactured by Mazur, and were carefully made so that the floor of the channel tapers in thickness from 3/8" [...] at the root to 1/16" [...] at the tip.|$|R
40|$|Fracture is {{the primary}} threat to the integrity, safety, and {{performance}} of nearly all highly stressed mechanical structures, e. g., aircrafts, building units or pressure vessels. Contemporary exacting demands on reliability and safety of material structures are not realizable without effective means of NDT and continuous state monitoring. AE monitoring of structures needs new robust and fast methods for emission source location and classification. Recently proposed AE source location method using so-called signal arrival time profiles and artificial neural networks (ANN) was applied for monitoring of growing defects during long-term fatigue testing of <b>riveted</b> aircraft wing <b>flange.</b> The potentialities of the method regarding the on-line monitoring of dangerous crack growth in selected critical parts of aircraft structures are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} {{supported}} by two fieldstone abutments and a pier. Its two spans are identical in construction, with one being much longer than the other. The 45 ft span {{at the south end}} is an end-post three-panel pony truss with both cast and wrought iron elements. Its upper chord is a riveted steel girder supported by lattice-braced members <b>riveted</b> to the <b>flanges</b> of the plate girder. The lower chord consists of two double wrought iron tension bars. The central panel is cross-braced with wrought-iron tie rods. All joints, not just in this span but the main one as well, are secured by threaded iron pins two inches (5 cm) wide capped with hexagonal nuts.|$|R
40|$|In principle, the {{acoustic}} emission (AE) {{represents one of}} NDT and structure health monitoring (SHM) methods for the detection and identification of growing material defects. Different types of signals detected by the AE method are supposed to correspond to different types of defects or operational noises. Monitoring of structures by acoustic emission needs new robust and fast methods for emission source location and classification. Recently proposed AE source location method using so called signal arrival time profiles and artificial neural networks (ANN) was applied for monitoring of growing defects during long term fatigue testing of <b>riveted</b> aircraft wing <b>flange.</b> The potentialities of the method regarding the on-line monitoring of dangerous crack growth in selected critical parts of aircraft structures are discussed...|$|R
50|$|As {{the bridges}} were for light roadways {{and did not}} have to carry the weight of a railway or train, their girders were of a {{lightweight}} construction, known as Balloon flange girders that simplified manufacture. A full balloon upper flange was used, similar in shape to the South Wales Railway bridges, but the flange sat above the main web of the girder and the web did not span the flange and reach to the top. This simplified construction as it avoided the T-joint, the necessary L-strips and thus several rows of <b>riveting.</b> The lower <b>flange</b> was of an entirely novel form, being triangular in section, although with concave sides. Again, the main web did not span the flange. All three joints were now simple lap joints with single-row riveting.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{self-piercing}} riveting (SPR) method {{which uses a}} <b>flange</b> pipe <b>rivet.</b> This joining technology can {{solve the problems of}} oblique rivet and incorrect rivet position which are usually found in the SPR with a pipe rivet. The lap shear strength of the joint with a <b>flange</b> pipe <b>rivet</b> is higher than that of a joint with a conventional rivet. In this research, a <b>flange</b> pipe <b>rivet</b> was placed between two sheets with a force applied to the top sheet by a punch <b>riveting</b> machine. The <b>flange</b> pipe <b>rivet</b> moved downward along with the top sheet to induce appropriate bending and form a mechanical interlock in both sheets. Finite element (FE) analysis of the SPR with a <b>flange</b> pipe <b>rivet</b> was done by DEFORM software. The simulated joint cross-section shapes were observed, and the influence of the <b>flange</b> pipe <b>rivet</b> parameters on joint quality was analyzed. Simultaneously, some riveting experiments on joining aluminum sheets were conducted taking into consideration different rivet heights and chamfer angles. The results show that the joining surface is smooth and the simulated joint cross-section shapes are in good agreement with the experimental results. The joining property with a chamfer angle of 45 Â° and a rivet height of 5 mm is found to be the best in joining the Al 6063 aluminum alloy sheets with a thickness of 2. 4 mm by using the SPR with a <b>flange</b> pipe <b>rivet...</b>|$|R
