40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} effects of {{positioning}} and notching of <b>resurfaced</b> femurs on the mechanical strength of third-generation saw bone (TGSB) femurs using an in vitro analogue bone model. METHODS: 30 TGSB femurs were equally divided into 6 <b>resurfaced</b> femur groups (intact, anatomic, varus, valgus, anatomically notched, and valgus notched) for testing the load to failure, stiffness, and total energy. RESULTS: Compared to the intact femurs, the load to failure in all <b>resurfaced</b> femurs was significantly decreased by 29 to 57 %. Among the <b>resurfaced</b> femurs, valgus and anatomic femurs had the highest load to failure, followed by valgus notched, varus, and anatomically notched femurs. Notching weakened the construct by a further 24 to 30 %. CONCLUSION: To minimise the risk of femoral neck fracture, <b>resurfaced</b> femoral heads should be placed in an anatomic or valgus orientation, and the superior cortex of the femoral neck should remain intact. 4 page(s...|$|R

5|$|The geology of Titania was {{influenced}} by two competing forces: impact crater formation and endogenic <b>resurfacing.</b> The former acted over the moon's entire history and influenced all surfaces. The latter processes were also global in nature, but active mainly for a period following the moon's formation. They obliterated the original heavily cratered terrain, explaining the relatively low number of impact craters on the moon's present-day surface. Additional episodes of <b>resurfacing</b> may have occurred later {{and led to the}} formation of smooth plains. Alternatively smooth plains may be ejecta blankets of the nearby impact craters. The most recent endogenous processes were mainly tectonic in nature and caused the formation of the canyons, which are actually giant cracks in the ice crust. The cracking of the crust was caused by the global expansion of Titania by about 0.7%.|$|E
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements {{may have led}} to melting of the ice if an antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. The melting {{may have led to}} the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the coreâ€“mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago. Among Uranian moons Umbriel was least subjected to endogenic <b>resurfacing</b> processes, although it may like other Uranian moons have experienced a very early <b>resurfacing</b> event.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Gemini and Keck telescopes {{obtained}} {{spectra of}} Haumea which showed strong crystalline water ice features {{similar to the}} surface of Pluto's moon Charon. This is peculiar, because crystalline ice forms at temperatures above 110 K, whereas Haumea's surface temperature is below 50 K, a temperature at which amorphous ice is formed. In addition, the structure of crystalline ice is unstable under the constant rain of cosmic rays and energetic particles from the Sun that strike trans-Neptunian objects. The timescale for the crystalline ice to revert to amorphous ice under this bombardment is on the order of ten million years, yet trans-Neptunian objects have been in their present cold-temperature locations for timescales of billions of years. Radiation damage should also redden and darken the surface of trans-Neptunian objects where the common surface materials of organic ices and tholin-like compounds are present, {{as is the case with}} Pluto. Therefore, the spectra and colour suggest Haumea and its family members have undergone recent <b>resurfacing</b> that produced fresh ice. However, no plausible <b>resurfacing</b> mechanism has been suggested.|$|E

5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It has frequently been {{confused with the}} other circumpolar long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia.

Herbarium specimens were also a mix of the two species. These points led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998.

5|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{of their}} orbits causes regular flexing {{of the three}} moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing heats the moons' interiors by friction.

A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and <b>resurfacing</b> after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E
