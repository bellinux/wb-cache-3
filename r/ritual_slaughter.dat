5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – <b>ritual</b> <b>slaughter</b> and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ritual</b> <b>slaughter</b> is permitted, and {{regulated}} {{by a special}} convention concerning <b>ritual</b> <b>slaughter.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{legal aspects}} of <b>ritual</b> <b>slaughter</b> include the {{regulation}} of slaughterhouses, butchers, and religious personnel involved with traditional shechita (Jewish) and dhabiha (Islamic). Regulations also may extend to butchery products sold in accordance with kashrut and halal religious law. Governments regulate <b>ritual</b> <b>slaughter,</b> primarily through legislation and administrative law. In addition, compliance with oversight of <b>ritual</b> <b>slaughter</b> is monitored by governmental agencies and, on occasion, contested in litigation.|$|E

50|$|Ritual Houses {{were the}} {{religious}} buildings before Christians came to Scandinavia. Early ritual houses were simple wooden buildings {{not much different}} from other buildings. Ritual houses were a place to display the weapons of defeated enemies. But as time went on, they got more complex. They became imitations of churches. They often had multi - layer roofs with decorations on the peaks. The entrances were also ornamented with decorated columns. Most <b>rituals</b> (<b>slaughtered</b> and burnt animal sacrifices) took place outside, so the majority of the decorations were on the outside.|$|R

30|$|Data we {{collected}} on absolute numbers of livestock births, deaths, transactions, and exchanges indicates that three primary factors drive changes in herd size and species composition {{during and after}} drought (Figure  19). For wealthy families, having larger absolute herd sizes means greater numbers of births (absolute numbers of infants born: U[*]=[*] 1, 586, 6.016, p[*]<[*] 0.00001) and excess stock to slaughter for ceremonies and <b>rituals</b> (<b>slaughters,</b> all species: U[*]=[*] 33, 2.790, p[*]<[*] 0.0053). Wealthy families purchased stock to rebuild their herds when times were bad (U[*]=[*] 108.5, 2.592, p[*]<[*] 0.0095) suggesting that these households prioritize year round herd building via stock purchases.|$|R

50|$|Yiḥya Yitzḥak Halevi {{was born}} in Ṣan‘ā’, the eldest of ten {{children}} born unto Musa Yitzḥak, a tanner of hides by profession, and a descendant {{of one of the}} city's more illustrious Jewish families. Yiḥya Yitzḥak received his early education from his maternal grandfather, the Rabbi and kabbalist Shalom Mansura, and was already knowledgeable in the laws of <b>ritual</b> <b>slaughtering</b> at the early age of eleven. In 1880, at the age of thirteen, he began to study the Talmud and the legal writings of the poskim, with other boys his own age, in the house of his grandfather, the said Rabbi Mansura, until his grandfather's death in 1883. Afterwards, he studied under the prominent scholars in the famous Maharitz synagogue in Ṣan‘ā’. The synagogue served at that time as the city's chief seat of learning. In the evenings, he would continue his studies in the midrashic school belonging to the great teacher, Rabbi Ḥayim Qoraḥ (d. 1914), where they studied Ein Yaakov and the Shulchan Arukh and their respective commentaries.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order for}} these traditions {{to take part}} in the United States, certain {{governmental}} regulations, enforced by acts, such as the Humane Slaughter Act require various prerequisites to be in place before any <b>ritual</b> or <b>slaughter</b> of any kind be permitted.

Regulations include that the animal be completely insensitive to pain before killing it, typically by a technique like electronarcosis.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Hilsner {{was accused}} of another murder. Marie Klímová, a servant, had {{disappeared}} on 17 July 1898. A female body was found on 27 October following in the same forest as the body of Anežka Hrůzová. This body had, with great probability, been identified as the missing girl. However, decomposition was so advanced that not even {{the fact that the}} girl had been murdered could be established. Hilsner, charged with this crime also, was tried for both murders in Písek (25 October-14 November 1900). The witnesses at this trial became more definite in their statements. Those that at the first trial had spoken of a knife which they had seen in Hilsner's possession, now asserted distinctly that it was such a knife as was used in <b>ritual</b> <b>slaughtering.</b> The strange Jews who were supposedly seen in company with Hilsner were more and more particularly described. When witnesses were shown that the testimony given by them at the second trial differed from that given at the first trial, they said either that they had been intimidated by the judge or that their statements had not been correctly recorded.|$|R
