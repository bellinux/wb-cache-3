40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{evaluate}} whether early-stage entrepreneurs and the established self-employed in <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> trade off-the-books and whether this tendency varies across deprived and affluent rural localities. Design/methodology/approach – Face-to-face {{interviews were conducted with}} 350 households in both affluent and deprived <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> in England. Findings – In both the affluent and deprived <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> surveyed, wholly legitimate enterprises represent {{just the tip of the}} iceberg. Beneath the surface is a large hidden enterprise culture of both registered businesses trading off-the-books and unregistered wholly off-the-books enterprises. However, the preponderance of both early-stage entrepreneurs, as well as the established self-employed to trade off-the-books is greater in deprived than affluent <b>rural</b> <b>communities,</b> intimating that deprived <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> are perhaps relatively more enterprising and entrepreneurial than is currently recognised. Research limitations/implications – These findings are based on a small-scale study of five English <b>rural</b> <b>communities.</b> Further studies are now required {{to evaluate}} whether similar findings are replicated elsewhere. Practical implications – The paper reveals that legitimising the hidden enterprise culture in deprived <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> could be an important but so far untapped means of promoting enterprise and economic development. Originality/value – Evaluates the extent of informal entrepreneurship in <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> and how this varies spatially.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial resources from the Sistema General de Participaciones or General Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas.

40|$|Abstract: The leading global {{cause of}} high {{mortality}} {{has been identified}} to be chronic non-communicable diseases such as stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory conditions, heart disease, diabetes etc. These diseases affect communities both from the rural and urban areas. Deaths {{as a result of}} these diseases are relatively higher in <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> as most of them have limited access to health care services. The limited access to health care services by <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> is due to the difficulty experienced by governments in bringing those services to <b>rural</b> <b>communities.</b> Contributing factors to the difficulty is the inaccessibility of those communities and shortage of resources such as health professionals. The authors in this paper share the sentiment that community health workers can play a major role in assisting governments to deliver health services to <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> regardless of their location. This paper therefore presents an application that supports health workers in diagnosing and monitoring non-communicable diseases in <b>rural</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R
