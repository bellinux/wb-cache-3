5000|$|A motor {{capacitor}}, {{such as a}} {{start capacitor}} or <b>run</b> <b>capacitor</b> (including a dual <b>run</b> <b>capacitor)</b> is an electrical capacitor that alters the current {{to one or more}} windings of a single phase AC induction motor to create a rotating magnetic field. There are two common types of motor capacitors, run capacitors and start capacitors. The units of capacitance are labeled in microfarads (µF). Older capacitors may be labeled with the obsolete terms [...] "mfd" [...] or [...] "MFD", which means microfarad.|$|E
50|$|If a motor {{is running}} during a {{lightning}} strike {{on the power}} grid, the <b>run</b> <b>capacitor</b> might be damaged or weakened by a voltage spike, thus requiring replacement.|$|E
50|$|Start {{capacitors}} have ratings above 70 µF, {{with four}} major voltage classifications: 125 V, 165 V, 250 V, and 330 V. Examples of motor capacitors are: a 35 µF, at 370 V, <b>run</b> <b>capacitor,</b> or an 88-108 µF at 250 V start capacitor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Run</b> <b>capacitors</b> are {{designed}} for continuous duty while the motor is powered, which is why electrolytic capacitors are avoided, and low-loss polymer <b>capacitors</b> are used. <b>Run</b> <b>capacitors</b> are mostly polypropylene film capacitors and are energized the entire time the motor is running. <b>Run</b> <b>capacitors</b> are rated {{in a range of}} 1.5 to 100 µF, with voltage classifications of 370 V or 440 V.|$|R
2500|$|Some film {{capacitors}} {{of special}} shapes and styles {{are used as}} capacitors for special applications, including RFI/EMI suppression capacitors for connection to the supply mains, also known as safety capacitors, Snubber capacitors for very high surge currents, Motor <b>run</b> <b>capacitors,</b> AC capacitors for motor-run applications ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the input}} {{parameters}} {{of a single}} phase split-phase induction motor is taken to investigate and to study the output performance characteristics of capacitor start and <b>capacitor</b> <b>run</b> induction motor. The value of these input parameters {{are used in the}} design characteristics of <b>capacitor</b> <b>run</b> and <b>capacitor</b> start motor with each motor connected to rated or standard capacitor in series with auxiliary winding or starting winding respectively for the normal operational condition. The magnitude of capacitor that will develop maximum torque in capacitor start motor and <b>capacitor</b> <b>run</b> motor are investigated and determined by simulation. Each of these capacitors is connected to the auxiliary winding of split-phase motor thereby transforming it into capacitor start or <b>capacitor</b> <b>run</b> motor. The starting current and starting torque of the split-phase motor (SPM), <b>capacitor</b> <b>run</b> motor (CRM) and capacitor star motor (CSM) are compared for their suitability in their operational performance and applications...|$|R
50|$|Start {{capacitors}} briefly increase {{motor starting}} torque and allow a motor to be cycled {{on and off}} rapidly. A start capacitor stays in the circuit long enough to rapidly bring the motor up to a predetermined speed, which is usually about 75% of the full speed, and is then {{taken out of the}} circuit, often by a centrifugal switch that releases at that speed. Afterward the motor works more efficiently with a <b>run</b> <b>capacitor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A faulty <b>run</b> <b>{{capacitor}}</b> often becomes swollen, {{with the}} sides or ends bowed or bulged out further than usual: {{it can be}} clear {{to see that the}} capacitor has failed because it is swollen or even blown apart causing the capacitor's electrolyte to leak out. Some capacitors are built with a [...] "Pressure Sensitive Interrupter" [...] design that causes them to fail before internal pressures can cause serious injury. One design causes the top of the capacitor to expand and break internal wiring.|$|E
5000|$|Dual {{capacitors}} come in {{a variety}} of sizes, depending on the capacitance (µF), such as 40 plus 5 µF, and also the voltage. A 440 volt capacitor can be used in place of a 370 volt, but not a 370 in place of a 440 volt. The capacitance must stay the same within 5% of its original value. [...] Round cylinder-shaped dual run capacitors are commonly used for air conditioning, to help in the starting of the compressor and the condenser fan motor. [...] An oval dual <b>run</b> <b>capacitor</b> could be used instead of a round capacitor, but the mounting strap should be changed to better fit the oval shape.|$|E
25|$|AC loads {{can occur}} in AC motor <b>run</b> <b>capacitors,</b> for voltage doubling, in snubbers, {{lighting}} ballast and for power factor correction PFC for phase shifting to improve transmission network stability and efficiency, {{which is one of}} the most important applications for large power capacitors. These mostly large PP film or metallized paper capacitors are limited by the rated reactive power VAr.|$|R
2500|$|The {{dissipation}} factor of PP film capacitors {{is smaller than}} that of other film capacitors. Due to the low and very stable {{dissipation factor}} over a wide temperature and frequency range, even at very high frequencies, and their high dielectric strength of 650nbsp&V/µm, PP film capacitors {{can be used in}} metallized and in film/foil versions as capacitors for pulse applications, such as CRT-scan deflection circuits, or as so-called [...] "snubber" [...] capacitors, or in IGBT applications. In addition, polypropylene film capacitors are used in AC power applications, such as motor <b>run</b> <b>capacitors</b> or PFC capacitors.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the great}} {{advantages}} of plastic films for capacitor fabrication is that plastic films have considerably fewer defects than paper sheets used in paper capacitors. This allows the manufacture of plastic film capacitors with only a single layer of plastic film, whereas paper capacitors need a double layer of paper. Plastic film capacitors were significantly smaller in physical size (better volumetric efficiency), with the same capacitance value and the same dielectric strength as comparable paper capacitors. Then-new plastic materials also showed further advantages compared with paper. Plastic is much less hygroscopic than paper, reducing the deleterious effects of imperfect sealing. Additionally, most plastics are subject to fewer chemical changes over long periods, providing long-term stability of their electrical parameters. Since around 1980, paper and metallized paper capacitors (MP capacitors) have almost completely been replaced by PET film capacitors for most low-power DC electronic applications. Paper is now used only in RFI suppression or motor <b>run</b> <b>capacitors,</b> or as a mixed dielectric combined with polypropylene films in large AC and DC capacitors for high-power applications.|$|R
40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of core length on efficiency of a single phase induction machine with a <b>run</b> <b>capacitor</b> in the auxiliary winding. The whole thesis {{can be divided into}} two parts. The first part of the thesis includes general knowledge concerning single phase induction machines and technical base for its analytical calculation. The second part works with the actual technical documentation of a motor. This part includes creation of the motor model in RMxprt module, analytical calculation for verifying the motor properties and laboratory measurement, where the results are primarily compared to RMxprt simulation {{as well as to the}} analytical calculation, mainly from the efficiency perspective...|$|E
40|$|Single Phase Induction Machines formthework {{horse of}} various fractional-power {{domestic}} and agricultural {{applications such as}} vacuum cleaners, fans, water pumps etc. They are often designed to be simple, rugged and low-cost. This work is aimed at using these single-phase induction machines for wider applications. A majority of single-phase induction machines are capacitor-start type of induction machines. These machines have two-stator windings {{in space and time}} quadrature. One of these windings is used only to start the machine. The possibility of using this passive winding as an active winding, functional throughout the machine operation, by simply retrofitting a <b>run</b> <b>capacitor,</b> has been discussed in this work. Consequently, this two-phase winding machine has been proposed {{to be used as a}} wind turbine generator coupled with power electronics. The suggested dc-link inverter single-phase induction machine system can be an economical generator system to provide for fractional horsepower applications as compared to the conventional and expensive permanent magnet generators. Computer simulation results have been used to confirm the analytical results of the proposed two-phase machine and wind-turbine generator system. Results of some preliminary experiments from a laboratory prototype of the two-phase motor have been presented...|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} of the centrifugal switch used a changeover contact {{to ensure that the}} auxiliary windings remain in the circuit through a running capacitor. These motors are called two-value or <b>capacitor</b> start <b>capacitor</b> <b>run</b> motors.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Nichicon {{was the primary}} {{capacitor}} manufacturer caught in the Capacitor Plague. No overall reason was ever proven for the huge production <b>runs</b> of defective <b>capacitors,</b> but some sources claimed that these capacitors were either overfilled with electrolyte or were constructed using electrolyte fluid that was prone to pop and leak fluid, causing premature failure in any equipment using them. Nichicon received particular infamy because of their use by major computer manufacturers including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Apple. In 2010 Dell settled a civil lawsuit for its shipment of at least 11.8 million computers from May 2003 to July 2005 that used faulty Nichicon components and were prone to major failure.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{switching}} transients in polyphase induction motors and synchro-nous machines {{has been studied}} in very great detail by several investigators in the past, but no published factual data exist dealing with {{the analysis of the}} problem of switch-ing transients in a three-phase induction motor <b>run</b> as a <b>Capacitor</b> Motor on single phase supply. This particular problem has been studied in this paper in detail by applying the Laplace Transform in a slightly modified form. It is shown that the developed electrical torque and the voltage across the con-denser do not exhibit any abnormal values during the first few cycles after the closing of the switch, whether switching is done at the maximum value or zero value of the applied voltage. This result is in striking contrast with the results obtained earlier with a plain general purpose Capacitor Motor...|$|R
50|$|To {{decouple}} other subcircuits {{from the}} effect of the sudden current demand, a decoupling capacitor can be placed between the supply voltage line and its reference (ground) next to the switched load. While the load is switched out, the capacitor charges up to full power supply voltage and otherwise does nothing. When the load is applied, the capacitor initially supplies demanded current. Ideally, by the time the <b>capacitor</b> <b>runs</b> out of charge, the power supply line inductance is saturated, and the load can draw full current at normal voltage from the power supply (and the capacitor can recharge too). Note that the voltage dip is reduced but not eliminated; i.e., the decoupling is not perfect and sometimes parallel combinations of caps are used to improve response. The best way to reduce switching noise is to design a PCB as a giant capacitor by sandwiching the power and ground planes across a dielectric material.|$|R
