5000|$|In the present, Spike demands his {{own office}} (or Wesley’s office during his leave of absence, while he adjusts to {{the shock of}} killing what he {{believed}} to be his father). Spike lacks sympathy for Wesley, since he himself killed his mother while she was hitting on him. “Well…that explains a lot,” Harmony remarks. She opens a package for Spike from an unknown source, producing a flash of light. When Harmony goes to answer the phone, she’s greeted by electronic screeching. As phones start <b>ringing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook,</b> Spike heads for Angel’s office, but {{when he tries to}} walk through the door, he quickly finds he is corporeal again, and celebrates with Harmony. Fred arrives, complaining that all of the atmospheric gauges in the science department have gone haywire and blown out the instruments. She is surprised to hear that Harmony and a re-corporealized Spike are, as Gunn says, [...] "having a nooner". Eve arrives and announces that the whole universe is in turmoil - Spike’s existence is messing with the expected course of the Shanshu prophecy, because after dying on the Hellmouth to save the world in the series finale of Buffy, Spike now qualifies as a champion. Meanwhile, Harmony’s eyes start bleeding and she bites Spike, screaming that he’s using her and really wants his [...] "Slayer whore". He returns to the group, and Eve says because there are two possible candidates for the Shanshu, “the wheel of destiny starts to spin off its axis.” ...|$|E

President Barack Obama personally called Stevens to congratulate him on Butler's season. David Letterman had Stevens on his show for a guest appearance. Butler admissions inquiries shot up 67%. Stevens received fan letters from around the world, and his phone <b>rang</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> He was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch before the Chicago Cubs vs. Florida Marlins game in Chicago on May 10. [...] "It's all been very surreal," [...] Stevens said. [...] "If you are the runner-up, you don't expect to talk to the president."

5000|$|These ten {{students}} {{entered into}} a tense but mostly peaceful situation at Mayfield High School {{in the fall of}} 1956. Looking back on those days, Alice Wilson remembered: [...] "They were absolutely shocked that we had walked in, and we did register; and I'm sure the telephones were <b>ringing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> for that one. Because, of course, it involved the teachers there, it involved, I'm sure, City Council, how they were gonna handle this situation. I'm sure it threw everybody into turmoil, but it wasn't blocked. It was not blocked by those, the City Council, and those who were making decisions at the time." [...] This was not the usual case - many other integration procedures did not go this smoothly. The integration of the white high school in nearby Sturgis, Kentucky, garnered international attention due to the white supremacist resistance.Alice Wilson described going in to register for admission to the all-white high school: [...] "I don't remember being afraid in the office. We weren't made to feel that way. But the atmosphere was that no one really knew what to do. Whether they should go ahead and register us, or wait until there was some decision, perhaps from the Board at that time. They didn't really know what to do. But we registered, and then the whole process began."The integration was optional, and for the first time, the students had the option to choose between Dunbar [...] "Colored" [...] High School and Mayfield High School. Following the Brown v. Board of Education decision, the Mayfield Ten chose to go to Mayfield High School to expand their opportunities, gain access to better materials, and to broaden their educations. They knew they were getting a better education at the all-white school, even though it was difficult on a day-to-day basis. Only two of the Mayfield Ten graduated on time - the others [...] "had to repeat a grade, or they failed, or they didn't catch up quite as quickly, or whatever." ...|$|E

Tommy Tutone's song [...] "867-5309/Jenny" [...] and the {{cinematic}} release of Bruce Almighty displaying 776-2323 as a number to call God both led to misdialed calls in multiple area codes.

5000|$|The {{makers of}} 2003 film Bruce Almighty used 776-2323 as a {{telephone}} number for God (played by Morgan Freeman).

In Colorado the calls were misdirected to KDMN radio; in Sanford, North Carolina the number belongs to a church. 776-2323 was ultimately replaced with a 555 number for television airings of the movie and on most copies of the DVD.

Mothers Acting Up is a movement to inspire, invite, and educate mothers to create systematic change by becoming politically active on behalf of children's well being around the world.

Griffin unfortunately discovers that Dr. Egan is the only suspect left. Logan, Griffin's friend and amateur actor, agrees {{to get to know}} Egan's daughter so he can search the house and find <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> getting him <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> <b>The</b> plan fails when they discover Egan does not have the ring. Griffin is tried and placed under house arrest, where his friends meet him via video chat and formulate a final plan to clear their friend's name. Savannah, the animal lover of the group, finds that a type of mouse that is attracted to shiny objects may have found Griffin's lost retainer and swapped it out with the ring. Melissa, the computer whiz, hacks into Griffin's house arrest system that allows him to leave the house without <b>the</b> alarm coming <b>off</b> while his parents are out. At the school during its play, Hail Caesar!, Griffin leads Egan to the pack rat's nest and clears his name. He is then raced home and resets his house arrest anklet as his parents arrive. Egan, who got Griffin home in time, clears up matters and apologizes to Griffin, saying that he was wrong to judge him. Also, Celia White shows up in an attempt to get a story on him. Before she can twist the words, however, Egan makes her stop and makes sure she won't be doing it again. After this, Griffin asks the court if it will take a truly good-hearted friend, Shank, out of the state school, so he can have a chance at life. They accept and it is implied that life will be better for Griffin and his friends.|$|R
