They develop an intertemporal endogenous growth model that explicitly accepts <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> imports as a factor of production. The model establishes {{a link between the}} growth rate of productivity in a developing country and the country's intensity of learning to use <b>foreign</b> <b>technologies.</b> They hypothesize that a developing country's economic growth rate increases as <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> imports increase. They run regressions with data for about 50 developing countries, using different econometric methods and time spans. These empirical tests confirm the hypothesis that <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> transfers boost income growth rates. Moreover, economic developing in developing countries differs from that in industrial countries. In developing countries, increases in productivity depend not on innovation but on importing foreign plants and equipment and on borrowing <b>foreign</b> <b>technology.</b> Economic Theory&Research,Environmental Economics&Policies,Achieving Shared Growth,Economic Growth,Inequality...|$|R

40|$|Summary This paper {{examines}} {{the pattern of}} innovation and learning among state-owned enterprises in Chinese high-tech sectors and empirically estimates the impact of three types of investment for acquiring technological knowledge [...] in-house R&D, importing <b>foreign</b> <b>technology,</b> and purchasing domestic technology [...] on the innovation capabilities of firms. Based on a panel dataset consisting of 21 high-tech sectors during the period 1995 - 2004, an augmented knowledge production function is estimated. The results show that importing <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> alone does not facilitate innovation in Chinese state-owned high-tech enterprises, unless in-house R&D is also conducted. Domestic technology purchases, however, are {{found to have a}} favorable direct impact on innovation, suggesting that firms have less difficulty in absorbing domestic technological knowledge than utilizing <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> and that absorptive capacity is contingent upon the source or nature of the external knowledge.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between firms’ innovation activities and efficiency in manufacturing firms in developing countries. We examine whether innovation activities including internal research and development (R&D) and adoption of <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> have differential effects on technical efficiency. We hypothesize that the relation between internal R&D and technical efficiency is positive; the relation between adoption of <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> and technical efficiency is negative and lastly, internal R&D {{in combination with the}} adoption of <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> {{have a positive effect on}} technical efficiency. We use cross-sectional firm level survey data from the 2013 World Bank Enterprise Survey and the linked 2014 Innovation Follow-up Survey for examining the effect of innovation activities on firms’ technical efficiency. We test our hypothesis using cross-sectional stochastic frontier analysis. We find that internal R&D has a negative and significant effect on technical efficiency. Adoption of <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> on the other hand does not have a significant effect on technical efficiency. Nevertheless, the combination of internal R&D and adoption of <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> has a negative and significant effect on technical efficiency. We conclude that internal R&D may have dynamic effects on technical efficiency. Furthermore, efficiency may be observed in firms conducting internal R&D but results in relative inefficiency for firms not conducting R&D giving rise to overall inefficiency in the manufacturing industry. Lastly, low rates of human capital hamper R&D activity and the adoption of <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> in manufacturing firms in developing countries...|$|R

50|$|As {{they have}} {{accumulated}} experience {{in dealing with}} foreign corporations, Chinese economic administrators and enterprise managers have become better able to negotiate contracts that still permit the necessary training and consultation {{in the use of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>technology.</b> By the late 1980s, the transfer of <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> had become a normal commercial transaction. To an increasing extent, policy and practices for technology transfer were becoming part of general economic and foreign trade policies. China faced problems in assimilating technology in the factories that imported it and in deciding which <b>foreign</b> <b>technologies</b> to import. It was becoming clear to Chinese planners and <b>foreign</b> suppliers of <b>technology</b> that these problems reflected overall deficiencies in technical and management skills and that they were general economic and management problems. The solution to these problems was increasingly seen by Chinese administrators as lying in reforms of the economy and industrial management. The effort to import and assimilate <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> thus served to help unify technology policy and economic policy and to overcome the problems of the separation of science, technology, and the economy, which China's leaders had been trying to solve since the early 1950s.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} {{study of the}} impact on U. S. wage structure of domestic <b>technology,</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>technology,</b> and import penetration. A model is presented which combines factor proportions theory with a version of growth theory. The model, which assumes two levels of skill, suggests that domestic technology raises both wages, while <b>foreign</b> <b>technology,</b> on a simple interpretation, lowers both. Trade at a constant technology, as usual, lowers the wage of that class of labor used intensively by the affected industry, and raises the other wage. The findings support the predictions of the model for domestic technology. On the other hand, they suggest that technological change, and perhaps other factors, have obscured the role of factor proportions in the data. Indeed, <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> and trade {{have the same effect}} on wages at different skill levels, not the opposite effects suggested by factor proportions. Finally, a simple diffusion story, in which <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> lowers all U. S. wages, is also rejected. Instead, uniformly higher U. S. wages, not lower, appear {{to be associated with the}} technology and trade of the oldest trading partners of the U. S., the economies of the West. Not so for Asia, especially the smaller countries which have recently accelerated their trade with the U. S. Their effects are uniformly negative on wages, suggesting a distinction between shock and long run effects of <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> and trade.

In this paper, we study how these externalities are affected by technological incompatibilities between <b>foreign</b> and domestic <b>technologies.</b> When <b>foreign</b> <b>technologies</b> require specialized inputs, some local suppliers self-select into production for multinational firms. A decrease in the cost of inputs compatible with the <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> has heterogeneous effects. It benefits foreign firms and the most productive downstream domestic firms adopting the <b>foreign</b> <b>technology,</b> and negatively affects firms using the domestic technology. The impact on welfare is positive when we allow for endogenous entry in both upstream and downstream industries, but welfare gains can be negatively related to observed foreign presence at equilibrium.

Theoretically, a real depreciation has an ambiguous effect on <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> adoption. On the one hand, a real depreciation makes exports more competitive, and as exporters tend to adopt and use more advanced technologies, we should observe a higher propensity to import technologies among them. On the other hand, a real depreciation can also make imports of technology relatively more expensive. Thus, this question must be examined empirically. The empirical analysis shows that a real depreciation significantly increases the probability of using <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> licences for plants that export and for plants in the intermediate range of the size and productivity distribution.

40|$|Through an industry-level {{analysis}} of Chinese large- and medium-size manufacturing enterprises {{over the period}} of 1996 - 2001, this article investigates the direct and interactive contributions of four technology acquisition channels to industry performances in terms of innovation performance and productivity. These channels include in-house R&D, <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> transfer, domestic technology transfer, and inter-industry R&D spillover. We have found evidence of an important role of inter-industry R&D spillover in shaping and improving industry performance in China, which has been neglected by previous empirical studies concerned with Chinese industrial firms. The empirical results indicate that inter-industry R&D spillover and <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> transfer make significant contributions to both labour productivity {{and the level of}} total factor productivity in Chinese manufacturing industries. We have also found that in-house R&D and inter-industry R&D spillover share a complementary relationship in shaping innovation performance and total factor productivity in Chinese industry, and that in-house R&D relates to <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> transfer as a complement for labour productivity. Finally, on the mixed results among existing literature in the context of developing countries, this article argues that the commonly followed strategy in technology development, combined with government regulations, will play an essential role in determining the relationship between in-house R&D and <b>foreign</b> <b>technology</b> transfer. ...|$|R
