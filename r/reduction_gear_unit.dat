50|$|To {{further reduce}} engine plant noise, the normal {{propulsion}} setup of two steam turbines driving the screw through a <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> was changed instead to one large propulsion turbine with no reduction gears. This eliminated {{the noise from}} the main reduction gears, but the cost {{was to have a}} huge main propulsion turbine. The turbine was cylindrical, about 12 feet in diameter, and about 30 feet long. This massive size was necessary to allow it to turn slowly enough to directly drive the screw and be fairly efficient in doing so. The same propulsion setup was used on both the USS Narwhal and the land-based prototype.|$|E
40|$|Today, VVVF {{inverter}} control systems using induction motors {{are the main}} type of drive system for trains. This system has developed dramatically {{over the past ten}} odd years because it does not require physical switches or brushes / commutators to provide power, braking, and switching between forward and reverse. All of these factors mean that these systems can be made smaller and more lightweight. Because induction motors use external air for cooling, however, they require periodic maintenance to clean the interior of the motor, and inspection of the bearings and grease used. In addition, the power of the motor is transmitted to the wheels through the cardan shaft driving device (<b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> <b>unit)</b> - the same system used in DC motors- which transmits power through deceleration. Therefore, inspection of the gears, replacement of lubricants, and other maintenance is necessary...|$|E

40|$|Thanks to the {{progress}} in power electronics and advanced control technologies, {{the rolling stock}} drive motor system has changed from the DC motor system to the induction motor system. This has brought about a compact size, light weight and maintenance-free configuration, {{and there has been}} a growing need for further advance in this direction. However, the conventional main circuit system has almost reached the stage of maturity, and it is difficult to expect further improvement from the conventional system. To solve this problem, we have abolished the current drive system (<b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> <b>unit),</b> and have been committed to achieving a technological innovation through radical system change where the wheel is driven directly by a traction motor. Regarding this direct-drive motor system, we have developed a drive system for AC Train, where a major objective is to reduce the total cost as well as the initial cost, and to ensure 13 -year maintenance-free operations...|$|E

The aircraft are all half-scale World War II fighter aircraft replicas, based on a common design, consisting of a wooden fuselage box shape and wooden spar wing. Polyurethane foam was then used to create the different aircraft shapes and details. The foam was then covered in a high-strength laminating fabric and epoxy-resin. The series all share a common conventional landing gear design that is electrically retractable. The aircraft were initially powered by 1600 cc Volkswagen air cooled engines of [...] using Lloyd Patner's <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>units</b> driving 3-blade Fahlin props, but later Continental O-200 and Lycoming O-235s were used along with the Rotec R2800 radial engine.|$|R

40|$|One highly {{desirable}} characteristic of electrostatically driven microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) {{is that they}} consume very little power. The corresponding drawback is that the force they produce may be inadequate for many applications. It has previously been demonstrated that <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>units</b> or microtransmissions can substantially increase the torque generated by microengines. Operating speed, however, is also reduced by the transmission gear ratio. Some applications require both high speed and high force. If this output is only required for a limited period of time, then energy could be stored in a mechanical system and rapidly released upon demand. We have designed, fabricated, and demonstrated a high-density energy storage/rapid release system that accomplishes this task. Built using a 5 -level surface micromachining technology, the assembly closely resembles a medieval crossbow. Energy releases {{on the order of}} tens of nanojoules have already been demonstrated, and significantly higher energy systems are under development...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{general the}} hollow block machine is worked in manual, semi-{{automatic}}, automatic for any form. It is movable and {{fixed to the}} ground. Aim of this project is to avoid unequal or unbalance position of lower die to the hydraulic machine. The reason of unbalance position of die is circulation of oil fluid cannot be flow equally to the hydraulic machine. So, the position die is not setting to pallet and product is not accepted to the market. The design of balancer is used to overcome the above problem thoroughly. The balancer is used the concept of rack and pinion mechanism. [2]The rack and pinion system, motor rotation can be easily converted to linear motion. Rotation of the pinion-shaft motor is received by the <b>gear</b> (<b>reduction</b> <b>unit),</b> and then transmitted through the pinion gear to the rack and finally converted to linear motion.

5000|$|Especially {{interesting}} is its {{use as an}} experimental aircraft engine. This type of VW engine deployment started separately in Europe and in the US. In Europe this started in France straight after the Second World War using the engine in the Volkswagen Kübelwagen that were abandoned in the thousands in the country side and peaked with the JPX engine. In the US this started in the 1960s when VW Beetle started to show up there. [...] A number of companies still produce aero engines that are Volkswagen Beetle engine derivatives: Limbach, Sauer, Hapi, Revmaster, Great Plains, Hummel, the AeroConversions AeroVee Engine, and others. Kit planes or plans built experimental aircraft were specifically designed to utilize these engines. The VW air-cooled engine does not require an expensive and often complex <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>unit</b> to utilize a propeller at efficient cruise RPM. With its relative low cost and parts availability, many experimental aircraft are designed around the VW engines.|$|R
5000|$|Cold {{saw blades}} are {{circular}} metal cutting saw blades categorized into two types: solid HSS or tungsten carbide-tipped (TCT). Both types of blades are resharpenable {{and may be}} used many times before being discarded. Cold saw blades are used to cut metal using a relatively slow rotational speed, usually less than 5000 surface feet per minute (SFM) (25m/s), and a high chip load per tooth, usually between [...]001" [...] - [...]003" [...] (0.025 - 0.08mm) per tooth. These blades are driven by a high power motor and high-torque <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>unit</b> or an AC vector drive. During the cutting process, the metal is released in a shearing action by the teeth as the blade turns and the feed mechanism moves the blade forward. They are called [...] "cold saw blades" [...] because they transfer all the energy and heat created during the cutting process to the chip. This enables the blade and the work material to remain cold.|$|R

5000|$|During World War II Haydon made an {{important}} contribution to the war effort that made it possible for the United States Army Air Corps (now the United States Air Force) to continue its accurate targeting of strategic and tactical targets. Specifically, reference is made to the Farnsworth Research Bombing Control System [...] that improved upon the Norden Bombsight. Farnsworth Research had assumed that almost any clock company could furnish one important component, a small <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>unit,</b> with the necessary clutches and differentials. After searching the clock industry, it was discovered that their assumption was very wrong. Their program for the new electronic bombing system was in jeopardy for the lack of this specialized component. Haydon designed the <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>unit</b> for this program by designing a DC motor, patent No. 2,513,410 [...] that was used in aircraft, tanks, submarines, and a variety of portable military equipment so that all of this equipment could be operated by battery supply. This enabled Haydon to provide timers for battery operation that had previously required alternating current for synchronous motor operation.Haydon found that DC timer applications required accuracy far in excess of anything obtainable by the use of any DC motors then available, even with the best centrifugal governor attached. The only way to obtain the precision timing accuracy required for many applications was to use a crystal oscillator, frequency divider, amplifier, and synchronous motor, the total cost of which was in the neighborhood of $1,000.00 at the time. This device was {{about the size of a}} loaf of bread and weighed approximately 15 pounds. Such units were made by other companies but only for applications requiring extreme precision. It was obvious to Haydon that there was a definite need for a much smaller, lighter and less expensive method of producing accurate speed drives for timers and control mechanisms. So, he developed what is well known in the industry as a Chronometric Governor for his DC motors covered by patent No. 2,523,298. It was less than 2” in diameter, ½” thick, weighed two ounces and sold as part of the motor to which it was attached for approximately $60.00.This invention gave The A.W. Haydon Company the capability of furnishing precision timers for de-icing, cabin pressurization, microwave tuning, potentiometer time drives and components for ...|$|R
