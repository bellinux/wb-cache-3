40|$|This report {{describes}} both {{a general}} methodology and some specific examples of passive <b>radio</b> <b>receivers.</b> A passive <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> uses no direct electrical power but makes sole {{use of the}} power available in the radio spectrum. These <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> are suitable as low data-rate receivers or passive alerting devices for standard, high power <b>radio</b> <b>receivers.</b> Some zero-power <b>radio</b> architectures exhibit significant improvements in range {{with the addition of}} very low power amplifiers or signal processing electronics. These ultra-low power radios are also discussed and compared to the purely zero-power approaches...|$|R

50|$|Colonel Green had an {{artificial}} leg {{that made it}} difficult to walk, so he used a small electric car, which he equipped with a <b>radio</b> <b>receiver,</b> to travel around the estate grounds. He became such a fervent of fan of broadcasting that he equipped a second larger automobile with a <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> and loudspeakers, which could be driven to farmhouses and other locations that didn't have <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> in order to entertain the residents.|$|R
50|$|The {{information}} {{produced by}} the receiver {{may be in the}} form of sound, images, or data. A <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> may be a separate piece of electronic equipment, or an electronic circuit within another device. <b>Radio</b> <b>receivers</b> are components of communications, broadcasting, remote control, and network systems. In consumer electronics, the terms <b>radio</b> and <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> are often used specifically for receivers designed to reproduce sound transmitted by radio broadcasting stations, historically the first mass-market commercial radio application.|$|R
