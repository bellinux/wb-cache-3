Wolters wrote to Speer on November 30, describing Speer's assignment of blame as a [...] "dangerous oversimplification made entirely from today's perspective... You will surely <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 1939 we were all {{of the opinion that}} Hitler was Germany. Although we were certainly depressed rather than enthusiastic about the war in Poland, we surely considered that the responsibility for it was {{to be found in the}} provocative conduct by the Poles, and it was the British who made of it a world war." [...] Wolters asked Speer to [...] "concentrate wholly on what really happened, leaving aside what the world thinks of it now".|$|E

However, he continued his career, undisturbed by friend and foe… Later in life he was attracted to the new Brahmo Samaj and became a close friend of Keshub Chunder Sen… While cultivating his little garden he was found lost in devotion at the sight of full-blown rose and while singing a hymn in adoration of God, his whole countenance seemed to beam with heavenly light… When his end approached, his old friend Debendranath Tagore went to take leave of him, and when he left, he cried, ‘Now that the gates of heaven are open to you, and the Gods are waiting with their outstretched arms to receive you to the glorious region.’” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Housing Act of 1937 {{directed}} {{that initial}} motivation, maintenance, and partial {{funding of the}} housing program originate as the local level. [...] The federal government would now provide loans and subsidy assistance to local public housing agencies for the construction and operation of projects for [...] "families whose incomes are so low that they cannot afford adequate housing provided by private enterprise." [...] Those involved actively with public housing were generally pleased with this readjustment in operations. One federal publication stated that [...] "..we must <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 1931, Government housing was only a dream of progressives. Today {{it is a fact}} and there is strong reason to believe that, in the near future, it will be recognized as a permanent necessity..." [...] The United States Housing Authority (USHA) was soon established to facilitate the implementation of the Housing Act of 1937. The USHA was charged with the responsibility for the development and administration of all federal public housing programs. One of the Authority's first efforts was the implementation of a public relations campaign to establish popular support for the housing program that would help blunt attacks from the construction industry and others enemies. Public Housing was a highly polished monthly publication distributed as part of this public relations campaign. [...] This publication not only discussed the benefits and justifications of public housing programs, but charted progress on a national scale. [...] Many other government agency publications also took a very protective and supportive—some might say radical—tone concerning the newly established United States Housing Authority and its mission: ...|$|E

"The {{southern}} tribal hinterland of Baha—home to {{especially the}} Al-Ghamdi and Al-Zahrani tribes—has been renowned for centuries for their tribal cemeteries {{that are now}} slowly vanishing, according to Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper... One old villager explained how tribal cemeteries came about. “People used to die in large numbers and very rapidly {{one after the other}} because of diseases. So the villagers would dig graves close by burying members of the same family in one area. That was how the family and tribal burial grounds came about,” he said. The old man continued, “If the family ran out of space, they would open old graves where family members had been buried before and add more people to them. This process is known as khashf.” During famines and outbreaks of epidemics huge numbers of people would die and many tribes faced difficulties in digging new graves because of the difficult weather. Elderly people <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> olden times, the winter used to stretch for more than six months and would be accompanied with lots of rain and fog making movement difficult. But due to tribal rivalries many families would guard their cemeteries and put restrictions on who got buried in them. Across Baha burial grounds are constructed in different ways. Some cemeteries consist of underground vaults or concrete burial chambers with the capacity of holding a large number of bodies at a time. Such vaults include windows for people to peer through and are usually decorated ornately with writings, drawings and patterns. Muhammad Saleh, a local resident, said, “One {{of the things that is}} so iconic about many of these graves is the fact that many of them are not directed toward the Kaaba. This tells us that some of these graves are from the pre-Islamic era. In Islam the face of a dead person should be toward the Kaaba.”" ...|$|E
