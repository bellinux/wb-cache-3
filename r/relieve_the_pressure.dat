5|$|Treatment {{includes}} a healthy diet, salt restriction, and exercise. Bariatric surgery {{may also be}} used to help with weight loss. The medication acetazolamide may also be used along with the above measures. A small percentage of people may require surgery to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> inside the muscle compartment {{and reduce the}} risk of compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E

5|$|The {{station and}} parking tower {{are the main}} {{architectural}} structures. They are the landmarks of Zuoying, and their scale meets {{the conditions of the}} environment. As the major public construction in the city, the station applies glass screens to frame Half-Screen Mountain in the backdrop, a technique referred to as “scenery-borrowing.” The glass screens are supported by a colonnade on the ground floor. As one of the architectural characteristics of southern Taiwan, the colonnade here can <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> the building might bring to the streets.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Colonel Michaelis {{went to the}} 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked {{division}} commander Major General Hobart R. Gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division. Gay telephoned the Eighth Army headquarters {{and asked if he}} should attack in an effort to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on the 27th Infantry, or if that regiment should withdraw into the 1st Cavalry Division's area, move south to Kumch'on, and then turn toward Sangju to rejoin the 25th Division. The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, as Gay feared it would quickly be surrounded if it tried to hold its position.|$|E
5|$|Henry II came to {{the throne}} in 1154 and built {{extensively}} at Windsor between 1165 and 1179. Henry replaced the wooden palisade surrounding the upper ward with a stone wall interspersed with square towers and built the first King's Gate. The first stone keep was suffering from subsidence, and cracks were beginning {{to appear in the}} stonework of the south side. Henry replaced the keep with another stone shell keep and chemise wall, but moved the walls in {{from the edge of the}} motte to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on the mound, and added massive foundations along the south side to provide additional support. Inside the castle Henry remodelled the royal accommodation. Bagshot Heath stone was used for most of the work, and stone from Bedfordshire for the internal buildings.|$|E
5000|$|Decompression zone. In this zone, {{about two-thirds}} down the screw, the channel {{suddenly}} gets deeper, which <b>relieves</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> and allows any trapped gases (moisture, air, solvents, or reactants) {{to be drawn}} out by vacuum.|$|R

50|$|Eugene's {{activity}} had greatly <b>relieved</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on Piedmont, enabled Turin to {{hold out}} and kept the half-hearted Duke of Savoy true to his new alliance. The French put off the subjugation of Piedmont until the following year, on Louis's orders.|$|R
5|$|According to a DJ Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance. He had surgery for kidney stones, with a stent placed to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure.</b> He needed {{follow-up}} surgery but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous surgery, has requested that he make a deposit toward the next surgery, because he has missed several follow-up visits. The hospital {{said it would not}} turn away uninsured patients in the emergency room. DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{anticipated}} that Labour would legislate for two years, then seek {{a general election}} and be returned with {{a majority of the}} seats. Were this to occur, he would be 67 when that term expired, and according to him perhaps too old to hold office. With no ministerial responsibilities, he departed on a three-month tour of East Africa, hoping it might be useful were he to serve in future as Colonial Secretary. As the minority Labour Government attempted to grapple with the onset of the Depression, the Conservative Party indulged in a period of internecine warfare, with Baldwin under attack in the Parliamentary Party and in the press for losing the election, and for being too moderate. Chamberlain attempted to mediate between the press lords and Baldwin, only to learn that the newspaper owners had been trying to influence local constituency organisations behind his back. During the leadership crisis, Chamberlain persuaded Conservative Party chairman John Davidson to resign to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on Baldwin. Chamberlain took the vacant chair himself.|$|E
5|$|Gale {{concluded}} that to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on the division, {{he had to}} take Bréville. The only units available for the attack were the division reserve, which consisted of the 12th Parachute Battalion (350 men), and 'D' Company 12th Battalion Devonshire Regiment (eighty-six men). Another unit, the 22nd Independent Parachute Company, the division's pathfinders, were to stand by and respond to any German counter-attack. To provide fire support, Gale was given a squadron of tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, three field artillery regiments armed with 25 pounder guns, a medium artillery regiment of 5.5 inch guns and the division's own artillery the 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment. The attack on Bréville would start at 22:00, timed to catch the Germans tired and off-guard following the days fighting. The start line was on the outskirts of Amfreville, which had already been secured by No.6 Commando.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} Ellis {{commented that}} the soldiers always appreciated the effort to distract them from their deadly duties.

5000|$|Low-pressure {{safety valve}} (LPSV): An {{automatic}} system that <b>relieves</b> by <b>the</b> static <b>pressure</b> of a gas. <b>The</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is small and}} near <b>the</b> atmospheric <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
50|$|Richardson was {{the first}} person who made a safety valve which, while it {{automatically}} <b>relieved</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of steam in the boiler, did not, in effecting that result, reduce <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> to such an extent as to make the use of <b>the</b> <b>relieving</b> apparatus practically impossible because of the expenditure of time and fuel necessary to bring up the steam again to the proper working standard.|$|R
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure,</b> followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
5|$|The Light Division {{tried to}} {{systematically}} reconquer the Island of Dordrecht by advancing {{on a broad}} front, using four battalions with little artillery support. On its left flank, where {{there was almost no}} enemy presence, the advance went according to plan. The battalion on the right flank however, ran into an attacking German force of battalion strength that had been ordered by General Student to circle around {{the outskirts of the city}} to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> being placed on his troops holding the Dort bridges. In confused street fighting the German troops were successful in blocking the battalion; the other Dutch units then halted their advance around noon. Though higher command soon ordered a better concentration of forces instead of some mopping-up action, due to a lack of clear lines of command, no subsequent attack materialised that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} high operational {{tempo of}} the Army after East Timor further emphasised {{the need to}} develop the capability of the Army Reserve. Since then increasing numbers of Reservists have been deployed overseas in varying capacities as well as undertaking periods of full-time service in Australia to maintain capabilities within Regular units heavily committed to deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. In lower intensity areas, such as East Timor and the Solomon Islands, formed units of Reservists raised from personnel drawn from many units, have been deployed on peacekeeping duties to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> being placed upon the Regular Army and allowing them to focus on the higher intensity combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition to this Australian Army Reserve units have been deployed on border security duties with the Royal Australian Navy as part of Operation Relex, as well as participating regularly in multinational exercises such as Rifle Company Butterworth.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{hypothesize that}} using an AAC device <b>relieves</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> {{of having to}} speak, {{allowing}} the individual to focus on communication, and that the reduction in psychological stress makes speech production easier. Others speculate {{that in the case}} of speech generating devices, the model of spoken output leads to an increase in speech production.|$|R
50|$|It {{was stated}} in a {{statutory}} report, under the Reservoir Safety Act 1975, dated 12 June, that all five reservoirs could be over-topped during a Probable Maximum Flood. Woodhead as the fountainhead {{had the most}} extensive improvements, <b>relieving</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on <b>the</b> other reservoirs. The work took place between 1989 and 1992 {{at a cost of}} £3m.|$|R
50|$|Ballonet air valves were {{originally}} a butterfly type, actuated by springs. If <b>pressure</b> rose in <b>the</b> ballonet, a spring would <b>pressure</b> <b>the</b> spindle of the butterfly valve to turn, <b>relieving</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure.</b> In more recent implementations, the valves are actuated electrically either by a linear actuator (driven open/closed) or a linear solenoid (spring return), {{the latter being}} the favoured fail-to-safe arrangement.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{after the}} Royal Marines had met stiff resistance, No. 6 Commando attempted to advance from {{its position in}} an effort to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on them. This attack was well supported by artillery and a squadron of armour from the 8th Hussars, nevertheless, the commandos were stopped near an orchard close to the crossroads by a hastily formed, but well-led, force consisting of Luftwaffe aircrew and Fallschirmjäger. As the rest of the brigade advanced towards the town of Linne, attempts to cross the Montforterbeek Canal were frustrated by the defenders who managed to destroy all the bridges that crossed it. The ice over the canal was not thick enough to support the crossing of armour, so temporary bridges were brought up and erected by members of the Royal Engineers. Finally, after a number of attempts at forcing a crossing, an assault force from No. 3 Commando managed to enter Linne.|$|E
5|$|In Arnhem {{at around}} 03:30, the leading units of 11 Para reached 1st Parachute Brigade and the 2nd South Staffords, {{just as they}} started a new attempt to fight through to the bridge. As the {{battalion}} had just arrived and had no appreciation of the ground, it was held in reserve and played no part in the attack. By dawn and under intense fire, the attack faltered and 11 Para were ordered {{to carry out a}} left flanking attack to <b>relieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on the South Staffords. Only the intervention of Major-General Urquhart, just freed from where he had been trapped, stopped the 11 Para assault. Having recognised the futility of the battle Urquhart was not prepared to reinforce failure. At 11:00 the Major-General ordered 11 Para still in the outskirts of Arnhem to support the advance of 4th Parachute Brigade by occupying the high ground on the north-west outskirts of Arnhem. At 14:30 the battalion was caught in the open and subjected to a mortar attack. The attacked caused heavy casualties including the commanding officer lieutenant-Colonel George Lea, unable to proceed around 150 of the survivors were forced to withdraw towards Oosterbeek.|$|E
