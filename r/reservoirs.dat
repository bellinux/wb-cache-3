5|$|Advanced {{technology}} {{was required for}} the planning and construction of large <b>reservoirs</b> and canals. When constructing <b>reservoirs,</b> the gaps between low ridges in the dry zone plains were used for damming water courses. Two different techniques were used in construction; one method involved making an embankment using natural rock formations across a valley and the other involved diverting water courses through constructed canals to <b>reservoirs.</b> All the <b>reservoirs</b> and canals in an area were interconnected by an intricate network, so that excess water from one will flow into the other. The locations of these constructions indicate that the ancient engineers were aware of geological formations in the sites as well, and made effective use of them. Underground conduits have also been constructed to supply water to and from artificial ponds, {{such as in the}} Kuttam Pokuna and the ponds at Sigiriya.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} the system theory, the index system of {{geological}} conditions is divided into <b>reservoir</b> physical property, liquid physical property, and <b>reservoir</b> integrity; index system of <b>reservoir</b> physical property is divided into <b>reservoir</b> geometric structure, <b>reservoir</b> characteristics, and <b>reservoir</b> sensitivity; index system of liquid property includes the properties of formation oil, water, and gas, such as oil viscosity and density; the index system of <b>reservoir</b> integrity includes the correlation between oil <b>reservoir</b> and liquid, and property indexes characterizing <b>reservoir</b> integrity.

40|$|The Rio Grande is {{the fifth}} longest river in North America. Amistad <b>Reservoir</b> plays an {{important}} role for the development of sustainable water in the Rio Grande drainage basin. <b>Reservoir</b> management is a complex process involving not only the hydrological state of the <b>reservoir,</b> water quality in/downstream of the <b>reservoir,</b> and demands from downstream users, but also judgment weighing the risk of flood versus drought and the political positions of the two countries. This study simulates water quality in Amistad <b>Reservoir</b> using a two-dimensional <b>reservoir</b> model under various hydrological and water demand scenarios and projects water quality in the <b>reservoir</b> under different future climate scenarios due to potential global climatic warming. Different inflow and outflow scenarios and the initial <b>reservoir</b> storage condition can result in different water quality conditions in the <b>reservoir</b> which impact <b>reservoir</b> management plans. Drought in Rio Grande basin and increasing of water demand upstream and downstream of Amistad <b>Reservoir</b> can result in low <b>reservoir</b> storage. Simulations of water quality in Amistad <b>Reservoir</b> under different water availability and weather conditions can assist us in developing different alternative <b>reservoir</b> management plans. Unfavorable water quality conditions in the <b>reservoir</b> pose environmental and ecological concerns for the <b>reservoir</b> and communities downstream of the <b>reservoir...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the 19th century farming {{became less}} {{economic}} when {{construction of the}} <b>reservoirs</b> reduced the amount of agricultural land in the village. The weaving industry was mechanised, small mines closed and the population declined further when properties in the village were demolished in the early 20th century. Agriculture, mainly sheep farming, continues although on a small scale. Tourism at Rivington began in Victorian times and after the <b>reservoirs</b> were filled in the 1860s {{was known as the}} Little Lake District. Rivington became a popular destination when Lever Park opened in 1904.

5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to dive {{for long periods of}} time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving. Other important <b>reservoirs</b> include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial <b>reservoirs</b> of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E
