40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the effectiveness of 20 hours of remedial reading instruction as compared with 20 hours of vocabulary instruction on a select group of university freshmen in the Remedial English Program. Three measures of effectiveness used were comprehension, rate, and effective reading rate. The effective reading rate was determined by computing the arithmetic product of level of comprehension and rate of reading. The results indicated that for this particular population, using the materials and instructional techniques described, neither group <b>increased</b> <b>reading</b> rate at the. 01 level of significance.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects that {{enrollment}} in a year’s social studies teacher training program emphasizing global education has on preservice social studies teachers’ teaching behaviors. A qualitative research effort supported by quantitative approaches was employed. A researcher-made questionnaire, the Social Studies Internship Inventory (SSII), was utilized along with classroom observations by a participant-observer. Subjects taking the SSII included all student teachers completing their internships in secondary social studies education during the 1988 - 1989 academic year. For the observational portion of this study, six subjects were selected from among the aforementioned group. Their student teaching placements were {{in a mixture of}} urban, suburban, and inner-city schools at both the junior and senior high school levels. Findings include: much of global education relies on the ability of the teacher to recognize a 2 ̆ 2 critical teaching moment 2 ̆ 2; a curriculum that emphasizes a global perspective may depend more on the teacher than other curriculums; daily newspaper <b>reading</b> <b>increased</b> <b>significantly</b> between the beginning of the academic year {{and the end of the}} internship; a reversal occurred in the popularity of the television and newspaper as the main source of information over the course of the academic year (television news was watched more at the beginning? newspapers consulted more by the end); at the beginning of the study, 20...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} understanding of language ambiguity {{as a source}} of individual differences in children's reading comprehension skill, and the role of peer metalinguistic discussion in fostering comprehension improvement. Twenty-four 7 - to 9 -year-old children worked in pairs to discuss and resolve ambiguities in joking riddles. Their <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>increased</b> <b>significantly</b> more than a group of 24 no-treatment controls. Analysis of the children's discussions shows that comprehension improvement was associated with increases over training sessions in frequency of metalinguistic comments about the text ambiguities, and in particular with the simultaneous explanation of two meanings.

50|$|Deciding from {{benchmarking}} results, {{when used}} with {{relatively small number}} of servers (15), the file system achieves reading performance comparable to that of a single disk (80-100 MB/s), but has a reduced write performance (30 MB/s), and is relatively slow (5 MB/s) in appending data to existing files. (The authors present no results on random seek time.) As the master node is not directly involved in data reading (the data are passed from the chunk server directly to the reading client), the <b>read</b> rate <b>increases</b> <b>significantly</b> with the number of chunk servers, achieving 583 MB/s for 342 nodes. Aggregating a large number of servers also allows big capacity, while it is somewhat reduced by storing data in three independent locations (to provide redundancy).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the efficacy of an integrated cognitive and affective approach to improve students’ reading proficiency by improving their affective levels and strategy use. A survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire completed by both control and intervention classes before and after the intervention. The participants were 195 first-year university students in both high risk and low risk groups. The data were analysed using t-tests. The findings from the independent and paired t-tests show that students’ affective reading levels and their use of appropriate <b>reading</b> strategies <b>increased</b> <b>significantly.</b> The effect sizes were mainly medium to large, as determined by Cohen’s d. These findings corroborate other studies that have shown an improvement in students’ affective reading levels and their ability to comprehend what they read when the integrated approach is used.

40|$|Purpose: While {{educators}} and optometrists {{are concerned with}} reading efficiency in children with low vision, in most low vision assessments, children’s reading performance is assessed only by a brief evaluation of reading fluency. We examined the relationships between clinical vision measures and reading performance in children with low vision. Methods: Subjects were 71 students with low vision, aged seven to 18 years. The vision and reading performance measures were: high contrast distance visual acuity, contrast sensitivity using both the Pelli-Robson and LH symbol charts, near text visual acuity and reading rates {{on a range of}} print sizes. Results: Most children achieved maximum reading rate at print sizes between 2. 5 and seven times larger than threshold print size. Maximum <b>reading</b> rate <b>increased</b> <b>significantly</b> with age and near visual acuity. There was no significant relationship between reading rate and contrast sensitivity. Conclusions: The majority of children with low vision can achieve near normal reading rates with magnification. Age is the strongest predictor of reading rate in children with low vision. They need print sizes well above threshold to achieve maximum reading rate. Routine contrast sensitivity testing to visually impaired students is not indicated for reading assessments...|$|R
40|$|This work {{compares the}} {{detector}} performance and image {{quality of the}} new Kodak Min-R EV mammography screen-film system with the Fuji CR Profect detector and with other current mammography screen-film systems from Agfa, Fuji and Kodak. Basic image quality parameters (MTF, NPS, NEQ and DQE) were evaluated for a 28 kV Mo/Mo (HVL = 0. 646 mm Al) beam using different mAs exposure settings. Compared with other screen-film systems, the new Kodak Min-R EV detector has the highest contrast and a low intrinsic noise level, giving better NEQ and DQE results, especially at high optical density. Thus, {{the properties of the}} new mammography film approach those of a fine mammography detector, especially at low frequency range. Screen-film systems provide the best resolution. The presampling MTF of the digital detector has a value of 15 % at the Nyquist frequency and, due to the spread size of the laser beam, the use of a smaller pixel size would not permit a significant improvement of the detector resolution.

40|$|Motivation: Haplotype {{inference}} is {{an important}} step for many types of analyses of genetic variation in the human genome. Traditional approaches for obtaining haplotypes involve collecting genotype information from a population of individuals and then applying a haplotype inference algorithm. The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies allows for an alternative strategy to obtain haplotypes by combining sequence fragments. The problem of ‘haplotype assembly’ is the problem of assembling the two haplotypes for a chromosome given the collection of such fragments, or reads, and their locations in the haplotypes, which are pre-determined by mapping the reads to a reference genome. Errors in <b>reads</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>increase</b> the difficulty of the problem and {{it has been shown that}} the problem is NP-hard even for reads of length 2. Existing greedy and stochastic algorithms are not guaranteed to find the optimal solutions for the haplotype assembly problem...|$|R

40|$|Questionnaire {{completion}} is {{a complex}} task that places demands on cognitive functions subserving reading, introspective memory, decision-making, and motor control. Although computerized questionnaires and surveys are used with increasing frequency in clinical practice, {{few studies have examined}} question completion time (QCT), the time required to complete each question. Here, we analyzed QCTs in 172 control subjects and 31 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who completed two computerized questionnaires, the 17 -question Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL) and the 25 -question Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). In control subjects, robust correlations were found between self-paced QCTs on the PCL and CFQ (r = 0. 82). QCTs on individual questions correlated strongly with the number of words in the question, indicating the critical role of <b>reading</b> speed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the impact of rhetorical reading interventions on ELL and dominant English speaking college students' perceptions of reading-writing connections, reading performances as measured by the Accuplacer Reading Test, and writing performances as measured by a holistic rubric. ELL, as defined here, refers to a student who is in the process of acquiring English and has knowledge of a first language other than English. The researcher applied a quasi-experimental comparison and treatment group post test design that included four composition classes. The independent variable was the rhetorical reading intervention. The dependent variables included: student reading- writing connection surveys, the Accuplacer Reading Test, and student generated essays. The rhetorical reading intervention applied focused on constructing awareness of an author?s purpose, context, and effect on audience (reader. Reading performance scores for the comparison group indicated an observed change in the mean score from pre-test to post-test of 0. 17. The observed change in the mean score from pre to post test performance for treatment group participants was 9. 16. Repeated measures ANOVA test yielded a main effect for pre-post reading performance scores across groups, F (1, 70) = 16. 153, p<. 05. Results indicated that comparison group participants displayed minimal change between the pre and post Accuplacer Reading scores; while, treatment group participants <b>reading</b> scores <b>increased</b> <b>significantly.</b> Writing performance scores for the comparison group indicated an observed change from pre-post scores of. 74. An observed change was indicated from pre-post scores of 1. 02 for treatment group subjects. A repeated measures (ANOVA) test within groups yielded a main effect for pre-post writing performance scores across all groups, F(1, 70) = 60. 327, p<. 05. The greater increase for the treatment group suggests that rhetorical reading interventions had an enhanced positive influence on writing performance scores. The analyses reported suggest varying degrees of the effects, on both reading and writing, the integration of reading with specific rhetorical guidelines appeared to maximize not only the connections between reading and writing, but also provide students opportunities to apply critical thinking skills when reading like a writer. The study provides noteworthy insights for educators in the areas of ELL instruction at the college level and provides information that facilitates bridging the achievement gap between dominant English speakers and ELL students...|$|R
