40|$|A Hybrid {{model for}} {{prediction}} of field scintillation on transionospheric paths of propagation was developed as {{the combination of}} the complex phase method (CPM) and <b>random</b> <b>screen</b> technique. In a recent paper [1] by Gherm et al., the model was described in detail. The initially developed propagation model [2] was solely based on the CPM, or the generalized Rytov’s approximation, which is not capable of describing the case of strong scintillation so that, to overcome this restriction, the CPM was combined with the <b>random</b> <b>screen</b> technique. In the contrast with widely employed effective phase screen (e. g. WBMOD, GISM), the <b>random</b> <b>screen</b> introduced in the present method is a physical screen with log-amplitude and phase fluctuations corresponding to a real field on a plane located below the ionosphere. To generate this <b>random</b> <b>screen</b> the relationships for spatial spectra of the phase and log-amplitude correlation functions, as well as their cross-correlation function, are utilized. They are derived in the framework of the CPM. According to the CPM the complex amplitude of the field which has propagated through the ionosphere is represented as follows: () () () tRrEtE o,,,,, ωωω rr =, (1) where E 0 is the undisturbed field, R is the random factor. The random factor R is treated in terms of the complex phase ψeR =, iS+ = χψ. (2) Correlation functions of fluctuations of χ and S and their cross-correlation are calculated in ray-centred variables with the variable s oriented along a curved line of sight (path of propagation) determined by a model of the 3 -D background ionosphere.

40|$|Mathematical {{models can}} help predict the {{effectiveness}} of control measures on the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) by reducing the uncertainty in assessing the impact of inter-vention strategies such as <b>random</b> <b>screening</b> and contact tracing. Even though contact tracing {{is one of the}} most effective methods used for controlling treatable STDs, it is still a controversial strategy for controlling HIV because of cost and confidentiality issues. To help estimate {{the effectiveness of}} these control measures, we formulate two models with <b>random</b> <b>screening</b> and contact tracing based on the differential infectivity (DI) model and the staged-progression (SP) model. We derive formulas for the reproductive numbers and the endemic equilibria and compare the impact that <b>random</b> <b>screening</b> and contact tracing have in slowing the epidemic in the two models. In the DI model the infected population is divided into groups according to their infectiousness, and HIV is largely spread by a small, highly infectious, group of superspreaders. In this model contact tracing is an effective approach to identifying the superspreaders and has a large effect in slowing the epidemic. In the SP model every infected individual goes through a series of infection stages and the virus is primarily spread by individuals in an initial highly infectious stage or in the late stages of the disease. In this model <b>random</b> <b>screening</b> is more effective than for the DI model, and contact tracing is les...|$|R

Here, we present a two-step procedure to establish a <b>random</b> <b>screen</b> for DN alleles, using the essential murine cytomegalovirus gene M 50 as an example. First, loss-of-function mutants from a linker-scanning library were tested for inhibition of virus reconstitution {{with the help of}} FLP-mediated ectopic insertion of the mutants into the viral genome. Second, DN candidates were confirmed by conditional expression of the inhibitory proteins in the virus context. This allowed the quantification of the inhibitory effect, the identification of the morphogenesis block, and the construction of DN mutants with improved activity. Based on these observations a DN mutant of the homologous gene (UL 50) in human cytomegalovirus was predicted and constructed.

A <b>random</b> <b>screen</b> of 20 organic man-made chemicals present in liquid effluents revealed that half appeared able to interact with the estradiol receptor. This was demonstrated by their ability to inhibit binding of 17 beta-estradiol to the fish estrogen receptor. Further studies, using mammalian estrogen screens in vitro, revealed that the two phthalate esters butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) and di-n-butylphthalate (DBP) and a food antioxidant, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) were estrogenic; however, they were all less estrogenic than the environmental estrogen octylphenol. Phthalate esters, used in the production of various plastics (including PVC), are among the most common industrial chemicals. Their ubiquity in the environment and tendency to bioconcentrate in animal fat are well known. Neither BBP nor DBP were able to act as antagonists, indicating that, in the presence of endogenous estrogens, their overall effect would be cumulative. Recently, it has been suggested that environmental estrogens may be etiological agents in several human diseases, including disorders of the male reproductive tract and breast and testicular cancers. The current finding that some phthalate compounds and some food additives are weakly estrogenic in vitro, needs to be supported by further studies on their effects in vivo before any conclusions can be made regarding their possible role in the development of these condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{unexpected}} {{low number}} of genes in the human genome has triggered increasing attention to alternative pre-mRNA splicing, and serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins have been correlated with the complex alternative splicing that is a characteristic of metazoans. SR proteins interact with RNA and splicing protein factors, and they also undergo reversible phosphorylation, thereby regulating constitutive and alternative splicing in mammals and Drosophila. However, {{it is not clear}} whether the features of SR proteins and alternative splicing are present in simple and genetically tractable organisms, such as yeasts. In the present study, we show that the SR-like proteins Srp 1 and Srp 2, found in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, interact with each other and the interaction is modulated by protein phosphorylation. By using Srp 1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid analysis, we specifically isolated Srp 2 from a <b>random</b> <b>screen.</b> This Srp interaction was confirmed by a glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay. We also found that the Srp 1 -Srp 2 complex was phosphorylated at a reduced efficiency by a fission yeast SR-specific kinase, Dis 1 -suppression kinase (Dsk 1). Conversely, Dsk 1 -mediated phosphorylation inhibited the formation of the Srp complex. These findings offer the first example in fission yeast for interactions between SR-related proteins and the modulation of the interactions by specific protein phosphorylation, suggesting that a mammalian-like SR protein function may exist in fission yeast...|$|E

40|$|Factor XI (FXI) is the zymogen of FXIa, which cleaves FIX in the {{intrinsic}} pathway of coagulation. FXI {{is known to}} exist as a dimer and interacts with multiple proteins via its 4 apple domains in the “saucer section” of the enzyme; however, to date, no complex crystal structure has been described. To investigate protein interactions of FXI, a large random peptide library consisting of 106 to 107 peptides was screened for FXI binding, which identified a series of FXI binding motifs containing the signature Asp-Phe-Pro (DFP) tripeptide. Motifs containing this core tripeptide were found in diverse proteins, including the known ligand high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK), {{as well as the}} extracellular matrix proteins laminin and collagen V. To define the binding site on FXI, we determined the crystal structure of FXI in complex with the HK-derived peptide NPISDFPDT. This revealed the location of the DFP peptide bound to the FXI apple 2 domain, and central to the interaction, the DFP phenylalanine side-chain inserts into a major hydrophobic pocket in the apple 2 domain and the isoleucine occupies a flanking minor pocket. Two further structures of FXI in complex with the laminin-derived peptide EFPDFP and a DFP peptide from the <b>random</b> <b>screen</b> demonstrated binding in the same pocket, although in a slightly different conformation, thus revealing some flexibility in the molecular interactions of the FXI apple 2 domain.

40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium {{encounters}} numerous host {{environments and}} defense mechanisms during the infection process. The bacterium responds by tightly regulating {{the expression of}} virulence genes. We identified two regulatory proteins, termed RtsA and RtsB, which are encoded in an operon located on an island integrated at tRNAPheU in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. RtsA belongs to the AraC/XylS family of regulators, and RtsB is a helix-turn-helix DNA binding protein. In a <b>random</b> <b>screen,</b> we identified five RtsA-regulated fusions, all belonging to the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI 1) regulon, which encodes a type III secretion system (TTSS) required for invasion of epithelial cells. We show that RtsA increases expression of the invasion genes by inducing hilA expression. RtsA also induces expression of hilD, hilC, and the invF operon. However, induction of hilA is independent of HilC and HilD and is mediated by direct binding of RtsA to the hilA promoter. The phenotype of an rtsA null mutation {{is similar to the}} phenotype of a hilC mutation, both of which decrease expression of SPI 1 genes approximately twofold. We also show that RtsA can induce expression of a SPI 1 TTSS effector, slrP, independent of any SPI 1 regulatory protein. RtsB represses expression of the flagellar genes by binding to the flhDC promoter region. Repression of the positive activators flhDC decreases expression of the entire flagellar regulon.

Our center has randomly checked blood alcohol levels (BALs) in ALD patients {{on the waiting list}} since 2004. We aimed to identify the incidence and predictors of inactivation on the transplant list due to alcohol use and to determine the utility of BAL-screening in this process. We conducted a retrospective review of patients with ALD listed for liver transplantation with at least 3 months of postlisting follow-up. Alcohol use while on the transplant list was defined as a positive BAL, an admission of alcohol use, or refusal to perform screening within 12 hours of request. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate risk ratios (RRs). Of 134 patients meeting eligibility criteria, 78 % were male, and mean age was 52 years. Alcohol use was documented in 23 patients (17 %). Of these, 12 refused to have a <b>random</b> <b>screen,</b> 8 had detectable serum ethanol levels, and 3 had self-reported alcohol use. On multivariable analysis, a higher number of random BAL-checks [RR 0. 63 (0. 52, 0. 76), P 0. 001] and a longer duration of prelisting abstinence [RR 0. 88 (0. 83, 0. 94), P 0. 001] independently reduced the risk of alcohol use by patients while on the waiting list. None of the patients with 24 months of prelisting abstinence had a positive screen. In conclusion, this study supports random BAL-screening before transplantation and reinforces the importance of abstinence duration as a predictor of relapse. For patients with 24 months of prelisting abstinence, our center will increase the frequency of random BAL screening and increase the rehabilitation requirements to include an intensive 3 -week rehabilitation program. We hope that these measures will reduce the rate of relapse to alcohol use post-transplantation. Liver Transpl 16 : 91 - 97, 2010. © 2009 AASLD...|$|E

We develop a stochastic model of MRSA transmission dynamics exploring the effects of two screening strategies in an epidemic setting: random and on admission.

The characterization is crucial for proper interpretation of past (Voyager) and future (Cassini) ring, occultation observations in terms of physical ring properties, and is needed to address outstanding puzzles in the interpretation of the Voyager radio occultation data sets; (2) to continue the development of spectral analysis techniques to identify and characterize the power scattered by all features of Saturn's rings that can be resolved in the Voyager radio occultation observations, and to use the results to constrain the maximum particle size and its abundance.

STUDY DESIGN Historical data on the HCV-infected population in Switzerland were obtained from published literature, unpublished data and government reports. A disease progression model was used to age the infected population to 2015. The HCV distribution was then used to identify 5 -year age cohorts with the highest HCV prevalence. The estimated number of cases needed to screen within an age cohort was calculated using the estimated viraemic prevalence, removing the percent previously diagnosed.
