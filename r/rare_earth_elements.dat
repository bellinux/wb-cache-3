The application of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> La in electroless plating was explored. The results showed that an appropriate amount of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> La could improve the stability of the chemical plating solution and reduce the temperature of electroless plating by 6 ℃ ~ 20 ℃. The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> La not only could make the morphology of alloy coatings compacted, smooth and uniform, but also could greatly improve the contents of Fe, Ni and could tremendously reduce the content of P in the alloy coatings of glass fiber. The conductivity and magnetic properties of the alloy coatings could be increased by <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> La. In the preparation of the Ni-Fe-La-P electroless alloys of glass fiber, the optimal content of La 2 O 3 was 1. 2 g·L- 1. <b>Rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> La could promote the transition of alloy coatings from amorphous state to rystal state, improve the electromagnetic performances of alloy coatings and enhance the electromagnetic wave absorbing properties of alloy coatings...|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the gaps led to an extensive search for the missing elements. In 1914, several people claimed the discovery after Henry Moseley predicted {{the gap in the}} periodic table for the then-undiscovered element 72. Georges Urbain asserted that he found element 72 in the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> in 1907 and published his results on celtium in 1911. Neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior he claimed matched with the element found later, and therefore his claim was turned down after a long-standing controversy. The controversy was partly because the chemists favored the chemical techniques which led to the {{discovery of}} celtium, while the physicists relied {{on the use of the}} new X-ray spectroscopy method that proved that the substances discovered by Urbain did not contain element 72. By early 1923, several physicists and chemists such as Niels Bohr and Charles R. Bury suggested that element 72 should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> group. These suggestions were based on Bohr's theories of the atom, the X-ray spectroscopy of Moseley, and the chemical arguments of Friedrich Paneth.|$|E

5|$|Joe Mayer {{was fired}} in 1937.

There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary.

40|$|The Mt Vulture {{carbonatite}}s are {{the only}} carbonatite occurrence in the southern Apennines. We present new trace element data for these rocks in order to evaluate the factors influencing <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> (REE) and other trace element fractionations and their REE grade. This study focuses on massive hyalo-alvikites from two lava flows and one dike, which have different relative abundances of silicate and carbonate (i. e. Si/Ca). These differences are also evident from CaO/(CaO + MgO + FeO(T) + MnO) and Sr/Ba ratios. The REE grade of the Mt Vulture carbonatites {{is very similar to}} that of the global average for calcio-carbonatites. R-mode factor analysis shows that most of the trace element variance reflects the relative roles of carbonate and silicate minerals in influencing trace element distributions. Silicates largely control heavy <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> (HREE), transition metal, Zr, and Th abundances, whereas carbonate minerals control light <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> (LREE), Ba, and Pb abundances. In addition, apatite influences LREE concentrations. Increasing silica contents are accompanied by decreases in (La/Yb) N and (La/Sm) N ratios and less marked LREE enrichment. In contrast, higher carbonate contents are associated with increases in (La/Yb) N and (La/Sm) N. The Si/Ca ratio has little influence on Eu anomalies and middle <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> (MREE) to HREE fractionations.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} had two main aims. The first aim was to study {{the use of a}} number of {{precipitation}} methods to control the size and morphology of precursor phosphor materials for potential applications in a new generation of high definition and field emission displays. The morphological and luminescent characteristics of these precursor phosphor materials were studied after they were annealed to form their respective luminescent oxides using electron microscopy and light measuring techniques. The first set of experiments presented describes the development of a range of spherical submicron europium-doped yttrium oxide phosphor particles and their optimisation for use in the aforementioned applications. A homogeneous precipitation technique exploiting a hydrothermal decomposition of urea that provides hydroxycarbonate phosphor precursor ligands is at the centre of this work. In the presence of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> nitrates the hydroxycarbonate ligands form spherical phosphor precursor particles that after annealing yield the luminescent oxides. This is followed by the presentation of a novel synthetic method using a micellar phase of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> chlorides, after annealing, yielding europium-doped yttrium oxide. This method produces a variety of morphologies with crystallites as small as a few nanometres and up to hundreds of nanometres. Next is described a new precipitation method using ammonia and carbon dioxide gases that are introduced in a controlled manner into a solution of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> chlorides at room temperature. <b>Rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> hydroxycarbonates rapidly precipitate upon supersaturation, yielding a range of morphologies and particles sizes.
