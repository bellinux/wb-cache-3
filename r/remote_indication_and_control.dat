40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{pressure}} transmitter using a modified op-amp based network for inductance measurement using a bellow as sensor {{has been proposed}} to measure the pressure and to convert pressure changes in to an electrical current which can be transmitted to a remote indicator. The change in inductance due to change in pressure is measured by an improved modified operational amplifier based network. The proposed network permits offset inductance compensation of sensing coil and also minimizes the stray capacitance between sensing coil and ground using dummy inductor whose value equal to zero level inductance of sensing coil and op-amps with high input impedance. In {{the first part of}} experiment, a modified op-amp based inductance measuring circuit has been simulated using LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) and studied with test inductance, and in the second part, the experimentation was done by replacing the test inductance with a sensing coil fitted to bellow by means of ferromagnetic wire for the measurement of pressure. It has been observed that the variation in gauge pressure from 0 to 70 psi having linear relationship with output ac voltage in the range of 0 to 85. 0 mV. Corresponding to pressure variations, the ac output voltage further converted into an electric current of 4 to 20 mA for <b>remote</b> <b>indication</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> purpose. The investigations have been performed to sense air pressure of pressure tank fitted with pump piston. The experimental results are found to have good linearity of about ± 0. 1 % and resolution.

The speed of measurement renders uch methods especially relevant for fast, in situ analyses of the size and size distribution of colloids in practical, industrial situations where these properties may be undergoing continuous change. The principles of the measurement of electrically induced birefringence using pulsed fields is outlined and used to study vermiculite suspensions as they undergo size reduction in an ultrasonic field.

The use of the method for on-line monitoring of dilute mineral suspensions for the <b>indication</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of aggregated, issolving or growing media is discussed.

40|$|Improving {{reliability}} {{in power}} system {{is very important}} to the utilities {{as well as to the}} country as it is an important attribute of the supply quality and increases the end user satisfaction. The aim of this study is to investigate the fault identification and isolation techniques to improve reliability. This study focuses on the following; 1. Reliability status of 33 kV network of C. E. B. 2. Type of faults in 33 kV network and outage reduction methods. 3. Develop a mathematical model for reliability evaluation. 4. Analyze protection scheme of C. E. B 33 kV network. 5. Design new protection scheme to reduce outages. The analyzed reliability indices of C. E. B are far below compared to internationally Accepted levels. In this study reliability status of 33 kV network is analyzed using event log data of reclosers and breakdown reports of Consumer Service Centers. The author is working atRegion- 04, C. E. B and two switching gantries of Region- 04 are selected to analyze events one in wet zone and other in coastal zone. It can be seen that outage time and fault frequency are high during both monsoon periods, 86 % of faults are tine to earth, 67 % of faults are of transient nature and the repair time in case of overcurrent fault is high due to poor workmanship in line connections. With this study predominant causes of faults in the network can be identified by using event log of recloser. The several methods for outage reduction are identified, installation of fault indicators for <b>remote</b> <b>indication</b> <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> operation of reclosers, using line sectionalize devices. The protection scheme of 33 kV network is analyzed to find techniques to reduce outages. The downstream protective devices (fuse on Spurs) beyond the recloser do not distinguish permanent and transient faults. It can be seen nuisance fuse blowing in spurs as well as nuisance recloser lockout affecting all customers in feeder. A new protection scheme is designed to overcome the above problems.

40|$|Context: Fructosamine is a glycemic {{biomarker}} {{which may}} be useful for <b>indication</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of diabetes respectively. Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate fructosamine as an indicator of hyperglycaemia <b>and</b> glucose <b>control</b> in subjects with diabetes. Design, Setting & Patients: From the AMORIS cohort, subjects with serum glucose, fructosamine and HbA 1 c from the same examination were studied cross-sectionally and longitudinally (n =  10, 987; 5, 590 overnight-fasting). The guidelines of the American Diabetes Association were followed for classification of prediabetes and diabetes. Separate analyses were performed in patients with a newly detected or a known diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes respectively. Results: All three biomarkers were strongly correlated. With regard to the association between fructosamine and HbA 1 c Pearson linear correlation coefficients in the range of 0. 67 – 0. 75 were observed in fasting and non-fasting subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Analyses of glucose control in fasting patients with type 2 diabetes having all three biomarkers measured at three separate occasions within on average 290 days of the index examination showed similar trends over time for glucose, fructosamine and HbA 1 c. Discrimination of subjects with and without diabetes across the range of fructosamine levels was good (area under curve (AUC) 0. 91 – 0. 95) and a fructosamine level of 2. 5 mmol/L classified subjects to diabetes with a sensitivity of 61 % and a specificity of 97 %. Conclusions: Fructosamine is closely associated with HbA 1 c and glucose respectively and may be a useful biomarker of hyperglycaemia <b>and</b> glucose <b>control</b> in clinical <b>and</b> epidemiological studies. © 2014 Malmström et al.

30|$|The {{definitive}} view of ESR regarding teleradiology {{is that a}} radiological act {{must always}} {{be defined as a}} medical act, even if it is performed remotely using information and communication technology tools [19].

In Germany, teleradiology faces legal restrictions. In the case of primary reading, special governmental permission is needed, which is valid for a maximum of 3  years. In general, permission should be restricted to night-time and weekends; only in special cases of insufficient local resources could teleradiology also be allowed in the daytime.

30|$|However, the {{collected}} KPI values are forwarded to controller components, that are located at CSs. The responsibility of theses controllers is {{to indicate the}} present status of the low voltage grid and to choose appropriate actions in order to mitigate stress on the power grid arising from emerging power quality issues. As depicted in Fig.  1, power quality estimation is performed by a component called PQ-Indicator (In this paper, we use PQ as an abbreviation of the Power Quality), which responds to triggered events from Kafka. For example in case of voltage fluctuations, which refer to degradation of the power quality, it gradually estimates the power quality and asks the so-called Smart Charger (SC) to decreases/increases the charging rate in order to counteract the voltage fluctuation and, hence, improve the power quality. This power quality indication, called ’PQ-Indic’, is defined {{within the range of}} [− 1, 1]. Within this normalized range, (- 1) corresponds to either a complete shutdown of the charging process or a reduction to the minimum required power {{in order to be able}} to control the EV later. In contrast, the value (+ 1) represents the maximum power capacity of the CS. The Smart Charger applies a smooth or drastic change on the used charging power capacity depending on value the PQ-Indic. The reason behind separating power quality <b>indication</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> logic is due to different interests of the involved parties. From the Charging Service Provider (CSP) perspective, the PQ-Indicator is a black box, which is configured by the DSO depending on the characteristics of each low voltage grid individually, e.g. applying different thresholds for voltage boundaries. In contrast, the CSP configures the Smart Charger according to its business model.|$|R
