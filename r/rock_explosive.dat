40|$|Modern mining {{industries}} focus on system efficiency {{much more than}} before. Simulation programs for ventilation networks and thermal environments are gaining momentum. However, {{it is difficult to}} achieve correct results for thermal environments through simulation programs. One of the reasons for this is the inaccurate estimation of heat from blind headings. In blind headings, the heat transferred from fragmented <b>rock,</b> <b>explosives</b> and diesel equipment to the air could make the thermal environments much more complex. In order to verify the heat load, in situ measurements were carried out in Hishikari Mine. According to the air temperature variation with time, a new method for determining the heat load from fragmented <b>rock</b> and <b>explosives</b> is introduced in this paper. The heat from diesel equipment is also discussed. The theoretical calculation results showed good correlation with in situ measurements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFor {{more than}} sixty years, {{cylindrical}} steel cannons (long mortar and short mortar) {{have been used in}} France to assess the safety of explosives with regard to firedamp. These testing methods are considered expensive mainly because a large number of shots are needed äs a result of the low level of reproducibility. Also, using them with certain explosives, such äs slurries and emulsions, is somewhat problematical. Taking into aecount the Polish expertise, CERCHAR (now INERIS) developed m the sixties a testing method in which the Charge, placed in a steel groove mortar, is isolated from the methane-air mixture by an asbestos-cement plate. This method seems more attractive than those traditionally used, {{especially when it comes to}} distinguishing <b>rock</b> <b>explosives</b> from the more powerfui pennitted explosives...|$|R
50|$|The railway route Bangkok-Chiang Mai {{had been}} {{designed}} to avoid the Khun Tan Mountains, a barrier between Lampang and Lamphun. The tunnel was built ease trade barriers between the northern and central provinces. Surveys for the tunnel route were started in 1905. Construction began in 1907. First, base pins were set up at a level behind the mountain aligned with the tunnel route so that the tunnel could be blasted to the width needed. Then air compressors were used to drill through the mountain. If these air compressors broke down, then metal chisels were hammered into the <b>rock,</b> <b>explosives</b> inserted and then the rock was blasted {{to make way for}} track-laying. The tunnel was finished in 1918 and remains in daily use.|$|R

25|$|On 28 January, further {{demonstrations and}} clashes {{took place in}} eleven cities, {{including}} those in the Suez Canal, Alexandria, Monufia and Cairo. The clashes resulted in six deaths. Thousands of people gathered in the Tahrir Square to show their solidarity with those killed over the weekend early in the day. Police fired tear gas at protesters near the Qasr al-Nil Bridge, while further violence spread along the Nile. Protesters also set fire to security vehicles and detained a police officer. The Shura Council approved the President state of emergency decision as per the Constitution requirement. And to aid the police, it approved a law granting judicial seizure powers to the Army. A funeral procession Port Said devolved into a street battle between mourners and police, with security troops firing tear gas and live ammunition at crowds from police buildings across the city; protesters threw <b>rocks,</b> <b>explosives</b> and gas canisters back at police, {{and by the end}} of the day civilians across the city were seen carrying guns. A Ministry of the Interior spokesman, however, denied that police had fired on protesters, and said that tear gas had been used only briefly.

50|$|Development mining is {{composed}} of excavation almost entirely in (non-valuable) waste rock {{in order to gain}} access to the orebody.

To start the mining first step is to make the path to go down. The path is defined as 'Decline' as describe above. Before the start of Decline all preplanning of Power facility, drilling arrangement, dewatering, ventilation and, muck withdrawal facilities are required.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBlasting is a majormechanism of <b>rock</b> fragmentation. <b>Explosive</b> usage creates ground vibration, {{air over}} {{pressure}} {{as well as}} fly rock. Blast design is a process which needs to be monitored continuously as the rock mass exhibit many vibrations within the same boundary. Often the quantum of explosive had to be determined within safe vibration limit. Artificial Neural Network approach is also gaining wide recognition for its accuracy to match with the measured values. This paper evaluates the governing relations between PPV at varying explosive quantities and distances using established approaches {{as well as the}} results by application of artificial neural network. A total of nine blast events have been analyzed. Indian Standard and ANN approaches exhibit better correlation with the measured values of PPV as compared to that by other approaches...|$|R
40|$|Most blast {{fragmentation}} models {{assume the}} <b>rock</b> mass properties, <b>explosive</b> properties and blast design variables to be constants and uniformly distributed within a blast. However, in reality all these input variables vary within a blast resulting in {{variation in the}} resulting fragmentation size distribution. A stochastic modelling approach is introduced in this paper to quantify this variation. This technique takes the input variables as statistical distributions rather than constants and through several thousand iterations, generates a statistical representation of the expected fragmentation resulting from a production blast. A case study of three production blasts from a large open pit mine are presented and the modelled fragmentation 2 ̆ 7 envelope 2 ̆ 7 shows good agreement with the fragmentation 2 ̆ 7 envelope 2 ̆ 7 estimated from Split image analysis. The various blast-related parameters influence {{different parts of the}} fragmentation distribution, e. g., <b>rock</b> strength and <b>explosive</b> velocity of detonation have most impact on the fines. The technique is used to identify the parameters that have the greatest influence on various size fractions. Such an analysis will be useful to direct resources to efficiently minimise the variation...|$|R

The soil samples were collected both near and away from the quarry and crushing sites. The collected samples were analyzed for various physico-chemical parameters viz temperature, pH, EC, organic carbon, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, manganese, iron and boron using standard methods. The results revealed the deterioration of soil quality near the quarrying and crushing sites and this can be attributed due to the accumulation of dust. The soil properties are less affected away from the quarry sites...|$|R
