25|$|The major {{advantage}} of teleradiology {{is the ability}} to use different time zones to provide real-time emergency radiology services around-the-clock. The disadvantages include higher costs, limited contact between the <b>referrer</b> and the reporting Clinician, and the inability to cover for procedures requiring an onsite reporting Clinician. Laws and regulations concerning the use of teleradiology vary among the states, with some requiring a license to practice medicine in the state sending the radiologic exam. In the U.S., some states require the teleradiology report to be preliminary with the official report issued by a hospital staff Radiologist.|$|E
25|$|Another cross-site {{vulnerability}} is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser {{into taking}} actions the user didn't intend at a target site (like transferring {{money at a}} bank). It works because, if the target site relies only on cookies to authenticate requests, then requests initiated by code on the attacker's site will carry the same legitimate login credentials as requests initiated by the user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and {{not only in the}} cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP <b>Referrer</b> header can also help.|$|E

25|$|The BBC {{introduced}} specially crafted web bugs, <b>referrer</b> {{checks and}} download chunk limits, such that only devices exhibiting this behaviour, i.e. a genuine iPhone handset, {{would be able}} to stream the video content. A cycle of updates and reverse engineering has followed such that all the various streams, both for the iPhone and flash streaming service, are now able to be downloaded without the need for decryption or DRM circumvention. This has been made possible by various software which can effectively simulate a RTMP flash client or an iPhone. As of early December 2010 the iPhone mp3 access has been changed to use https. The server checks the client's certificate and only accepts connections for those issued to Apple. This change to the protocol not only prevents access to non Apple devices but also disables use by a number of early generation iPod Touch devices.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes a <b>referrer</b> {{system is}} implemented. A <b>referrer</b> {{is someone who}} {{introduced}} or otherwise [...] "helped someone" [...] with the decision to join the site (likewise, how a HTTP <b>referrer</b> is the site who linked one to another site). Usually, referrers are other forum members and members are usually rewarded for referrals. The <b>referrer</b> system is also sometimes implemented so that, if a visitor visits the forum though a link such as referrerid=300, the user with the id number (in this example, 300) would receive referral credit if the visitor registers. The purpose is commonly just to give credit (sometimes rewards are implied) to those who help the community grow.|$|E

The Buddy Program, on the other hand, is a means for full-subscription players to distribute 21-day free trial accounts to their friends. If the buddy account is converted to a full account within 2 weeks of receiving the Buddy Program invite, the <b>referrer</b> is rewarded with 30 free days added to their subscription.|$|E

50|$|<b>Referrer</b> spam {{takes place}} when a spam {{perpetrator}} or facilitator accesses a web page (the referee), by following a link from another web page (the <b>referrer),</b> {{so that the}} referee is given {{the address of the}} <b>referrer</b> by the person's Internet browser. Some websites have a <b>referrer</b> log which shows which pages link to that site. By having a robot randomly access many sites enough times, with a message or specific address given as the <b>referrer,</b> that message or Internet address then appears in the <b>referrer</b> log of those sites that have <b>referrer</b> logs. Since some Web search engines base the importance of sites on the number of different sites linking to them, referrer-log spam may increase the search engine rankings of the spammer's sites. Also, site administrators who notice the <b>referrer</b> log entries in their logs may follow the link back to the spammer's <b>referrer</b> page.|$|E
50|$|Many blogs publish <b>referrer</b> {{information}} {{in order to}} link back {{to people who are}} linking to them, and hence broaden the conversation. This has led, in turn, to the rise of <b>referrer</b> spam: the sending of fake <b>referrer</b> {{information in}} order to popularize the spammer's website.|$|E
50|$|Content Security Policy {{standard}} version 1.1 {{introduced a new}} <b>referrer</b> directive that allows {{more control over the}} browser's behavior in regards to the <b>referrer</b> header.

50|$|More generally, a <b>referrer</b> is the URL of a {{previous}} item which led to this request. The <b>referrer</b> for an image, for example, is generally the HTML page on which {{it is to be}} displayed. The <b>referrer</b> field is an optional part of the HTTP request sent by the web browser to the web server.|$|E
50|$|Most {{web servers}} {{maintain}} logs of all traffic, {{and record the}} HTTP <b>referrer</b> sent by the web browser for each request. This raises a number of privacy concerns, and as a result, a number of systems to prevent web servers being sent the real referring URL have been developed. These systems work either by blanking the <b>referrer</b> field or by replacing it with inaccurate data. Generally, Internet-security suites blank the <b>referrer</b> data, while web-based servers {{replace it with a}} false URL, usually their own. This raises the problem of <b>referrer</b> spam. The technical details of both methods are fairly consistent - software applications act as a proxy server and manipulate the HTTP request, while web-based methods load websites within frames, causing the web browser to send a <b>referrer</b> URL of their website address. Some web browsers give their users the option to turn off <b>referrer</b> fields in the request header.|$|E

50|$|Many {{websites}} log referrers as part {{of their}} attempt to track their users. Most web log analysis software can process this information. Because <b>referrer</b> information can violate privacy, some web browsers allow the user to disable the sending of <b>referrer</b> information. Some proxy and firewall software will also filter out <b>referrer</b> information, to avoid leaking the location of non-public websites. This can, in turn, cause problems: some web servers block parts of their website to web browsers that do not send the right <b>referrer</b> information, in an attempt to prevent deep linking or unauthorised use of images (bandwidth theft). Some proxy software has the ability to give the top-level address of the target website as the <b>referrer,</b> which usually prevents these problems while still not divulging the user's last-visited website.|$|E

50|$|If the referred-to site {{does not}} {{validate}} the referring site URL, {{it may be}} subject to <b>referrer</b> spam (due to forged <b>referrer</b> headers) and may end up with links to dynamic web content and private web sites, such as web-based e-mail.
