40|$|A time-course {{analysis}} of sulfate reduction in Sapelo Island <b>marsh</b> <b>soils</b> using 3 sS 042 - in-dicated that acid-volatile H, 35 S formation was a linear function {{of time for}} the 0 - 12 -cm depth interval of both tall and short Spartina alternijlora soils. Aqua regia-soluble 3 ”S was present in significant amounts at all depths in both sites in killed controls and did not increase significantly during a 72 -h incubation. The activity of 35 S in aqua regia digests of <b>marsh</b> <b>soils</b> was dependent {{on the type of}} acid used to distill H 235 S before aqua regia digestion; the greatest activity was with 6 N HCl and the least was with 1 N H 3 P 04. No consistent formation of [5 sFe]pyrite was observed during a 72 -h incubation of 5 ”Fe in short S. alterniflora soils. These data indicate that the incorporation of 35 S into aqua regia-soluble compounds was at least in part an artifact of the distillation procedure and that the use of aqua regia-soluble 35 S to calculate sulfate reduction rates could result in a significant overestimation of this process.

40|$|Humic {{substances}} (HS) {{from salt}} <b>marsh</b> <b>soils</b> were characterized and {{the relationships among}} HS composition and some geochemical factors were analysed. For this, three salt marshes with the same vegetation cover (Juncus maritimus), but with different geochemical characteristics, were selected. The qualitative characterization of the soil humic acids and fulvic acids {{was carried out by}} elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and VACP/MAS (13) C NMR spectroscopy. HS from salt <b>marsh</b> <b>soils</b> under sea rush (Juncus maritimus) displayed some shared characteristics such as low degree of humification, low aromatic content and high proportion of labile compounds, mainly polysaccharides and proteins. However, although the three salt <b>marsh</b> <b>soils</b> under study were covered by the same type of vegetation, the HS showed some important differences. HS composition was found to be determined not only {{by the nature of the}} original organic material, but also by environmental factors such as soil texture, redox conditions and tidal influence. In general. an increase in the humification process appeared to be related to aerobic conditions and predominance of sand in the mineral fraction of the soil, while the preservation of labile organic compounds may be associated with low redox potential values and fine soil texture.

40|$|International audienceFreshwater <b>reclaimed</b> <b>marshes</b> {{along the}} European Atlantic coast are highly {{suitable}} for European eels (Anguilla anguilla). However, European eel stocks have declined, and the coastal marshes {{have been subjected}} to major disturbances. The objective of our study was to analyze the processes governing patterns of European eel microhabitat distribution of four eel size classes (from, 160 mm to. 360 mm) in a <b>reclaimed</b> <b>marsh</b> (France). Analyses were conducted using artificial neural network (ANN) techniques and ecological profiles. Our ANN results showed that eel densities were significantly related to three major influencing variables: the width of ditch section, the silt depth, and the density of emergent plants. Such ecological profiles were significantly different between small (, 240 mm) and large eels (. 360 mm) : small eels were more widespread than large eels. Large eels were absent or at low densities in shallow ditches with a high aquatic plant cover obstructing the water column and a large quantity of silt. These characteristics seem to define the ditches not directly connected with the main river where dredging operations were rare. Management of regular dredging operations in the channels by maintaining a mosaic of permanent aquatic habitats and avoiding the heavy silt loads in most ditches should be promoted. This dredging operation {{was probably one of the}} most promising ways for restoring inland eel stocks...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} marsh {{hydraulics}} {{have focused on}} tide-induced pore water circulation as the main drive for solute transport in the <b>marsh</b> <b>soil</b> and exchange with coastal water. Our study revealed another important mechanism provided by unstable fingering flow, which largely modified solute transport paths. In the marsh interior, downward penetration of salt fingers forced ambient pore water and solute plumes to move upward and exit the <b>marsh</b> <b>soil</b> through <b>marsh</b> platform at relatively high concentrations, up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than exit solute concentrations at the tidal creek bed. The mixing of solute with ambient pore water in the marsh interior was intensified greatly by fingering flow.

The new transport mechanism has implications for understanding the fate of solutes in particularly salt marshes of low creek densities...|$|R

However, few researches {{have focused on the}} effects of global climate change on carbon mineralization in Zoig alpine wetland, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, {{which is one of the}} most important peatlands in China. Through incubation experiment, this paper studied the effects of temperature, soil moisture, <b>soil</b> type (<b>marsh</b> <b>soil</b> and peat soil) and their interactions on CO(2) and CH(4) emission rates in Zoig alpine wetland. Results show that when the temperature rises from 5 A degrees C to 35 A degrees C, CO(2) emission rates increase by 3. 3 - 3. 7 times and 2. 4 - 2. 6 times under non-inundation treatment, and by 2. 2 - 2. 3 times and 4. 1 - 4. 3 times under inundation treatment in <b>marsh</b> <b>soil</b> and peat soil, respectively. Compared with non-inundation treatment, CO(2) emission rates decrease by 6 %- 44 %, 20 %- 60 % in <b>marsh</b> <b>soil</b> and peat soil, respectively, under inundation treatment. CO(2) emission rate is significantly affected by the combined effects of the temperature and soil type (p < 0. 001), and soil moisture and soil type (p < 0. 001), and CH(4) emission rate was significantly affected by the interaction of the temperature and soil moisture (p < 0. 001).
