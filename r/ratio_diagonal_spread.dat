40|$|Documenting {{spread and}} {{combination}} trading {{in a major}} options market for the first time, we find that spreads and combinations collectively account for over 55 % of large trades (trades of 100 contracts or more) in the Eurodollar options market and almost 75 % of the trading volume due to large trades. In terms of total volume, the four most heavily traded combinations are (in order) : straddles, ratio spreads, vertical spreads, and strangles. These four represent about two thirds of all combination trades. On the other hand, condors, horizontal spreads, guts, iron flys, box spreads, guts, covered calls or puts, and synthetics are very rarely traded while trading is light in collars, <b>diagonal</b> <b>spreads,</b> butterflies, straddle spreads, seagulls, doubles, and delta-neutral combinations. Significant differences in size, cost, and time-to-expirations are found among the various combination types. Our results confirm that traders use spreads and combinations to construct portfolios which are highly sensitive to some risk factors and much less sensitive to other risk factors. The most popular combination designs are those yielding portfolios which are quite sensitive to volatility and less sensitive to directional changes in the underlying asset value- thoug...|$|R

The frame rate or refresh rate of a typical NTSC format CRT TV is 29.97 Hz, and for the PAL format, 25 Hz, both are scanned with two fields per frame in an interlaced fashion. A typical NTSC broadcast signal's visible portion has an equivalent resolution of 449 x 483 rectangular pixels. It actually could be slightly higher than that, but the vertical blanking interval (VBI), allows time for magnetic beam scanning retrace in affordable CRT-equipped television receivers. Maximum spectrum use is made by allowing other signals to be carried within the VBI period along with the broadcast.|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{separated}} BI-RL is {{to combine}} separately deblurred sub-image blocks into the resulting output image without block artifacts. Obviously, {{this is not}} a new approach. What is new in the proposed separated BI-RL is that the proposed method can suppress block artifacts efficiently for arbitrarily shaped blocks. This flexibility is important for the success of separated BI-RL; simulation results of this paper will show that diagonally shaped blocks produce better results than rectangularly shaped blocks for separated BI-RL in the deblurring problem modeled by a <b>diagonal</b> point <b>spread</b> function (PSF).|$|R

40|$|Complex {{regional}} pain syndrome (CRPS) generally remains {{restricted to}} one limb but occasionally may {{spread to other}} limbs. Knowledge of the spreading pattern of CRPS may lead to hypotheses about underlying mechanisms but to date {{little is known about}} this process. The objective is to study patterns of spread of CRPS from a first to a second limb and the factors associated with this process. One hundred and eighty-five CRPS patients were retrospectively evaluated. Cox’s proportional hazards model was used to evaluate factors that influenced spread of CRPS symptoms. Eighty-nine patients exhibited CRPS in multiple limbs. In 72 patients spread from a first to a second limb occurred showing a contralateral pattern in 49 %, ipsilateral pattern in 30 % and diagonal pattern in 14 %. A trauma preceded the onset in the second limb in 37, 44 and 91 %, respectively. The hazard of spread of CRPS increased with the number of limbs affected. Compared to patients with CRPS in one limb, patients with CRPS in multiple limbs were on average 7  years younger and more often had movement disorders. In patients with CRPS in multiple limbs, spontaneous spread of symptoms generally follows a contralateral or ipsilateral pattern whereas <b>diagonal</b> <b>spread</b> is rare and generally preceded by a new trauma. Spread is associated with a younger age at onset and a more severely affected phenotype. We argue that processes in the spinal cord as well as supraspinal changes are responsible for spontaneous spread in CRPS...|$|R
40|$|Diagrids are {{becoming}} an increasingly popular structural system in high rise design and construction. Little {{research has been}} performed on the seismic performance of Diagrids and how it integrates with seismic loss estimation. A motion based design scheme can facilitate the seismic design of Diagrids with {{the ultimate goal of}} reducing upfront costs and repair costs. In this thesis we analyze Diagrids with varying locations, aspect <b>ratios,</b> <b>diagonal</b> angles, and motion design parameters to understand the relationship between the geometric design parameters of a Diagrid and the design costs and estimated losses. We use a static seismic design procedure and analyze various period estimation techniques to evaluate their validity when used with Diagrids. We develop a simple loss estimation scheme focused on interstory drift and content replacement. We then analyze which Diagrids are most cost effective for a given set of design parameters, and briefly discuss additional methods of reducing seismic damage to buildings. Our analysis uses Matlab and Microsoft Excel for the development of our analytical models and for the manipulation and organization of data.

40|$|Coupling beams {{are a key}} {{structural}} element for resisting seismic loading because of their energy dissipating capabilities and high ductilities. In coupling beams with short span-to-depth <b>ratios,</b> <b>diagonal</b> reinforcement is used to provide the amount of ductility required. Because of {{the large amount of}} steel congestion within traditionally reinforced diagonally reinforced coupling beams, however, alternative reinforcement layouts are desired to simplify their construction. Two specimens were constructed and tested under reversed cyclic loading. The results were then compared to previous experimental results to evaluate the viability of these construction techniques. One specimen contained No. 20 diagonal bars placed in a symmetrical arrangement and confined with closely spaced headed reinforcing bars in place of hoops. The second specimen used diagonal reinforcement constructed using structural steel elements that were anchored in the shear wall elements with shear studs. For comparison, the structural steel elements used {{in the design of the}} second specimen were chosen to match the yield force of the diagonal reinforcement of the first specimen. The hysteretic responses of the two specimens showed that the specimen containing the structural steel diagonal reinforcement had a higher ductility and was able to dissipate more energy than those using headed reinforcing bars or traditional hoops. This indicates that the use of structural steel is a viable alternative for the diagonal reinforcement of coupling beams. In addition, these results also demonstrated that the use of headed reinforcing bars as confinement for diagonal reinforcement is similar to, and therefore a feasible replacement for, diagonal reinforcement confined with closely spaced hoops...|$|R
