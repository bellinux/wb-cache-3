40|$|Analyses of risk-bearing often {{assume that}} agents face only one risk when {{deciding}} how much risk to bear. Agents however usually face several risks {{at the same}} time and the interaction between risks can affect the willingness to bear any particular one of them. We consider how the introduction of uninsurable background risk affects the comparative statics predictions of distribution changes in the standard two-asset portfolio model. We show that such predictions are fairly robust, no matter what the correlation between the background risk and the risky asset's return distribution. We consider changes in the conditional distributions of the risky asset's <b>return</b> (<b>holding</b> the marginal distribution of the background risk fixed); and changes in the marginal distribution of the asset's <b>return</b> (<b>holding</b> the conditional distributions of the background risk fixed). For the first question, a version of Gollier's (1995) Central Riskiness order is sufficient and necessary to increase risk-bearing. For the second question, Monotone Likelihood Ratio improvements are sufficient and necessary. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to empirically {{investigate}} holding periods, illiquidity and disposition {{effect in}} Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE). KSE 100 Index Companies daily {{data were collected}} {{for a period of}} five year i. e. 2003 - 2007.

Holding periods were found positively related to illiquidity and negatively associated with stock <b>returns.</b> Further, <b>holding</b> periods were long for illiquid stocks and short for less illiquid stocks.

The enhancement from holding options can be substantial if the implied volatilities of the options are higher than the volatilities of the benchmark returns. alpha; hedge funds; mutual funds; options; portfolio management...|$|R
