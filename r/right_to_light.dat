500|$|The {{claimant}} {{must first}} {{show that the}} defendant's actions have caused an interference with their use or enjoyment of the land. These interferences are indirect, and almost always the result of continuing events rather than a one-off incident. This interference may be a physical invasion of the land, such as in Davey v Harrow Corporation, noise, as in Christie v Davey, or smells, such as in Wheeler v J J Saunders. The courts have allowed cases where the interference causes emotional distress, as in Thompson-Schwab v Costaki, but have been loath to protect recreational facilities or [...] "things of delight"; things such as the blocking of a pleasant view or a television signal are not considered a nuisance. The latter was discussed in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, where the claimants argued that the blocking of their television signal by {{the construction of the}} skyscraper at One Canada Square was a nuisance. The House of Lords rejected this argument. There are rights to land known as servitudes, such as the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> through windows or the right of support. An occupier can also be liable for an interference that is naturally arising, assuming they are aware of the interference's existence and fail to take reasonable precautions, as in Leakey v National Trust, which established that in such situations [...] "the standard ought to be to require of the occupier what is reasonable to expect of him in his individual circumstances". This principle was extended in Holbeck Hall Hotel v Scarborough Borough Council, where the Court of Appeal said that if a landowner knows or ought to know that their property may cease to support another's, they are required to take reasonable precautions or they will be liable.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Aims {{to examine}} {{judicial}} attitudes to current surveying practice in <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> disputes. Tests {{the assumption that}} the use of the Waldram methodology is endorsed by the courts and seeks to establish whether, despite its acknowledged limitations, its continued use can be justified on this basis. Design/methodology/approach – Analyses reported judgments. Findings – Neither the 50 - 50 rule, nor any other aspect of the Waldram methodology, has the status of a rule of law, or is otherwise approved of by the courts. On the contrary, the methodology {{has been the subject of}} judicial criticism. Although the courts frequently rely on the expert evidence presented to them, they have consistently expressed disquiet over aspects of the methodology. Particular concerns have been expressed over its inability to cater for the effects of sunlight and externally reflected light, on its dependence on internal room design, and on its failure to distinguish task illumination from general room lighting. There is also no indication that the judiciary are aware of the extent to which the Waldram threshold of adequate illuminance falls short of that prescribed by contemporary standards. The paper concludes that the courts' attitudes to the Waldram methodology cannot therefore justify its continued use by surveyors, either when acting in the capacity of expert witness, or when advising clients who may be contemplating litigation in a <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> dispute. Research limitations/implications – Makes a further contribution to the debate, started in this journal in 2000, about the future of surveying practice in <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> disputes. Practical implications – Places new information in the public domain which has implications for judges in future <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> cases, and for the professional liability of surveyors when advising clients in contemplation of possible <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> litigation. Originality/value – Presents the first comprehensive analysis of judicial attitudes <b>to</b> modern <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> surveying practice since its introduction in the early part of the twentieth century...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The paper {{examines}} {{the origins of}} the so-called "grumble point" (a sky factor of 0. 2 per cent) as the measure of daylight adequacy in <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> disputes. It seeks to identify the rationale, and underlying scientific basis, for the adoption of this standard in the early twentieth century. Design/methodology/approach - Analysis of archive materials. Findings - The use of the 0. 2 per cent standard {{does not appear to be}} based on empirical investigations involving human perceptions of adequate light. No evidence exists of the investigations reputedly undertaken by Percy Waldram during the early twentieth century. Waldram's own writings suggest that the standard began as a "rule of thumb" and was only later justified by reference to other independent reports. These generally do not support the use of the standard and, in any event, were soon superseded by other reports that concluded that it was too low. There is a lack of reliable evidence to justify the original adoption of the 0. 2 per cent figure, and many of the assumptions underpinning modern <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> practice are found to be based on inaccurate information. Research limitations/implications - Continues the debate, started in this journal in 2000, about the future of surveying practice in <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> disputes. Practical implications - Places new information in the public domain which has implications for the professional liability of surveyors advising clients in <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> cases.

40|$|Purpose – Over {{the last}} few years it has been {{established}} {{that there is a need}} to re-evaluate the basis of assessment of the sufficiency of daylight, in <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> cases, where the loss of daylight after obstruction might lead to injunction and/or damages. The purpose of this paper is to further examine whether the methodology used by surveyors, whereby the effect of glazing, window frames and internal reflectance are ignored, is valid and whether theoretical values can be translated into real values obtained through practical experimentation. Design/methodology/approach – Modern methods of assessment of daylighting, for design purposes, calculate a whole room average as a percentage of available daylight from a Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) sky whereas Waldram's methodology, in <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> cases, results in a contour line marking the series of points in a room where the task lighting, from a uniform sky, would be insufficient for normal use. These two methods appear incompatible and the conundrum is that whilst the courts are seeking to determine adequacy of daylighting to a room, the practitioners need to be able to measure the reduction in a way that has real meaning and can be valued. Findings – By comparing theoretical results using the Waldram methodology with those obtained using the Building Research Establishment (BRE) methodology and with physical measurements on site and in an artificial sky dome, it can be demonstrated that results using the Waldram Diagram, or the proposed CIEL Diagram, can be translated into real values of daylighting for a room and that these values are more realistic than those obtained through the BRE methodology. Originality/value – This research (which is ongoing) will be useful to practitioners and the courts in determining <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> cases and is a significant contribution to the debate initiated in this journal by Michael Pitts some 12 years ago...|$|R

50|$|Building {{surveyors}} work in most {{real estate}} markets including residential, commercial, retail, industrial, leisure, education and health. Consequently, {{there are a}} wide variety of opportunities for chartered building surveyors to work in both the commercial, private, and public sectors. Many chartered building surveyors work for property consultancies, public sector organisations, real estate owning clients and contractors as well as in a number of specialist niche areas such as insurance, <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> party wall matters etc. As well as strong technical skills, building surveyors need to have strong people skills and the highest levels of integrity. Clients, whether a large corporation or an individual member of the public, need to have the utmost confidence in the impartial advice given by chartered building surveyors. Chartered building surveyors are clearly differentiated from the rest of their market by their enhanced technical knowledge and professional standards.|$|R
5000|$|Once a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> exists, {{the owner}} of the right is {{entitled}} to [...] "sufficient light according to the ordinary notions of mankind": Colls v. Home & Colonial Stores Ltd (1904). Courts rely on expert witnesses to define this term. Since the 1920s, experts have used a method proposed by Percy Waldram to assist them with this. Waldram suggested that ordinary people require one foot-candle of illuminance (approximately ten lux) for reading and other work involving visual discrimination. This equates to a sky factor (similar to the daylight factor) of 0.2%. Today, Waldram's methods are increasingly subject to criticism and the future of expert evidence in rights to light cases is currently the subject of much debate within the surveying profession.|$|E
