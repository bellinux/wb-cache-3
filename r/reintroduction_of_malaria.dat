40|$|Because {{of concern}} about the {{possible}} <b>reintroduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> transmission in Italy, we analyzed the epidemiologic factors involved and determined the country’s malariogenic potential. Some rural areas in central and southern Italy have high receptivity {{because of the presence}} of potential malaria vectors. Anopheles labranchiae is probably susceptible to infection with Plasmodium vivax strains, but less likely to be susceptible to infection with P. falciparum. Its vulnerability is low because of the low presence of gametocyte carriers (imported cases) during the season climatically favorable to transmission. The overall malariogenic potential of Italy appears to be low, and <b>reintroduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> is unlikely in most of the country. However, our investigations showed that the malaria situation merits ongoing epidemiologic surveillance.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Transfusion {{transmitted}} malaria {{is undoubtedly}} a potential health hazard for blood recipients. Egypt {{is still on}} the prevention <b>of</b> <b>reintroduction</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> control program. Fayoum Governorate {{is considered one of the}} high risk foci due to its geology in Egypt, however no studies have been reported to evaluate the current status of subclinical Plasmodium infection based on sensitive molecular techniques. Moreover, screening <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> is not listed within screening protocols of blood-borne pathogens in Fayoum blood banks. Objective: To assess the current prevalence of subclinical Plasmodium infection among blood donors of Fayoum inhabitants for transfusion biosafety. To predict if there is any possibility <b>of</b> reemergence <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> in the governorate and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> control measures. Methods: A cross sectional survey was conducted on 400 apparently healthy blood-donors in blood transfusion center of Fayoum University hospital from Jun 2012 to Jan 2013. Conventional PCR was used to detect the 18 S ssrRNA Plasmodium gene. Results: All Fayoum inhabitants’ blood donors’ samples were negative for Plasmodium infection. Conclusions: Current applied control and preventive measures are effective in the context of blood transfusion biosafety in Fayoum blood banks and, therefore, the implementation <b>of</b> a routine <b>malaria</b> screening test in Fayoum blood banks is not merited at this time. In light of our study, we can assume that malaria has been successfully eliminated, at present, from Fayoum Governorate. However further comprehensive study is recommended to screen and stratify the results according to age, substantiate the assume eradication of the infection.

40|$|Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a {{well-known}} insecticide that was introduced and widely used during World War II. In total more than 4. 5 million tonnes DDT have been produced. Although its use and production stopped worldwide during the 1970 s, it was reintroduced in the 2000 s as a malaria vector control by the World Health Organization (WHO).

40|$|Movement {{of malaria}} across {{international}} borders poses {{a major obstacle}} to achieving malaria elimination in the 34 countries that have committed to this goal. In border areas, malaria prevalence is often higher than in other areas due to lower access to health services, treatment-seeking behaviour of marginalised populations that typically inhabit border areas, difficulties in deploying prevention programs to hard-to-reach communities, often in difficult terrain, and constant movement of people across porous national boundaries. Malaria elimination in border areas will be challenging, and key to addressing the challenges is strengthening of surveillance activities for rapid identification of any importation or <b>reintroduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria.</b> This could involve taking advantage of technological advances, such as spatial decision support systems, which can be deployed to assist program managers to carry out preventive and reactive measures, and mobile phone technology, {{which can be used}} to capture the movement of people in the border areas and likely sources of malaria importation.

The ideal malaria eradication drug is a coformulated drug combination suitable for mass administration that can be administered in a single encounter at infrequent intervals and that results in radical cure of all life cycle stages of all five malaria species infecting humans. Short of this optimal goal, highly desirable drugs might have limitations such as targeting only one or two parasite species, the priorities being Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.

40|$|About 30 yr after malaria eradication, surveys {{to assess}} the {{presence}} and abundance of anopheline vectors were carried out in central and southern Italy and in the islands of Sardinia and Sicily from 1992 to 1994. Anopheles labranchiae Falleroni was present in scattered foci in all regions, except for Tuscany, where it breeds almost exclusively in rice fields (Grosseto Province). Most common breeding sites were rivers and streams, followed by ponds and ground pools. The highest adult densitiy was found in Tuscany near rice fields and along {{the west coast of}} Calabria.

To determine the completeness <b>of</b> reporting <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> cases to SLHDs, cases identified by local surveillance systems were compared with those identified through active case detection conducted at all laboratories that receive clinical specimens from 11 metropolitan areas in Arizona, Cali-fornia, New Mexico, and Texas. <b>Of</b> the 61 <b>malaria</b> cases identified through either local surveillance or active case detection, 43 (70 %) were identified by SLHDs (range by metropolitan area 5 50 – 100 %) and 56 (92 %) through active case detection.

Completeness of reporting, calculated using the Lincoln-Peterson Capture-Recapture technique, was 69 % for SLHD surveillance systems and 89 % for laboratory-based active case detection. The high percentage of cases identified by the 11 SLHDs suggests that the National Malaria Surveillance System provides trends that accurately reflect the epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> in the United States.

A total of 256, 179 confirmed malaria cases were recorded in this period, and 86. 8 % of them were reported during 2004 – 2008. Between 2004 and 2008, Plasmodium vivax was the major species (72. 2 %) of malaria parasite. Most cases (67. 3 %) were found in male, and mainly in {{the age group of}} 35 – 39 years. A total of 236 deaths resulting from malaria were reported and nearly half (45. 3 %) of them were in Yunnan province. In all, 204, 760 local malaria (79. 9 %) and 51, 419 imported malaria (20. 1 %) were observed during 2004 – 2013. However, afterward the proportion of imported malaria continuously increased from 2004 (16. 2 %) to 2013 (97. 9 %).

40|$|Recent {{increases}} in funding for malaria control {{have led to}} the reduction in transmission in many malaria endemic countries, prompting the national control programmes of 36 malaria endemic countries to set elimination targets. Accounting for human population movement (HPM) in planning for control, elimination and post-elimination surveillance is important, as evidenced by previous elimination attempts that were undermined by the <b>reintroduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> through HPM. Strategic control and elimination planning, therefore, requires quantitative information on HPM patterns and the translation of these into parasite dispersion. HPM patterns and the risk of malaria vary substantially across spatial and temporal scales, demographic and socioeconomic sub-groups, and motivation for travel, so multiple data sets are likely required for quantification of movement. While existing studies based on mobile phone call record data combined with malaria transmission maps have begun to address within-country HPM patterns, other aspects remain poorly quantified despite their importance in accurately gauging malaria movement patterns and building control and detection strategies, such as cross-border HPM, demographic and socioeconomic stratification of HPM patterns, forms of transport, personal malaria protection and other factors that modify malaria risk. A wealth of data exist to aid filling these gaps, which, when combined with spatial data on transport infrastructure, traffic and malaria transmission, can answer relevant questions to guide strategic planning. This review aims to (i) discuss relevant types of HPM across spatial and temporal scales, (ii) document where datasets exist to quantify HPM, (iii) highlight where data gaps remain and (iv) briefly put forward methods for integrating these datasets in a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework for analysing and modelling human population and Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection movements...|$|E

The presence of malaria vector borne diseases (Anopheles stephensi), availability of breeding sites, and the presence of individuals who are infected with malaria protozoans (Plasmodium spp.), states the risk of a <b>reintroduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> to Qatar. اجريت هذه الدراسة المسحية بهدف معرفة اجناس) انواع(البعوض الاكثر انتشارا في بلدية الريان بدولة قطر وذلك في الفترة من شهر ديسمبر 2014 م الي شهر ابريل 2015 وخلال هذه الدراسة تم جمع العينات من 37 موقعا واشتملت العينات اليرقات بالاضافة الى البعوض البالغ والذي وصل عدده 312 فرد) بعوضة(كما قيست درجة حموضة مياه التوالد في المعمل. وبالاضافة الى ذلك تم تقديم خرائط لتوزيع الانواع المختلفة وذلك باستخدام احد برامج نظم المعلومات الجغرافية. وبناء علي احدث المفاتيح التصنيفية للبعوض تم تعريف ثلاثة اجناس: Culex, Anopheles and Coquillettidia واربعة انواع Culex vagans Culex bitaeniorhynchus Culex, mimeticus and Anopheles stephensi.. كما اظهرت النتائج ان بعوض Culex هو الاكثر انتشارا في منطقة الدراسة. ان وجود بعوض Anopheles stephensi المدرج كعامل اساسي لمرض الملاريا يمثل خطورة ويجعل دولة قطر عرضة لظهور مرض الملاريا مجددا به...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www 3. interscience. wiley. comDuring the last decade, major progress in malaria control has been achieved in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. However, malaria is still a potentially fatal disease in some hilly-forested areas {{and continues to be}} endemic in a few coastal foci. To estimate the risk that stems from the major vectors after a decade of intensive malaria control, an entomological study based on human landing collections was conducted between April 1998 and November 2000 in six study villages (four in Vietnam, one in Cambodia and one in Laos) located in different physio-geographical areas. Five villages were selected in places where new cases of malaria still occurred. In the sixth village, in the northern hilly area of Vietnam, no case of malaria was detected during the past 3 years. In three study villages of the hilly forested areas of Cambodia and central Vietnam, Anopheles dirus A still {{played an important role in}} malaria transmission and maintain perennial transmission inside the villages despite its low density. Anopheles minimus A was found in all study villages except in the southern coastal village of Vietnam. Its role in malaria transmission, however, varied between localities and surveys. In one study village of central Vietnam it was almost absent (one specimen collected over 480 man nights), and in another village sporozoite positive specimens (2. 8 %) were only observed during the first two surveys whereas this species disappeared from the collections from November 1998 onwards (six surveys: 360 man nights). In the northern study site An. minimus A and C were found in all collections, but no local malaria transmission occurred. However, the constant presence of these two species associated with a high longevity (parous rate up around 80 % and 65 %, respectively), suggests that transmission can occur at almost any time if parasite reservoirs are reintroduced in the area. The proper management of malaria cases and population movement is, therefore, important to prevent outbreaks and the <b>reintroduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> in northern Vietnam. In the study site of the Mekong delta, An. sundaicus occurred at high densities (up to 190 bites/man/night). The recent changes in land use from rice cultivation to shrimp farming probably explains the increase of this brackish water breeding species during the study period. However, none of the 11 002 specimens was positive for Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein (CSP). The relative low survival rate as estimated by the parous rate (around 47 %) may reflect its low vectorial status that could explain the very low malaria incidence (1. 9 case/ 100 persons/year) in this study site. A calculated sporozoite rate of maximum 1 / 300 000 is enough to explain this low malaria incidence. Despite the successes in malaria control, the vector An. dirus A continues to play an important role in malaria transmission, whereas An. minimus A showed temporal and spatial variation in its role as vector. The role of An. sundaicus as vector could not be confirmed because of the low incidence in the coastal study village. Other Anopheles species may be locally involved, but in the five study villages where malaria is still present they probably do not contribute significantly to malaria transmission. The study also points towards the fact that in Southeast Asia it will become increasingly difficult to incriminate Anopheles species in malaria transmission while the risk for malaria transmission still persist...|$|E
