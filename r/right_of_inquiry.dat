Committees of inquiry were rarely set up until 20 years ago, and have been used increasingly in the recent past.

A parliamentary committee of inquiry can also conduct searches and seize documents. Committee meetings at which witnesses or experts are heard are public unless the committee decides otherwise. Normally, the committee is obliged to report in a given time to the plenary assembly. It can for instance suggest amending existing legislation. The plenary assembly votes on motions submitted in the committee's report.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the major}} role that {{shareholders}} play in {{both private and public}} companies, legislators in various jurisdictions emphasize the need to protect their interests and rights through different legal instruments. In this regard, the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> is a unique right granted to shareholders enabling them to better protect their interests in the company. In essence, the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> allows shareholders of a company to assess whether the company is managed according to the principles of company law, whether there has been a misconduct in the management of the company (fiduciary duties {{of the members of the}} board are especially emphasized in this case) and whether the company is managed for the benefit of all the shareholders. Once the assessment of the management of the company is complete, the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> provides just and effective reliefs in order to remedy the situation in question if misconduct has been identified. Only two countries in the European Union are known to empower shareholders with such a right – the Netherlands and Lithuania. Due to this reason, a legal analysis of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> is necessary to determine whether it positively influences the relations between the shareholders and members of the board of the company and if it can be used to address the issue of conflicts of interests between the aforementioned subjects. The article examines the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> in the Netherlands and Lithuania, discusses the differences of the procedures established by the laws of each country and analyses whether the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> is an essential right for the shareholders of the company that could be introduced in the laws of other jurisdictions...|$|E

40|$|This Note {{focuses on}} two areas of uncertainty: the {{authority}} to stop and frisk fleeing suspects and the appropriate grounds to stop and frisk a suspect based on an anonymous tip. Four years ago, the ambiguities of a controversial New York Court of Appeals decision threw the lower courts into disarray as the standard of suspicion necessary to justify a police officer 2 ̆ 7 s pursuit of a fleeing suspect. This Note attempts to clarify those ambiguities and suggests a more reasonable approach for adoption by the court of appeals. This Note also explores {{the extent to which}} an anonymous tip can serve as a predicate for the stop-and-frisk action by a police officer. This Note identifies two apparently conflicting lines of cases in New York and offers a recommendation to resolve this conflict. The authority for stop-and-frisk procedure is both constitutional and statutory. New York 2 ̆ 7 s criminal Procedure Law codifies the reasonableness standard set forth by the Supreme Court in Terry v. Ohio, in which the Court recognizes the need for police initiated confrontations with private citizens based upon less than probable cause, the constitutional standard for issuance of search and arrest warrants. This lesser degree of cause needed for initiating a stop and frisk is known as 2 ̆ 2 reasonable suspicion. 2 ̆ 2 A third and less intrusive level of police initiated interference with citizens, the common-law <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry,</b> has been articulated by the New York Court of Appeals. The predicate for this common-law right is 2 ̆ 2 founded suspicion 2 ̆ 2 of criminal activity.

40|$|This thesis employs {{discourse}} analysis {{to examine the}} human rights contradictions contained in the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). It follows {{the development of the}} CEAS since its inception in 1999. However, the principal emphasis of the thesis falls on the scope for realising a rights-based asylum regime in the post-Lisbon context. The research takes the form of policy analysis, and is grounded in a human <b>rights</b> framework <b>of</b> <b>inquiry.</b> This human <b>rights</b> perspective is used to examine the normative and legal inconsistencies inherent to the EU’s securitised approach to asylum, and to put forward suggestions for an approach to asylum in the EU, which engenders a rights-based approach to protection. The analysis of contemporary EU asylum policy and practice demonstrates the extent to which securitisation is present in EU asylum policymaking. It shows that, until the security paradigm in this policy area is supplanted, the realisation of a rights-based asylum system in the EU will not be possible. It also addresses the further challenges to the realisation of the EU as a ‘single asylum space,’ which stem from the limitations in the current instruments of the acquis, most notably the absence of burden-sharing mechanisms to ensure that the EU’s humanitarian obligations are shared equally amongst Member States. The recent ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon holds significant potential {{for the development of a}} rights-based asylum regime in the EU.

40|$|The {{public inquiry}} {{has long been}} used to gather {{information}} of concern to the State in order that the best decisions may be made according to the information thereby obtained. The Quebec legislator has, therefore, foreseen the need for different laws or particular provisions that would enable the government {{to make use of}} this procedure. Among these we find the laws governing commissions <b>of</b> <b>inquiry,</b> police, municipal commissions, coroners and arson investigations. The public often follows closely the proceedings <b>of</b> such <b>inquiries,</b> which, consequently, become a means of informing, educating, and establishing a dialogue with, the public. However, certain public inquiries, such as the Quebec Commission <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> on Organized Crime, the commission <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> on freedom <b>of</b> unionization and the Keable Commission, run the risk <b>of</b> affecting the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> citizens, namely those summoned to appear during such hearings as well as those whose names appear in the testimony given. Hence, some individuals may see their reputations tarnished because of facts brought to light during the inquiry, lose their jobs as a result of commission recommendations or many later have to face either civil or criminal prosecution. It is, therefore, important that such persons be given access to the courts, in order to either challenge the jurisdiction of the commission or demand that the inquiry respect the rules of natural justice. In this area, judicial review depends on the characterization of the method of operation <b>of</b> the public <b>inquiry</b> as a whole, i. e. as the exercise by the commissioners of a recommendatory power, or of interlocutory decisions taken during the course <b>of</b> the <b>inquiry.</b> Depending on the judicial or administrative nature of the activity concerned, the courts will {{decide whether or not to}} exercise their superintending and reforming powers. Thus, the courts will intervene only if the function exercised is of a judicial nature. In this regard, the courts deem that an administrative body exercises a judicial function, on the one hand when it determines the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> individuals and, on the other, when such a body has a duty to act judicially. Apart from some rare exceptions, the courts have ruled that the exercise of the power <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> generally does not trench on the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> citizens and that such a power is therefore administrative in nature. At present, the issue as to whether the <b>inquiry</b> determines the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> individuals is considered by the courts in the light of either one of two theories, which can be labelled the binary and global theories. Supporters of the binary theory feel that the inquiry and the decisions which may proceed therefrom represent two quite distinct stages and the interference with the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> individuals can only occur when a decision is made. We find an illustration of this reasoning in, among others cases, Guay v. Lafleur and St-John v. Fraser. Proponents of the second theory are agreed that the decision is an integral part <b>of</b> the <b>inquiry</b> process and that interference with rights occurs at the inquiry level itself. This argument is exemplified adequately by the judgement in Saulnier v. Quebec Police Commission. This paper also examines the characterization of interlocutory decisions made by a commission in the course of its proceedings. In this respect, the courts feel that coercive powers are of a judicial nature, while decisions concerning the administration of evidence are seen as administrative. A study of the abundant jurisprudence in this area leads us to conclude that the Quebec legislator should provide for a specific recourse, similar to that existing presently in Ontario, which would allow citizens access to the courts to challenge decisions made by commissions <b>of</b> <b>inquiry...</b>|$|R
