5|$|A Love Surreal {{comprises}} a {{cycle of}} slow-burning songs about different stages of love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, renewal, and existential peace. Bilal's intimate lyrics address love's ephemeral nature and how to sustain happiness. It veers between danceable, upbeat songs about cultivating a new <b>romance</b> <b>and</b> bluesy, meditative songs about how romances dissolve. In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A Love Surreal deals more with feelings of lust and flirting rather than personal and societal issues.|$|E

Its songs eschew the personal and societal themes of Airtight's Revenge in favor of upbeat songs about cultivating a <b>romance</b> <b>and</b> meditative laments on its dissolution. Bilal {{wanted to make the}} album sound multidimensional and drew on the surrealist art of Salvador Dalí for inspiration.|$|E

5|$|Ezra Pound {{is really}} at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It {{is true that}} he was driven to Europe by a thirst for <b>romance</b> <b>and</b> color that he could {{scarcely}} have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself...|$|E

5|$|Einstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also {{enrolled}} at the Polytechnic that year. She {{was the only woman}} among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into <b>romance,</b> <b>and</b> they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.|$|E
