The main new features of the speculative strategy are (a) the use of Kalman filters to update the forecasting equation, (b) the allowance for transactions,costs and margin requirements and (c) the endogenous determination of the leveraging of the portfolio. While the forecasting model tended to overestimate profit and underestimate risk, the strategy was still profitable over a three year period and it was possible to reject the hypothesis that the sum of profits was zero. Furthermore, the currency portfolio was found to have an extremely low market risk. Combinations of the speculative currency portfolio with traditional portfolios of U.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{forecasting}} the pricing kernel, i. e., stochastic claim inflation or link ratio function, of incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims (in property casualty insurance) from residuals in a dynamic claims forecast model is presented. We employ a pseudo Kalman filter approach by using claims risk exposure estimates to reconstruct innovations in stochastic claims development. Whereupon {{we find that}} the pricing kernel forecast is a product measure of the innovations. We show how these results impact performance measurement including but not limited to <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> by and through insurance accounting relationships for adjusted underwriting results; and loss ratio or pure premium calculations. Additionally, we show how, in the context of Wold decomposition, diagnostics from our model can be used to compute signal to noise ratio for, and cross check, unobservable pricing kernels used to forecast claims. Furthermore, we prove that a single risk exposure factor connects seemingly unrelated specifications for loss link ratio, and claims volatility. ...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{institutions}} todayface major hurdles in miti-gating {{credit risks}} (“play-ing defense”), and simultaneously pursuing risk-adjusted profitabili-ty (“playing offense”). Nowhere is this harder than in large corporate lending, where, by most accounts, adequate risk-adjusted returns {{are hard to}} achieve. To support these conflicting objectives, {{there has been a}} decade of rapid development of both in-house and commercially available credit risk and perform-ance measurement tools. Broadly, these tools have included: • Sophisticated, empirical default models used in estab-lishing credit risk ratings for both public and private bor-rowers. • Risk-adjusted performance measurement tools, such as <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> (RAROC), used in pricing individual loans and assessing risk-adjusted profitability. • Portfolio management models used in measuring systematic portfolio concentrations with the assistance of correlation analysis. In this push to implement better credit risk analytics, deci-sion-support models for risk-adjusted pricing have received less emphasis. The reasons for this are varied, but they probably stem from the view that solving the “portfolio problem ” was the next key priority after implement-ing better credit ratings. After all, big concentrations of risk in Texas in the 1980 s, real estate in the early 1990 s, and Asia most recent-ly have gotten the big headlines.

30|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} financial innovation {{that could be}} explained using evolutionary theory is modern risk management (Barlow, 1993). From World War II to the mid- 1960 s, risk management was mainly shaped by the practices and heuristics of business people, investors, and employees. Beginning in the late 1960 s, new risks emerged, and old ones were aggravated. Interest and exchange risks emerged after the termination of Bretton Woods. Other risks became more relevant such as energy prices, inflation, and rising funding costs. In response, the risk management function started to evolve and gain more relevance. In the late 1970 s, the US Bankers Trust developed the concept of <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> {{for the purpose of}} obtaining a measure of profitability adjusted for risk. At the same time, regulatory authorities began considering more standardized rules for risk management in banks (Field, 2003). For risk estimation, banks initially used repricing gap analysis, which estimated the effect of interest rates on interest income. Gap analysis evolved further to consider market values with the introduction of duration analysis. Duration {{is a measure of the}} sensitivity of a fixed income asset to interest rates. Another important evolutionary step was the introduction of value at risk measures by JP Morgan. Value at risk is a quantitative measure used to estimate the potential loss that a portfolio can have over a specific time frame. With the increasing use of derivatives and the need for a standard risk language, banks and regulators needed a measure for risk that was both easy to understand and allowed for comparison across banks. Therefore, a paradigm was established called modern risk management for which the value at risk measure was the main risk instrument. Risk management is still evolving and changing, particularly in response to the increasing number and complexity of risks faced by financial institutions.|$|E
40|$|Liberalization and {{deregulation}} {{have recently}} accelerated. It is therefore useful to keep risk {{within a certain}} level in relation to capital, considering that financial institutions must control their risk appropriately to maintain the safety and soundness of their operation. In 1988, the Basle Capital Accord—International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards—introduced a uniform framework {{for the implementation of}} risk-based capital rules. However, this framework applies the same “risk weight ” (a ratio applied to assets for calculation of aggregated risk assets) to loans to all the private corporations, regardless of their creditworthiness. Such an approach might encourage banks to eliminate loans that can be terminated easily while maintaining loans with higher risk. As shareholder-owned companies, banks are expected to maximize <b>return</b> <b>on</b> equity during this competitive era, while performing sound and safe banking functions as financial institutions with public missions.

40|$|This paper puts forth two models, {{one of a}} {{bank and}} one of an insurer. Their {{divisions}} responsible for investment (and risk underwriting, respectively) seek to maximize the expected <b>risk-adjusted</b> rate of <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> (RAROC). For the bank, higher solvency lowers the cost of refinancing; for the insurer, it attracts more premium income. In both cases, however, higher solvency ties costly capital. Sequential decision making is tracked over three periods. In period 1, exogenous changes in expected returns and in volatility occur, each suggesting optimal adjustments in solvency. However, there can be only one adjustment, which in period 3 creates an endogenous trade-off between expected returns and volatility. This tradeoff is shown to involve parameters that differ between banks and insurers, calling for bank-specific and insurance-specific solvency regulation. In addition, Basel I and II (Solvency I and II, respectively) are shown to modify this tradeoff, inducing senior management of both banks and insurers to opt for higher volatility and lower solvency than otherwise. Therefore, existing solvency regulation can run counter their stated objective in both cases, which quite likely is also true of Basel III and Solvency III...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2009. The {{financial}} intermediation function that a bank performs dictates {{the existence of}} a risk-reward trade-off embedded within a bank's balance sheet. The process of risk management focuses on achieving the broader organisational objectives relating to this risk-reward trade-off. Measuring the contribution of risk to profitability is pivotal in assessing the optimality of a bank's risk-reward trade-off. Conventional accounting-based performance measures such as return on assets and return on equity do not incorporate the risk effects as part of the performance assessment. Risk-adjusted performance measurement assessments, such as <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>capital,</b> acknowledge the impact of risk in measuring the profitability of a bank. Interest rate risk is an important source of bank profitability. The Asset-and-Liability Management function of a bank is tasked with the management of interest rate risk in the 'banking book' of its balance sheet. Managing interest rate risk demands that the sources of interest rate risk for example, reprice risk, yield curve risk, option risk and basis risk are clearly identified and measured. The impact of interest rate risk can be assessed from two perspectives namely, the earnings perspective and the economic value perspective. Measuring the impact of interest rate risk conventionally involves a number of techniques, each of which has inherent strengths and weaknesses. Simulation modelling techniques deploying earnings-at-risk and economic value of equity analyses respectively, most accurately quantifies the earnings and economic value perspectives to the effects of interest rate risk. The methods of repricing gap analyses and duration analyses present efficiency constraints in measuring interest rate risk although complimentary to developing a complete interest rate risk metrics framework. Matched-Term Funds Transfer Pricing is an important component in measuring the risk-adjusted net interest margin for the risk-adjusted performance measurement process. Matched-Term Funds Transfer Pricing system isolates the business units from the effects of interest rate risk by transferring the interest rate risk or mismatch spread (profit or loss) to the Central Funding Unit or Asset-and-Liability Management unit. Business units are therefore allocated the net interest margin components relating to the controllable risk elements for which management responsibility is assumed. Business units use the risk-adjusted performance measurement results to develop balance sheet and pricing strategies that are sensitised to asset and liability management and interest rate risk management objectives through the Matched-Term Funds Transfer Pricing mechanism. These business strategies {{should be included in the}} measurement of interest rate risk by the asset-and-liability management simulation model. The asset-and-liability management process can therefore optimise the interest rate risk management process. The integration of the Matched-Term Funds Transfer Pricing, Asset-and-Liability Management and banking book interest rate risk management processes institutes a risk-optimisation approach to risk management compared against the conventional risk-control perspective to the function of risk management.
