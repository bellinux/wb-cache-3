40|$|AIM: <b>Restorative</b> <b>surgery</b> after (procto) {{colectomy}} with ileo-neorectal anastomosis (INRA) or restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (RPC) combines cure of {{ulcerative colitis}} (UC) with restoration of intestinal continuity. This study aimed to evaluate these two operations. METHOD: Patients having INRA and RPC were matched according to sex, age at onset of UC, age at <b>restorative</b> <b>surgery</b> {{and duration of}} follow-up. Patients were included if they were over 18 years of age, had UC confirmed histopathologically and had undergone either operation. Long-term function, anal and neorectal physiology, complications, quality of life (QoL) and health status (HS) were determined. RESULTS: Seventy-one consecutive patients underwent surgery {{with the intention of}} having an INRA procedure. This was successfully carried out in 50, and 21 underwent intra-operative conversion to RPC. Median defaecation frequency was 6 / 24 h. In 11 / 71 patients reservoir failure occurred and 13 / 71 developed pouchitis. QoL and HS were comparable to the healthy population. Median follow-up was 6. 2 years. These patients were matched with 71 patients who underwent RPC. RPC was successful in all patients. Median defaecation frequency was 8 / 24 h. Failure occurred in 7 / 71 patients and 13 / 71 developed pouchitis. QoL and HS were comparable with the healthy population. Median follow-up was 6. 9 years. CONCLUSION: Comparison of INRA and RPC on an intention to treat basis was not considered to be realistic due to the high intra-operative conversion rate and the failures in the INRA group.

Cohort studies have shown feasibility concerning procedure, specimen quality and morbidity. However, concerns exist about quality of life and ano(neo) rectal function. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate quality of life in patients following TaTME for rectal cancer with anastomosis. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent <b>restorative</b> TaTME <b>surgery</b> for rectal adenocarcinoma in an academic teaching center with tertiary referral function were evaluated. Validated questionnaires were prospectively collected. Quality of life was assessed by the EuroQol 5 D (EQ- 5 D), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's QLQ-C 30 and QLQ-CR 29 and low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) scale. Outcomes of the questionnaires at 1 and 6 months were compared with preoperative (baseline) values. RESULTS: Thirty patients after restorative TaTME for rectal cancer were included. Deterioration for all domains was mainly observed at 1 month after surgery compared to baseline, but most outcomes had returned to baseline at 6 months.

30|$|Given this confinement, {{the extant}} {{literature}} on dental tourism {{has focused on}} three main themes. The first theme is on the key features of this service. In terms of human need, similar dental care is needed by most people throughout their lives [43]. However, customer demand for dental care tends to be non-emergency. That is, non-immediate treatments {{are less likely to}} lead to catastrophic consequences compared to other health care [9]. This feature would widen customer choices as to where and when to use this service. On the other aspect, dental tourists may need general or specialist care. General dental care includes basic fillings, scaling, cleaning and tooth whitening. Specialist care includes <b>restorative</b> treatments, <b>surgery</b> and implant surgery. Some complex treatments such as crowns, bridges, veneers and surgical treatments including the removal of wisdom teeth and dental implants are commonly expensive in high-income countries [5]. This feature is among the reasons motivating customers to seek the service in another country as a dental tourist. To this respect, Chandu [5] identifies two main groups of dental tourists. The first group includes those who purposefully go to a foreign country for a dental treatment, either for the sole purpose or dental treatment as part of a holiday package. The second group includes immigrants who are returning to their native country for a holiday or to visit relatives and then access dental treatment during their visit.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A {{complication}} after <b>restorative</b> rectal <b>surgery</b> with {{a straight}} anastomosis is low-anterior resection syndrome with a postoperatively deteriorated anorectal function. The colonic J-reservoir is sometimes used {{with the purpose of}} reducing these symptoms. An alternative method is to use a simple side-to-end anastomosis or a coloplasty. Material and Methods: Three-hundred fifty seven patients with rectal cancer undergoing total mesorectal excision (TME). Three-hundred (84. 0 %) received a low anterior resection with primary anastomosis and colo-rectal n= 194 (64. 6 %) or colo-anal anastomosis n= 106 (35. 3 %). A colonic pouch using the descending colon was created in 24 patients and in 75 patients respectively. Surgical results and complications were recorded. Patients were followed with a functional evaluation at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Results: Patient characteristics in both groups were very similar regarding gender, age, tumor level, and Dukes’ stages. A large proportion of the patients received short-term preoperative radiotherapy (72 %). There {{was no significant difference in}} surgical outcome between the 2 techniques with respect to anastomotic height, perioperative blood loss,, postoperative complications, reoperations, hospital stay or pelvic sepsis rates except the anastomotic stricture rate in the colonic J-Pouch group after coloanal anastomosis (p< 0. 02).

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{reason for}} endodontic failures is almost invariably due to bacterial infection. The bacteria may be situated within a previously missed or uninstrumented {{portion of a}} root canal, infiltrate via a leaky coronal restoration and root filling, or cause contamination from an extra-radicular infection.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{technical}} {{difficulties of the}} ileoanal reservoir operation have been overcome, allowing acceptable morbidity {{in the hands of}} both the frequent and less frequent operator. However, a minority of patients have persistently unsatisfactory pouch function, which can be a difficult problem to manage. METHODS: A Medline search was carried out to identify relevant papers published from November 1996 to January 1978. For clinical information more emphasis was given to recent publications with larger numbers. Where appropriate, information from other sources and some local data were included. RESULTS: Most patients empty the pouch four to eight times a day with perfect continence and no urgency, and are considered to have acceptable function with which they are satisfied. Patients who have poor function beyond an easily treated episode of pouchitis require the expertise of a multidisciplinary team offering some understanding of the anatomy, physiology and pathology of the gastrointestinal tract in general and of the ileal reservoir in particular. A thorough and persistent approach to difficult cases is often rewarded with a good outcome, with the exception of problems arising from postoperative sepsis. The temptation to use pouchitis as a waste-basket diagnosis for poorly understood dysfunction should be avoided. Problems causing poor function may originate in the pouch (including pelvic sepsis), the pouch outlet, or the small bowel above the pouch, and these areas need to be considered in each case. CONCLUSION: To optimize the benefits of <b>restorative</b> pouch <b>surgery,</b> both patients and physicians need to understand aspects of fine tuning of pouch function, including diet, medication and lifestyle. In managing ileoanal reservoir dysfunction the temptation to procrastinate should be resisted; an approach that is systematic and sympathetic should be adopted...|$|R
40|$|Basic neurotransplantation {{research}} evoked {{clinical trials}} of <b>restorative</b> brain <b>surgery.</b> Parkinson's disease {{was the first}} and primary test bed for this putative new therapeutic method. Various centers performed the grafting surgery and the behavioral evaluations in different ways, and observed a varying degree of symptomatic relief. This led to a plea for double blind placebo-controlled clinical trials, which have since been performed and of which the first outcomes were recently published. In the present paper this approach of experimental neurotransplantation in brain diseases is discussed and rejected. Neural grafting in the central nervous system is irreversible and is therefore not suitable for experimental approaches originally designed for and best suited to drug studies. For Parkinson's disease in particular, the technique is far from optimized to perform large-scale studies at this stage. Moreover, previous negative results of adrenal medulla tissue implantation in the brain of patients make placebo effects rather unlikely. Moral arguments concerning the validity of the informed consent, therapeutic misconception, and the risk/benefit ratio can be added in the plea against this control surgery. Finally, a recommendation is made for study designs that apply a disease-dedicated core assessment protocol (CAP) that can evaluate the period from pre-operative to post-convalescent stages quantitatively, and therefore, unbiased. The strength of these CAPs is that they allow comparisons of different grafting techniques, of results between centers and of other types of interventions and invasive treatments such as deep brain stimulation. On ethical grounds, it is unacceptable not to use a study design that circumvents sham or imitation surgery. It is a challenge for the neuroscience community to develop CAPs for brain diseases that are eligible for neurotransplantation in the future. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
