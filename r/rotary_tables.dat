5000|$|The {{rotary table}} is also called a turntable. Most <b>rotary</b> <b>tables</b> are chain driven. These chains {{resemble}} very large bicycle chains. The chains require constant oiling to prevent burning and seizing. Virtually all <b>rotary</b> <b>tables</b> {{are equipped with}} a rotary lock'. Engaging the lock can either prevent the rotary from turning in one particular direction, or from turning at all. This is commonly used by crews in lieu of using a second pair of tongs to makeup or break out pipes.The rotary bushings are located {{at the center of}} the rotary table. These can generally be removed in two separate pieces to facilitate large items, i.e. drill bits, to pass through the rotary table. The large gap in the center of the rotary bushings is referred to as the [...] "bowl" [...] due to its appearance. The bowl is where the slips are set to hold up the drill string during connections and pipe trips as well as the point the drill string passes through the floor into the wellbore.

50|$|A {{rotary table}} is a {{precision}} work positioning device used in metalworking. It enables the operator to drill or cut work at exact intervals around a fixed (usually horizontal or vertical) axis. Some <b>rotary</b> <b>tables</b> allow the use of index plates for indexing operations, and some can also be fitted with dividing plates that enable regular work positioning at divisions for which indexing plates are not available. A rotary fixture used in this fashion is more appropriately called a dividing head (indexing head).|$|E

50|$|Until recently, CNC {{machining}} {{was used}} only {{to provide the}} basic shape of the port but hand finishing was usually still required because {{some areas of the}} port were not accessible to a CNC tool.

40|$|A novel {{calibration}} method is presented for a sensor fusion system in large-scale metrology, which improves the calibration efficiency and reliability. The attitude sensor {{is composed of}} a pinhole prism, a converging lens, an area-array camera and a biaxial inclinometer. A mathematical model is established to determine its three-dimensional attitude relative to a cooperative total station by using two vector observations from the imaging system and the inclinometer. The measurement model developed has two aspects to be calibrated: the intrinsic parameters of the imaging model; and the transformation matrix between the camera and the inclinometer. An integrated {{calibration method}} using a three-axis <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> and a total station is then proposed. A single mounting position of the attitude sensor on the <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> is sufficient to solve for all parameters of the measurement model. A correction technique for the reference laser beam of the total station removes the need for accurate positioning of the sensor on the <b>rotary</b> <b>table.</b> Calibration measurements are made at multiple angular positions of the <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> {{in order to determine}} all the unknown parameters in the model. Experimental verification has verified the practicality and accuracy of this calibration method. Results show that the mean deviations of attitude angles using the proposed method are less than 0. 01 °...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} {{setup for}} non-tactile high-precision measurements of roundness and cylindricity of ring gauges {{is presented in}} this paper. The aim is to overcome classical problems of tactile and radial roundness measurements such as the error influences of the used <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> and the work piece alignment and thus to increase the accuracy and reduce the measurement time. To achieve those aims a double interferometer concept was chosen and combined with a measurement system for the work piece alignment, a high precision <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> and an automated four-axes adjustment unit. The main alignment errors of the work pieces (e. g. ring gauges) such as eccentricity and tilting are either suppressed or directly detected and consequently reduced by the automated four-axes adjustment unit. Due to the non-tactile measurement concept and the contactless energy supply of the four-axes adjustment unit, the radial run of the <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> is not affected.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a modern design {{approach}} via finite elements {{in the definition of}} the main structural elements (<b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> and working unit) of an innovative family of transfer machine tools. Using the concepts of green design and manufacture, as well as sustainable development thinking, the paper highlights the advantages derived from their application in this specific field (i. e., the clever use of lightweight materials to allow ruling out high-consumption hydraulic pump systems). The design is conceived in a modular way, so that the final solution can cover transfers from four to 15 working stations. Two versions of the machines are examined. The first one has a <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> with nine divisions, which can be considered as a prototype: this machine has been studied in order to set up the numerical predictive model, then validated by experimental tests. The second one, equipped with a <b>rotary</b> <b>table</b> with 15 divisions, is the biggest of the range: this machine has been entirely designed with the aid of the previously developed numerical model. The loading input forces for the analyses have been evaluated experimentally via drilling operations carried out on a three-axis CNC unit.
