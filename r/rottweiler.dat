25|$|The {{traditional}} gait of a <b>Rottweiler</b> is a trot. Therefore, the <b>Rottweiler</b> is a trotter. Trotting in this breed is by {{no means}} a fault and is required. This movement comes naturally to the <b>Rottweiler</b> and should appear as such; any deviation may lead to a disqualification in the show ring. While walking, the Rottweiler's legs, both front and hind, should move in a straight forward and backward manner. As with the straight movement of the legs, the path the <b>Rottweiler</b> moves in should also be straight. The Rottweiler's gait is all about balance and effectiveness as the breed is still used as a herder today.|$|E

50|$|In {{the fall}} and winter of 2003 in Ring of Honor, Smokes {{assembled}} a face stable called The <b>Rottweilers.</b> Its original members were Homicide, Grim Reefer, Slugger, and Benny Blanco. Other than Homicide, who was already a well-established star with the company, no one from this first incarnation of the <b>Rottweilers</b> really caught on with fans, and the stable was quietly depushed. When the Havana Pitbulls debuted in ROH in the spring of 2004, they joined forces with Homicide and Smokes, now heels, and reformed the <b>Rottweilers.</b> They were soon joined by Low Ki. This version of the <b>Rottweilers,</b> heels until the winter of 2006 when Homicide turned, lasted until when Homicide was made exclusive property of TNA in 2007.
