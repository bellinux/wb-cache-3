The Davis Cup World Group is the top level of the competition and features matches between players from the top 16 countries {{at the start of the}} year. Countries that lose their first round match face a relegation play-off against winning countries from the continental zones. World Group winning countries progress to the quarter-finals.

5|$|In September, Murray {{played his}} debut singles {{match for the}} Davis Cup in the World Group Play-off against Switzerland in Geneva on clay with Greg Rusedski, Alan Mackin and David Sherwood. Captain Jeremy Bates {{surprised}} everyone by naming Murray as the British No 1 and Alan Mackin as British No 2. Under the Davis Cup rules, this meant that for Friday's singles, Murray played the Swiss No 2, Stan Wawrinka while Mackin played the Swiss No 1, Roger Federer. Both of them lost their <b>rubbers,</b> giving Switzerland a 2–0 lead. Under the rules, for Sunday's reverse singles, Bates {{would have been able}} to substitute Mackin with Greg Rusedski, so that Rusedski would play Wawrinka, while Murray played Federer. However, Bates believed that Federer was virtually unbeatable because he was on a winning streak and hadn’t lost since June, and consequently Britain gambled on beating Wawrinka twice, with Murray playing Wawrinka when he was freshest. In the doubles, Murray/Rusedski played Federer and Yves Allegro, leaving Rusedski to play only once. The British tactics came to nought as Switzerland won the doubles rubber as well, gaining an unassailable 3–0 lead after two days. Alan Mackin and David Sherwood were consequently nominated for the dead singles <b>rubbers</b> losing both of them, resulting in a clean sweep for Switzerland.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{increased}} {{reliance on the}} automobile {{and the use of}} <b>rubber</b> in common products such as boots were driving demand for <b>rubber.</b> At that time <b>rubber</b> was made from naturally occurring latex extracted from certain plants. The most important of the plants for latex production is the <b>rubber</b> tree, Hevea brasiliensis whose cultivation is restricted to tropical climates. At this time about 75% of <b>rubber</b> was controlled by British corporations, spurring efforts in Russia, Germany and the United States to reduce dependence on British <b>rubber.</b> All three countries were trying to develop methods of manufacturing synthetic <b>rubber,</b> and the United States <b>Rubber</b> Company began producing natural <b>rubber</b> in Sumatra in 1910.

5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, <b>rubbers,</b> and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals.

For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E
