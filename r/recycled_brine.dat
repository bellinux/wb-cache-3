50|$|Key to the {{production}} of chlorine is the operation of the brine saturation/treatment system. Maintaining a properly saturated solution with the correct purity is vital, especially for membrane cells. Many plants have a salt pile which is sprayed with <b>recycled</b> <b>brine.</b> Others have slurry tanks that are fed raw salt and <b>recycled</b> <b>brine.</b> The raw brine is treated with sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide to precipitate calcium and magnesium. The reactions are often carried out in a series of reactors before the treated brine is sent to a large clarifier where the calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide are settled out. A floculating agent may be added just prior to the clarifier to improve settling. The decanted brine is then mechanically filtered using sand filters or leaf filters before entering a series of ion exchangers to further remove impurities. At several points in this process the brine is tested for hardness and strength.|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{waters of}} {{northern}} (18 degrees- 27 degrees S) and southern (37 degrees- 45 degrees S) Chile occur in {{two very different}} climatic, geologic and hydrologic environments: arid closed basins with abundant evaporites in the north: humid climate and well drained valleys in the south. The origin and behavior of {{the main components of}} the two groups of waters are examined and compared to each other. The modeling of the alteration of volcanic rocks leads to water compositions very different from those observed both in the north and south. In addition to hydrothermal alteration and deep emanations, the Cl/Br ratio reveals a major contribution of saline waters to the two groups: infiltrating brines from salt lakes in the north; seawater in the south. In the north, concentrations of Cl, Br, Na, K, Ca, SO 4, Li, B, Si result from the mixing of alteration waters with <b>recycled</b> <b>brines.</b> Hydrothermal alteration is obscured by this massive saline input, except for Mg. delta S- 34 values are consistent with an origin of sulfate from salar brines, which are themselves derived from deep Tertiary gypsum. In the south, two processes account for the composition of thermal waters: mixing of alteration waters with seawater and deep magmatic contribution. The mixing process controls the concentration of Cl, Br, Na, Alk, Si, K, Ca, Mg. Magmatic inputs are detectable for SO 4, Li and B. delta S- 34 suggests that sulfate stems from the mixing of alteration waters with either marine SO 4 in coastal waters or with deep SO 2 in inland waters. In both the north and south, the Mg concentration is drastically lowered (< 1 mu mol/L) by the probable formation of a chlorite-type mineral. In the south, very small amounts of seawater (< 1 % in volume) are sufficient to imprint a clear signature on thermal waters. Not only coastal springs are affected by seawater mixing, but also remote inland springs, as far as 150 km from the sea. Subduction of marine sediments in the accretive margin could be the source of the marine imprint in thermal waters of southern Chile. Seawater may be expelled from the subducted lithosphere and incorporated into the mantle source...|$|R
40|$|Postprocessing {{contamination}} of the products in a processing plant {{has been identified as}} one of the major reasons for food contamination with Listeria; brining is one such postprocessing area. Our previous study has shown that the combinations of UV and antimicrobials reduces the number of this organism significantly in fresh brine, but <b>brine</b> is usually <b>recycled</b> from days to weeks depending on its use. Therefore, this study is focused on the reduction of L. monocytogenes in <b>recycled</b> chill <b>brine</b> (obtained from a frankfurter processor) using the combinations of UV and antimicrobial agents, such as citric acid (CA), hydrogen peroxide (HP) and dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC). Results show that the combinations of UV and 2000 ppm and 4000 ppm HP were the most effective treatments in reducing the Listeria population with the total processing time of 120 min. Both of these treatments were found to be more effective than UV or HP alone. Additionally, all other treatments, such as the combinations of UV and CA (0. 2 and 0. 5 %) and UV and DMDC (250 and 500 ppm) were comparatively less effective. This {{may be due to the}} presence of organic matter in spent brine, which may have reduced the penetration of UV and availability of antimicrobials for microbial interaction...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} how the design and operation parameters of the Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) desalination process are optimised when the process is subject to variation in seawater temperature, fouling and freshwater demand throughout the day. A simple polynomial based dynamic seawater temperature and variable freshwater demand correlations are developed based on actual data which are incorporated in the MSF mathematical model using gPROMS models builder 3. 0. 3. In addition, a fouling model based on stage temperature is considered. The fouling {{and the effect of}} noncondensable gases are incorporated into the calculation of overall heat transfer co-efficient for condensers. Finally, an optimisation problem is developed where the total daily operating cost of the MSF process is minimised by optimising the design (no of stages) and the operating (seawater rejected flowrate and <b>brine</b> <b>recycle</b> flowrate) parameters...|$|R
40|$|Central Andes in Bolivia and {{northern}} Chile contain numerous internal drainage basins occupied by saline lakes and salt crusts (salars). Salts in inflow waters stem from two origins: alteration of volcanic rocks, which produces dilute waters, and brine recycling, {{which leads to}} brackish waters. Chilean alteration waters are three times more concentrated in average than Bolivian waters, which is related to a higher sulfur content in Chilean volcanoes. Brackish inflows stem from brines which leak out from present salars and mix with dilute groundwater. Most of the incoming salts are recycled salts. The cycling process {{is likely to have}} begun when ancient salars were buried by volcanic eruptions. Three major brine groups are found in Andean salars: alkaline, sulfate-rich, and calcium-rich brines. Evaporation modeling of inflows shows good agreement between predicted and observed brines in Chile. Alkaline salars are completely lacking in Chile, which is accounted for by higher sulfate and lower alkalinity of inflow waters, in turn related to the suspected higher sulfur content in Chilean volcanic rocks. Six Bolivian salars are alkaline, a lower number than that predicted by evaporative modeling. Deposition on the drainage basin of eolian sulfur eroded from native deposits shifts the initial alkaline evolution to sulfate brines. The occurrence of calcium-rich brines in Andean salars is not compatible with volcanic drainage basins, which can only produce alkaline or sulfate-rich weathering waters. The discrepancy is likely due to <b>recycled</b> calcic <b>brines</b> from ancient salars in sedimentary basins, now buried below volcanic formations. Calcic salars are not in equilibrium with their volcanic environment and may slowly change with time to sulfate-rich salars...|$|R
40|$|The design {{features}} of SWCC MSF plants are quite unique. The {{number of stages}} varies from as low as 16 up to 34 stages; distiller capacity from 2. 5 to 10 MIGD and performance ratio {{are in the range}} of 2. 39 to 4. 57 Kg / 1000 kJ. Top brine temperature varies from 90 to 115 oC; <b>brine</b> <b>recycles</b> rate from 946 to 1882 ton/h; stage width from 10. 2 to 19. 4 m and stage length from 2. 28 to 4. 7 m. Such diverse and accumulated {{design features}} provided a great opportunity to serve a twofold purpose. Firstly, to carry out a comprehensive thermodynamic diagnosis that identifies the design constraints and irreversibilities inherited {{in the design of the}} different MSF plants and can be subsequently used as a guide to identify the features of an improved design. Secondly, extensive available design information that can be effectively used to identify and to establish design equations for future design use. A comprehensive second law analysis was carried out using the second law of thermodynamic to assess the thermodynamic constraints inherited in the design of eleven MSF distillers representing SWCC major MSF plants situated in the Red Se...|$|R
40|$|Desalination is a {{technique}} of producing fresh water from the saline water. Industrial desalination of sea water is becoming an essential part in providing sustainable source of fresh water for {{a large number of}} countries around the world. Thermal process being the oldest and most dominating for large scale production of freshwater in todayÂ¿s world. Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) distillation process has been used for many years and is now the largest sector in the desalination industry. In this work, a steady state mathematical model of Multistage Flash (MSF) desalination process is developed and validated against the results reported in the literature using gPROMS software. The model is then used for further investigation. First, a steady state calcium carbonate fouling resistance model has been developed and implemented in the full MSF mathematical model developed above using gPROMS modeling tool. This model takes into consideration the effect of stage temperature on the calcium carbonate fouling resistance in the flashing chambers in the heat recovery section, heat rejection section, and brine heaters of MSF desalination plants. The effect of seasonal variation of seawater temperature and top brine temperature on the calcium carbonate fouling resistance has been studied throughout the flashing stage. In addition, the total annual operating cost of the MSF process is selected to minimise, while optimising the operating parameters such as seawater rejected flow rate, <b>brine</b> <b>recycle</b> flow rate and steam temperature at different seawater temperature and fouling resistance. Secondly, an intermediate storage between the plant and the client is considered to provide additional flexibility in design and operation of the MSF process throughout the day. A simple polynomial based dynamic seawater temperature and different freshwater demand correlations are developed based on actual data. For different number of flash stages, operating parameters such as seawater rejected flow rate and <b>brine</b> <b>recycle</b> flow rate are optimised, while the total annual operating cost of the MSF process is selected to minimise. The results clearly show that the advantage of using the intermediate storage tank adds flexible scheduling in the MSF plant design and operation parameters to meet the variation in freshwater demand with varying seawater temperatures without interrupting or fully shutting down the plant {{at any time during the}} day by adjusting the number of stages. Furthermore, the effect of non-condensable gases (NCG) on the steady state mathematical model of MSF process is developed and implemented in the MSF model developed earlier. Then the model is used to study effect of NCG on the overall heat transfer coefficient. The simulation results showed a decrease in the overall heat transfer coefficient values as NCG concentrations increased. The model is then used to study the effect of NCG on the design and operation parameters of MSF process for fixed water demand. For a given plant configuration (fixed design) and at different seawater and steam temperatures, a 0. 015 wt. ...|$|R
40|$|Among many {{seawater}} desalination processes, the multistage flash (MSF) desalination {{process is}} {{a major source of}} fresh water around the world. The most costly design and operation problem in seawater desalination is due to scale formation and corrosion problems. Fouling factor {{is one of the many}} important parameters that affect the operation of MSF processes. This thesis therefore focuses on determining the optimal design and operation strategy of MSF desalinations processes under fouling which will meet variable demand of freshwater. First, a steady state model of MSF is developed based on the basic laws of mass balance, energy balance, and heat transfer equations with supporting correlations for physical properties. gPROMS software is used to develop the model which is validated against the results reported in the literature. The model is then used in further investigations. Based on actual plant data, a simple dynamic fouling factor profile is developed which allows calculation of fouling factor at different time (season of the year). The role of changing brine heater fouling factor with varying seawater temperatures (during the year) on the plant performance and the monthly operating costs for fixed water demand and fixed top brine temperature are then studied. The total monthly operation cost of the process are minimised while the operating parameters such as make up, <b>brine</b> <b>recycle</b> flow rate and steam temperature are optimised. It was found that the seasonal variation in seawater temperature and brine heater fouling factor results in significant variations in the operating parameters and operating costs. The design and operation of the MSF process are optimized in order to meet variable demands of freshwater with changing seawater temperature throughout the day and throughout the year. On the basis of actual data, the neural network (NN) technique has been used to develop a correlation for calculating dynamic freshwater demand/consumption profiles at different times of the day and season. Also, a simple polynomial based dynamic seawater temperature correlation is developed based on actual data. An intermediate storage tank between the plant and the client is considered. The MSF process model developed earlier is coupled with the dynamic model for the storage tank and is incorporated into the optimization framework within gPROMS. Four main seasons are considered in a year and for each season, with variable freshwater demand and seawater temperature, the operating parameters are optimized at discrete time intervals, while minimizing the total daily costs. The intermediate storage tank adds flexible scheduling and maintenance opportunity of individual flash stages and makes it possible to meet variable freshwater demand with varying seawater temperatures without interrupting or fully shutting down the plant at any-time during the day and for any season. Finally, the purity of freshwater coming from MSF desalination plants is very important when the water is used for industrial services such as feed of boiler to produce steam. In this work, for fixed water demand and top brine temperature, the effect of separation efficiency of demister with seasonal variation of seawater temperatures on the final purity of freshwater for both cleaned and fouled demister conditions is studied. It was found that the purity of freshwater is affected by the total number of stages. Also to maintain the purity of freshwater product, comparatively large number of flash stage is required for fouled demister...|$|R
