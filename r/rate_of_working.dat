5000|$|Welfare state generosityCross-national {{studies are}} in {{agreement}} {{that the most important}} factor affecting working poverty rates is welfare state generosity. A generous welfare state spends a higher proportion of its GDP on things like unemployment insurance, social security, family assistance, childcare subsidies, healthcare subsidies, housing subsidies, transportation subsidies, and food subsidies. Studies on working poverty have found that these kinds of government spending can pull a significant number of people out of poverty, even if they earn low wages. Lohmann's 2009 study shows that welfare state generosity has {{a significant impact on the}} [...] "post-transfer" [...] <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> poverty. [...] The [...] "post-transfer" [...] <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> poverty is the percentage of working households that fall below the poverty threshold after government aid has been taken into account.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the service}} sector has the highest <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> poverty, a {{significant}} portion of the working poor are blue-collar workers in the manufacturing, agriculture, and construction industries. Most manufacturing jobs used to offer generous wages and benefits, but manufacturing job quality has declined over the years. Nowadays, many US manufacturing jobs are located in right-to-work states, where it is nearly impossible for workers to form a union. This means that manufacturing employers are able to pay lower wages and offer fewer benefits than they used to.|$|E

On the other hand, many liberals argue that working poverty can only be solved through increased, not decreased, government intervention.

Furthermore, women working in large private sector firms, who enjoy stronger employment protection, have a higher probability of having a child than those working in smaller firms. In turn, more-stable contracts also increase the likelihood of having a child during a working spell.

5000|$|Households {{with two}} wage-earners have a {{significantly}} lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> poverty than households {{with only one}} wage-earner. Also, households with two adults, but only one wage-earner, have lower working poverty rates than households with only one adult. Therefore, {{it seems clear that}} having two adults in a household, especially if there are children present, is more likely to keep a household out of poverty than having just one adult in a household. Many scholars and policymakers have used this fact to argue that encouraging people to get married and stay married is an effective way to reduce working poverty (and poverty in general). However, this is easier said than done. Research has shown that low-income people marry less often than higher-income people because they have a more difficult time finding a partner who is employed, which is often seen as a prerequisite for marriage. [...] Therefore, unless the employment opportunity structure is improved, simply increasing the number of marriages among low-income people would be unlikely to lower working poverty rates.|$|E

40|$|Taylor's {{swimming}} sheet is {{a classical}} model of microscale propulsion and pumping. Many biological fluids and substances are fibrous, having a preferred direction in their microstructure; for example cervical mucus is formed of polymer molecules which create an oriented fibrous network. Moreover, suspensions of elongated motile cells produce {{a form of}} active oriented matter. To understand how these effects modify viscous propulsion, we extend Taylor's classical model of small-amplitude zero-Reynolds-number propulsion of a 'swimming sheet' via the transversely-isotropic fluid model of Ericksen, which is linear in strain rate and possesses a distinguished direction. The energetic costs of swimming are significantly altered by all rheological parameters and the initial fibre angle. Propulsion in a passive transversely-isotropic fluid produces an enhanced mean <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>working,</b> independent of the initial fibre orientation, with an approximately linear dependence of energetic cost on the extensional and shear enhancements to the viscosity caused by fibres. In this regime the mean swimming velocity is unchanged from the Newtonian case. The effect of the constant term in Ericksen's model for the stress, which can be identified as a fibre tension or alternatively a stresslet characterising an active fluid, is also considered. This stress introduces an angular dependence and dramatically changes the streamlines and flow field; fibres aligned with the swimming direction increase the energetic demands of the sheet. The constant fibre stress {{may result in a}} reversal of the mean swimming velocity and a negative mean <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> if sufficiently large relative to the other rheological parameters.
