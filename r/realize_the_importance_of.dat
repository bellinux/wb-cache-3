25|$|The {{strictly}} defined netchain analysis {{could not}} become {{popular in the}} field of supply chain management. After its introduction the netchain concept was widely used in the agribusiness sector. Nevertheless, the perspective of network science and network analysis is used more and more generally to examine supply chains/networks. First of all, as information technology develops communication becomes easier. Second, more and more companies start to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> collaboration with firms operating in the same environment. This change provides an opportunity for supply chain analysis to integrate the knowledge and tools of network science.|$|E

25|$|UPS had seriously {{underestimated the}} union's {{capacity}} {{to wage a}} strike. Most importantly, UPS officials simply did not believe a strike would occur. But company officials also did not <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the union's early mobilization efforts, believed the union was too divided between the Carey and Hoffa camps to wage an effective strike, and believed thousands of Teamsters would cross the picket line to return to work. As the strike began, many UPS executives felt they could pressure Carey into offering the company's final offer to the Teamster membership and that the members would accept this offer.|$|E
25|$|Ilia's main {{political}} and social goals were based on Georgian patriotism. He radically advocated {{the revival of the}} use of the Georgian language, the cultivation of Georgian literature, the revival of autocephalous status for the Georgian national church, and, finally, the revival of Georgian statehood, which had ended when the country became part of the Russian Empire. As the number of supporters for his ideas grew, so did opposition among the leading Social Democrats like the Menshevik Noe Zhordania; their main aims were focused on battling the Tsarist autocracy and a democratic transformation of the Russian empire. This did not include the revival of a Georgian state or of a Georgian self-identity. Ilia was viewed as bourgeois and as an old aristocrat who failed to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the revolutionary tide.|$|E
25|$|Dezong {{began his}} reign by issuing {{a variety of}} edicts restricting {{wasteful}} government spending. Monetary contribution from local government officials or abroad were discouraged or limited. He also issued edicts that freed hundreds of palace girls {{in order to reduce}} palace expenses. These acts were all met with praise however they only lasted {{the first few years of}} his reign. A series of unfortunate events which included revolts by military governors forced Dezong to flee Chang'an in 784. During the months in exile, Dezong began to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> creating wealth and as a result, after Dezong's returned to Chang'an he began to reversed many of the original edicts he set forth. With the aid of eunuchs, Dezong started to amalgamate a large fortune either by extortion or bribery. These in turn led to a negative atmosphere where wealth rather than merit would ultimately bring one power.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{appreciated}} Hammond's {{closeness to}} the SG-1 team and {{his willingness to}} compromise. At {{the beginning of the}} series, Hammond does not accept the alien warrior Teal'c but comes to trust and respect him after realizing Teal'c's devotion to the Stargate Program. Despite his admiration for Dr. Daniel Jackson's enthusiasm in the beginning, Hammond has a hard time understanding Daniel's unorthodox and non-military approach to problems until Hammond comes to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> a civilian viewpoint to SG-1's mission. When the alien Jonas Quinn joins SG-1 in season 6, Davis compared Hammond's response to Jonas to his reaction to Teal'c in season 1. Although Hammond does not blame Jonas for Daniel's death in [...] "Meridian", [...] "the situation does make it difficult for [...] to totally take the young man under his wing and embrace him like family as he has the rest of SG-1". Davis named the NID as Hammond's only source of frustration, since they regularly outflank Hammond and SG-1. Hammond's only option is to call the President for support, but most cases end with SG-1 or Hammond breaking the rules to assure the survival of humanity, so [...] "Hammond will do whatever he must to get things done".|$|E
500|$|The The Moving Picture World {{reviewer}} {{found the}} subject to be too long, but did not find {{it to be a}} fault. The reviewer states, [...] "A domestic comedy with a different flavor. In fact, with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook, the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring, neither one knowing that the others have done likewise. The humor in this piece centers around this pie. What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination. Imagine eight people, not to speak of the cat, getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week. Licensed as well as Independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the scenario end of matters. The mince pie episode was well done, which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News was not amused by the plot and stated, [...] "To me the last scene had no humor. It was only the necessary ending to the beginning. True humor does not emanate from cognac." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "This is the old story of too many cooks, and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way. The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation. ... A weak point in the story {{is the fact that the}} pie is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power. Two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing. The character parts are all well taken, although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the Revolutionary War, British forces {{occupied}} the Champlain Valley. [...] However, it did not take long for rebel leaders to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> controlling Lake Champlain. Early in the war, the colonial militias attempted to expel the British from Boston; however, this undertaking could not be achieved without heavy artillery. [...] The British forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, on Lake Champlain, were known to have ample supplies of artillery and were weakly manned by the British. Thus, the colonial militias devised a plan {{to take control of the}} two forts and bring the guns back to the fight in Boston.|$|E

[...] In his famous series of lectures Talks to Teachers on Psychology, published in 1899 and now regarded as the first educational psychology textbook, James defines education as [...] "the organization of acquired habits of conduct and tendencies to behavior". [...] He states that teachers should [...] "train the pupil to behavior" [...] so that he fits into the social and physical world. Teachers should also <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> habit and instinct. They should present information that is clear and interesting and relate this new information and material to things the student already knows about. He also addresses important issues such as attention, memory, and association of ideas.|$|E
2500|$|The Anthropological Research Facility, {{the first}} body farm created, {{was founded by}} Bass to {{generate}} information about what a corpse experiences when exposed to various experimental conditions. On this farm, human corpses yield to the elements of nature in many re-enacted scenes such as a car accident unseen for days, or a murder victim buried in a shallow grave. Prior {{to the creation of}} this institution, no advances had been made in the study of long-term body decomposition since the days of Song Ci's in 13th century China. Many advances have been made about how to determine postmortem interval due to the Body Farm. During the 1970s, donated and unclaimed bodies were macerated at an abandoned farm owned by the university. [...] During the early 1980s, the [...] "body farm" [...] began with one body, a small plot of land, and a novel idea. By that time, Bass had been in the position of head of the anthropology department at the University of Tennessee for a little over a decade, and had been appointed as the first state forensic anthropologist of Tennessee. As the state's forensic anthropologist, Bass was the official called on to determine cause and time of death. This first body was part of an actual crime investigation in which Bass was needed to determine cause of death, and it was instrumental in helping [...] Bass <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> needing a place to study and observe postmortem events.|$|E
