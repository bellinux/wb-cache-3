This includes operation of a monitored retrievable storage facility, the Central Interim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel at Oskarshamn, about 150 miles south of Stockholm on the Baltic coast; transportation of spent fuel; and construction of a permanent repository. Swedish utilities store spent fuel at the <b>reactor</b> <b>site</b> for one year before transporting it to the facility at Oskarshamn, {{where it will be}} stored in excavated caverns filled with water for about 30 years before removal to a permanent repository.|$|E

25|$|The President was {{required}} to review site recommendations and submit to Congress by March 31, 1987 his recommendation of one site for the first repository, and by March 31, 1990, his recommendation for a second repository. The amount of high-level waste or spent fuel that could {{be placed in the}} first repository was limited to the equivalent of 70,000 metric tons of heavy metal until a second repository was built. The Act required the national government to take ownership of all nuclear waste or spent fuel at the <b>reactor</b> <b>site,</b> transport it to the repository, and thereafter be responsible for its containment.|$|E

500|$|Although Martin Marietta {{completed}} its AEC contract and its lease expired on December 21, 1966, {{it had to}} stay at the <b>reactor</b> <b>site</b> [...] "until radiation contamination was brought to acceptable levels". Martin Marietta partially decontaminated the site, and in April 1967 undertook a joint radiological survey with Penn State and the AEC. The survey found [...] "licensable [...] quantities of strontium-90 stayed behind as structural contamination and residual radioactivity in piping and tanks, estimated at about 0.2 curies". This met the standards for that day, although Penn State did raise questions about the contamination remaining. Strontium is chemically very similar to calcium (both are alkaline earth metals) and can be absorbed by the body, where it is chiefly incorporated into bones. Strontium-90 decays by beta decay and has a half-life of 29 years; when it is in the body, its radioactivity can lead to bone cancer and leukemia.|$|E
500|$|The cleanup {{was thought}} finished, so a final survey {{was done in}} December 2004, and a Final Status Survey Report was filed in February 2005. However, when the NRC and {{scientists}} from the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education surveyed the facility in May 2005, they found many areas of contamination above the legal limits. According to the NRC's Quehanna Site Status Summary, strontium-90 had contaminated the [...] "buildings as well as ... surface and subsurface soil" [...] but was not in groundwater. More cleanup work {{was done in the}} summer of 2005, but the site still did not meet NRC regulations. DEP concluded that [...] "some type of migration of radioactive material [...] taking place in the concrete at the facility", and changed its disposal plan. The new plan called for demolition of the building without completing decontamination, and disposal of the above ground material in a regular landfill. This plan was approved by the NRC in October 2006, and a December 2006 survey showed [...] "that the above grade structure met the release limits" [...] of the disposal plan. The former reactor structure was demolished, and on May 13, 2009 the NRC released the state from its license for the site. As of 2011, a small octagonal [...] "restricted area" [...] around the <b>reactor</b> <b>site</b> is still shown on official DCNR maps.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distance}} between Israeli military bases and the <b>reactor</b> <b>site</b> was significant—over [...] The Israeli planes {{would have to}} violate Jordanian and/or Saudi airspace in a covert flight over foreign territory, making mid-air refueling unfeasible.

2500|$|Prime Minister Begin {{defended the}} timing of the bombing stating that a later attack, after the reactor had become operational, could cause lethal {{radioactive}} contamination doses to reach all the way to Baghdad. An analysis by Warren Donnelly of the United States Congressional Research Service concluded that [...] "it would be most unlikely for an attack with conventional bombs upon the reactor when operating to have caused lethal exposures to radioactivity in Baghdad, although some people at the <b>reactor</b> <b>site</b> might receive some exposure". This was similarly the conclusion of Herbert Goldstein of Columbia University using IAEA release factors, the lethal contamination would be confined to a close proximity to the reactor and small amounts of radiation would be detectable in Baghdad under the assumption that winds were blowing in that direction.|$|E
2500|$|Small {{traces of}} {{plutonium}} {{have been found}} in the soil near the stricken reactors: repeated examinations of the soil suggest that the plutonium level is similar to the background level caused by atomic bomb tests. As the isotope signature of the plutonium is closer to that of power-reactor plutonium, TEPCO suggested that [...] "two samples out of five may be the direct result of the recent incident." [...] The more important thing to look at is the curium level in the soil; the soil does contain a short-lived isotope (curium-242) which shows that some alpha emitters have been released in small amounts by the accident. The release of the beta/gamma emitters such as caesium-137 has been far greater. In the short and medium term the effects of the iodine and the caesium release will dominate the effect of the accident on farming and the general public. In common with almost all soils, the soil at the <b>reactor</b> <b>site</b> contains uranium, but the concentration of uranium and the isotope signature suggests that the uranium is the normal, natural uranium in the soil.|$|E

Among the elements contained in {{this strategy is}} an initial focus on accepting used nuclear fuel from shutdown <b>reactor</b> <b>sites.</b> This focus {{is consistent with the}} recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, which identified removal of stranded used nuclear fuel at shutdown sites as a priority so that these sites may be completely decommissioned and put to other beneficial uses (BRC 2012). Shutdown sites are defined as those commercial nuclear power <b>reactor</b> <b>sites</b> where the nuclear power reactors have been shut down and the site has been decommissioned or is undergoing decommissioning. In this report, a preliminary evaluation of removing used nuclear fuel from 12 shutdown sites was conducted.
