Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 52). A band plan is a plan for utilizing a particular band of radio frequencies that are {{a portion of the}} electromagnetic spectrum. Each band plan defines the frequency range to be included, how channels are to be defined, and what will be carried on those channels. An Amateur Radio Band Plan is an arrangement of how to use radio frequencies. Amateur <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>allocation</b> is done by national telecommunications authorities, in our case, it should have been done by Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. Globally, the ITU oversees how much radio spectrum is set aside for amateur radio transmissions. In 2001 the National Frequency Allocation Plan was made and adopted in 2004 by BTRC. The commission allocated HF and VHF, UHF frequency range for HAM, but merely specified any details. Radio amateurs use a variety of transmission modes, including Morse code, radioteletype, data, and voice. Specific frequency allocations are a matter of record and vary from country to country and between ITU regions as specified in the current ITU HF frequency allocations for amateur radio. In our thesis we are aiming {{to come up with the}} band plan for amateur radio in Bangladesh. The proposal contains the distribution of amateur frequency to set the first such footing towards an effective utilization of the allocated frequencies. The proposed band plan is in accordance with the National Frequency Allocation Plan (NFAP) of Bangladesh, compatible with International Amateur Radio Union Region 3 (IARU R 3) countries and it is done after taking consideration of our technology and resource.

However, rapid technological change, ever increasing demands for new wireless services and the nature of spectrum as a scarce resource necessitate an urgent re-examination of issues such as congestion and interference. This paper argues that the traditional administrative spectrum management approach is unlikely to overcome these issues, thereby resulting in growing technical and economic inefficiencies. As countries review their spectrum policies - a process that is generically referred to as radio spectrum policy reform - to counter these inefficiencies, modifications to the <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>allocations</b> and assignments are beginning to be implemented by way of radio spectrum re-farming?

Moreover, the results are extended to those on fractional distance chromatic parameters and on distance multi-colorings. Inspiration comes from <b>radio</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>allocation</b> problem. The basic idea is the observation that binary primitive narrow-sense BCH codes or their shortenings have size asymptotically within a constant factor below the largest possible size, A(n,d), among all binary codes of the same length, n, and the same minimum distance, d, as n→∞ while d is constant. Also a lower bound in terms of A(n,d) is obtained for B(n,d), the largest size among linear binary codes...|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} issues of imbalances in global communication had been discussed for some time. The American media scholar Wilbur Schramm noted in 1964 that {{the flow of}} news among nations is thin, that much attention is given to developed countries and little to less-developed ones, that important events are ignored and reality is distorted. From a more radical perspective, Herbert Schiller observed in 1969 that developing countries had little meaningful input into decisions about <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>allocations</b> for satellites at a key meeting in Geneva in 1963. Schiller pointed out that many satellites had military applications. Intelsat which was set up for international co-operation in satellite communication, was also dominated by the United States.

40|$|Abstract—Recently, a {{technique}} called beam-space MIMO has been demonstrated as an effective approach for transmitting multiple signals while using a single RF-chain. In this work, we present novel design considerations and a compact antenna solution to stimulate the deployment of beam-space MIMO in future wireless applications. Targeting integration in small wireless devices, the novel antenna is made of a single integrated radiator rather than an array of physically-separated dipoles. It also drastically simplifies the implementation of variable loads and DC bias circuits for BPSK modulated signals, and does not require any external reconfigurable matching circuit. Finally, we show that this antenna system could be reconfigured by dynamic adjustment of terminating loads to preserve its beam-space multiplexing capabilities over a 1 : 2 tuning range, thereby promoting the convergence of MIMO and dynamic spectrum allocation via reduced-complexity hardware. A prototype achieving single-RF-chain multiplexing at a fixed frequency is designed and measured, showing excellent agreement between simulations and measurements.

Several research efforts have increased telemetry efficiency by decreasing the amount of spectrum needed to transmit information. These techniques, promising a two to three fold increase, still can’t address the need for future wide-band telemetry, which is growing exponentially.
