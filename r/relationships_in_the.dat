5|$|Attachment {{theory was}} {{extended}} to adult romantic <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles of attachment {{have been identified in}} adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860–1948) {{published}} his book On Growth and Form. His description of phyllotaxis and the Fibonacci sequence, the mathematical <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of animal horns and mollusc shells.|$|E

40|$|Fail-stop {{failures}} in distributed environments are often tolerated by checkpointing or message logging. In this paper, {{we show that}} fail-stop process {{failures in}} ScaLAPACK matrix matrix multiplication kernel can be tolerated without checkpointing or message logging. It has been proved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous algorithm-based fault tolerance research that, for matrix-matrix multiplication, <b>the</b> checksum <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> input checksum matrices is preserved {{at the end of}} the computation no matter which algorithm is chosen. From this checksum <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final computation results, processor miscalculations can be detected, located, and corrected {{at the end of the}} computation. However, whether this checksum <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> input checksum matrices can be maintained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the computation or not remains open. In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for many matrix matrix multiplcation algorithms, <b>the</b> checksum <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> input checksum matrices is not maintained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the computation. We then prove that, however, for the outer product version matrix matrix multiplcation algorithm, <b>the</b> checksum <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> input checksum matrices can be maintained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the computation. Based on this checksum <b>relationship</b> maintained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the computation, we demonstrate that fail-stop process failures in ScaLAPACK matrix-matrix multiplcation can be tolerated without checkpointing or message logging. Because no periodical checkpointing is involved, the fault tolerance overhead for this approach is surprisingly low...|$|R
5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from}} the rest of the group. However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different methods of analysis are not always consistent and could not be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E
5|$|According to the backstory {{provided}} by the play, Sycorax, while pregnant with Caliban, was banished {{from her home in}} Algiers to the island on which the play takes place. Memories of Sycorax, who dies several years before the main action of the play begins, define several of the <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> play. Relying on his filial connection to Sycorax, Caliban claims ownership of the island. Prospero constantly reminds Ariel of Sycorax's cruel treatment to maintain the sprite's service.|$|E

The novel features Asian-Canadian characters in these lesbian relationships, incorporating racial and ethnic identity into a queer understanding of speculative fiction. Salt Fish Girl engages queer ideas in regards to procreation and bodies, as characters are able to give birth without sperm by eating the durian fruit. It was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. award in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Moondram Pirai {{depicts a}} young woman whose mental state regresses {{to that of a}} child {{following}} an accident. Sexuality and the repression of desire are dominant motifs, similar to Balu Mahendra's previous film Moodu Pani (1980). The film also explores the possibility of unresolved sexual tension between the protagonists. Critic K. Jeshi compares Moondram Pirai to other films based on physical and mental disabilities like Sethu... (1999), Pithamagan (2003), Perazhagan (2004), Chandramukhi (2005), Anniyan (2005) and Ghajini (2005). When asked about the reason amnesia was chosen for a disability, Mahendra said the disorder is used as a camouflage and as an excuse to portray <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E

5|$|The phylogenetic <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Sarcoscypha were {{analyzed}} by Francis Harrington in the late 1990s. The cladistic analysis combined comparison of sequences from the internal transcribed spacer in the non-functional RNA with fifteen traditional morphological characters, such as spore features, fruit body shape, and degree of hair curliness. Based on this analysis, S.dudleyi {{is part of a}} clade of evolutionarily related taxa that includes the species S.occidentalis, S.emarginata, S.hosoyae, S.korfiana and S.mesocyatha. All of these species contain large oil droplets in their spores, in contrast to the other major clade of Sarcoscypha (containing the type species S.coccinea), characterized by having smaller, more numerous droplets.|$|E

5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation. This could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, {{although there was no}} divorce as such. After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second degree of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery or desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, where divorce necessitated and act of parliament, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E
5|$|Building {{structure}} of Lam Tin Estate's blocks is standardised by the government. As types 3, 4 and 6 buildings, the 23 towers of Lam Tin Estate were shaped as cuboids and resembled candy-boxes {{standing on a}} knoll. Most buildings were 16-storeys high and housed about 800 units. Each building had an estimated capacity of 3,000 residents and an approximate space allocation at 30ft² per person. Bathrooms and kitchens were combined into one compartment, as were living rooms and bedrooms. Lifts only reached some of the floors. To access the other floors, one needed to exit the lift at a level nearby and hike upstairs or downstairs. On the ground floor beneath the buildings were a variety of shops which served the residents. Although densely packed, the living environment of Lam Tin Estate fostered close <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighbourhood.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer <b>relationships.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children {{were significantly more likely}} to exhibit poor peer relationships.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} Otto von Bismarck—Minister President of Prussia—had {{a master plan}} to expand the North German Confederation of 1866 to include the {{remaining}} independent German states into a single entity or simply to expand {{the power of the}} Kingdom of Prussia. They conclude that factors in addition to the strength of Bismarck's Realpolitik led a collection of early modern polities to reorganize political, economic, military, and diplomatic <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. Reaction to Danish and French nationalism provided foci for expressions of German unity. Military successes—especially those of Prussia—in three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride that politicians could harness to promote unification. This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars, particularly in the War of Liberation of 1813–14. By establishing a Germany without Austria, the political and administrative unification in 1871 at least temporarily solved the problem of dualism.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the book, the memoir exhibits Bruce Bechdel's obsession with restoring the family's Victorian home. His obsessive need to restore the house is connected to his emotional distance from his family, which he expressed in coldness and occasional bouts of abusive rage. This emotional distance, in turn, is connected with his being a closeted homosexual. Bruce Bechdel had homosexual <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military and with his high school students; some of those students were also family friends and babysitters. At the age of 44, two weeks after his wife requested a divorce, he stepped into the path of an oncoming Sunbeam Bread truck and was killed. Although the evidence is equivocal, Alison Bechdel concludes that her father committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 1943, Kinkaid became Commander of the North Pacific Force (COMNORPACFOR) {{following}} {{the failure of}} his predecessor, Rear Admiral Robert A. Theobald, to work harmoniously with the U.S. Army. Command <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Pacific were complicated. Naval forces came under Fletcher's Northwestern Sea Frontier. The troops in Alaska, including Brigadier General William O. Butler's Eleventh Air Force, were commanded by Major General Simon B. Buckner, Jr., who was answerable {{to the head of}} the Western Defense Command, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt. Kinkaid's command was responsible for coordinating these forces and retaking the Aleutian Islands captured by the Japanese. He found the Army eager to cooperate, but encountered more difficulty with Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell, the commander of the Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, and later the IX Amphibious Force. Rockwell was an Academy classmate of Kinkaid's, who was senior to him in rank, and convinced that he would both plan and command the amphibious phase of the operation rather than Kinkaid.|$|E
