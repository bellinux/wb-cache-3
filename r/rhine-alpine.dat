40|$|New {{scenarios}} arose {{with the}} development of high speed rail (HSR) services: their shorter travel times make them competitive against the car on short distances and the aeroplane on medium to long distances. HSR integration is best realised if a hierarchical system is conceived whereby cities not served by HSR lines are well connected by rail [Chen and Hall (J Transp Geogr 19 : 689 - 704, 2011) ]. Such integration among the different railway services, e. g. HSR, long distance and regional trains, and freight, plays a crucial role in being {{able to take advantage of}} these new opportunities. Moreover, the integration with interregional and local services would help provide better regional accessibility to HSR, allowing people living in the hinterland along the corridor to travel easily between regions. Better use of existing tracks will also contribute to avoiding or alleviating the saturation of the lines, thus allowing railways to achieve a better level of service without large new infrastructural projects. This chapter focuses on the current provision of high speed and long distance services along the <b>Rhine-Alpine</b> Corridor and presents a new methodology developed to assess their integration. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Their increasing size and number can however also {{pose a threat to}} quality of life in adjacent urban regions, for spatial conflicts between port and urban functions may arise. Therefore, inland port governance strategies are needed. The aim {{of this paper is to}} reflect on the findings of an international comparison of municipal governance strategies for inland port development in four different countries along the <b>Rhine–Alpine</b> Corridor. Our findings reflect the difficult position of inland ports relative to urban functions within a densely populated corridor. Sufficient capacity is needed to prevent the occurrence of bottlenecks on links and in nodes, which could limit flows on other parts of the corridor. Increasing inland port capacity should however also be aligned with policy measures in urban regions, to avoid the overlapping of inland port and urban functions which could lead to mutually exclusive land-uses. This poses challenges in terms of inland port governance. We observe that cases in which the port and urban administrations open up the policy process to relevant private stakeholders and the civil society, integrated governance strategies for inland port development are more likely to emerge...|$|E
40|$|In {{a context}} of {{increasing}} global freight transportation and transnational corridor development, inland ports are becoming more important in enhancing hinterland accessibility of deep-sea ports. At the same time, however, when considering the ‘weakest link’ principle, the increasing reliance on inland hubs can also {{pose a threat to}} efficient transnational corridor development, especially in relation to adjacent urban regions. Port literature pays limited but growing attention to the conflicting port and urban functions in inland ports. The aim of this paper is therefore to reflect on the findings of a cross-national comparison of governance strategies for inland port development in four different countries along the CEF <b>Rhine-Alpine</b> Corridor (Rotterdam-Genoa). Our findings reflect the difficult position of inland ports within a densely populated corridor. On the one hand, sufficient capacity is needed to prevent the occurrence of bottlenecks, which could threaten flows on other parts of the corridor. On the other hand, increasing port capacity should be aligned with policy measures on the level of the urban region, to avoid the overlapping of port and urban functions, which could lead to conflicts with respect to land-use, economic development and quality of life. This poses challenges in terms of port governance. We observe that cases in which the port and urban administrations open up the policy process to other private stakeholders and the public, common governance strategies for inland port development are more likely to occur...|$|E
