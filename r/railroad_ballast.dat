40|$|<b>Ballasted</b> <b>railroads</b> are {{designed}} to provide high speed commuter and heavy haul transportation. Ballast is one of most important load bearing components of the track substructure. However, it often experiences excessive settlement, lateral deformation and particle breakage when subjected to large dynamic (cyclic and impact) stresses. In addition, tracks constructed along coastal areas often undergo large settlements over soft compressible estuarine deposits, leading to frequent and costly track maintenance. The use of artificial inclusions such as geogrids, geocomposites, shock-mats (rubber) and prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) are attractive options to maintain the vertical and horizontal alignment of tracks and to curtail excessive maintenance costs.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>ballasted</b> <b>railroads</b> form an {{integral}} part of the modern transportation infrastructure in Australia. However, they are subjected to large stresses especially on mixed traffic lines, where heavy freight trains are operated. Under such adverse operational conditions, ballast progressively degrades contributing to overall track deformations and frequent maintenance. Maintaining geometry of ballast embankments is necessary to improve safety and efficiency of railway operations. The use of artificial inclusions (geosynthetics and shock mats) as well as recycled (discarded) ballast in track can be economically viable options. In order to gain more insight, the CGRE has conducted extensive field trials on two rail lines in Bulli and Singleton in New South Wales supported by Sydney Trains and Australian Rail Track Corporation, respectively. In these studies, different types of geosynthetics (geogrid, geotextile and geocomposite) and shock mats were installed beneath the ballast layer constructed on varying subgrade conditions. Relative advantages of different geogrids were studied. Traffic induced stresses, ballast breakage, transient and permanent deformations were routinely monitored using precise instrumentation schemes.

This research aims to investigate the angularity (shape) of ballast aggregates and the influence of particle size distribution on its deformation and degradation. To achieve this aim, a three-dimensional laser scanner and the triaxial apparatus designed and built at the University of Wollongong were used respectively to carry out a three dimensional characterisation of ballast aggregates and cyclic large-scale triaxial tests. The deformation and degradation of ballast under high and low track speeds was investigated by using two different loading frequencies, and then a fractional order constitutive model was proposed to predict the long term deformation of ballast by using the fractional rate for strain accumulation. These experiments indicated that shape of ballast particles varied according to their size, such that as the particles increased in size, ballast became more rounded and less columnar. Moreover, a two-dimensional characterisation would underestimate particle sphericity, so a new index called ‘ellipsoidness’ was suggested to facilitate a three dimensional analysis of particle shape. This ellipsoidness decreased as the particles increased in size, which indicated relatively more irregularity in coarser ballast. The parent ballast aggregates became increasingly regular after cyclic tests while smaller aggregates created from ballast degradation seemed to have a lower ellipsoidness...|$|R

40|$|The ballast layer {{serves as}} a major {{structural}} component in typical ballasted railroad track systems. When subjected to an external load, ballast particles present a complex mechanical response which {{is strongly dependent on}} particle to particle interactions within this discrete medium. One common test used to study the shear strength characteristics of <b>railroad</b> <b>ballast</b> is the Direct Shear Test (DST). However, it is often not feasible in standard geotechnical engineering laboratories to conduct direct shear tests on ballast particles due to significantly large specimen and test setup requirements. Even for the limited number of laboratories equipped to accommodate the testing of such large specimens, conducting repeated tests for parametric analysis of different test and specimen parameters on shear strength properties is often not feasible. Numerical modeling efforts are therefore commonly used for such parametric analyses.

40|$|AbstractRailway ballast is {{a highly}} heterogonous {{material}} consisting of a multitude of stone sizes with varying physical characteristics. It is a critical layer of railroad track structures providing drainage, strength, stability and load distribution. Ballast degrades under cyclic train loads {{and needs to be}} maintained to prevent rail misalignment, settlement and buckling, which may necessitate lower train speeds to prevent derailments. This paper utilizes the Discrete Element Method (DEM) code PFC 2 D to model the behaviour of <b>railroad</b> <b>ballast</b> under cyclic loading. It introduces two innovative approaches to capture stone angularity by fitting circular shapes into each stone shape. One of these methods involves a MATLAB® routine and the other an AutoCAD® routine. Inter-particle contact laws in these agglomerations of circular elements reflect the strength of the stones. The advantage of these two techniques over the conventional clumping technique is that they allow modelling stone breakage which is a leading cause of ballast degradation. Previous studies have implemented techniques to simulate the behaviour of a circular particle idealized as a single aggregate under cyclic loads. Three different techniques are presented in this study to better understand the natural behaviour of ballast under loading. In this paper, particle angularity is being introduced by using another method.
