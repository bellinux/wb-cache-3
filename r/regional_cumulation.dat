40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{the issue of}} whether Bangladesh should take {{advantage}} of the EU-GSP under the <b>regional</b> <b>cumulation</b> (RC) facilities has emerged as a highly contentious one. The interests of the influential export-oriented RMG sector and the emerging textile industries appear to be in direct and immediate conflict over this particular policy choice. Since the matter is related to the strategic interest of the countryâ€™s apparel exports in the medium and long-term, it calls for a close scrutiny. The paper candidly has done this scrutiny. <b>Regional</b> <b>Cumulation,</b> Trade and Globalisation, EC-GSP, RMG, Readymade Garment, Bangladesh...|$|E
40|$|European {{economic}} integration fascinates and inspires {{for the way}} it brought peace to a continent torn by violent and long-standing rivalries. The lessons from Europe, however, cannot be applied directly as the degree of the European Union's supranationality is unthinkable elsewhere. This paper discusses how Europe overcame the specific problem of overlapping free trade agreements (FTAs) with the Pan-European Cumulation System which instituted common rules of origin, <b>regional</b> <b>cumulation</b> of value, and completed the full matrix of bilateral FTAs. After this, Europe had what {{can be thought of}} as a "customs union" for rules of origin...|$|E
40|$|Two mega-regional {{negotiations}} {{are changing the}} landscape of Asia Pacific trade policy: an Asian track centered on ASEAN (the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP), and a Trans-Pacific track centered on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) among 12 economies, including the United States, which Korea is expected to join. Modeling results suggest that both would generate substantial benefits for Korea and the global economy. From Korea's viewpoint, the agreements would establish new FTAs with China, Japan and smaller economies, improve the utilization of FTAs by permitting the <b>regional</b> <b>cumulation</b> of inputs, and help to upgrade some Korean FTAs to more rigorous standards. By participating in these agreements, Korea could also help to guide them toward inclusive, high-quality regional outcomes. As one of the region's most open and agile economies, Korea has a large stake in regional integration and would {{be well advised to}} pursue both tracks...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a description of}} what Rules of Origin are, its economic effects, the main RoO types and the options for adding leniency to these rules by means of using the diagonal cumulation. Nowadays, cumulation of origin is studied in different trade agreements models in the Americas {{and the use of}} this practice among FTAs families of one or another style is imminent. According to evidence provided by several papers (Cornejo and Harris, 2007; Gasiorek, 2007; and Estavadeordal and Suominem, 2008), we estimate that taking measures for adding leniency to RoO structures will make it more attractive for regional firms to import from within the region. Finally, more flexible rules of origin will make the region more attractive to foreign investors and, as a consequence, will foster investment flows from abroad. We consider that South American countries have now an opportunity to define a strategy for cumulating origin norms among them. Therefore, it is necessary to negotiate the implementation of a single RoO regime for the region. In this negotiation we think MERCOSUR would be the leading PTA, {{due to the fact that}} it is the main player in the region.
