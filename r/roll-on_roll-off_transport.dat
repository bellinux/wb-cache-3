40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is that of {{analysing}} the available sources of information for the Italian roll‐on roll‐off and underlining {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of this data. As a matter of fact in the Short Sea Shipping the <b>roll‐on</b> <b>roll‐off</b> <b>transport</b> represents an important leg of the intermodal maritime combined transport. For this reason and considering the accessibility to the data made possible by the Information Communication Technologies, the analysis of this mode of transport should be simple, yet in reality it is not so. Actually the chosen sector does not always register the availability and quality of information that is present for other types of transport (such as container lift‐on lift‐off or cruises). Even though the <b>roll‐on</b> <b>roll‐off</b> <b>transport</b> is the core of the Motorways of the Sea, the historical series for the Italian market that can be consulted often present a certain amount of gaps. In fact, if on the one hand the official statistics published periodically by the Port Authorities contain information on the volume of annually handled goods, on the other, this same elaborations are not always comprehensive (especially in less structured ports) on the most significant features of the traffic flows, such as the origin and destination of the maritime relations. To solve this problem, it is possible to use some analysis carried out at central level (by the Italian Institute of Statistics and Eurostat) that could be useful to overcome the existing gaps, yet the chosen measure units differ from that of the Port Authorities. Here lies the main difficulty of reaching a sufficiently detailed description of the market that should support the choices of the operators but in particular the formulation of actions aimed at fostering modal shift from road to sea. The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 concerns the introduction and methodological aspects; Section 2 addresses the Italian scenario and defines the sample (most important ports regarding Italian roll-on roll‐off market); Section 3 Takes into account the main relations of Short Sea Shipping and it focuses the analysis on some features of the traffic flows in the chosen ports. Section 4 contains some final considerations regarding the exploitation of the sources of information and the improvement of the roadsea combined transport's appeal...|$|E

40|$|<b>Roll-on</b> <b>Roll-off</b> {{shipping}} companies <b>transport</b> rolling cargo, such as cars, trucks and large construction machines. When sailing, {{this type of}} cargo must {{be attached to the}} deck using chains, to prevent damaging the cargo. For each voyage including multiple port calls where the cargo is loaded/unloaded, an important decision is to decide where to place each vehicle (or unit), such that the time used on shifting is minimized. Shifting means temporarily moving some vehicles to make an entry/exit route for the vehicles that are to be loaded/unloaded at a given port. As the vehicles are securely fastened to the deck, shifting is a time-consuming procedure. We present the stowage plan evaluation problem which is to determine the optimal vehicles to shift at each port call, such that the time spent on shifting is minimized. Given a set of alternative stowage plans for a voyage, the results from the stowage plan evaluation problems are used to determine the best among these stowage plans. We present a shortest path based heuristic for solving the problem. Computational results show that the solution method is a powerful tool for comparing stowage plans, due to its fast computing times and high success rate, i. e. its ability to determine the better of two stowage plans...|$|R

In this paper a complete taxonomy of the disturbances affecting the operational processes in a <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> terminal is introduced together with a system able to assess the performance of any measure used to mitigate them. The study is based on an overview of the existing literature on the topic, a detailed diagram of the operational processes of the terminal, and an exhaustive set of interviews of the staff involved in the processes occurring in a <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> terminal, together with field measurements.
