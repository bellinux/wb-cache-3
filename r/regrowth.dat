5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with <b>regrowth</b> of bone tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone <b>regrowth</b> into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone <b>regrowth</b> maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. <b>Regrowth</b> usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E
5|$|A {{trial in}} Western Australia showed Banksia marginata to be mildly {{sensitive}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. At Brisbane Ranges National Park west of Melbourne, which was invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1970s, Banksia marginata (along with such species as Grevillea steiglitziana) {{was part of}} a secondary <b>regrowth</b> of understory species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{research}} {{is the ability of}} starfish to regenerate lost body parts. The stem cells of adult humans are incapable of much differentiation and understanding the <b>regrowth,</b> repair and cloning processes in starfish may have implications for human medicine.|$|E
5|$|Flame robins {{often become}} more {{abundant}} in areas recently burnt by bushfires, but move away once the undergrowth regrows. They may also move into logged or cleared areas in forests. However, a field {{study in the}} Boola Boola State Forest in central Gippsland revealed they are not found {{in areas where the}} <b>regrowth</b> after logging is dense.|$|E
5|$|As {{oil prices}} rose during the 1990s, Fairbanks' economy improved. The city was also boosted by the <b>regrowth</b> of gold mining in the area. The Fort Knox Gold Mine north of Fairbanks opened in 1997 {{after several years}} of development, and another gold {{prospect}} is likely to be developed in the next decade. The same year that Fort Knox Mine opened, Alyeska moved 300 jobs from Anchorage to Fairbanks, making the city the base of its operations {{for the first time in}} several decades.|$|E
5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest dieback. In some areas, {{especially in the}} peripheral region, this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as {{the main cause of}} dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent. <b>Regrowth</b> of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the most affected. A study has suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the dieback. Leaching of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the dieback.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years of age in that they are able to resprout afterwards. <b>Regrowth</b> is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) to withstand a high intensity fire.|$|E
5|$|Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via {{mechanical}} means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably {{followed by}} sowing of native plants. Animals rarely graze {{it because of}} its irritating hairs, and liquid herbicides require surfactants to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the lotus effect. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy. G. tetrum and Cucullia verbasci usually have little effect on V.thapsus populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein. Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include glyphosate, triclopyr and sulfurometuron-methyl. Ground herbicides, like tebuthiuron, are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent <b>regrowth.</b>|$|E
5|$|In North America, C.violaceus favours conifers, and, though rare {{over much}} of the continent, is {{relatively}} common in certain areas, including Mount Rainier National Park and Olympic National Park. It is more common in old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, though has sprung up in <b>regrowth</b> areas populated with fir, pine, aspen and alder in the Great Lakes region. Fruit bodies occur singly or in small groups, often near rotting wood, and can grow in fairy rings. Closely related species that look like C.violaceus can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates in the park, and {{two to four}} females have cubs {{in the park and}} the {{landscape}} protection area each year. Bears can also be found in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, stoat, least weasel, American mink and European pine marten. The population of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the <b>regrowth</b> of trees. Norway lemming and wood lemming are uncommon; Eurasian lynx sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. Reindeer husbandry is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. Raccoon dog is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{officials}} in Réunion declared a disaster {{area for the}} island. The government started an emergency relief fund to provide assistance to the affected families. The European Economic Community donated ₣1.42million francs ($222,000 1989USD) due to the storm. Residents on the island assisted each other by providing lodging and donating clothing. France sent 15,000ration kits, 1,500beds and blankets, and 20cisterns to the island {{in the aftermath of}} Firinga. In addition, 400troops and 50vehicles were dispatched from an insular military base in order to assist the affected populations. Within two days, crews in Réunion restored water access to about 20,000people. Conditions returned to normal in northern Réunion within about a day. In the southern portion, however, it took up to four weeks for life to return to normal. The significant amount of flooding damaged the coral reef system due to excessive runoff. Due to dead animals being washed into the ocean, diving at the reefs was banned for several weeks. The waves had damaged the coral reef system to such extent that there was no <b>regrowth</b> after seven years.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>regrowth</b> of {{pine trees}} after {{disturbance}} like clearcutting or wildfire, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species {{is replaced by}} another. A study on the ecological succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian jack pine forests following wildfire concluded that S.brevipes is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout {{the life of the}} tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the forest canopy. Generally, S.brevipes responds favorably to silvicultural practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by the fungus may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable {{for a period of time}} following disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Hartebeest are {{primarily}} grazers, and their diets consist mostly of grasses. A {{study in the}} Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods. The hartebeest has much lower food intake than {{the other members of}} Alcelaphini. The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses. These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a difficult period for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the roan antelope, the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce <b>regrowth</b> of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii fruits singly or {{in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} grass or among leaf litter. It is {{typically}} found in eucalypt forest and subtropical rainforests. It has been recorded from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. In southwest Australia it is found in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forests, where fruiting usually occurs in late autumn and early winter. The fungus appears to prefer disturbed ground, as it is often found at roadsides by forests, on lawns, grassy areas of parks, and among the slash of thinned karri <b>regrowth</b> forests. It is common in river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) woodlands. M.clelandii also occurs in New Zealand, where it is found in mixed mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), kānuka (Kunzea ericoides), and kauri (Agathis) forest, and in conifer plantations. It is the smallest and most slender of the Macrolepiota species that occur there.|$|E
5|$|Methods for {{controlling}} {{the spread of}} Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A.luteobubalina {{and one of the}} saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A.luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri <b>regrowth</b> forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A.luteobubalina on the stump base.|$|E
5|$|Most {{states had}} placed {{restrictions}} on fisher trapping by the 1930s, coincidental {{with the end}} of the logging boom. A combination of forest <b>regrowth</b> in abandoned farmlands and improved forest management practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover. Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered. Increasing forest cover in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for the near future. Between 1955 and 1985, some states had allowed limited trapping to resume. In areas where fishers were eliminated, porcupine populations subsequently increased. Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops. In these cases, fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest. Once the fisher populations became reestablished, porcupine numbers returned to natural levels. In Washington State, fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s, but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any.|$|E
5|$|Pasvik is {{dominated}} by the old-growth Scots pine, which covers half the park's area. The forest has a very slow life cycle. The age of a typical tree is between 300 and 400 year; the oldest recorded tree was 820 years when chopped down in 1896. <b>Regrowth</b> is slow because the trees need two consecutive years to produce cones and young trees often die after their buds are eaten by moose during winter. The park has been stricken regularly by wildfires—the latest major fire occurring in 1945. Wildfires normally spread and burn in the undergrowth; as pine trees do not have low-laying branches, older pines will not be effected while younger trees will be consumed by the fire. A forest fire can kill tens of generations of trees, but the remaining ashes give good conditions for young trees, giving an uneven age distribution of pine. None of the islands in the lake of Ellensvatn have had fires, giving it a unique forest composition.|$|E
5|$|While moving near Rodrigues, Bella {{produced}} wind {{gusts of}} 210km/h (130mph), along with high tides that flooded the northern coastline, including the capital Port Mathurin. The storm damaged 1,200homes and destroyed 300others, leaving about 1,000people homeless. About 30schools were wrecked. The storm damaged about 75% of the electrical network was damaged, which also disrupted water supply on the island, and about 30% of roads were damaged. Over 90% of the cropson the island were destroyed, with many livestock killed. Cyclone Bella killed {{about half of}} the Rodrigues flying fox, a critically endangered species, decreasing the numbers from around 800 to around 400. The species had regrown from a minimum of around 70 in 1971, and the trend toward <b>regrowth</b> continued after the storm, reaching about 3,500 in 2002. The storm also affected the Rodrigues warbler. The storm also injured nine people, and overall, Bella was considered the worst storm on the island in 20years.|$|E
5|$|At any size, a meat ant nest {{always has}} a {{possibility}} of dying out in any year, but the site may be reoccupied by another colony. Hence, nests can be very old as suggested in one study. Some nests may never be reoccupied for unknown reasons. The <b>regrowth</b> of vegetation which shades the nest, soil damage or even a disease may wipe out a colony and leave the nest site completely abandoned. The death of a colony may be obvious when competing colonies increase in population and size by expanding their territories with well-established satellite nests in order exploit the food sources once used by a former colony. Satellite nests may diverge from their parent nests to become independent, {{as suggested by the}} antagonism of worker ants from different nests or when others are uninhabitable by insecticide treatment. After the eradication of a nest, satellite nests emerge nearby, and may sever their connections with the parent nest. The separation of a satellite nest is an effective way for a nest to exploit food sources, and a colony with less than 11 entrance holes is recognised as non-mature (a nest is mature at 12). As most satellite nests have 11 holes and accept a queen of their own, a satellite nest may easily develop maturity in one year.|$|E
5|$|In some lowland {{areas the}} adult {{salamanders}} will remain active all winter long, excluding cold spells. However, {{during the cold}} winter months in the northern parts of its range, the long-toed salamander burrows below the frost-line in a coarse substrate to hibernate in clusters of 8–14 individuals. While hibernating, it survives on protein energy reserves that are stored in its skin and along its tail. These proteins serve a secondary function {{as part of a}} mixture or concoction of skin secretions that is used for defense. When threatened, the long-toed salamander will wave its tail and secrete an adhesive white milky substance that is noxious and likely poisonous. The color of its skin can serve as a warning to predators (aposematism) that it will taste bad. Its skin colors and patterns are diverse, ranging from a dark black to reddish brown background that is spotted or blotched by a pale-reddish-brown, pale-green, to a bright yellow stripe. An adult may also drop part of its tail and slink away while the tail bit acts as a squirmy decoy; this is called autotomy. The regeneration and <b>regrowth</b> of the tail is one example of the developmental physiology of amphibians that is of great interest to the medical profession.|$|E
25|$|GSE {{has been}} found to be {{associated}} with alopecia areata (patchy baldness) whereas <b>regrowth</b> did not necessarily occur on a gluten free diet.|$|E
25|$|The {{glial scar}} also {{prevents}} neuronal <b>regrowth.</b> Following {{trauma to the}} CNS, axons begin to sprout and attempt to extend across the injury site in order to repair the damaged regions. However, the scar prevents axonal extensions via physical and chemical means. Astrocytes form a dense network of gap junctions that generates a physical barrier to axonal <b>regrowth.</b> Further, the astrocytes secrete several growth-inhibitory molecules that chemically prevent axonal extensions. Moreover, the basal membrane component is expected to generate an additional physical and chemical barrier to axonal extensions.|$|E
25|$|From the 1980s {{until the}} present day, Louisville has {{experienced}} a <b>regrowth</b> in popularity and prosperity. This {{can be seen in}} the many changes in this period, including a great deal of downtown infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Another {{complication}} {{can occur}} in case of incomplete or erroneous regeneration of the damaged facial nerve. The nerve {{can be thought of}} as a bundle of smaller individual nerve connections that branch out to their proper destinations. During <b>regrowth,</b> nerves are generally able to track the original path to the right destination - but some nerves may sidetrack leading to a condition known as synkinesis. For instance, <b>regrowth</b> of nerves controlling muscles attached to the eye may sidetrack and also regrow connections reaching the muscles of the mouth. In this way, movement of one also affects the other. For example, when the person closes the eye, the corner of the mouth lifts involuntarily.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{individuals}} of Orthalicus reses reses grow is dependent upon the availability of food, and how quickly their food is replenished after being grazed. <b>Regrowth</b> of the epiphytes {{is affected by the}} light intensity and moisture (canopy density and climate) of the hammock habitat.|$|E
25|$|Other actions include {{contributing}} to pulmonary surfactant {{synthesis of the}} fetal lungs {{at the end of}} the pregnancy and immune tolerance of the fetus by the maternal organism during pregnancy. Prolactin delays hair <b>regrowth</b> in mice. Prolactin promotes neurogenesis in maternal and fetal brains.|$|E
25|$|Debeaking, {{also called}} beak trimming, is the partial {{removal of the}} beak of poultry, {{especially}} layer hens and turkeys although {{it may also be}} performed on quail and ducks. Most commonly, the beak is shortened permanently, although <b>regrowth</b> can occur. The trimmed lower beak is somewhat longer than the upper beak.|$|E
25|$|Initially, beach vitex stems are wounded using a machete. A 5.25% {{solution}} of imazapyr {{is applied to}} the wounded areas of the stems. After a period of 6 months, all stems are removed. This treatment procedure is repeated until zero <b>regrowth</b> is observed. Triclopyr may be used to treat small resprouts and seedlings.|$|E
25|$|On 24 October 2007, it was {{discovered}} {{that there had been a}} <b>regrowth</b> of his pituitary tumour and bleeding into his brain. He underwent emergency surgery and was discharged from hospital on 31 October. He underwent an extensive rehabilitation programme, including radiotherapy. His sixth studio album, Outside In, was released on 26 November 2007.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} use of Nephila silk lies in tissue engineering. A {{study from the}} Medizinische Hochschule Hannover reports that processed Nephila silk is an excellent scaffold material thanks to its biocompatibility, mechanical strengths, and its property to promote cell adhesion and proliferation. In particular, the silk acts as a suitable guiding material for peripheral nerve <b>regrowth.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>regrowth</b> of lost tissues or organs in {{the human}} body is being researched. Some tissues such as skin regrow quite readily; others have been thought to have little or no {{capacity}} for regeneration, but ongoing research suggests that there is some hope for a variety of tissues and organs. Human organs that have been regenerated include the bladder, vagina and the penis.|$|E
25|$|At one {{veterinary}} teaching hospital, between 50 and 80% of cats {{had one or}} more medical complications post-surgery; 19.8% developed complications after release. Other {{studies have}} reported medical post-op complication rates as 24% (Jankowski 1998), 53% (Martinez 1993), 1.4% (Pollari 1996), 82.5% for blade and 51.5% for shear technique (Tobias 1994), and 80% (Yeon 2001). Reported medical complications include: pain, hemorrhage, laceration of paw pads, swelling, reluctance to bear weight on affected limb, neuropraxia (transient motor paralysis), radial nerve damage, lameness, infection, abscess, tissue necrosis, wound dehiscence, incomplete healing, protrusion of 2nd (middle) phalanx, claw <b>regrowth,</b> scurs (growth of deformed claw segments), retention of flexor process of third phalanx, chronic draining tracts, self-mutilation, dermatitis, lethargy, palmigrade stance (walking on wrists), chronic intermittent lameness, chronic pain syndrome, flexor tendon contracture, and cystitis (stress-associated bladder inflammation). Claw <b>regrowth</b> has been seen by veterinarians anywhere from weeks up to 15 years after onychectomy.(Veterinary Information Network).|$|E
25|$|As {{the county}} {{sits at the}} {{headwaters}} of the Chesapeake Bay along the Susquehanna River, it {{plays a key role in}} controlling sediment and fertilizer runoff into the bay as well as fostering submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) <b>regrowth.</b> The county has had to balance the needs of land owners to practice agriculture and/or pave land (creating impervious surfaces) with effects of runoff into the bay.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the limited}} {{functionality}} received from autografts, the current gold standard for nerve regeneration and repair, recent neural tissue engineering {{research has focused on}} the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits in order to guide axonal <b>regrowth.</b> The creation of artificial nerve conduits is also known as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap are enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materials.|$|E
25|$|Many {{silviculture}} practices worldwide involve {{cutting and}} <b>regrowth,</b> and coppicing {{has been of}} significance {{in many parts of}} lowland temperate Europe. The widespread and long-term practice of coppicing as a landscape-scale industry is something that remains of special importance in southern England. For this reason many of the English-language terms referenced in this article are particularly relevant to historic and contemporary practice in that area.|$|E
25|$|Minoxidil is {{a growth}} {{stimulant}} that stimulates already-damaged hair follicles to produce normal hair. Minoxidil does not, however, provide any protection to the follicles from further DHT damage. When a follicle is destroyed by DHT, minoxidil {{will no longer}} be able to have any more <b>regrowth</b> effects on that follicle. Other treatments include tretinoin combined with minoxidil, ketoconazole shampoo, spironolactone, alfatradiol, and topilutamide (fluridil).|$|E
