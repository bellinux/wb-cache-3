He was almost heartbroken by the rebuke from Most, who had [...] "preached propaganda by deed all his life—now he repudiates the first attentat in this country". He was encouraged by the words of Kropotkin, who wrote that [...] "Berkman {{has done more to}} spread the anarchist idea among the masses who do not <b>read</b> <b>our</b> papers than all the writings that we may publish. He has shown that there are among the anarchists, men capable of being revolted by the crimes of capitalism to the point of giving their life {{to put an end to}} these crimes, or at least to open a way to such an end." ...|$|E
500|$|Jones, {{who played}} Les, {{revealed}} that the runaway storyline was tough on him and he began crying when he read the script. He continued [...] "The four {{of us in the}} Battersby family <b>read</b> <b>our</b> scripts together to work out how we are going to play our parts. On this occasion, all four of us were sobbing. It is not like a normal Coronation Street story, it's more like a Taggart or a Cracker." [...] Jones thought the [...] "scrapes" [...] that Toyah found herself in were frightening and hoped that if the storyline could stop one teenager from running away from home, then it would be worthwhile. The storyline attracted the attention of the Independent Television Commission, who believed that the episode featuring Toyah's abduction should have carried a warning before it was broadcast.|$|E
500|$|In late 1861, the Reverend Mark R. Watkinson of Ridleyville, Pennsylvania, {{had written}} to Chase, proposing that some {{reference}} to God {{be placed on the}} coinage in that time of war, and on November20 of that year, Chase wrote to Mint Director Pollock, [...] "You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest tersest terms possible this national recognition." [...] Several mottoes were considered by Pollock, including [...] "God Our Trust" [...] and [...] "God and Our Country". Some of the patterns he sent Chase in December 1863 used [...] "God Our Trust", and he wrote of the design, [...] "the devices are beautiful and appropriate, and the motto on each such, as all who fear God and love their country, will approve." [...] He also sent pattern coins depicting George Washington; Chase responded to the letter, [...] "I approve your mottoes, only suggesting that on that with the Washington obverse the motto should begin with the word OUR, so as to <b>read</b> <b>OUR</b> GOD AND OUR COUNTRY. And on that with the shield, it should be changed so as to read: IN GOD WE TRUST." [...] Pollock had been inspired by [...] "The Star Spangled Banner", a later stanza of which includes the line, [...] "And this be our motto, 'In God Is Our Trust'". Chase may have been influenced in his decision by the motto of his alma mater, Brown University, In Deo Speramus (In God We Hope).|$|E

2500|$|In Gratz v. Bollinger, Thomas said that, in his view, [...] "a State's use {{of racial}} {{discrimination}} in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause." [...] In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who concluded that [...] "he way to stop {{discrimination on the basis}} of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race." [...] Concurring, Thomas wrote that [...] "if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories," [...] and charged that the dissent carried [...] "similarities" [...] to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in Brown v. Board of Education. In Grutter v. Bollinger, he approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's Plessy v. Ferguson dissent: [...] "Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." [...] In a concurrence in Missouri v. Jenkins (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court [...] "has <b>read</b> <b>our</b> cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority." ...|$|E

I'm sorry. I always get into trouble when I do that." [...] Pressed as to whether he believed Prime Minister John Howard should continue as prime minister, he said: [...] "I have nothing further to say. I'm sorry. <b>Read</b> <b>our</b> editorials in the papers. It'll be the journalists who decide that – the editors." [...] In 2009, in response to accusations by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that News Limited was running vendettas against him and his government, Murdoch opined that Rudd was [...] "oversensitive". Murdoch described Howard's successor, Labor Party Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, as [...] "...more ambitious to lead the world [...] than to lead Australia..." [...] and criticised Rudd's expansionary fiscal policies {{in the wake of the}} financial crisis of 2008 as unnecessary. Although News Limited's interests are extensive, also including the Daily Telegraph, the Courier-Mail and the Adelaide Advertiser, it was suggested by the commentator Mungo MacCallum in The Monthly [...] that [...] "the anti-Rudd push, if coordinated at all, was almost certainly locally driven" [...] as opposed to being directed by Murdoch, who also took a different position from local editors on such matters as climate change and stimulus packages to combat the financial crisis.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{decided to}} marry, Darwin visited his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838 {{and told her}} of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November he {{returned}} and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote, [...] "When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep {{out of my head}} but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain.

[...] In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to [...] "love one another", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief. For Emma the importance of faith had been reinforced by the death of her sister Fanny in 1832, and her need to meet Fanny again in the afterlife. She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says [...] "If a man abide not in me...they are burned". Darwin's warm reply reassured her, and she replied that [...] "To see you in earnest on the subject will be my greatest comfort & that I am sure you are. I believe I agree with every word you say, & it pleased me that you shd have felt inclined to enter a little more on the subject." [...] However, this tension would remain.|$|E
