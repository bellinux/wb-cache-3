5000|$|The Hamburg Index {{shows some}} clear trends in recent {{chartering}} markets. First, rates were generally increasing from 2000 to 2005. From 2005 to 2008, rates slowly decreased, and in mid-2008 began a [...] "dramatic decline" [...] of approximately 75%, which lasted until rates stabilized in April 2009. [...] Rates {{have ranged from}} $2.70 to $35.40 in this period, with prices generally lower on larger ships. The most resilient sized vessel in this time period were those from 200-300 TEU, {{a fact that the}} United Nations Council on Trade and Development attributes to lack of competition in this sector. [...] Overall, in 2010, these rates rebounded somewhat, but remained at approximately half of their 2008 values. [...] As of 2011, the index shows signs of <b>recovery</b> for <b>container</b> shipping, and combined with increases in global capacity, indicates a positive outlook for the sector in the near future.|$|R

40|$|The container-shipping industry's poor {{performance}} in 2011 and its continued struggles in 2012 are primarily the result {{of supply and demand}} imbalance, which triggered intense competition and price wars. Some carriers have begun to recognize the importance of alliances, as reflected by their expanded efforts to collaborate during the past year. This article present how the global rates in container industry had dropped as the carriers added ships in anticipation of an economic <b>recovery,</b> causing overcapacity. <b>Container</b> lines began cutting capacity and raising rates to restore profitability.

40|$|Performance {{anomalies}} represent {{one common}} type of failures in Internet servers. Overcoming these failures without introducing server downtimes is {{of the utmost importance}} in video-streaming services. These services have large user abandon- ment costs when failures occur after users watch a significant part of a video. Reboot is the most popular and effective technique for overcoming performance anomalies but it takes several minutes from start until the server is warmed-up again to run at its full capacity. During that period, the server is unavailable or provides limited capacity to process end-users’ requests. This paper presents a recovery technique for performance anomalies in HTTP Streaming services, which relies on Container-based Virtualization to implement an efficient multi-phase server reboot technique that minimizes the service downtime. The recovery process includes analysis of variance of request-response times to delimit the server warm-up period, after which the server is running at its full capacity. Experimental results show that the Virtual <b>Container</b> <b>recovery</b> process completes in 72 seconds, which contrasts with the 434 seconds required for full operating system recovery. Both recovery types generate service downtimes imperceptible to end-users...|$|R
5000|$|The Massachusetts Bottle Bill (Mass. Bills H.2943/S.1588) is a container-deposit {{legislation}} {{dealing with}} recycling in the United States that originally {{passed in the}} U.S. state of Massachusetts in 1982 as the Beverage <b>Container</b> <b>Recovery</b> Law. Implemented in 1983, the law requires containers of carbonated beverages to be returnable with a minimum return value of $0.05. The bottle bill does not cover containers of non-carbonated beverages like water, tea, or sports drinks. The law also establishes the handling fee paid by distributors to redemption centers, $0.0325 per unit as of July 5, 2013, and to retailers $0.0225 per unit. As the number of non-deposit beverage containers (water, tea, sports beverages, etc.) has increased to represent over one-third of beverage containers sold, the Bottle Bill has no influence on these non-deposit containers, {{with the result that}} these containers are {{three times more likely to}} be found as litter in Massachusetts communities. Additional studies indicate that beverage containers covered by the state's container deposit system are redeemed at approximately 70% and another 9% are recycled via curbside programs. Conversely, containers that are not covered, such as bottled water, juices, and sports drinks, are recycled at approximately 25% ...|$|R
40|$|Issue: A {{successful}} {{program for}} re-washing recycled glass containers {{for use in}} applications such as wine bottling depends on overcoming a number of challenges, including developing collection infrastructure, sorting diverse bottle streams, achieving efficient washing, and market penetration. Bottle washing programs may focus {{on a variety of}} bottle types, including beer bottles, wine bottles, or juice bottles. This Best Practice focuses on the key elements of a wine bottle-washing program, although many of the concepts are applicable to other containers. A successful bottle-washing program requires the integration of collection and supply infrastructure, sorting protocols, and equipment selection. Best Practice: Historically, bottles were manufactured to heavy specifications as returnables. Today, most glass containers are manufactured as one-way containers, not intended to withstand the rigors of multiple re-washings. Wine bottles remain an exception. Wine bottles manufactured in the United States generally have the same weight as those manufactured in Europe, where washing wine bottles is a common procedure. Because it contains a non-pressurized liquid, a wine bottle does not have the same potential to break from pressure, as does a defective container of beer or soda. However, the development of coated glass bottles may lead to lighter weight wine bottles as well. In addition, only regions with an adequate wine production industry are potential locations for wine bottle washing facilities. Finally, wine bottles wholesale for 35 ¢- 40 ¢each, while beer bottles cost only about 10 ¢, so washing may be more economically feasible for wine bottles. The collection of bottles must be structured to maximize the <b>recovery</b> of usable <b>containers.</b> Certai...|$|R
