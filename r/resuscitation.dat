5|$|Concerned {{with safety}} when using {{electrical}} appliances, {{and no doubt}} drawing on her own experience in receiving an accidental electric shock that knocked her out for an hour, McKenzie delivered at least one talk on <b>resuscitation,</b> advising that conventional <b>resuscitation</b> should proceed for up to thee-quarters of an hour following electrocution. She knew of one case where recovery took 4 hours.|$|E
5|$|Medics were at Kumaritashvili's side {{immediately}} after the crash. Both Cardio-pulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> and mouth-to-mouth <b>resuscitation</b> were performed. He was airlifted to a Whistler hospital, where he died of his injuries. It was luge's first fatality since 10 December 1975, when an Italian luger was killed. Kumaritashvili became the fourth athlete to die during preparations for a Winter Olympicsafter British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski and Australian skier Ross Milne (both 1964 Innsbruck), and Swiss speed skier Nicolas Bochatay (1992 Albertville)and the seventh athlete to die in either a Summer or Winter Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Although {{multiple}} definitions exist, {{a tension}} pneumothorax {{is generally considered}} to be present when a pneumothorax (primary spontaneous, secondary spontaneous, or traumatic) leads to significant impairment of respiration and/or blood circulation. Tension pneumothorax tends to occur in clinical situations such as ventilation, <b>resuscitation,</b> trauma, or in patients with lung disease.|$|E
5|$|First {{responder}} – A {{person who}} arrives {{first at the}} scene of an incident, and whose job is to provide early critical care such as cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> (CPR) or using an automated external defibrillator (AED). First responders may be dispatched by the ambulance service, may be passers-by, or may be dispatched to the scene from other agencies, such as the police or fire departments.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{evacuations}} continued {{from other}} area hospitals that were flooded or damaged. Reports from the Methodist Hospital indicated {{that people were}} dying of dehydration and exhaustion while the staff worked unendingly in horrendous conditions. The {{first floor of the}} hospital flooded and the dead were stacked in a second floor operating room. Patients requiring ventilators were kept alive with hand-powered <b>resuscitation</b> bags.|$|E
5|$|In the 1780s the Royal Humane Society {{installed}} <b>resuscitation</b> kits, including smoke enemas, {{at various}} points along the River Thames, and {{by the turn of}} the 19th century, tobacco smoke enemas had become an established practice in Western medicine, considered by Humane Societies to be as important as artificial respiration.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1999, the Marquess {{complained of}} a stomach ache and dizziness, and {{spent most of}} the day in bed. The {{following}} morning, his butler went into his room and found he was not breathing. Along with Whitby, they attempted mouth-to-mouth <b>resuscitation</b> and called an ambulance. This arrived about 11:30am, when paramedics concluded he had died.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{is usually}} treated with urgent needle decompression. This {{may be required}} before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted. If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression is performed as part of <b>resuscitation</b> as it may restore cardiac output.|$|E
5|$|When Bågenholm {{was pulled}} out of the water, her pupils were dilated, her blood was not circulating, and she was not breathing. Falkenberg and Næsheim, both doctors, began giving her {{cardiopulmonary}} <b>resuscitation</b> (CPR). The rescue helicopter soon arrived and Bågenholm was brought to the Tromsø University Hospital in an hour. The helicopter emergency team continued to give her CPR during the flight, and she was ventilated with oxygen. She was also treated with a defibrillator, but to no effect.|$|E
5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} let {{themselves}} into the house using Floyd's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while Cynthia and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer pushed Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said {{she had not been}} pushed but had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth <b>resuscitation,</b> to no avail. The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, following the coroner's direction that such a verdict would mean Cynthia had been pushed, but perhaps accidentally.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} sweep by the attack helicopters, two Chinooks carried the SAS to Gberi Bana. The troopers fast-roped {{into the village}} and {{immediately}} came under fire from the West Side Boys. Early on in the confrontation, the British operation sustained its first casualty—a round entered Trooper Bradley Tinnion's flank, leaving him seriously injured. He was dragged back to the helicopter and flown to the medical team aboard the RFA Sir Percivale, dying despite intensive <b>resuscitation</b> attempts on board. The SAS proceeded to clear the village, engaging those West Side Boys who offered resistance and capturing those who surrendered, including Foday Kallay.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the Second World War the operas began to be {{performed}} in the major opera houses, and eventually were established in the general repertory. The <b>resuscitation</b> of Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music {{in the way that}} Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer. It was not until 1932 that the 1610 Vespers were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision two years later. Modern editions of the Selva morales and Missa e Salmi volumes were published respectively in 1940 and 1942.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, 2009, Jackson stopped {{breathing}} {{while attempting to}} sleep {{under the care of}} Conrad Murray, his personal physician. Murray had reportedly given Jackson an array of medications in an attempt to help him sleep at his rented mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Attempts at resuscitating Jackson were unsuccessful. Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics received a 911 call at 12:22 pm (PDT, 19:22 UTC), arriving three minutes later. Jackson was reportedly not breathing and CPR was performed. <b>Resuscitation</b> efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and {{for more than an hour}} after arriving there at 1:13 pm (20:13 UTC). He was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific time (21:26 UTC).|$|E
5|$|Smallpox {{vaccination}} {{within three}} days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms {{in the vast majority}} of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease. Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid <b>resuscitation.</b> People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns.|$|E
5|$|Using a {{searchlight}} {{the helicopter}} crew searched {{the exterior of}} the building and at 1:17 AM February 23, the helicopter spotted a broken window on the 28th floor located in an area that could not be seen from the street. At about 2:15 AM a rescue team was sent to the spot and found the three missing firefighters unconscious and out of air in their SCBAs. The firefighters were brought to a medical triage set up on the 20th floor. There were attempts at <b>resuscitation,</b> but they were unsuccessful and the firefighters were pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need <b>resuscitation.</b> Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require <b>resuscitation.</b> Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a stroke}} {{at a family}} reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, Roddenberry's health {{declined}} further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich. He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling for breath, and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a cardiopulmonary arrest, and {{he died in the}} doctor's office shortly afterwards. Cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of <b>resuscitation,</b> and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E
5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute liver failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid <b>resuscitation</b> or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|One way {{to advance}} {{emergency}} medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries that currently lack it. Without such recognition, {{it is difficult to}} set up training programs or recruit potential students, as they face the uncertainly of training to obtain a credential that may end up being useless to them. Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development. Botswana may serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a <b>Resuscitation</b> Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.|$|E
5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room. Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary <b>Resuscitation</b> have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E
5|$|Yeovil and County Cricket Club {{was formed}} in 1865, {{and was the first}} attempt at setting up a county cricket team for Somerset. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the club broke up. In 1874, the club was re-formed with the lesser remit, as Yeovil Cricket Club. As part of the club's <b>resuscitation,</b> the {{committee}} purchased the use of a field in West Hendford in Yeovil, from a local farmer, Mr Brook. The field, part of Key Farm, was leased for £10. There is record of a match being played on the ground the following year between two sets of members of the Yeovil Cricket Club. During the late 19th-century, the ground was used for other sports as well as cricket; it had a grass athletics track, and also hosted Yeovil Football Club, who at the time played both association and rugby football. The football club played at West Hendford on an irregular basis during the late 19th-century, but returned in 1935, by which time they only played rugby, and had changed their name accordingly to Yeovil Rugby Club. In 1895, the cricket club committee announced that there was provision for a longer lease, of five or seven years, and that they would make improvements to the ground to enable it to host first-class cricket. The ground was also used for field hockey in the early 20th-century, hosting a Yeovil Hockey Club.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{focus is}} on <b>resuscitation</b> {{beginning}} with airway management and fluid <b>resuscitation</b> using either intravenous fluids and or blood. A number of medications may improve outcomes depending on {{the source of the}} bleeding.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{elements}} of <b>resuscitation</b> for sudden cardiac arrest are cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> (CPR in turn consists of mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compression), defibrillation and {{emergency medical services}} (the means to bring these techniques to the patient quickly).|$|E
25|$|The initial {{focus is}} on <b>resuscitation</b> {{beginning}} with airway management and fluid <b>resuscitation</b> using either intravenous fluids and or blood. A number of medications may improve outcomes depending on {{the source of the}} bleeding. Although proton pump inhibitors are often given in the emergent setting, {{there is no evidence that}} these medications decrease death rates, re-bleeding events, or needs for surgical interventions. After the initial <b>resuscitation</b> has been completed, treatment is instigated to limit the likelihood of rebleeds and correct any anaemia that the bleeding may have caused.|$|E
25|$|Delayed {{clamping}} is {{not recommended}} {{as a response to}} cases where the newborn is not breathing well and needs <b>resuscitation.</b> Rather, the recommendation is instead to immediately clamp and cut the cord and perform cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation.</b> The umbilical cord pulsating is not a guarantee that the baby is receiving enough oxygen.|$|E

25|$|Cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> is an {{important}} life saving first aid skill, practiced throughout the world. It is the only known effective method of keeping someone who has suffered cardiac arrest alive long enough for definitive treatment to be delivered. In 1954, James Elam {{was the first to}} demonstrate experimentally that cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> (CPR) was a sound technique, and together with Dr. Peter Safar he demonstrated its superiority to previous methods.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{management}} {{of a patient}} with acute pancreatitis consists of supportive care with fluid <b>resuscitation,</b> pain control, and nutritional support.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{improvement}} with fluid <b>resuscitation,</b> therapy-resistant hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or fluid overload may necessitate artificial {{support in the}} form of dialysis or hemofiltration.|$|E
25|$|Vasopressin infusions {{are also}} used as second line therapy in septic shock {{patients}} not responding to fluid <b>resuscitation</b> or infusions of catecholamines (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine).|$|E
25|$|Class I Hemorrhage {{involves}} up to 15% {{of blood}} volume. There is typically {{no change in}} vital signs and fluid <b>resuscitation</b> is not usually necessary.|$|E
25|$|Class IV Hemorrhage {{involves}} loss of >40% of {{circulating blood}} volume. The {{limit of the}} body's compensation is reached and aggressive <b>resuscitation</b> is required to prevent death.|$|E
