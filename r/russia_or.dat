5|$|S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon {{expedition}} of 1897 was {{an effort}} to reach the North Pole in which all three expedition members perished. S.A.Andrée (1854–97), the first Swedish balloonist, proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from Svalbard to either <b>Russia</b> <b>or</b> Canada, which was to pass, with luck, straight over the North Pole on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen behind {{in the race for the}} North Pole.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is {{the most}} widespread member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from Ireland to Japan. It prefers mature trees, and in most of Europe, where it shares its range with short-toed treecreeper, {{it tends to be}} found mainly in coniferous forest, especially spruce and fir. However, where it is the only treecreeper, as in European <b>Russia,</b> <b>or</b> the British Isles, it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in preference to conifers.|$|E
5|$|Within the Triple Alliance, Prussia {{was hoping}} for some {{territorial}} gains in the Baltic region, through war (with <b>Russia)</b> <b>or</b> diplomacy (from the Commonwealth), {{or a combination of}} the above. With regard to the Balkans, the Triple Alliance aimed at restraining the Russian Empire, as well as the its ally, the Austrian Empire, and there were expectations of a war between the Alliance and Russia (and possibly Austria) around 1791.|$|E

5|$|Briskin {{was born}} on February 8, 1896 in either Riga, <b>Russia</b> <b>or</b> New York City. His Parents were Benjamin and Rose Briskin. Two of his brothers, Irving and Murray also became film producers, while his sister, Ida, married a film studio executive. Briskin also had one other brother, Barnett (Barney), who {{was also in the}} film {{industry}} as a theater manager and in sales capacities. While some sources have his birthplace is Riga, Russia, others indicate that he was born in New York, after his parents immigrated there. Briskin was a product of the public school system. He obtained his college degree in accounting from the College of the City of New York.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{technology}} {{began to}} change this balance. New Krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies {{in the event of}} war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In the event of a war between Britain and France or <b>Russia,</b> <b>or</b> both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire's worldwide trade.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Ekholm was {{skeptical of the}} balloon's ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. His {{buoyancy}} checks {{in the summer of}} 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into the balloon, convinced him that the balloon leaked too much to ever reach the Pole, let alone go on to <b>Russia</b> <b>or</b> Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along the seams, which no amount of glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula varnish seemed to seal. The balloon was losing 68kilograms (150lb) of lift force a day. Taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17 days at most, not 30. When {{it was time to go}} home, he warned Andrée that he would not take part in the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought.|$|E

5|$|France, {{friendly}} towards both Russia and Austria, {{suggested a}} series of territorial adjustments, in which Austria would be compensated by parts of Prussian Silesia, and Prussia in turn would receive Polish Ermland (Warmia) {{and parts of the}} Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a Polish fief already under Baltic German hegemony. King Frederick II of Prussia had no intention of giving up Silesia, gained recently in the Silesian Wars. He was, however, also interested in finding a peaceful solution– his alliance with Russia would draw him into a potential war with Austria, and the Seven Years' War had left Prussia's treasury and army weakened. He was also interested in protecting the weakening Ottoman Empire, which could be advantageously utilized {{in the event of a}} Prussian war either with <b>Russia</b> <b>or</b> Austria. Frederick's brother, Prince Henry, spent the winter of 1770–71 as a representative of the Prussian court at Saint Petersburg. As Austria had annexed 13 towns in the Hungarian Szepes region in 1769 (violating the Treaty of Lubowla), Catherine II of Russia and her advisor General Ivan Chernyshyov suggested to Henry that Prussia claim some Polish land, such as Ermland. After Henry informed Frederick of the proposal, the Prussian monarch suggested a partition of the Polish borderlands by Austria, Prussia, and Russia, with the largest share going to the party most weakened by the recent changes in balance of power, Austria. Thus Frederick attempted to encourage Russia to direct its expansion towards weak and dysfunctional Poland instead of the Ottomans. Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz counter-proposed that Prussia take lands from Poland in return for relinquishing Silesia to Austria, but this plan was rejected by Frederick.|$|E

25|$|The Russian {{copyright}} law of 1993 covered works first disclosed on Russian territory, {{as well as}} undisclosed works that existed in objective form within Russia, regardless of the nationality of the author. It also covered works of Russian authors that were first disclosed outside of <b>Russia</b> <b>or</b> that, if undisclosed, existed only abroad. Foreign works (i.e., works not disclosed in <b>Russia</b> <b>or</b> not existing there of an author {{who did not have}} Russian citizenship) were subject to the Russian {{copyright law}} according to the provisions of the international treaties Russia was a member of. In 2004, article 5, which laid down these definitions, was amended with a new sub-paragraph 5(4) to cover also foreign works that were still copyrighted in their foreign country of origin, but had never been copyrighted in Russia. Such restored copyrights on foreign works were limited to at most the copyright term they enjoyed in the foreign country.|$|E
