5|$|Nerdist <b>remarks</b> <b>that</b> Battletoadss sudden {{difficulty}} spike {{was intended}} to combat the then-budding video game rental industry; if the game was more difficult, then it would take longer to complete, and consumers {{would be more likely}} to purchase a retail cartridge instead of renting one.|$|E
5|$|A team of {{scholars}} worked from 1040 to 1044 to compile the Wujing Zongyao {{with the intent}} to collect all known military knowledge and to disseminate it to a wider government audience.

5|$|Although Sandra Panem in {{the journal}} Science praised Shilts' efforts and the {{attention}} the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight {{to the issue of}} homophobia hampering attention on the disease, but <b>remarks</b> <b>that</b> even if AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress.|$|E

His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and <b>remarks</b> <b>that</b> he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.|$|E
5|$|In his {{documentary}} The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, Slavoj Žižek <b>remarks</b> <b>that</b> Norman Bates' mansion {{has three}} floors, paralleling the {{three levels of}} the human mind that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: the top floor would be the superego, where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ego, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' id. Žižek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.|$|E

5|$|McDowell's {{original}} {{script is}} far less comedic and much darker; the Maitlands' car crash is depicted graphically, with Barbara's arm being crushed and the couple screaming for help as they slowly drown in the river. A reference to this remained in all versions of the script, as Barbara <b>remarks</b> <b>that</b> her arm feels cold upon returning home as a ghost. Instead of possessing the Deetzes and forcing them to dance during dinner, the Maitlands cause a vine-patterned carpet to come to life and attack the Deetzes by tangling them to their chairs.|$|E
5|$|On a Good Friday evening, Ivan Velikopolsky, a 22-year-old sacristan's son and {{clerical}} student, walks {{home and}} imagines that the bitter wind, cold, and darkness he experiences were also felt throughout history: by Rurik, Ivan the Terrible, and Peter the Great. Along his path, he meets Vasilisa and Lukerya, {{a mother and}} her daughter who have both been widowed. As he joins them around their fire, Ivan <b>remarks</b> <b>that</b> the warmth they feel must also have been felt by Saint Peter.

Bart is {{conflicted}} and asks Homer whether it is okay to compromise one's beliefs to be popular. Homer tells Bart that popularity {{is the most important thing}} in the world, as long as Bart is not talking about killing someone. That night, Bart sneaks out of the house and decapitates the statue.|$|E
