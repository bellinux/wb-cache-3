40|$|The latest {{revision}} of the Internal Ratings Based approach of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s New Capital Accord Proposal for retail portfolios contains a significant innovation relative to previous versions: the recognition that, for revolving credits, future margin income {{will be available to}} cover losses before a bank’s capital is threatened. We assemble a mini-portfolio of <b>revolving</b> <b>exposures</b> and we compare the capital charges generated by the latest Basel’s formula with the capital charges generated by two possible earnings-at-risk internal capital allocation models. We find that in general, Basel’s capital ratios are closer to those generated by our models for the groups with lower credit risk. We attribute the discrepancies to the different ways Basel and our models account for future margin income, to Basel assumptions about asset correlations, and to one our models taking macroeconomic conditions explicitly into account...|$|R
40|$|The Vasicek {{single factor}} model of {{portfolio}} credit loss is generalized to include correlated stochastic exposures and loss rates. The new model can accommodate any distribution and correlation assumptions {{for the loss}} and exposure rates of individual credits and will produce a closed-form approximation for an asymptotic portfolio’s conditional loss rate. <b>Revolving</b> <b>exposures</b> are modeled as draws against committed lines of credit. Draw rates and loss rates on defaulted credits are random variables with known probability distributions. Dependence among defaults, individual exposures, and loss rates are modeled using a single common Gaussian factor. A closed-form expression for an asymptotic portfolio’s inverse cumulative conditional loss rate {{is used to calculate}} a portfolio’s unconditional loss rate distribution, estimate economic capital allocations, and analyze portfolio loss rate characteristics. Positive correlation in individual credit exposures and loss rates increases systematic risk. As a consequence, portfolio loss rate distributions exhibit wider ranges and greater skewness...|$|R
50|$|In general, EAD {{is seen as}} an {{estimation}} {{of the extent to which}} a bank may be exposed to a counterparty in the event of, and at the time of, that counterparty’s default. EAD is equal to the current amount outstanding in case of fixed exposures such as term loans. For <b>revolving</b> <b>exposures</b> like lines of credit, EAD can be divided into drawn and undrawn commitments; typically the drawn commitment is known whereas the undrawn commitment needs to be estimated to arrive at a value of EAD. Based on Basel Guidelines, EAD for commitments measures the amount of the facility that is likely to be drawn further if a default occurs. Two popular terms used to express the percentage of the undrawn commitment that will be drawn and outstanding at default (in case of a default) are Conversion Factor (CF) and Loan Equivalent (LEQ).|$|R
50|$|The Guillaume Affair was an espionage {{scandal in}} the Cold War history of Germany. The scandal <b>revolved</b> around the <b>exposure</b> of an East German spy within the West German {{government}} and had far-reaching political repercussions in Germany, the most prominent being the resignation of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1974.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} that new loans to large borrowers fell by 37 % {{during the peak}} period {{of the financial crisis}} (September-November 2008) relative to the prior three-month period and by 68 % relative to the peak of the credit boom (Mar-May 2007). New lending for real investment (such as capital expenditures) fell to the same extent as new lending for restructuring (LBOs, M&A, share repurchases). Banks that have access to deposit financing cut their lending less than banks with less access to deposit financing. In addition, there is a large overhang of revolving credit facilities, which may also have curtailed lending. We document an increase in drawdowns of revolving credit facilities. Many of these drawdowns were undertaken by low credit quality firms concerned about their access to funding. While helpful to these borrowers, they may limit the ability of banks to make other loans. Banks with more revolving lines outstanding relative to deposits reduced their lending more than those with less <b>revolving</b> line <b>exposure...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Basel Committee has {{suggested}} some formulas for calculating capital requirement using the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach. However, these formulas were derived {{under the assumption}} of a normal distribution. Thus, the capital requirement estimated by the Basel formula may be incorrect when the asset distributions are not normal. Using an analysis of qualifying <b>revolving</b> retail <b>exposures</b> as an example, this paper introduces a formula based on the Extreme Value Theory to calculate the capital requirement. This formula is more general and accurate than its predecessors, {{because it can be}} used with any type of distribution. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the capital requirement estimated by the Basel formula is less than by our formula when the asset distribution has a heavy tail, and more than by our formula when the distribution has a short tail. Our formula is also more sensitive to risk than competing models {{in the context of the}} recent financial crisis. Basel accord Extreme Value Theory Capital requirement...|$|R
40|$|Several Greek tragedies <b>revolve</b> {{around the}} <b>exposure</b> of corpses and the {{conflict}} this creates between characters who support or oppose {{this lack of}} burial. Such a conflict is often between a ruler who outlaws the burial to punish an enemy and an individual or citizen who tries to protect {{the body of a}} loved one from mutilation and dishonour. The opposition of the individual can be construed as a direct challenge of the authority of the ruler. In this thesis, burial conflicts in Sophocles’ Antigone, Sophocles’ Ajax and Euripides’ The Suppliant Women are therefore analysed as power struggles to answer the question why the conflicts arise {{in the first place and}} what role power plays in their resolution or escalation. This is done by systematically looking at the motives and justifications of the characters throughout the plays to see how they influence the outcome of the narrative...|$|R
40|$|Viral {{encephalitis}} {{remains a}} significant {{public health problem}} world wide including Bangladesh. Its transmission is either from insect or environmental vectors or from human-to-human contact. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis, viral studies, and various imaging techniques provide sensitive and specific methods to detect many of these viral pathogens. Rapid diagnosis of encephalitis allows early intervention in those conditions that are responsive to specific antiviral treatment, such as herpes simplex encephalitis. Specific treatment is available for certain viral encephalitides, but for others only supportive therapy is available. Vaccines are available to prevent a few important causes of encephalitis, but prevention of encephalitis <b>revolves</b> around minimizing <b>exposure</b> to pathogens, and insects which transmit many of them. Control {{must be based on}} rapid recognition of early cases, subsequent immunization of persons or animals at risk, or immunization of persons or animals with the potential to be at risk, such as travelers, laboratory personnel, and attending clinicians.

40|$|This {{report is}} based on two {{different}} approaches that companies could use {{in order to develop}} their business. These approaches are: Social Media Marketing and Strategic Alliances. A detailed theory study explains what these approaches are and how they are used. This study was done from a startup company’s point of view. Startup companies are also called startups and the results found are based on how these two approaches are and could best be utilized by startups. The results indicate that the majority of startups does not utilize the possibility of a business partnership, other than small “deals” made startup to startup. The startups however who are in a business partnership right now or are in the early stage of implementing one could not go into details of what said partnership were, but that terms and conditions had been set. Another result is the correlation between the two different approaches. Social media marketing {{is one of the first}} things that startups uses and if marketing and sales are operating at a good level then strategic alliances, or some other business partnership, could be exploited mainly in order to reach mainstream customers. Another result is also the order of how startups usually aims their business. This is described in chapter 4 where figure 3. 0 visualizes these aims. Also found is that startups should use social media platforms in order to expose themselves. They should make a strategy <b>revolving</b> their <b>exposure</b> and have a Social Media Manager responsible for implementing the strategy. It’s also important for a company that uses social media as a marketing tool to have a clear message towards its consumers and employees - a cohesive profile amongst all social media. Also, the strategizing procedure is connected to the specific company, meaning that every single company needs to make its own social media strategy...|$|R
40|$|I {{evaluated}} metallothionein (MT), free (unbound) hepatic cadmium {{and whole}} body cadmium {{as indicators of}} cadmium exposure in juvenile bluegills Lepomis macrochirus in laboratory tests. Two types of cadmium exposure were tested; aqueous and sediment-associated. In the aqueous tests, fish were exposed to cadmium (0. 0 to 32. 3 [mu]g/L) in an intermittent-flow diluter. The experimental design for the aqueous exposure was completely randomized and included two replicates in each of eight treatments (seven cadmium exposures and one water control). In the sediment-associated cadmium test, fish were exposed to resuspended river sediment containing 1. 3 to 21. 4 [mu]g Cd/g (dry weight) at a nominal total suspended solids concentration of 1000 mg/L in <b>revolving,</b> circular glass <b>exposure</b> chambers. The experimental design for the sediment exposure was a randomized block and included three replicates in each of six treatments (five sediment exposures and one sediment-free control). In both the aqueous and sediment bioassays, 25 juvenile bluegills per replicate were exposed for 28 -d. Total cadmium concentrations were measured in various bluegill liver fractions, whole bluegill, water, and resuspended sediment to assess the partitioning and bioaccumulation of cadmium after the tests. Mean concentrations of MT and free cadmium in bluegill livers and concentrations of cadmium in whole bluegills were positively correlated with aqueous cadmium concentration and were equally suitable as indicators of aqueous cadmium exposure. Sediment-associated cadmium was biologically available, but {{to a lesser extent}} than aqueous cadmium. Cadmium concentrations in whole bluegills exposed to resuspended river sediment were 1. 5 - to 3. 5 -fold the concentrations in bluegills in sediment-free controls. Free cadmium and MT concentrations in bluegill liver and whole-body cadmium concentrations in bluegills were positively correlated with the cadmium concentrations in filtered water, resuspended sediment, and bulk river sediment; however, whole-body cadmium concentrations were a more sensitive indicator of exposure to sediment-associated cadmium than either free cadmium or MT concentrations in liver...|$|R
