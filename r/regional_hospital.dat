40|$|Background A {{disaster}} {{is defined by}} the World Health Organization as ―a serious disruption of the functioning of a community that exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. ‖ Healthcare facilities are critical in responding to disasters, but disasters have potential to overwhelm facility and human resources. Aim To assess the current state of disaster preparedness and response in Tanzanian <b>regional</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Materials and Methods This is a descriptive cross sectional study using a structured questionnaire based on WHO defined essential data. Results All 25 <b>regional</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Tanzania were surveyed. Ninety two percent of <b>regional</b> <b>hospitals</b> reported experiencing a disaster in the past five years. The most common disasters were due to large motor vehicle accident (80 %) and floods (24 %). A majority of the hospitals had a disaster committee (60 %), but only 36 % had a disaster plan. Disaster planning, personnel and equipment resources varied greatly among <b>regional</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Conclusions <b>Regional</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Tanzania experience disasters secondary to large motor traffic accidents, floods, bomb explosions and infection outbreaks. The survey found hospital preparedness was at an early stage of development. The {{results of this study suggest}} important opportunities to better prepare <b>regional</b> <b>hospitals</b> to respond to disasters. Particular gaps include inadequate surge capacity, lack of disaster planning, inadequate personnel, shortage of equipments, and lack of contingency communication systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the possibilities of}} development for Croatian <b>regional</b> <b>hospitals</b> through Public-Private Partnerships (PPP). The goal is to derive lessons from other countries’ experiences in implementation and enforcement of the PPP model for hospitals {{in order to avoid}} future mistakes and to present possibilities of the PPP model implementation in Croatian <b>regional</b> <b>hospitals,</b> putting it in the framework of EU accession. The paper will answer questions like are there EU experiences in the PPP model application in hospitals and what are the outcomes; is the PPP model of financing public infrastructure regulated on EU level and how; are there existing preconditions in the Croatian legal system and institutional environment for the enforcement of EU experiences; how can UK’s experiences be applied in Croatian <b>regional</b> <b>hospitals,</b> and finally, what needs to be adjusted and regulated in order to create grounds for PPP implementation in <b>regional</b> public <b>hospitals</b> and to avoid future mistakes in Croatia. In order to show that the PPP model of fi nancing public <b>regional</b> <b>hospitals</b> offers possibilities of economic transformation of the health care sector, paper first tried to prove that <b>regional</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Croatia are neglected and the concentration is present in Zagreb. Secondly, the specifi c geographic layout of Croatia requires the development of regional medical centers where access to public health service is available to patients from the region. Thirdly, {{in the light of the}} current situation (large hospitals debts, insuffi cient fi nancial funds etc.) the PPP model could offer an extra model of fi nancing in order to provide the best quality medical service to citizens. And finally, as a good practice example, the largest PFI hospital scheme in the United Kingdom was analysed and tried to present through opportunities for Clinical Hospital Osijek (CHO) transformation using PFI model of financing. public sector transformation, <b>regional</b> <b>hospitals,</b> PPP, EU accession, Croatia, Osijek. ...|$|R
