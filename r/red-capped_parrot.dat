40|$|A new Eimeria {{species is}} {{described}} from a <b>red-capped</b> <b>parrot</b> (Purpureicephalus spurius). Sporulated oocysts (n = 31) were spherical to subspherical, with a rough bilayered oocyst wall 0. 8 μm thick. Oocysts measured 24. 0 × 22. 8 (20. 4 – 26. 4 × 18. 3 – 25. 9) μm, oocyst length/width ratio, 1. 10. Oocyst residuum, polar granule and micropyle were absent. Sporocysts are elongate-ovoid, 11. 0 × 7. 3 (12. 7 – 9. 2 × 7. 9 – 6. 6) μm, sporocyst length/width ratio, 1. 51 (1. 33 – 1. 71). The thin convex Stieda body and indistinct substieda bodies were {{present and the}} sporocyst residuum was composed of numerous small granules less than 1. 0 μm in diameter dispersed randomly. Each sporocyst contained 2 sausage-shaped sporozoites in head-to-tail arrangement. The sporozoite nuclei were located centrally surrounded by refractile bodies. Molecular analysis was conducted at two loci; the 18 S ribosomal RNA gene and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene. At the 18 S locus, the new isolate shared 99. 0 % genetic similarity with Eimeria dispersa and Eimeria innocua from the turkey. At the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene locus, this new isolate was most closely related to E. dispersa and E. innocua, presented 99. 0 % and 98. 0 % genetic similarity, respectively.

40|$|O apuim-de-costas-pretas [Touit melanonotus (Wied, 1820) ] é uma espécie florestal endêmica da Mata Atlântica Brasileira e de {{relevante}} interesse conservacionista. Trata-se de uma ave com poucas informações disponíveis acerca de sua história natural e distribuição geográfica e novas observações são importantes fontes de informação para auxiliar na conservação da espécie. Aqui reavaliamos o primeiro registro da espécie e apresentamos novas observações no estado do Paraná, sul do Brasil. As vocalizações atribuídas a T. melanonotus e que consubstanciaram sua ocorrência no estado foram examinadas com auxílio de espectrogramas e identificadas como vozes de Pionopsitta pileata (Scopoli, 1769). Não obstante, T. melanonotus ocorre com certa regularidade no Paraná, como indicado por novos registros da espécie em sete localidades distribuídas por todo o litoral do estado. Esta ave foi registrada principalmente em florestas de terras baixas e, uma vez que esta fisionomia sofre intensas pressões antrópicas, sugerimos que esforços de conservação da espécie devem priorizar a preservação desses hábitats. The Brown-backed Parrotlet [Touit melanonotus (Wied, 1820) ] {{is a rare}} forest species {{restricted to}} the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and {{is included in the}} endangered category for species threatened of extinction. As {{there is a lack of}} knowledge about the species' natural history and occurrence, new observations can provide helpful information for parrotlet conservation. Here we reevaluate the first record for the species and present new records for the state of Paraná (southern Brazil). The vocalizations previously attributed to T. melanonotus, and which were used to infer its occurrence in the state, were examined by spectrogram analysis. These were actually found to be vocalizations of the <b>Red-capped</b> <b>Parrot</b> [Pionopsita pileata (Scopoli, 1769) ], representing a case of misidentification. Even so, the Brown-backed Parrotlet occurs with some regularity in the state of Paraná, as shown by 12 records spread through seven localities spanning the entire Paraná coast. The Brown-backed Parrotlet was recorded mostly in lowland areas, and as these forest types suffer intense pressures, conservation efforts aiming the species preservation should focus in the maintenance of these habitats...|$|E
