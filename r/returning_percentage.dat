40|$|SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In the {{introduction}} attention {{is drawn to}} the most striking physical sign in aortic sclerosis: the cardiac murmur often being at first noticed by the general practitioner. The collective entity 'arteriosclerosis' is headed into: 1. Atherosclerosis, a locution especially regarding the vessel's intima. 2. Mönckeberg's sclerosis, a lesion especially affecting the media, and also appertaining {{to the subject of}} arteriosclerosis, 3. The arteriolosclerosis, a term reserved for small blood-vessels, in diameter 100 -microns or less. In chapter 1 the design of the cardiological screening of the population in the city of Zutphen is discussed: a search into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, performed in almost the same way as has been done in different foreign countries, coordinated by a number of American Professors. In the Netherlands the whole project is supervised by Prof. Dr. F. S. P. van Buchem, who since 1960 annually repeats the investigation in Zutphen, the cooperation of the citizens being caracterized by the high <b>returning</b> <b>percentage</b> of the examined men. For the investigation from the 2300 men in the 40 - 60 year's age group, 4 out of every 9 names, taken from the alphabetical city register, were invited to come for examination, which selection method resulted into a group of 918 men. Up till 1969 an average annually returning rate of 90 % was obtained. Apart from detailed physical-and laboratory examination, each year different additional medical performances were organized. In 1965, for instance, phonocardiograms were recorded from those participants in whom, in the preceding years, a cardiac murmur-seemingly of the aortic type-had struck the examiners, {{in spite of the fact}} that these examinees had no other signs or symptoms of aortic disease. At the same time this method was applied to a control-group of about the same number of men, in whom no cardiac murmur was noticed [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to find the fitting model and dependence measures of both Thailand’s exchange rate and Malaysia’s exchange rate during, between, and after the World’s recent financial crises based on linear, nonlinear and empirical copula approaches. The results of the study confirm that the nonlinear model (NNTs) is an appropriate model for Thailand’s exchange rate <b>return</b> in <b>percentage</b> during the periods of 2008 - 2011 but not for Malaysia’s exchange rate return. Based on empirical copula approach, the dependence measures are very small between Thailand’s exchange and Malaysia’s exchange. This seems to suggest that when global economy is affected by World’s financial crisis, the nonlinear approach should be used to predict Thailand’s exchange rate <b>return</b> in <b>percentage.</b> In addition, it suggests that both the nonlinear and linear approaches should be used to predict the Malaysia’s exchange rate <b>return</b> in <b>percentage.</b> Moreover, the relationship between the exchange rate of Thailand and that of Malaysia is not strong. This is also true for the currencies of both countries. Linear, Nonlinear, Copulas, Exchange Rate, Thailand, Malaysia The Appropriate Forecasting Model...|$|R

40|$|Described in {{this thesis}} are the {{development}} and use of novel single molecule localization microscopy technologies to gain new insights into (neuronal) microtubule organization. The image quality of single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) depends on a sound optical setup. Aberrations introduced by optical components result in optical distortions, lower photon counts, and a decreased localization precision. Avoiding aberrations or correcting them is therefore of great importance. We show that SMLM deep in biological samples is aided by the use of a deformable mirror to decrease aberrations. At the same time the deformable mirror can be used to encode information about the z-position of molecules allowing them to be localized with high accuracy in three dimensions. Optimized fixation protocols and fluorescent probes are just as important for high quality images. The immunostaining protocol described {{in this thesis}} allows SMLM of microtubules and microtubule associated proteins with low background signal and high labeling density. This protocol was used to show that microtubule organization drastically changes during neuronal development, and that the microtubule associated protein CAMSAP 2 decorates MT minus-ends in neurons. Optimization of fluorescent probes in terms of brightness, <b>return</b> <b>percentage,</b> and size also leads to higher quality SMLM imaging. The commonly used bright monomeric red fluorescent protein mCherry {{turned out to be a}} high quality SMLM probe when exploiting a purely chemical caging mechanism with a <b>return</b> <b>percentage</b> up to 80 %. Other novel probes very small in size, called tubulin nanobodies, were shown to enable investigation of individual microtubules in dense bundles, which is not possible with conventional antibodies. A property of microtubules that cannot be determined with immunostaining is their orientation. We showed, using a processive kinesin motor protein as a probe for SMLM. that the orientation of MTs can be determined in fixed cells and, surprisingly, that there is local orientational order in the dendritic MT array. In conclusion, described in this thesis are the development of novel SMLM methods and their use to find new insights in the neuronal microtubule organization...|$|R

The average <b>percentage</b> <b>return</b> for the combined period is the single year return, R, that is the solution of the following equation: (1 − 0.23)0.5 × (1 + 0.13)2.5 = (1 + R)0.5+2.5, giving an average <b>percentage</b> <b>return</b> R of 0.0600 or 6.00%.|$|R
50|$|A type {{of average}} used in finance {{is the average}} <b>percentage</b> <b>return.</b> It {{is an example of}} a {{geometric}} mean. When the returns are annual, it is called the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). For example, if we are considering a period of two years, and the investment return in the first year is −10% and the return in the second year is +60%, then the average <b>percentage</b> <b>return</b> or CAGR, R, can be obtained by solving the equation: (1 − 10%) × (1 + 60%) = (1 − 0.1) × (1 + 0.6) = (1 + R) × (1 + R). The value of R that makes this equation true is 0.2, or 20%. This means that the total return over the 2-year period is the same as if there had been 20% growth each year. Note that the order of the years makes no difference - the average <b>percentage</b> <b>returns</b> of +60% and −10% is the same result as that for −10% and +60%.|$|R

A couple of papers which used long-term predicting models focused on two regions, China and the US High Plains, show a decrease of about 14 % and 7 %- 17 % respectively in wind power density due to global warming over the next century. This paper focuses on a smaller grid size of 10 km x 10 km to concentrate on a specific wind farm in Pililla, Rizal, Philippines which is considered as a commercially feasible site by wind developers.  Wind energy projection that considers the {{effects of climate change}} for the expected period of operation of 25 years is used because this gives wind developers an outlook on the power production during the wind farm's lifetime and would contribute in determining the wind farm's potential for financial <b>returns.</b> <b>Percentage</b> difference of wind power density between the baseline period of 2008 - 2012 and five-year projection periods from 2013 - 2037 are presented.
