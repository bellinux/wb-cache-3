40|$|We present <b>radial</b> <b>tracks</b> {{for four}} early-type galaxies with {{embedded}} intermediate-scale discs in a modified spin-ellipticity diagram. Here, each galaxy's spin and ellipticity profiles are shown as a <b>radial</b> <b>track,</b> {{as opposed to}} a single, flux-weighted aperture-dependent value as is common in the literature. The use of a single ellipticity and spin parameter is inadequate to capture the basic nature of these galaxies, which transition from fast to slow rotation as one moves to larger radii where the disc ceases to dominate. After peaking, the four galaxy's <b>radial</b> <b>tracks</b> feature a downturn in both ellipticity and spin with increasing radius, differentiating them from elliptical galaxies, and from lenticular galaxies whose discs dominate at large radii. These galaxies are examples of so-called discy elliptical galaxies, which are a morphological hybrid between elliptical (E) and lenticular (S 0) galaxies, and have been designated ES galaxies. The use of spin-ellipticity tracks provides extra structural information about individual galaxies over a single aperture measure. Such tracks provide a key diagnostic for classifying early-type galaxies, particularly in the era of 2 D kinematic (and photometric) data beyond one effective radius.

The design objective {{is that the}} peak of the tracking error in time domain must be as small as possible under persistent bounded disturbances. Since the nonlinear L∞-gain optimal <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> cannot be solved directly, the nonlinear L∞-gain optimal tracking problem is transformed into a nonlinear L∞-gain tracking problem by given a prescribed disturbance attenuation level for the L∞-gain tracking performance. To guarantee that the L∞-gain tracking performance can be achieved for the uncertain robotic systems, a sliding-mode scheme is introduced to eliminate the effect of the parameter uncertainties. By virtue of the skew-symmetric property of the robotic systems, sufficient conditions are developed for solving the robust L∞-gain <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> problems in terms of an algebraic equation instead of a differential equation.

In practice, task-space control of redundant robot systems {{is known to be}} susceptive to modeling errors. Here, data driven learning methods may present an interesting alternative approach. However, learning models for task-space <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> from sampled data is an ill-posed problem. In particular, the same input data point can yield many different output values which can form a non-convex solution space. Because the problem is ill-posed, models cannot be learned from such data using common regression methods.
