30|$|Each {{sensor network}} {{belonging}} to an operator {{is associated with}} a management and database server. The central database server is linked with each gateway and records attributes of the shared network resources. Individual database servers of each network operator are connected to the central database server in order to exchange pricing information. The gateway upon receiving a packet through shared channel updates its database server. These databases are RREQ database and unicast database (Figure 6). RREQ database records the arrivals of RREQ packets. A gateway may receive duplicate RREQ through different paths as a result of flooding but RREQ arriving through the shortest path is added in database after ensuring that RREQ is not registered at other gateways of the same operator. ‘Gateway ID’ is the destination address of the receiving gateway that responds to the RREQ through the shortest path. ‘Source Node ID’ is the ID of the node originating RREQ and ‘RREQ ID’ is the ID of the RREQ packet. Hop count is the minimum hop count value in arriving RREQs. ‘Relay count’ is the hop count in foreign networks identified through their respective ‘Nets’ fields (see Figures  5 and 6). For each arriving RREP or data packet, the gateway updates the unicast database for recording the cost of traversal. This method is useful for measuring the cost of transmission of packets in unicast since the exact number of forwarding by each network is retained in the packet. Figure 7 gives the algorithm at gateway to handle RREQ, RREP or data packets. The database information is periodically updated by individual database servers at the central database server for <b>reconciliation</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> based on predefined network resource sharing agreement.|$|E
