On his collar the king wears as amulets (1) the fork, {{the symbol of the}} weather-god, Adad; (2) a segment of a circle, of uncertain meaning; (3) an eight-pointed star in a disk, here probably the symbol of Shamash, the sun-god; (4) a winged disk, again of the god Ashur. The gesture of the right hand has been much discussed and variously interpreted, either {{as the end of the}} action of throwing a kiss as an act of worship, or as resulting from cracking the fingers with the thumb, as a ritual act which is attributed to the Assyrians by later Greek writers, or as being simply a gesture of authority suitable to the king, with no reference to a particular religious significance. It seems fairly clear that the gesture is described in the phrase 'uban damiqti taraṣu', 'to stretch out a favourable finger', a blessing which corresponds to the <b>reverse</b> <b>action,</b> in which the index finger is not stretched out. There is a cuneiform inscription written across the face and base and around the sides of the stela.|$|E
2500|$|Control action - The {{mathematical}} model and practical loop above both use a [...] "direct" [...] control action {{for all the}} terms, which means an increasing positive error results in an increasing positive control output for the summed terms to apply correction. However, the output is called [...] "reverse" [...] acting if it's necessary to apply negative corrective action. For instance, if the valve in the flow loop was 100-0% valve opening for 0-100% control output - meaning the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this <b>reverse</b> <b>action.</b> An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the fail safe mode, {{in the case of}} loss of signal, would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% controller output needs to cause 100% valve opening.|$|E

In another house, the entrance of a stranger might cause surprise-- perhaps anger, even {{going so far as}} to expel the said stranger with violence: but here, I knew, nothing of the sort could happen. The ordinary course of events first, to think nothing about me; then, hearing my footsteps to look up and see me; and then to wonder what business I had there--would be reversed by the action of my Watch. They would first wonder who I was, then see me, then look down, and think no more about me. And as to being expelled with violence, that event would necessarily come first in this case. [...] "So, if I can once get in," [...] I said to myself, [...] "all risk of expulsion will be over!" ...|$|E

It has been considered difficult due to strong nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties, the effect of which increases {{with the size of}} booms. A human simulated intelligent control scheme is developed to improve control performance by modifying control mode and control parameters. In addition, considering the negative effects caused by frequent and redundant <b>reverse</b> <b>actions</b> of the proportional valve, a double-direction compensation scheme is proposed to deal with the dead-zone nonlinearity of proportional valve. Sinusoidal motions are implemented on a real boom system. The results indicate that HSIC controller can improve control accuracy, and dead-zone nonlinearity is effectively compensated by proposed compensation scheme without introducing frequent <b>reverse</b> <b>actions</b> of proportional valve...|$|R

The proof, therefore, {{appears to}} me complete, that the {{combination}} of the acid with the oxide, in the former experiment, {{had nothing to do with}} the production of the electric current; for the same current is here produced when the action of the acid is absent, and the <b>reverse</b> <b>action</b> of an alkali is present. I think it cannot be supposed for a moment, that the alkali acted chemically as an acid to the oxide formed; on the contrary, our general chemical knowledge leads to the conclusion, that the ordinary metallic oxides act rather as acids to the alkalies; yet that kind of action would tend to give a reverse current in the present case, if any were due to the union of the oxide of the exciting metal with the body which combines with it. But instead of any variation of this sort, the direction of the electricity was constant, and its quantity also directly proportional to the water decomposed, or the zinc oxidized. There are reasons for believing that acids and alkalies, when in contact with metals upon which they cannot act directly, still have a power of influencing their attractions for oxygen (941.); but all the effects in these experiments prove, I think, that it is the oxidation of the metal necessarily dependent upon, and associated as it is with, the electrolyzation of the water (921. 923.) that produces the current; and that the acid or alkali merely acts as solvents, and by removing the oxidized zinc, allows other portions to decompose fresh water, and so continues the evolution or determination of the current.|$|E

50|$|The artistic use of <b>reverse</b> <b>action</b> is {{pervasive}} {{in the films}} of Jean Cocteau. In his Beauty and the Beast (1946), for example, an actor placing {{a piece of paper}} in a fire and then walking backwards away was filmed in reverse motion, causing it to appear as though the character walked up to a fire and pulled the paper out of it. Similar instances are where the petals are peeled off a flower. Cocteau filmed this in reverse motion, making it appear on screen as if the flower comes back to life, with petals rejoining the stem. Yet other examples include Cocteau sketching drawings with a rag and unsmashing pottery, with fragments flying up into his hand and joining together. By the time of Le Testament d'Orphée, use of <b>reverse</b> <b>action</b> was endemic in Cocteau's work, with more than one critic declaring it so overused as to be an embarrassing personal tic.|$|E

The reason was the effect of thermal shock on the rudder which blocked it entirely.

[...] When differentiating between deterrence and compellence, deterrence {{can be described as}} [...] "drawing a line in the sand" [...] and acting only if the adversary crosses it; {{in contrast}}, compellence [...] "requires that the punishment be administered until the other acts rather than if he acts" [...] as in deterrence.

George, a scholar of international relations and former {{professor of political science at}} Stanford University, was a pioneer in the field of political psychology. Like Schelling before him, Alexander George worked to create a diplomatic strategy of coercion; his was the theory of coercive diplomacy. Unlike Schelling, George's theory of 'coercive diplomacy' is different than Schelling's 'coercive warfare', in that he believed that coercive diplomacy was [...] "a subset of coercion and compellence". He viewed it as encompassing [...] "defensive" [...] compellent actions only: to force a target to stop or <b>reverse</b> <b>action</b> already taken, rather than an offensive goal of forcing them to do something ... Coercive diplomacy essentially is the embodiment of a [...] "carrot and stick" [...] philosophy: motivation is used to induce a target to submit to your wishes, while appearing threatening at the same time".|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 95 - 97). We study actions of monoids and monoidal categories, and {{their relations with}} (co) homology theories. We start by discussing actions of monoids via bi-actions. We {{show that there is}} a well-defined functorial <b>reverse</b> <b>action</b> when a monoid action is given, which corresponds to acting by the inverses for group actions. We use this reverse actions to construct a homotopical structure on the category of monoid actions, which allow us to build the Burnside ring of a monoid. Then, we study categorifications of the previously introduced notions. In particular, we study actions of monoidal categories on categories and show that the ideas of action reversing of monoid actions extends to actions of monoidal categories. We use the <b>reverse</b> <b>action</b> for actions of monoidal categories, along with homotopy theory, to define homology, cohomology, homotopy and cohomotopy theories graded over monoidal categories. We show that most of the existing theories fits into our setting; and thus, we unify the existing definitions of these theories. Finally, we construct the spectral sequences for the theories graded over monoidal categories, which are the strongest tools for computation of cohomology and homotopy theories in existence. by Mehmet Akif Erdal.

Measurements of the catalysed exchange of the phosphatidylcholine in the sarcoplasmic-reticulum cytoplasmic monolayer with an exogenous phosphatidylcholine pool suggested that phosphatidylcholine is symmetrically distributed across the sarcoplasmic-reticulum membrane. A similar result was obtained for phosphatidylethanolamine when sarcoplasmic-reticulum lipids were labelled with trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid. Further catalysed lipid-exchange reactions showed that the transverse movement of phosphatidylcholine across the membrane was exceedingly slow (t 1 / 2 greater than 15 days) ...|$|E

40|$|When Samuel Hahnemann devised homoeopathy he {{constructed}} multiple {{arguments that}} both vehemently supported his new system and criticized the conventional medical practice of his day.

Instead, homeopaths found themselves lose significant cognitive ground to their long time conventional rivals with the dawn of the 20 th century, a ground they have not yet recovered. This paper uses the theoretical framework of Berger and Luckmann to analyse the dynamics of the arguments used against homeopathy and suggests that homeopaths failed to adopt a universalizing medical explanation that was available to them: the <b>reverse</b> <b>action</b> of drugs.
