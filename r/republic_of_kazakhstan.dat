40|$|The {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union created a new region of instability. The former <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kazakhstan</b> and Uzbekistan are situated in a strategic region that has garnered the attention of numerous actors in a competition for influence in Central Asia. It also saw the entrance of a most unlikely player: Israel. Since 1948, Israeli foreign policy has been directed at guaranteeing {{the security of the}} nation. Israel responded to the emergence of an independent Central Asia by evaluating the region's potential to impact its security and engaging the region to prevent the emergence of hostile regimes. Israel's strategic objectives in the region were to block Iranian inroads and to expand Tel Aviv's sphere of influence in order to secure the survival of the Israeli state. By constructively engaging Central Asia in diplomatic, economic, and security relations, Israel exerted its influence over the region. In the first ten years of independence, Israel achieved all its objectives. This thesis examines the reasons behind Israel's interests and evaluates its successes. It will explain what threat perceptions drove Israel's relationship with these states and evaluate these possible threats. This will be accomplished through an examination of the relationship and an evaluation of its successes in the advancement of Israeli national security interests. The focus of this study will be on the complex and multifaceted relations between Israel and the <b>republics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kazakhstan</b> and Uzbekistan. This study will examine Israel's multifaceted relationship with these two republics within the framework of Israel's overall nation security policy and foreign policy objectives. This thesis will explore and evaluate Israel's principal relations with these states, including diplomatic relations, development assistance, commercial relations, and security cooperation. These aspects of the relationship will be explored in order to trace Tel Aviv's interest and exposure. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
