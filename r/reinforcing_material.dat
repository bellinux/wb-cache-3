25|$|Materials {{that are}} {{typically}} {{used for the}} rotor blades in wind turbines are composites, as {{they tend to have}} a high stiffness, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and low weight. Typical resins used for these composites include polyester and epoxy, while glass and carbon fibers have been used for the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>material.</b> Construction may use manual layup techniques or composite resin injection molding. As the price of glass fibers is only about one tenth the price of carbon fiber, glass fiber is still dominant.|$|E

The <b>reinforcing</b> <b>material,</b> usually {{a kind of}} fibre, provides the strength and stiffness. The rubber matrix, with low strength and stiffness, provides air-fluid tightness and supports the reinforcing materials to maintain their relative positions. These positions are of great importance because they influence the resulting mechanical properties.|$|E

40|$|Bast fibre reinforced, {{unsaturated}} polyester matrix composites were fabricated using non-woven mats of hemp or jute fibre as reinforcement. Composites were also prepared using {{chopped strand mat}} glass fibre as reinforcement. The short-term mechanical properties of the laminates were assessed. It was observed that at equivalent fibre volume fractions the stiffness of the glass fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>material</b> only marginally exceeded that of the two, unmodified bast fibre, <b>reinforced</b> <b>materials.</b> At equivalent fibre volume fractions, however, {{the strength of the}} glass fibre reinforced composite was found to be significantly greater than that of the bast fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>materials.</b> It was noted that in the bast fibre reinforced composites, the onset of non-linear behaviour occurred at relatively low applied stresses. Work of fracture in static three-point flexure and Charpy impact strength tests, indicated that the toughness of the plant fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>material</b> was as much as an order of magnitude less than that of the glass fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>material.</b> Fracture mechanics techniques were used to further quantify toughness and confirmed this to be so. Furthermore, these tests indicated that the microstructure of the bast fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>material</b> should be examined more closely. Microscopy conducted on the fibres revealed that these were often subject to extensive micro-compressive damage. It was postulated that uneven fibre straining characteristics could lead to compromised interfacial properties, which might in turn detrimentally affect the macroscopic behaviour of the composite. A technique known as half fringe photoelasticity was used to investigate the stress-field in the matrix surrounding the fibre defects. It was observed that not only did concentrations of stress occur in the vicinity of these, but also that the shear stress distribution {{along the length of the}} fibre was interrupted by the presence of the defects. The implications of fibre defects upon composite properties are discussed...|$|R

50|$|While it {{is common}} to {{associate}} polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a <b>reinforcing</b> <b>material</b> like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion.

The long WS, SG and HB (length up to 10 cm) with simple cut or split and without chemical treatment, were used directly in the composites.

Lightweight composites are preferred, especially for automotive applications due to the potential saving in energy. In this research, the effects of manufacturing parameters, such as concentrations, lengths, widths and split configurations of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>materials,</b> on the properties of composites have been studied.
