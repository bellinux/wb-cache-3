40|$|Trusses {{used for}} roof support in coal mines are {{constructed}} of two grouted bolts installed at opposing forty-five degree angles into the <b>roof</b> and a <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> that ties the angled bolts together. The {{load on the}} <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is vertical, which is transverse to the longitudinal axis, and therefore the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> is loaded in the weakest direction. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the vertical load capacity and deflection of three different types of <b>cross</b> <b>members.</b> Single-point load tests, with the load applied {{in the center of}} the specimen and double-point load tests, with a span of 2. 4 m, were conducted. For the single-point load configuration, the yield of the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> was nominally 98 kN of vertical load, achieved at 42 cm of deflection. For cable <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> yield was not achieved even after 45 cm of deflection. Peak vertical loads were about 89 kN for 17 mm cables and 67 kN for the 15 mm cables. For the double-point load configurations, the 25 mm solid bar <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> yielded at 150 kN of vertical load and 25 cm of deflection. At 25 cm of deflection individual cable strands started breaking at 133 and 111 kN of vertical load for the 17 and 15 mm cable <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> respectively.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{infrared}} (IR) local heating method drastically reduces springback of advanced high-strength steels (AHSSs). Though the IR local heating method saves heating energy because it utilizes focused IR rays to heat only the plastic deformation zone, there has yet to be an attempt to show that the heating method can be applied to industrial manufacturing processes. In this work, the IR local heating method is used to manufacture a seat <b>cross</b> <b>member.</b> Seat <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> require high strength because they are responsible for protecting passengers from broadside collisions. Although AHSS is preferred in seat <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> the large amount of springback of AHSS makes a problem in the accuracy of the shape. This work verifies that the IR local heating method is able to make the seat <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> with the target shape in the manufacturing process. A thermo-mechanical analysis was also conducted with the finite element method to discuss the springback results...|$|R

40|$|New {{requirements}} {{from the}} automotive industry regarding light weight design request the realization of structural parts with maximum strength over 1, 000 MPa. On the other hand, demands concerning part complexity, function integration and part quality become higher and higher. The press hardening technology of boron-manganese alloyed steel for blank based part applications represent {{the state of the}} art. Typical applications are reinforcement parts in crash relevant car body structures. The consequently using of such parts allows to fulfil the requests of current and future cars regarding crash performance at acceptable structural weights. Beside press hardening parts also hydroformed profiles enable a high potential for applications in structural car body elements with high loads. By this, hydroforming of tubes and blanks at room temperature represents also {{the state of the art}} for several applications in car body structures or exhaust systems, but also for special applications outside the car industry. These parts are mainly made from materials such as steel, high-strength steel, stainless steel and aluminium. Originating from increased demands for hydroformed parts regarding maximum strength and complexity the limits of conventional hydroforming processes are reached. The use of temperature as a process parameter in hydroforming offers the chance to increase the application field of this innovative technology. The potential of this strategy was proven; complex car body parts of aluminium and magnesium were realized at elevated temperatures. However, today available fluids can only be used up to 300 C because of the limited thermal resistance of the available fluids. Gaseous media (e. g. nitrogen) offer the chance to use the potential of temperature-supported hydroforming also in steel forming. Consequently, temperatures up to 1, 0000 ́ 3 C can be provided. In analogy to hot stamping processes for blanks, it is also possible to combine the gas forming process with a special heat treatment and to realize closed structural parts with highest strength in anthology to applications of hydroformed car body structures, such as A-pillars (BMW, VOLVO, OPEL), <b>roof</b> rails (AUDI), <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> (BMW), crash cans (VOLVO) or sill reinforcement parts (AUDI, VOLVO), in serial production...|$|R

This was dispensed with on the strutted variant, which also had an extra frame strut towards the rear and normal to the lower girder.|$|R
