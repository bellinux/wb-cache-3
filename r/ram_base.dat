A <b>RAM</b> <b>base</b> on the asteroid is awaiting the arrival of the pirate [...] "Talon", who has been sent to rescue the staff from the base due to a series of experimental gennies that have escaped and overrun the base. The team can bluff their way in and claim to have been sent on Talons behalf. In the depths of the base the team discovers that the scientists were attempting to replicate the ECG's first encountered upon the Maelstrom Rider, in addition to working on an unusually powerful laser.|$|E
50|$|Following this, {{the player}} is sent {{on a mission}} to Mars itself, to {{infiltrate}} the <b>RAM</b> <b>base,</b> Gradivus Mons. On Mars, the player meets the Desert Runners, a slender, athletic, warrior-like people who have been genetically engineered with canine and feline attributes in order to more easily adapt to the Martian desert environment, and live without the assistance of most technology. Prior to the meeting, the player becomes aware of an impending RAM attack on the natives' city, but is unable to earn their trust before the attack begins. In a parallel {{to the beginning of the}} game, the party must repel the RAM attack, and fights alongside Desert Runner NPCs in combat. The RAM troops engaged in this battle are much tougher (and more numerous) than the NEO attack at the beginning of the game, and growing enemy numbers begin to become a theme of the game. The party earns the trust and respect of the Desert Runners, and their leader, Tuskon, helps the party infiltrate Gradivus Mons and destroy the Doomsday Laser prototype along with the entire base.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to design a tool for moderate cross section reduction of bars that are deformed within a channel slider tool that is used for equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE). The bars that are deformed via ECAE have an initial square cross section with a nominal value of 1. 00 in 2 and aspect ratios (length/width) ranging between 4 and 6. A systems engineering design methodology is used to generate a topbottom approach {{in the development of}} the tool's design. This includes defining a need statement, which is the "Need for an area reduction extrusion tool to replace the current practices of machining ECAE processed billets". The system functions and requirements are defined next and used to generate three concepts that are compared to select the winning concept for further refinement. Major components of the selected tool are: a container, <b>ram,</b> <b>base</b> plate, punch plate, four die-inserts, four wedges and four flange locks. For materials, such as copper (C 10100) and aluminum (Al 6061 -T 6), that can be processed by this tool, the upper bound extrusion pressure, which is derived by limit analysis, is set at 192 ksi. The upper bound extrusion pressure is constrained by the buckling limit of the ram, which is 202 ksi. The maximum wall stress experienced by the container is 113 ksi. For materials with the same cross section and dimensions, fixed end conditions of the Ram support larger bucking loads when compared to other end conditions such as rounded ends or rounded-fixed ends. With the application of the upper bound method, an increase in the extrusion ratio of the tool causes a corresponding rise in the optimal cone angle of the die further translating to a rise in the extrusion pressure...|$|E

It is also indicated how one could use it to polynomially solve 3 -SAT and briefly mention how could one train this novel model. ...|$|R

40|$|Designing {{breeding}} schemes {{suitable for}} smallholder livestock production systems in developing regions has hitherto been a challenge. The suggested schemes either {{do not address}} farmers’ breeding goals (centralized station-based nucleus schemes) or yield slow genetic progress (village-based schemes). A new breeding scheme that integrates the merits of previously suggested schemes has been designed for Menz sheep improvement in Ethiopia. It involves selection based on breeding values in nucleus flocks to produce elite rams, a one-time only provision of improved rams to villagers and a follow-up village-based selection to sustain genetic progress in village flocks. Here, we assessed whether conventional selection of breeding <b>rams</b> <b>based</b> on breeding values for production traits, which is the practice in station-based nucleus flocks, meets farmers’ breeding objectives. We also elicited determinants of farmers’ ram choice. Low but significant correlations were found between rankings of <b>rams</b> <b>based</b> on farmers’ selection criteria, estimated breeding values (EBV) and body weight (BW). Appearance traits (such as color and horn) and meat production traits (BW and linear size traits) significantly determined farmers’ breeding ram choice. The results imply that conventional selection criteria based solely on EBV for production traits do not address farmers’ trait preferences fully, but only partially. Thus, a two-stage selection procedure involving selection on breeding values in nucleus centers followed by farmers’ selection among top- ranking candidate rams is recommended. This approach accommodates farmers’ preferences and speeds up genetic progress in village-based selection. The Menz sheep scheme could be applied elsewhere with similar situations to transform conventional station-based nucleus breeding activities into participatory breeding programs...|$|R
