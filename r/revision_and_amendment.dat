60|$|This {{could be}} {{understood}} {{only as a}} formal demand that the President should acknowledge his own incompetency to perform his duties, content himself with the amusement of distributing post-offices, and resign his power as to all important affairs {{into the hands of}} his Secretary of State. It seems to-day incomprehensible how a statesman of Seward's calibre could at that period conceive a plan of policy in which the slavery question had no place; a policy which rested upon the utterly delusive assumption that the secessionists, who had already formed their Southern Confederacy and were with stern resolution preparing to fight for its independence, could be hoodwinked back into the Union by some sentimental demonstration against European interference; a policy which, at that critical moment, would have involved the Union in a foreign war, thus inviting foreign intervention in favor of the Southern Confederacy, and increasing tenfold its chances in the struggle for independence. But it is equally incomprehensible how Seward could fail to see that this demand of an unconditional surrender was a mortal insult {{to the head of the}} government, and that by putting his proposition on paper he delivered himself into the hands of the very man he had insulted; for, had Lincoln, as most Presidents would have done, instantly dismissed Seward, and published the true reason for that dismissal, it would inevitably have been the end of Seward's career. But Lincoln did what not many of the noblest and greatest men in history would have been noble and great enough to do. He considered that Seward was still capable of rendering great service to his country in the place in which he was, if rightly controlled. He ignored the insult, but firmly established his superiority. In his reply, which he forthwith despatched, he told Seward that the administration had a domestic policy as laid down in the inaugural address with Seward's approval; that it had a foreign policy as traced in Seward's despatches with the President's approval; that if any policy was to be maintained or changed, he, the President, was to direct that on his responsibility; and that in performing that duty the President had a right to the advice of his secretaries. Seward's fantastic schemes of foreign war and continental policies Lincoln brushed aside by passing them over in silence. Nothing more was said. Seward must have felt that he was at the mercy of a superior man; that his offensive proposition had been generously pardoned as a temporary aberration of a great mind, and that he could atone for it only by devoted personal loyalty. This he did. He was thoroughly subdued, and thenceforth submitted to Lincoln his despatches for <b>revision</b> <b>and</b> <b>amendment</b> without a murmur. The war with European nations was no longer thought of; the slavery question found in due time its proper place in the struggle for the Union; and when, at a later period, the dismissal of Seward was demanded by dissatisfied senators, who attributed to him the shortcomings of the administration, Lincoln stood stoutly by his faithful Secretary of State.|$|E

5000|$|Case E-16/11 Icesave {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the landmark case of the EFTA Court case, mainly due to its relation to the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis and Directive 94/19/EC on deposit-guarantee schemes, which had also been transposed into EEA law. This directive obliged EU and EEA EFTA states to create deposit-guarantee schemes. Deposit-guarantee schemes reimburse a limited amount of deposits to depositors where their bank has failed, as a way to protect a part of depositors’ wealth from bank failures. In Icesave, the EFTA Court dealt with an action by the EFTA Surveillance Authority against Iceland. The Authority claimed that Iceland had violated the transposed Directive and thus EEA law in the aftermath of its major economic crisis and the collapse of the Icelandic banking sector in 2008, by failing to ensure that British and Dutch depositors using the ‘Icesave’ accounts offered by Icelandic banks received the minimum amount of compensation set out in Article 7(1) of the Directive. The Court noted that the nature of the result to be achieved fell to be determined by the substantive provisions of the particular directive. Moreover, it noted {{that as a result of}} the economic crisis, the regulatory framework of the financial system had been subject to <b>revision</b> <b>and</b> <b>amendment</b> in order to enhance financial stability. But the Court held that the Directive did not envisage the alleged obligation of result to ensure payment to depositors in the Dutch and British branches of Icelandic banks in a systemic crisis of the magnitude experienced in Iceland or how to proceed in a case where the guarantee scheme was unable to cope with its payment obligations remained largely unanswered by the Directive, with its Article 7(6) being the only operative provision that deals with non-payment. Still, the relevant question in Icesave was whether the EEA States are legally responsible under the Directive in an event of such magnitude. The Court held that the principle of non-discrimination requires that there to be no difference in treatment of depositors by the guarantee scheme itself and the way in which it uses its funds. Discrimination under the Directive is prohibited but the transfer of domestic deposits from some entities to new ones was made before the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority, Fjármálaeftirlitið, rendered its declaration that triggered the application of the Directive. Thus, depositor protection under the Directive never applied to depositors in Icelandic branches of the affected banks. Accordingly, the transfer of domestic deposits did not fall within the scope of the non-discrimination principle as stipulated by the Directive and could not lead to an infringement of the aforementioned provisions of the Directive read in light of Article 4 EEA.|$|E

40|$|For {{reasons that}} are unclear to me, the {{committees}} reviewing the articles of the Uniform Commercial Code <b>and</b> drafting <b>revisions</b> are congenitally conservative.

40|$|Underground {{coalmining}} is {{a notorious}} industry {{due to its}} poor safety record. During the early 20 th century, the Australian underground coal mining industry was suffering from unacceptably high annual death rate. Today, Australian mining industry has developed safe working practices, rules and regulations and provides a safer working environment for miners. However, accidents and fatalities still occur and threaten the health and life of miners. Explosive atmosphere management is critical {{to ensure the safety}} of personnel and the mine itself. In order to achieve the final goal of zero harm, this research attempts to investigate the pattern of safety improvement by reviewing the Australian underground coal mine history. A time period from 1887 - 2007 is considered. Explosion control has some revolutionary improvements in both reducing the number of fatalities and fatality rates. The analysis of data has shown that mine explosions contributed to 74. 58 % of fatal injuries during 1887 - 1946; whereas, roof/side fall and machinery related accidents are contributing to 71 % fatal injuries during 1947 - 2007. Over a century, a sophisticated legalisation system was built resulting in a dramatic improvement of underground coal mine explosion control performance. Several important <b>revisions</b> <b>and</b> <b>amendments</b> were made throughout this long period of progress. Roof falls and machinery gradually became the greater issue than explosions. As the continued amendment of existing regulation, the focus of the future legalisation will move on to specific regulations to specific mines according to different geological conditions, mining method and other varieties of aspects...|$|R

40|$|The South Atlantic rift basin {{evolved as}} {{branch of a}} large Jurassic-Cretaceous intraplate rift zone between the African and South American plates during the final breakup of western Gondwana. By quantitatively {{accounting}} for crustal deformation in the Central and West African rift zone, we indirectly construct the kinematic history of the pre-breakup evolution of the conjugate West African-Brazilian margins. Our model suggests a causal link between changes in extension direction and velocity during continental extension and the generation of marginal structures such as the enigmatic Pre-salt sag basin and the São Paulo High. We model an initial E-W directed extension between South America and Africa (fixed in present-day position) at very low extensional velocities until Upper Hauterivian times (≈ 126 Ma) when rift activity along in the equatorial Atlantic domain started to increase significantly. During this initial ≈ 17 Myr-long stretching episode the Pre-salt basin width on the conjugate Brazilian and West African margins is generated. An intermediate stage between 126. 57 Ma and Base Aptian is characterised by strain localisation, rapid lithospheric weakening in the equatorial Atlantic domain, resulting in both progressively increasing extensional velocities {{as well as a}} significant rotation of the extension direction to NE-SW. Final breakup between South America and Africa occurred in the conjugate Santos [...] Benguela margin segment at around 113 Ma and in the Equatorial Atlantic domain between the Ghanaian Ridge and the Piauí-Ceará margin at 103 Ma. We conclude that such a multi-velocity, multi-directional rift history exerts primary control on the evolution of this conjugate passive margins systems and can explain the first order tectonic structures along the South Atlantic and possibly other passive margins.

40|$|In Istanbul, {{especially}} after 1980 s, {{economic and social}} policies are the major axis that constitutes the development dynamics of the metropol. The urban sprawl began with the rapid urbanization process and has continued with the increasing concentration caused by individual housing solutions and changes in real estate development policies. In this period, although planning attributes an increased importance, the spatial character of the period can be determined as the excessive concentration in built up area and low density expansion in the periphery of Istanbul. During this period, - However, due to the implementations of the plans there emerged a structure, where the local plans constantly underwent <b>revisions</b> <b>and</b> <b>amendments,</b> - Furthermore, {{in contrast to the}} preparation of broad scale plans, the development of housing is directed by projects that independent from the plans. - Until 1990 s, the public lands are used as a tool for creating healthier city, but in 2000 s public lands are seen as the tools that provides annuity. These are the examples of changing paradigms and problems in the housing development. With the changing socio-economic and technological conditions housing preserve its characteristic of being a major cumulative problem. In this context, current developments such as "urban renaissance", "smart growth" approaches are defined as the main principles of the new housing development process in 1990 s. However from the mid- 2000 s, the experiences based on these trends, are questioned with highlighting the 'urban capacity' contradictions. After 1990 public- private sector partnerships or only private sector has begun to develop mass housing projects in Istanbul. These projects are high-density projects, furthermore structuring conditions of the projects are against to construction regulations and the equipment standards (education, health facilities and green space) are ignored.

40|$|Purpose – Penn World Tables (PWT) data on output {{measured}} at international prices are the data {{most frequently used}} in cross-country growth regressions. These data are subject to <b>revision,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>amendments</b> can be substantial for a minority of countries, although negligible for most. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the effect of data revisions on research results using the data. Design/methodology/approach – Using Hanushek and Kimko's analysis of the relationship between growth and schooling quality and Sala-i-Martin's tests of model selection, the authors investigate how much the results of cross-country growth regressions vary if the most recent vintage (6. 2) of PWT data is used, rather than the previous vintage (6. 1). Findings – The variation is substantial enough to imply significant differences in research results using different vintages of the PWT data. Practical implications – The results reinforce the case for examining the sensitivity of growth regressions to outliers, which may be subject to subsequent data revision that might substantially affect the conclusions. Originality/value – Previous research has identified significant revisions between successive vintages of PWT growth data, but has implied that this is not likely to affect the results of cross-country growth regressions based on long-run averages rather than on annual data. The findings suggest that this is not necessarily the case. Data revisions, Economic growth, Education, Growth, Model selection...|$|R
