40|$|Syndrome-based Multimedia coding), a video coding {{paradigm}} {{based on}} the principles of distributed compression from multi-user information theory. The theoretical framework for PRISM is based on that of lossy source coding with side information (Wyner-Ziv) with the important twist that unlike the classical coding with side information setup, PRISM is based on uncertainty at both encoder and decoder about the “state” of the side-information known at the <b>receiver.</b> <b>Resting</b> heavily on channel coding concepts, PRISM represents a major departure from current popular video coding architectures (such as the MPEGx and H. 26 x series) based on motion-compensated prediction. Aimed at removing some of the architectural limitations of existing video codecs, the architectural goals of PRISM are (i) to have a flexible distribution of computational complexity between encoder and decoder without compromising compression performance; (ii) to have inbuilt robustness to “drift ” between encoder and decoder, e. g. due to channel loss; and (iii) to have a light yet rich encoding syntax that permits unencumbered innovating within the standard. In this paper, we describe an instance of PRISM corresponding to a near reversal in codec complexities with respect to today’s codecs. This leads to a novel light encoder and heavy decoder paradigm. Specifically, we show the feasibility of moving the expensive motion search component of the video codec from the encoder to the decoder. The ideal is to marry the encoding lightness and robustness of intraframe coding (motion-JPEG) with the compression efficiency of interframe coding (full-motion MPEG). Our preliminary simulation results based on a block-DCT implementation of PRISM based on very simple trellis codes reveal its strikingly superior performance potential of PRISM to the standards-based codecs in the realm of packet/frame drops, making it an attractive candidate for wireless video applications.

In DSL, the primary user who has the license for {{a part of the}} bandwidth, decides to lease it to a secondary user or not. In this paper, we assume an OFDM-based system and perform the leasing operation in this system where the primary user leases the spectrum for a number of OFDM symbols to secondary users in exchange of a better quality-of-service achieved by secondary network cooperation. The secondary users use a part of the spectrum for relaying the primary data to the primary <b>receiver</b> and the <b>rest</b> of the spectrum for their own transmissions. More precisely, we propose a time-frequency domain leasing scheme. Simulation results show that both primary and secondary users benefit from this proposed spectrum sharing strategy. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} show the {{principle}} viability of a recently proposed relativistic positioning method based {{on the use of}} pulsed signals from sources at infinity, we present an application example reconstructing the world-line of an idealized Earth in the reference frame of distant pulsars. The method considers the null four-vectors built from the period of the pulses and the direction cosines of the propagation from each source. Starting from a simplified problem (a <b>receiver</b> at <b>rest)</b> {{we have been able to}} calibrate our procedure, evidencing the influence of the uncertainty on the arrival times of the pulses as measured by the receiver, and of the numerical treatment of the data. The most relevant parameter turns out to be the accuracy of the clock used by the receiver. Actually the uncertainty used in the simulations combines both the accuracy of the clock and the fluctuations in the sources. As an evocative example the method has then been applied to the case of an ideal observer moving as a point on the surface of the Earth. The input have been the simulated arrival times of the signals from four pulsars at the location of the Parkes radiotelescope in Australia. Some substantial simplification have been made both excluding the problems of visibility due to the actual size of the planet, and the behaviour of the sources. A rough application of the method to a three days run gives a correct result with a poor accuracy. The accuracy is then enhanced to the order of a few hundred meters if a continuous set of data is assumed. The method could actually be used for navigation across the solar system and be based on artificial sources, rather than pulsars.

Methods and Results—In 29 patients with coronary artery disease (687 years of age, 2 women, 328 % ejection fraction), wall motion was evaluated semiquantitatively by MRI before and 3 months after revascularization. SCAR and DSMR were performed before revascularization. The transmural extent of scar was assessed semiquantitatively. Binary prediction of RECOVERY was performed by logistic regression in 288 segments with wall motion abnormalities at <b>rest.</b> <b>Receiver</b> operating characteristic–area under curve (AUC) statistics were used to compare different models. Low-dose DSMR (AUC 0. 838) was superior to SCAR (AUC 0. 728) in predicting RECOVERY. SCAR did not improve accuracy of prediction by DSMR. Subgroup analysis showed superiority of DSMR for 1 % to 74 % transmural extent of infarction. Conclusions—Low-dose DSMR is superior to SCAR in predicting RECOVERY.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} design and {{implementation}} of a linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) receiver in asynchronous bandlimited direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems that employ long-code pseudo-noise (PN) sequences and operate in multipath environments. The receiver is shown {{to be capable of}} multiple-access interference (MAI) suppression and multipath diversity combining without the knowledge of other users' signature sequences. It outperforms any other linear receiver by maximizing output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) {{with the aid of a}} new chip filter which exploits the cyclostationarity of the received signal and combines all paths of the desired user that fall within its supported time span. This work is motivated by the shortcomings of existing LMMSE receivers which are either incompatible with long-code CDMA or constrained by limitations in the system model. The design methodology is based on the concept of linear/conjugate linear (LCL) filtering and satisfying the orthogonality conditions to achieve the LMMSE filter response. Moreover, the proposed LMMSE receiver addresses two drawbacks of the coherent Rake receiver, the industry's current solution for multipath reception. First, unlike the Rake receiver which uses the chip-matched filter (CMF) and treats interference as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), the LMMSE receiver suppresses interference by replacing the CMF with a new chip pulse filter. Second, in contrast to the Rake receiver which only processes a subset of strongest paths of the desired user, the LMMSE receiver harnesses the energy of all paths of the desired user that fall within its time support, at no additional complexity. The performance of the proposed LMMSE receiver is analyzed and compared with that of the coherent Rake receiver with probability of bit error, Pe, as the figure of merit. The analysis is based on the accurate improved Gaussian approximation (IGA) technique. Closed form conditional Pe expressions for both the LMMSE and Rake receivers are derived. Furthermore, it is shown that if quadriphase random spreading, moderate to large spreading factors, and pulses with small excess bandwidth are used, the widely-used standard Gaussian Approximation (SGA) technique becomes accurate even for low regions of Pe. Under the examined scenarios tailored towards current narrowband system settings, the LMMSE receiver achieves 60 % gain in capacity (1. 8 dB in output SNR) over the selective Rake receiver. A third of the gain is due to interference suppression capability of the <b>receiver</b> while the <b>rest</b> is credited to its ability to collect the energy of the desired user diversified to many paths. Future wideband systems will yield an ever larger gain. Adaptive implementations of the LMMSE receiver are proposed to rid the receiver from dependence on the knowledge of multipath parameters. The adaptive receiver is based on a fractionally-spaced equalizer (FSE) whose taps are updated by an adaptive algorithm. Training-based, pilot-channel-aided (PCA), and blind algorithms are developed to make the receiver applicable to both forward and reverse links, with or without the presence of pilot signals. The blind algorithms are modified versions of the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) which has not been previously studied for long-code CDMA systems. Extensive simulation results are presented to illustrate the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithms and quantify their performance loss under various levels of MAI. Computational complexities of the algorithms are also discussed. These three criteria (performance loss, convergence rate, and computational complexity) determine the proper choice of an adaptive algorithm with respect to the requirements of the specific application in mind...|$|R
