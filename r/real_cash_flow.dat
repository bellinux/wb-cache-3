In those papers, the use of real economic value added based on the real free cash flow was suggested. This means the <b>real</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> calculated from the immediately previous period. In Velez-Pareja (1999 a and 2000), a methodology was presented to determine and to construct the free cash flow of a firm.

His general equilibrium approaches stresses the interaction of the demand for financial assets with the decision to accumulate productive capital.

This paper examines the empirical linkage between fundamental returns on physical corporate assets and market return on financial claims on those assets. It defines the fundamental return as <b>real</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> divided by replacement cost.

40|$|This paper explores time {{variation}} in bond risk, {{as measured by}} the covariation of bond returns with stock returns and with consumption growth, and in the volatility of bond returns. A robust stylized fact in empirical finance is that the spread between the yield on long-term bonds and short-term bonds forecasts positively future excess returns on bonds at varying horizons, and that the short-term nominal interest rate forecasts positively stock return volatility and exchange rate volatility. This paper presents evidence that movements in both the short-term nominal interest rate and the yield spread are positively related to changes in subsequent realized bond risk and bond return volatility. The yield spread appears to proxy for business conditions, while the short rate appears to proxy for inflation and economic uncertainty. A decomposition of bond betas into a <b>real</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> risk component, and a discount rate risk component shows that yield spreads have offsetting effects in each component. A widening yield spread is correlated with reduced cash-flow (or inflationary) risk for bonds, but it is also correlated with larger discount rate risk for bonds. The short rate forecasts only the discount rate component of bond beta. JEL classification: G 12...|$|E
40|$|A key {{input to}} the capital {{budgeting}} process {{is the cost of}} capital. Financial managers most often use the CAPM to estimate the cost of capital for which they need to know the market risk premium. Textbooks advocate using the historical value for the US equity premium as the market risk premium. The CAPM as a model has been seriously challenged in the academic literature. In addition, recent research indicates that the true market risk premium might have been as low as half the historical US equity premium during the last two decades. If business finance courses have been teaching the use of the wrong model along with wrong inputs for 20 years, why has no one complained? We provide an answer to this puzzle. The classic rule for making capital budgeting decisions is to take projects with positive Net Present Value (NPV). Consider a project that generates an annual, <b>real</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> of 100, 000 forever, starting one year from now. The initial investment is 1, 600, 000. To decide whether to invest in this project or not, we discount all future cash flows and subtract the initial investment to get the NPV. The decision rule is then simple: If the NPV is positive, take it; if the NPV is negative, leave it. The current textbooks used in all major MBA courses advise financial managers to calculate the cost of capital based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The project’...|$|E

It is necessary to reconstruct existing large-scale public buildings for large-scale public buildings having the characteristics of high-energy consumption and low-energy efficiency. Existing building retrofit is a system engineering involving technology, policy and management. There are fewer large-scale public building retrofit projects and the major funding is from national financial subsidies. There is no expediting financing channel and flexible financing mode. Therefore, this study designs asset-backed securitization (ABS) as the main financing mode according to steady future income of existing large-scale public buildings retrofit. That is, we secure the steady future income of existing large-scale public buildings retrofit, and sell it to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) through a series of asset structure optimizations and reorganizations so as to transfer stagnant assets or unforeseeable future incomes into <b>real</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> through issuing securities. This liquid cash flow can ensure the funds needed by existing large-scale public buildings retrofit. The ABS financing mode can satisfy the fund requirements of this project and reduce the ratio of liabilities to assets.

This result implies that the long bull market that began in 1982 can be partially attributed to the stock market's shift from a state of undervaluation to one of overvaluation.

RAM payments resulted in median <b>real</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> increases of 11 to 18 percent during the ten year analysis period. Between 25 and 35 percent of poverty households moved above the line with use of a RAM. ^ Median real net worth increased 33 percent over the decade, enough to offset depletion of net home equity due to RAM use. Fifty-one percent of respondents ended the decade with higher net worth, even with RAM use. For 12 percent, net worth decreased if a RAM was simulated. ^ Separate analysis of low-income households showed even greater cash flow increments (17 to 23 percent) and comparable net worth changes. For 14 percent, net worth decreased with a RAM; 43 percent had higher net worth at the end, even with RAM use. ^ The effect of RAM use by public assistance recipients was analyzed by assuming several patterns for offsets against benefits. Treating RAM payments as earned income was the only offset format which allowed significant improvement in cash flow. Because of low home value, the benefits for this group are too low to justify {{the widespread use of}} RAMs by public assistance recipients. ^ Asset depletion results differed according to the time period selected.

40|$|The {{earnings}} yield, {{determined by}} the ratio of reported earnings to price, is frequently used to predict real return. Complications characterize the predictions, however, because reported earnings are not real. This research identifies an adjusted earnings yield that ensures that real return can be determined as a ratio of current-period prices. From freely accessible and publicly disseminated data, an adjusted-earnings-yield series is created for the U. S. equity market. Statistical tests indicate that this measure {{is a much better}} predictor of future real returns than are other popular valuation measures. wo correct methods are used for computing expected return. The first is to determine a nominal (inflation-affected) discount rate that equates the present value of the asset’s nominal expected <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> to its price. The sec-ond is to remove the effect of inflationary expecta-tions on nominal <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and then determine a real discount rate that equates the present value of the asset’s <b>real</b> expected <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> to price. Econ-omists frequently prefer the second method because <b>real</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> tend to be more stable and, therefore, easier to predict than their nominal coun-terparts. Investors should also focus on real expected returns because their typical concern is to improve purchasing power. Consistent with this line of reasoning, the earn-ings yield (the reciprocal of the P/E) is commonly labeled a reasonable approximation of the real expected return to equity (see Siegel 2005 for a recent example). To see why, assume that the market value of equity, S, can be estimated by using the constant-growth dividend discount model (DDM) of Gordon (1962) presented in Equation 1, where Div repre-sents dividends and where expected return, r, and dividend growth, g, are both assumed real: (1) Rearranging the terms in Equation 1 results i...|$|R

This research investigated whether banks are successful in adapting to changes in the economy, by comparing the realised returns generated before and after the financial collapse, at an individual loan account level. Banks that have superior credit risk pricing models, driven by a pro-active credit risk department, will survive the onslaught of future economic downturns and come out stronger and more competitive. Individual loan data was collected from a credit provider to establish whether credit departments are pro-active in assessing credit risk and pricing for it accurately, in the context of a changing economic environment. Based on the results, banks are not successful in pricing through economic cycles.

40|$|This {{working paper}} seeks to {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} real estate in the capital gains issue, indicating the quantitative orders of magnitude involved. We offer two main observations. First, generous capital consumption allowances (CCAs) greatly magnify the proportion newly constructed buildings, of course, but also on land and old buildings being sold and resold. Our tax code allows for properties to be re- depreciated by their new owners after a sale or swap, permitting real estate investors to recapture principal again and again on the same structure. When CCAs have been excessive relative to true economic depreciation, as they were during in the 1980 s, capital gains have been commensurately larger than the actual increase in property prices. Second, very little of <b>real</b> estate <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> is taxable as ordinary income, so {{the capital gains tax}} is currently the only major federal levy paid by the real estate industry. CCAs and tax-deductible mortgage interest payments combine to exempt most of <b>real</b> estate <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> from the income tax. This encourages debt pyramiding as it throws the burden of public finance onto other taxpayers. A central conclusion of our study is that better statistics on asset values and capital gains are needed-or, more to the point, a better accounting format. The economic effects of a capital gains tax depend upon how the gains are made. The present GNP/NIPA format fails to differentiate between wealth and overhead; between value from production and value from obligation. In particular, theory and measurement should distinguish real estate from other sources of capital gains-and, within the category of real estate, distinguish land from built improvements. Markets for immovable structures and for land have distinctive inherent feature and are shaped by distinctive institutional constraints. ...|$|R

The results of formal comparative statics analysis show that the lender's percentage participation is, in general, positively related to changes in the loan-to-value ratio and threshold <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> above which participation is payable. Among yet other results, a change in the contracted loan life has an ambiguous effect on the lender's percentage participation.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{accuracy}} and real-time {{of all kinds of}} information in the cash business, and solve the problem which accuracy and stability is not high of the data linkage between cash inventory forecasting and cash management information in the commercial bank, a hybrid learning algorithm is proposed based on adaptive population activity particle swarm optimization (APAPSO) algorithm combined with the least squares method (LMS) to optimize the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model parameters. Through the introduction of metric function of population diversity to ensure the diversity of population and adaptive changes in inertia weight and learning factors, the optimization ability of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is improved, which avoids the premature convergence problem of the PSO algorithm. The simulation comparison experiments are carried out with BP-LMS algorithm and standard PSO-LMS by adopting <b>real</b> commercial banks’ <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed time series prediction of bank <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> based on improved PSO-ANFIS optimization method. Simulation results show that the optimization speed is faster and the prediction accuracy is higher...|$|R
