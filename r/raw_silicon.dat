50|$|Usually, silicon wafers {{are used}} as {{substrates}} for bulk micromachining, {{as they can be}} anisotropically wet etched, forming highly regular structures. Wet etching typically uses alkaline liquid solvents, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) or tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) to dissolve silicon which has been left exposed by the photolithography masking step. These alkali solvents dissolve the silicon in a highly anisotropic way, with some crystallographic orientations dissolving up to 1000 times faster than others.

The raw wafer is engineered by the growth of an ultrapure, virtually defect-free silicon layer through epitaxy. In the most advanced logic devices, prior to the silicon epitaxy step, tricks are performed to improve the performance of the transistors to be built. One method involves introducing a straining step wherein a silicon variant such as silicon-germanium (SiGe) is deposited. Once the epitaxial silicon is deposited, the crystal lattice becomes stretched somewhat, resulting in improved electronic mobility. Another method, called silicon on insulator technology involves the insertion of an insulating layer between the <b>raw</b> <b>silicon</b> wafer and the thin layer of subsequent silicon epitaxy.

We transfer a two-step MACE method from Si wafers to Si powder.

SEM micrographs showed that the two-step MACE method enabled the grooving of densely packed films of SiNWs having lengths ranging from 0.2 to 10  μm. On the basis of XRD patterns and Raman spectroscopy, we showed that the nanowires were perfectly crystalline, oriented perpendicularly or tilted to the facets of the SiμGs. We evidenced that MACE enhances the apparent crystalline structure of the Si powder.

Its advantage is not only saving energy-intensive silicon material: thin wafers have lower requirements on the carrier lifetime since reasonable cell results can already be reached with small effective diffusion lengths. The Ribbon on Sacrificial Template (RST) technology, which is a direct wafer casting method, meets these demands. In this study we apply a passivated emitter and rear solar cell (PERC) process, which was developed for defect-rich multicrystalline silicon materials at the University of Konstanz, on below 100 μm thin RST wafers. An independently confirmed efficiency of up to 16. 0 % are demonstrated on a 2 x 2 cm 2 solar cell. Hence, the mass of Si needed per Wp of this cell is below 1. 5 g/Wp.

For recycling glass and silicon of end-of-life solar modules, it is necessary to separate them from the plastic materials used for laminating the panel. De-lamination of solar modules can be done with a thermal treatment that modifies the physical characteristics of these materials, allowing the removal of them from the panel.

30|$|The upper one {{corresponds}} to the raw Si powder {{and the other one}} to the SiNW sample. RS of the raw Si powder is similar to a typical spectrum of monocrystalline silicon. It appears that each RS has three main peaks. The most intense central peak {{corresponds to}} the first-order phonon mode, an optical active mode triply degenerated. On either side of the central peak, we observe two less intense peaks corresponding to the spectrum of second-order Raman spectra involving two phonons. The midpeak has a frequency of about 516.8  cm- 1 instead of the typical 520  cm- 1 of silicon. This peak is much thinner, almost 57 times more intense than raw Si. This notable Raman peak shift towards higher energy might be attributed to the same three reasons mentioned above to explain the XRD pattern variations. Indeed, both metal impurities and amorphous silicon oxide initially present inside and at the surface of <b>raw</b> <b>silicon</b> powder disturb the Si crystalline structure and induce tensile strains, respectively. Therefore, the etching process smoothes the tensile strains and enhances the crystalline structure. On the basis of the recent work of Khorasaninejad et al., we can partially attribute this enhancement in the Raman scattering intensity to the increased confinement of light within the wires[36].|$|E

40|$|International audienceSilicon is {{the most}} widely used {{semiconductor}} for photovoltaic solar cells, arid also the most extensively studied. The need for cost reduction lead solar cell producers to look for cheaper <b>raw</b> <b>silicon,</b> allowing a higher impurity content in the charge used as input for crystallization and making it very different from the extensively studied electronic-grade silicon. In order to keep a good efficiency of the solar cells, the impurities that have a huge impact over the electrical properties of the material should be removed born the final ingot. Controlling the segregation of impurities during the solidification is therefore mandatory. A study of the solidification of metallurgical grade silicon under controlled solidification parameters such as growth rate, thermal gradient and forced convection flow was conducted in a Bridgman set-up. Forced convection was induced by a travelling magnetic field (TMF) during the solidification, and resulted in a mixing of excess impurities in the liquid, removing them from the vicinity of the solidification front. As a result the purity of the final ingot is increased. The impact of the forced convection on the segregation of metallic impurities and on the orientation of grain boundaries during the silicon solidification is presented in this paper.
