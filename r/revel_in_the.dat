5|$|Nelson's love {{interest}} is Destiny (Canis selfabsorbedb*tchicus), an Afghan hound. However, Destiny {{has no interest}} in Nelson. She is the pet dog of Gary (Tony Way), the landlord of The Lord Nelson. However, like the other humans that appear in the series, he cannot understand what Destiny or what the other animals are saying. Elsewhere there is Marion (Felis retardicus), an idiotic cat to whom Nelson acts as a father-figure. Marion has been abandoned by several owners and is very corruptible. Then there is Kali (Aves aggravaticus), a pigeon who likes to <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> misfortune of others. She has several grudges, including a hatred of all humans and foxes for the way they treat birds. Lastly, there is Vince, Nelson's older brother (Vulpus c***itcus), a violent, foul-mouthed fox who considers himself a proper animal. Almost all his lines contain at least one swear word that is always bleeped over.|$|E
25|$|A Swedish {{squadron}} of six ships {{under the command}} of Vice Admiral Lile was spotted at <b>Revel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening of 17 June. Together with 15 other Russian ships led by Peter I, Poltava for 13 hours chased the Swedish squadron. The pursuit was fruitless and the squadron returned to Revel. On 4 August, Poltava left Revel, arrived to Helsinki on 14 August, and on 24 August departed to Kronstadt for overwintering.|$|E
25|$|Lunars often shun civilization; rather, they shun {{forms of}} civilization characterised by Dragon-Blooded oppression and exploitation, preferring society with humans and spirits {{far beyond the}} borders of the satrapies. Some of these Stewards lead or guide and {{sometimes}} breed tribes of anthropomorphic animals known as Beastmen and teach them self-sufficiency. Others go into deep seclusion in their territories to absorb themselves in primitive, hand-to-mouth freedoms and commune with the small, simple gods of the natural environment. Finally, some even <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unaccountable warping effects of the Wyld and, forgoing the characteristic silvered tattoos, become increasingly unstable until becoming Chimera: inhuman beings known as with no consistent form.|$|E

25|$|Is {{considered}} by some as the most representative festival {{of the city that}} lives up to the nickname he carries. The festival {{is one of the most}} important in Peru and is done in early October of each year, by the Lions Club of La Libertad Region. The first festival was held in 1950, and has been held annually since. The flower festival has a rich and varied program of over a hundred activities to meet the tastes and interests of Trujillo people and thousands of domestic and foreign tourists. The activities are carried out for a month in which the city takes on a festive environment, thousands of domestic and foreign tourists arriving in the town for various events like the coronation of the Queen of Spring, competition horses step, the parade of foreign queens and Spring Corso through the main avenues of the city, where visitors <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maneuvers of the Guaripolas.

25|$|Between 7 and 12 June 1713, {{the fleet}} was visited by Peter I, who brought 8 ships and a {{battalion}} of Preobrazhensky Regiment. Peter stayed on Poltava and inspected the fleet. On 2 July 1713, a Swedish squadron of Vice Admiral Lile (9 ships and two frigates) arrived to Helsinki, which was besieged by Russian troops. On 5 July, 3 more Swedish ships of the line blockaded Revel (now Tallinn) which then hosted five Russian warships recently purchased abroad. After receiving the news, on 4 July Peter I arrived in Kronstadt and raised his flag on Poltava. On 7 July, he ordered Cruys with his squadron to relieve the siege of Revel. On 9 July, together with 12 other ships Poltava left Kronstadt heading for the <b>Revel.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> evening of 10 July {{the vanguard of the}} squadron spotted the three Swedish ships at the island of Gogland and began chasing them. However, the next morning the three Russian front ships, Vyborg, Riga and frigate Esperanza run aground and the Swedish ships managed to join the squadron of Lile at Helsinki. Poltava was part of the vanguard, but avoided being stranded. On 16 July, it reached Revel, joined the Russian ships there, and together they returned to Kronstadt on 25 July.|$|E

Reviewers from Rolling Stone also praised the brother's playing, concluding that [...] "Catch a Fire is a blazing debut". According to the review, [...] "'Concrete Jungle' and 'Slave Driver' crackle with streetwise immediacy, while 'Kinky Reggae' and 'Stir It Up' ... <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music's vast capacity for good-time skanking. 'Stop That Train' and '400 Years,' both written by Peter Tosh, indicate the original Wailers weren't strictly a one-man show".|$|E

Larry Flick of Billboard magazine compared it to [...] "Wannabe" [...] saying that it [...] "is as immediately infectious, though it's not nearly as silly and novelty-driven". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a bid for street cred", while David Browne from the same magazine commented about the confusing lyrics, [...] "let's see: She wants to be friends, he wants more, and yet she croons, 'I'm giving you everything/All that joy can bring'? She's as confused as I am. Better to <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> delectably frothy girl-group melody". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic, {{in a review of}} their debut album Spice, said that [...] "what is surprising is how the sultry soul of 'Say You'll Be There' {{is more than just a}} guilty pleasure".

2500|$|The Danube {{school was}} a {{contemporary}} group of German and Austrian artists who were also pioneers of landscape painting, {{and the first to}} regularly paint pure landscapes without figures. [...] Their landscapes <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forests of the Upper Danube, and the place of a foreground figure is often taken by a single tree, a formula invented by Albrecht Altdorfer, the most significant artist of the group, and used, mostly in drawings and prints, by Wolf Huber and Augustin Hirschvogel. Other innovative works showed close-up views of dense forest with hardly any distant view or even sky. [...] But many of their landscapes are panoramic in a version of the Netherlandish style, although the river winding out of sight normally replaces the sea that occupies the horizon of many Netherlandish works. [...] It is probable that at least Altdorfer had seen a Patinir by about 1531; one was in Augsburg from 1517 (an Assumption now in Philadelphia).|$|E
2500|$|Splatter films, {{according}} to film critic Michael Arnzen, [...] "self-consciously <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> special effects of gore as an artform." [...] Where typical horror films {{deal with such}} fears {{as that of the}} unknown, the supernatural and the dark, the impetus for fear in a splatter film comes from physical destruction of the body and the pain accompanying it. There is also an emphasis on visuals, style and technique, including hyperactive camerawork. Where most horror films have a tendency to re-establish the social and moral order with good triumphing over evil, splatter films thrive on a lack of order. Arnzen argues that [...] "the spectacle of violence replaces any pretentions to narrative structure, because gore is {{the only part of the}} film that is reliably consistent." [...] These films also often feature fragmented narratives and direction, including [...] "manic montages full of subject camera movement...cross-cuttings from hunted to hunter, and ominous juxtapositions and contrasts." ...|$|E
