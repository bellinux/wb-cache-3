40|$|Extension of {{the lateral}} four toes {{of the foot}} {{is caused by the}} {{extensor}} digitorum longus. Each tendon of the extensor digitorum longus is attached to the middle and distal phalanges of the corresponding toes. The medial three tendons <b>receive</b> <b>the</b> <b>insertion</b> of lateral three tendons of the extensor digitorum brevis. During regular dissection for the undergraduate medical students, we came across a rare variation of extensor tendons of the second toe.

The extensor digitorum longus tendon for <b>the</b> second toe <b>received</b> <b>the</b> <b>insertion</b> of extensor digitorum brevis medial slip for the second toe, opposite to the base of second metatarsal bone. Further, the lateral slip of the extensor digitorum brevis was inserted to the lateral side of the extensor digitorum longus tendon for the second toe, opposite {{to the base of the}} proximal phalanx.

40|$|The Advanced Photon Source (APS) uses Nd-Fe-B {{permanent}} magnets in <b>the</b> <b>insertion</b> devices <b>to</b> produce x-rays for scientific research [1, 2]. Earlier investigations have exhibited {{varying degrees of}} demagnetization of these magnets [3] due to irradiation from electron beams [4, 5, 6], {sup 60 }Co {gamma}-rays [5], and high-energy neutrons [7, 8]. Radiation-induced demagnetization has been observed in <b>the</b> APS <b>insertion</b> devices [9] and was first measured in December of 2001. Partial demagnetization has also been observed in <b>insertion</b> devices at <b>the</b> European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) [4, 6], where Nd-Fe-B {{permanent magnets}} are also used. Growing concern for the lifetime of APS insertion devices, {{as well as the}} permanent magnets that will be used in next-generation, high-power light sources, like the FEL [10, 11], resulted from the partial demagnetization observations made at both facilities. This concern in relation to radiation-induced demagnetization spurred a long-term project to measure and analyze <b>the</b> absorbed doses <b>received</b> by <b>the</b> APS <b>insertion</b> devices. <b>The</b> project required a reliable photon high-dose dosimetry technique capable of measuring absorbed doses greater than 10 {sup 6 } rad, which was not readily available at the APS.
