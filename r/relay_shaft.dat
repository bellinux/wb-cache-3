50|$|The truck has an {{independent}} front suspension with coil springs and wishbones. At the rear it mounts a beam axle with leaf springs instead of the coil springs used by the similarly designed Super Goélette. It has telescopic dampers on both axles. The transmission is a rear-wheel drive system with a fully synchronised 4-speed gearbox. The drivetain has a double universal joint on the normal chassis and a triple universal joint with <b>relay</b> <b>shaft</b> on the long and extra long. Brakes are drums on both axles. The steering system is a gammer worm and roller.|$|E
5000|$|The ASCC {{was built}} from switches, <b>relays,</b> {{rotating}} <b>shafts,</b> and clutches. It used 765,000 electromechanical components {{and hundreds of}} miles of wire, comprising a volume of [...] - 51 ft in length, 8 ft in height, and 2 ft deep. It weighed about 10,000 lb. The basic calculating units had to be synchronized and powered mechanically, so they were run by a 50 ft shaft driven by a [...] electric motor, which served as the main power source and system clock. From the IBM Archives: The Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (Harvard Mark I) was the first operating machine that could execute long computations automatically. A project conceived by Harvard University’s Dr. Howard Aiken, the Mark I was built by IBM engineers in Endicott, N.Y. A steel frame 51 ft long and eight feet high held the calculator, which consisted of an interlocking panel of small gears, counters, switches and control circuits, all only a few inches in depth. The ASCC used 500 mi of wire with three million connections, 3,500 multipole relays with 35,000 contacts, 2,225 counters, 1,464 tenpole switches and tiers of 72 adding machines, each with 23 significant numbers. It was the industry’s largest electromechanical calculator.|$|R
5000|$|The company's logo {{underwent}} {{a series of}} changes during its existence. The first logo for the [...] "Kearns Kar Kompany" [...] frames {{the words in the}} outline of the grille of a 1907 runabout. The logo for the company boasted the car as being [...] "Valveless, Gearless, and Clutchless" [...] which was indeed true. The engine for the first vehicles was an air-cooled 3-cylinder [...] "porcupine head" [...] two cycle engine which the owner needed to prepare a mixture of fuel and oil in order to run. The vehicle's transmission was a friction drive, consisting of a flat spinning flywheel mounted on the engine which was set at right angles to a rubber lined steel drive wheel which slid from side to side on a drive shaft mounted in parallel to the rear axle. Sprockets {{on the end of the}} drive <b>shaft</b> <b>relayed</b> power to the rear wheels via a pair of chains, one per wheel. The friction drive was prone to slippage due to environmental conditions (water) and if the rubber drive wheel was allowed to rest against the spinning flywheel for a long period of time it would develop a flat spot which would produce an uneven power transfer. The transmission was infinitely variable, however, allowing the user to simply progressively slide the rubber covered wheel from a neutral position at the center of the flywheel to a position closer to the edge of the flywheel to vary the gear ratio.|$|R
