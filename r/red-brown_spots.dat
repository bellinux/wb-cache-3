In severe infections leaves and flowers may fall and badly affected stems may keel over.|$|E
50|$|The checker-throated antwren is {{normally}} found as pairs or small groups, but often forms {{the core of}} a mixed-species feeding flock. It feeds on the eggs, larvae and adults of insects and spiders, taken from leaf litter, epiphyte bases and vine tangles in low vegetation or on the ground. This is a common bird in the understory of wet forest and in adjacent tall second growth. The female lays two lilac or <b>red-brown</b> <b>spotted</b> white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes, in a 15 cm deep pouch nest constructed from plant fibres and dead leaves. The nest is suspended from the last fork of a thin twig less than 2 m up. The male and female parents both feed the chicks. At territorial boundaries, males will perch 30 cm apart with lowered heads and puffed-out plumage and sway in opposite directions.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{very small}} spider with a length (excluding legs) of around 3 mm. The legs are black and the {{markedly}} domed and very shiny abdomen is <b>red-brown</b> with white <b>spots.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are yellowish white, the costal {{area to the}} postmedial line, {{the inner}} margin (except towards base) and the terminal area red-brown. There is a diffused incurved red-brown subbasal line and the antemedial line is red-brown, oblique to the median nervure. There is a <b>red-brown</b> <b>spot</b> {{in the middle of}} the cell and a discoidal bar. The median nervure towards the extremity and a patch beyond the lower angle of the cell are red-brown, as is the postmedial line. This line is excurved between veins 5 and 2, then retracted to the lower angle of the cell and excurved to the inner margin. The inner edge of the red-brown terminal area is waved, excurved between veins 5 and 2, then expanding into a patch confluent with the postmedial line. The hindwings are yellowish white with an oblique brown discoidal bar. The veins beyond the lower angle of the cell are streaked with brown and the postmedial line is rather diffused red-brown, excurved between veins 5 and 2, then retracted to below the angle of the cell and ending above the inner margin. The terminal area is red-brown, its inner edge waved and excurved between veins 5 and 2.|$|R

The body is greenish-brown to silvery with many brown to <b>red-brown</b> <b>spots.</b> Spines and {{rays of the}} dorsal fin are separated by a deep notch. Small ctenoid scales cover the body. Juveniles are a greenish-brown with either a few large, dark, rounded blotches, or five or six dark, vertical bars.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{a common}} bird in the {{understory}} of wet forest and in adjacent tall second growth in foothills typically from 700 m to 1700 m altitude, although locally it may be found down to sea level or up to 2000 m. The female lays two <b>red-brown</b> <b>spotted</b> white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes, in a deep pouch nest constructed from plant fibres. The nest is suspended from the fork of a thin twig less than 2 m up. The male and female parents both feed the chicks. The slaty antwren is typically 10 cm long, and weighs 9.5 g. The adult male is mainly dark slate with a black throat and breast, black wings with white spots, and a concealed white shoulder patch. The white on the wings is less extensive than in related species. The adult female is olive-brown above and buff-brown below, paler on the throat. Young males are darker, duller and greyer than the adult female. This species has a thin cheeur call, and the infrequent song is a soft t’week t’week t’week t’week weet weet weet weet [...]|$|R
50|$|Adults {{are usually}} 40 to 50 cm long. They {{are found in}} light and dark forms {{and a variety of}} intermediates. Animals {{typically}} have red-brown heads with narrow black streaks with a light crown and off-white chin. Wings are a <b>spotted</b> <b>red-brown</b> with dark brown quills. Beaks are light blue/grey; eyes are brown. The falcons make a loud cackle call uttered frequently.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} from June to December. The female wattlebird {{generally}} constructs the nest, a loose, untidy cup of twigs lined with shredded bark and placed from 1 to 10m {{high in the}} fork of a banksia, tea-tree or eucalypt sapling. 1-2 eggs are laid and may be <b>spotted</b> <b>red-brown,</b> purplish red or salmon-pink in colour. The female incubates the eggs alone. Both sexes care for young chicks.|$|R
50|$|Peyronellaea curtisii causes <b>red-brown</b> <b>spots</b> on leaf tips of Narcissus {{and other}} members of the Amaryllidaceae family; this gives them a {{scorched}} appearance that is easily mistaken for frost damage. A yellowish discolouration then spreads down the leaf; more spots may develop as the leaf withers, turns brown and die away. Minute black fungal fruiting bodies may be visible on the foliage. The flowers and flower stalks may also display brown spots and marks.|$|E
50|$|The {{eggs are}} whitish; {{all but the}} black-capped and dwarf vireos have sparse, fine brown or <b>red-brown</b> <b>spots</b> at the wide end. Tropical species lay two, while temperate-zone species lay four or five. Incubation lasts 11 to 13 days, and the young fledge after {{the same amount of}} time. Both sexes feed the nestlings arthropods, and each fledgeling is fed by one parent or the other (not both) for as long as 20 days.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{an adult}} shell varies between 35 mm and 130 mm. These {{medium-sized}} shells are oval and acuminate, with a rather narrow mouth, the outer lip folded back and internally denticulate. Shoulder are not angulate nor plicate and the anterior prickles on outer lip obsolete. The surface of the shell is white with five series of large squarish <b>red-brown</b> <b>spots</b> (hence the common name). Later whorls show spiral striae anteriorly on whorls and above shoulders.|$|E

It has {{beautiful}} fan-shaped growth and bears single, large, glossy flowers on 6" [...] spikes. The long-lived, fragrant blooms may reach 5" [...] across and are <b>red-brown</b> with yellow <b>spotting</b> toward the top, fading to white spotting toward the bottom. These plants usually grow at elevations of 900-3,600 feet and prefer warm, moderately bright environments.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 21-26 mm. The antennae are whitish {{with very}} fine brown annulations. The anterior {{part of the}} thorax is buff, spreading out into {{the base of the}} costa of the forewings. The thorax is dorsally brown, becoming lighter basally. The abdomen is light brownish buff on the anterior part with a <b>red-brown</b> squarish <b>spot</b> close to the base, becoming quite dark, almost seal-brown, mottled with lighter on the anal segments. The groundcolour of the forewings is white, the costal edge, discal area from the base to the cleft and the inner margin broadly brown streaked, the spaces between being more or less suffused with light brown scales. A dark brown costal streak is found just above the base of the cleft, connected broadly with the outer end of the discal streak, preceded and followed by white. Another brown costal streak is found {{at the base of the}} first lobe. The fringes are smoky with a whitish spot at the anal angle. They are darker within the cleft.

40|$|Southern Mississippi. Common {{names for}} it include Purple pleat-leaf and pine or {{pinewood}} lily. The plants grow from a small, shallow bulb and form loose colonies in sandy soils in lightly wooded areas. The leaves are mostly basal and are pleated. They are winter dormant and flower from May unto fall. The flowers resemble Tigridia, with a cupped center, rounded outer segments and narrow inner segments. The {{margins of the}} inner segments curl tightly inward. Both inner and outer segments are velvety purple to red-purple at the margins and yellowish, <b>spotted</b> <b>red-brown</b> in the center. Unlike Tigridia, the flowers are secund (face the side). Several flowers are formed at the terminal, opening in succession and lasting only a day. In East Texas (according to Ajilvsgi), A. drummondii is found predominantly in a plant association called the 'long leaf/blue stem uplands' which are open park-like areas. These are scatted slopes, hills, ridge tops and low mounds dominated by long leaf pine (Pinus palustris) and sometime...|$|R
