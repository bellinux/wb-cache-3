5|$|During the ordeal, several forward air-controllers {{were sent}} out to make low passes over Khâm Đức, to locate the CCT, without success. Then, in {{response}} to a call for the nearest aircraft to land on the runway to search for the stranded CCT, Lieutenant Colonel Alfred J. Jeanotte approached the airfield from the south and landed his C-123 on the runway with support from fighter-bombers, which were used to suppress enemy fire. Not seeing the men, Jeanotte applied full power and took off to avoid taking hits from North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire. As the C-123 rolled past the CCT's position, the three men came out of their position chasing the aircraft with their arms waving. Believing that the aircraft had missed them, the three men <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ditch {{on the left side of}} the runway. As the C-123 was airborne, Jeanotte banked his aircraft to the left, and that enabled the aircrew to see the three men running back towards the ditch. However, Jeanotte was deterred from making another attempt at landing, because of low fuel. The next C-123 in line, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Joe M. Jackson, landed on the runway as fire swept through the Khâm Đức facility, and the aircrew were able to extract the stranded CCT under heavy fire, and they flew out to Đà Nẵng. By 17:00, the evacuation was over. On 13 May, 60 B-52s bombed the Khâm Đức camp.|$|E
25|$|Cynthia Ann's brother John Richard Parker was ransomed back in 1842 {{along with}} his cousin, James Pratt Plummer. He was unable to adapt to white society and <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Comanche. He later was left to die after he {{contracted}} smallpox during a Comanche raid into Mexico. The war party left a captive Mexican girl to care for him, and he restored her to her family after recovering, and spent {{the remainder of his}} life in Old Mexico after marrying her. During the American Civil War, he served in a Mexican Company within the Confederate Army. He later lived as stockman and rancher in Mexico, where he died in 1915.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of April 20, {{the day after the}} Orthodox Easter was celebrated in the tent colony, three Guardsmen {{appeared}} at the camp ordering the release of a man they claimed was being held against his will. This request prompted the camp leader, Louis Tikas, to meet with a local militia commander at the train station in Ludlow village, a half mile (0.8km) from the colony. While this meeting was progressing, two companies of militia installed a machine gun on a ridge near the camp and took a position along a rail route about half a mile south of Ludlow. Anticipating trouble, Tikas <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp. The miners set out to flank the militia positions and a gunfight soon broke out.|$|E

Polla tells Lupus that Felix is away at Rome, and Lupus <b>runs</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grotto <b>to</b> free <b>the</b> children himself. When he communicates this, Pulchra confides shamefully that her mother has spells of mental illness, and her father rarely leaves the house for that reason.

25|$|In {{the face}} of Loison's first assault, Leite's and Moretti's men took to their heels. The Spanish hussars bolted without even {{attempting}} to stop the French charge. Leite fled, but most of his men <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town and tried to defend the place. The French troops were able to fight {{their way into the}} town at a number of places. In the butchery that followed, at least 2,000 Portuguese and Spanish fell, including many townspeople. French losses were 90 killed and 200 wounded. After the killing stopped, the French soldiers thoroughly sacked Évora. According to one account, the French massacred the town's entire population. Whatever the exact truth, the atrocity made it easier for the proud Portuguese to accept British aid in their struggle. Loison continued east to drive the Portuguese away from Elvas before being ordered back to Lisbon to face a new threat.|$|E
25|$|The Tigers {{had their}} first shutout {{of the season in}} week four, when they {{traveled}} to the Orange Bowl and defeated the Miami Hurricanes, 41–0. On its first possession LSU drove down to the Miami 49-yard line, where a pass from Rabb was intercepted and <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> LSU 42-yard line. The Hurricanes went three-and-out on their offensive possession and attempted a field goal, but the kick was short. After punts by both teams, the Tigers scored their first touchdown of the game on a 51-yard run by Don Purvis. Miami was forced to punt on the first play of the second quarter and it was downed at the LSU 5-yard line. LSU was also forced to punt, but the Hurricanes fumbled on the return and the Tigers recovered it at Miami's 27-yard line. After a first down run by Cannon, Rabb threw a touchdown pass to Billy Hendrix to make the score 13–0 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 2006 Raviraj led a {{demonstration}} outside the UNICEF office in Colombo protesting against the Vaharai bombing in which 45 {{civilians were killed}} by army shelling. The following morning Raviraj {{took part in a}} live discussion on TV Derana between 7.00am and 7.30am. Afterwards he returned to his home in Manning Town, Narahenpita, had breakfast and changed for work. Raviraj had to drive to work himself as his driver was on leave. He had intended to use his wife's car but finding its battery drained got into his Toyota Land Cruiser Prado (reg WP KE 1279). Raviraj's police bodyguard Sergeant Lokuwellamurage Shantha Laxman Lokuwella got onto the passenger seat. At 8.39am, as Raviraj was driving slowly down Martha Road and turning into Elvitigala Mawatha, a motorcycle (reg JE 3507) coming from the opposite direction stopped nearby. The motorcycle's passenger got down, removed his helmet, crossed the road and waited on the pavement with a bag over his shoulder. As Raviraj's vehicle went past, the motorcycle passenger ripped open the shoulder bag and fired the T-56 hidden inside. Raviraj's vehicle was hit from the front, side and rear at point blank range. After firing an entire magazine the assassin <b>ran</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> motorcycle which then sped off, turning into Martha Road. The shoulder bag, with the T-56 inside, and the assassin's helmet were left at the roadside. According to the police a rickshaw parked nearby also drove off after the shooting. They believed that its driver had been a look out who had tipped off the assassins about the location of Raviraj's vehicle using a mobile phone.|$|E

About seventy people participated in the emergency work.|$|E
