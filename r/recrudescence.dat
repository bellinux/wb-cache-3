5|$|Symptoms {{of malaria}} can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, {{recurrence}} {{can be classified}} as either <b>recrudescence,</b> relapse, or reinfection. <b>Recrudescence</b> is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period. It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood {{as a result of}} inadequate or ineffective treatment. Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant hypnozoites in liver cells. Relapse commonly occurs between 8–24 weeks and is commonly seen with P.vivax and P.ovale infections. P.vivax malaria cases in temperate areas often involve overwintering by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite. Reinfection means the parasite that caused the past infection was eliminated from the body but a new parasite was introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from <b>recrudescence,</b> although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial infection is typically attributed to treatment failure. People may develop some immunity when exposed to frequent infections.|$|E
25|$|Artemisinins {{can be used}} alone, {{but this}} leads to a high rate of <b>recrudescence</b> (return of parasites) and other drugs are {{required}} to clear the body of all parasites and prevent recurrence.

40|$|The acyclic {{nucleoside}} 9 -(1, 3 -dihydroxy- 2 -propoxymethyl) guanine (DHPG) {{was evaluated}} for its efficacy in protecting guinea pigs from primary and recrudescent infections of {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2. Vaginally infected guinea pigs were treated twice a day with DHPG at 25 mg/kg per dose for 3 weeks. Subcutaneous doses were started 3 h, 24 h, or 5 weeks after virus inoculation. Treatment starting at 3 or 24 h reduced {{the severity of the}} primary infection by greater than 70 % when lesions were graded for 3 weeks; lesion duration was lessened by greater than 55 %. For 6 weeks after treatment, the number of recrudescent lesions was reduced by greater than 60 %, and the duration of the <b>recrudescences</b> declined by greater than 40 %. When dosing was started at 3 h postinfection, 33 % of the animals did not develop any sign of primary or recrudescent infection throughout the 9 -week test. By comparison, all the animals treated with DHPG starting at 24 h or with saline became infected. A 3 -week DHPG regimen starting 5 weeks postinfection reduced the number of animals that developed recrudescent lesions by 70 %. When treatment ended, however, recrudescent episodes in the animals increased to the level of saline-treated controls. These results suggest that (i) DHPG is highly effective in reducing the severity of both primary and recrudescent lesions of herpes simplex virus type 2, (ii) early treatment of a primary infection or treatment of <b>recrudescences</b> reduces the incidence of <b>recrudescences,</b> and (iii) the drug appears to have no effect on the latent form of the virus, as the incidence of <b>recrudescences</b> increases when DHPG treatment is ended...|$|R

[...] David Underdown, writing in his 1987 work Revel, Riot, and Rebellion, viewed Gunpowder Treason Day {{as a replacement for}} Hallowe'en: [...] "just as the early church had taken over many of the pagan feasts, so did Protestants acquire their own rituals, adapting older forms or providing substitutes for them".

40|$|It is {{a matter}} of common {{experience}} that initial attacks or <b>recrudescences</b> of acute rheumatic fever frequently follow a hemolytic streptococcal infection of the throat such as acute follicular tonsillitis or scarlet fever. In the experience of Coburn and Pauli (1), <b>recrudescences</b> are determined by: (1) infections with a highly effective agent; (2) the disease pattern, peculiar to each rheumatic subject; (3) the intensity of the immune response of the patient as indicated by a rise in the antistreptolysin titer of the blood. During our studies of erysipelas (2, 3), we did not observe a single case of rheumatic fever following the infection, and the records of 1400 cases of erysipelas that were reviewed did not reveal any cases. Other studies fail to mention erysipelas as a preceding infection in rheumatic fever, whereas it is common knowledge that hemolytic streptococcal infections of the throat frequently precede attacks. Why this should be the case is not clear; but inasmuch as Coburn and Pauli have emphasized the importance of certain characteristics of the effective organisms in the determination of <b>recrudescences</b> of rheumatic fever, we have studied the hemolytic streptococci from cases of erysipelas {{to see whether or not}} they differed in any respect from those isolated from rheumatic subjects. METHODS OF STUDY (Received for publication September 24, 1936) In the cases of facial erysipelas, the organisms were isolated either from the lesion or the nose.

2500|$|The reunification {{was opposed}} in several {{quarters}} {{both inside and}} outside Germany, including Margaret Thatcher, Jürgen Habermas, and Günter Grass, out of fear of that a united Germany might resume its aggression toward other countries.

40|$|Malaria {{treatment}} {{guidelines are}} {{based primarily on}} results from clinical trials. Accurate assessment of drug efficacy in such studies therefore represents a prerequisite to ensure effective and lifesaving treatment for children with Plasmodium falciparum infections in Africa. The World Health Organization standard procedures for in vivo assessment include a patient follow-up duration of at least 28 days. However, during four weeks or more after initiation of treatment in high transmission areas in Africa recurrent infections are inevitable, due to the continuous exposure to infective mosquito bites. Since microscopy cannot distinguish parasites that have escaped drug action (treatment failure/recrudescence) from those arising from new mosquito inoculations (new infections/reinfections), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based genotyping of malaria infections has been introduced to improve this distinction. PCR adjustment is presently achieved by analysis of two blood samples, one collected at enrolment and the other at time of recurrent parasitaemia. However, despite being a sensitive technique PCR may not identify minority clones in complex malaria infections and parasites sequestering in the deep vascular system during the later part of the erythrocytic life cycle. This thesis primarily addresses two fundamental aspects of the assessment of PCR adjusted efficacy of antimalarial drugs in Africa, i. e. the influence of extended follow-up beyond 28 days and added consecutive day blood sampling. The results reveal that both an extension of follow-up and consecutive day blood sampling improve the identification of <b>recrudescences.</b> By pooling data from 1414 children enrolled in three studies included in this thesis the overall sensitivity of the 28 day follow-up schedule to identify <b>recrudescences</b> was calculated to 48 / 72 = 67 % [95 % CI 55 - 76 %] compared with day 42 assessment. Moreover, consecutive day, instead of single day blood sampling improved identification of <b>recrudescences</b> by circa 20 %. The work in this thesis also highlights the potential influence {{of the number of}} genetic markers used and the choice of DNA extraction method on the efficacy outcome in the clinical trials Thus, assessment of PCR adjusted cure rates in high endemic areas depends substantially on methodology and should therefore be interpreted with caution. The results from this thesis should be considered in the design of antimalarial drug trials to improve assessment of antimalarial drug efficacy in Africa...|$|R

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection {{may increase the}} burden of malaria by increasing susceptibility to infection or by decreasing the response to antimalarial treatment. We investigated the seroprevalence rate of HIV- 1 infection {{and its effect on}} antimalarial treatment outcomes in adults and children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Uganda. Methods. This retrospective study included 1965 patients 18 months old who were randomized to receive 1 of 3 antimalarial regimens at 7 sites in Uganda. HIV- 1 testing was performed using 2 enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assays and Western blot analysis of stored blood spots. The primary study outcome was clinical treatment failure at 28 days after antimalarial treatment. Molecular genotyping was used to distinguish clinical treatment failures due to new infections from those due to <b>recrudescences.</b> Results.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the influence that}} consecutive-day blood sampling, compared with single-day blood sampling, had on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -adjusted parasitological cure after stepwise genotyping of merozoite surface proteins 2 (msp 2) and 1 (msp 1) in 106 children in Tanzania who had uncomplicated falciparum malaria treated with either sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or artemether- lumefantrine; 78 of these children developed recurrent parasitemia during the 42 -day follow-up period. Initial msp 2 genotyping identified 27 and 33 <b>recrudescences</b> by use of single- and consecutive-day sampling, respectively; in subsequent msp 1 genotyping, 17 and 21 of these episodes, respectively, were still classified as recrudescences; these results indicate a similar sensitivity of the standard single-day PCR protocol - that is, 82 % (27 / 33) and 81 % (17 / 21), in both genotyping steps. Interpretation of PCR-adjusted results will significantly depend on methodology. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A multicenter {{prospective}} trial {{was performed to}} investigate the efficacy and the tolerability of halofantrine in nonimmune patients with malaria imported from areas with drug-resistant falciparum parasites (mainly Africa). Forty-five of the 74 subjects were treated with a one-day regimen (3 x 500 mg) of halofantrine, and the other 29 received the same regimen with an additional treatment on day 7. In the second group, a 100 % efficacy rate was demonstrated, but in the group receiving the one-day regimen, four <b>recrudescences</b> were observed in patients with falciparum malaria. Only five mild adverse reactions were seen, which disappeared spontaneously {{after the end of}} the treatment. We conclude that halofantrine is highly effective in curing malaria in nonimmune subjects. The treatment scheme for such persons should include an additional treatment on day 7 for nonimmune individuals. This drug was well tolerated in our patients, indicating that halofantrine will be useful in the treatment of multidrug-resistant malaria in nonimmune persons. ...|$|R
40|$|A recent drug {{efficacy}} trial reported Coartem (artemether-lumefantrine) to {{be highly}} effective against Plasmodium falciparum in children less than 5 years of age in Papua New Guinea (PNG). In contrast, we have observed high levels of treatment failures in non-trial conditions in a longitudinal cohort study in the same age group in PNG. <b>Recrudescences</b> were confirmed by genotyping of three different marker genes to provide optimal discrimination power between parasite clones. After excluding genetic host factors by genotyping potentially relevant cytochrome P 450 loci, {{the high number of}} treatment failures in our study is best explained by poor adherence to complex dosing regimens in combination with insufficient fat supplementation, which are both crucial parameters for the outcome of Coartem treatment. In contrast to the situation in classic drug trials with ideal treatment conditions, our field survey highlights potential problems with unsupervised usage of Coartem in routine clinical practice and under program condition...|$|R
