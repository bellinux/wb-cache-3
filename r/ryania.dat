50|$|<b>Ryania</b> speciosa var. mutisii is an extinct plant of Colombia, {{a variety}} of <b>Ryania</b> speciosa.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ryania</b> speciosa is {{a species}} of plants in the family Salicaceae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ryania</b> is a genus {{of plants}} in the family Salicaceae.; it was {{previously}} listed in the now defunct family Flacourtiaceae.|$|E
50|$|Ryanodine is a {{poisonous}} diterpenoid {{found in the}} South American plant <b>Ryania</b> speciosa (Salicaceae). It was originally used as an insecticide.|$|E
50|$|Ryanoids are a {{class of}} {{insecticides}} which share the same mechanism of action as the alkaloid ryanodine. Ryanodine is a naturally occurring insecticide isolated from <b>Ryania</b> speciosa.|$|E
50|$|The genus is {{significant}} {{partly because the}} ryanoid insecticides are derived from - and have the same mode of action as - the alkaloid ryanodine: which was originally extracted from <b>Ryania</b> speciosa.|$|E
50|$|Ryanoids are {{synthetic}} analogues {{with the}} same mode of action as ryanodine, a naturally occurring insecticide extracted from <b>Ryania</b> speciosa (Flacourtiaceae). They bind to calcium channels in cardiac and skeletal muscle, blocking nerve transmission. Only one such insecticide is currently registered, Rynaxypyr, generic name chlorantraniliprole.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ryania</b> speciosa is a grove {{belonging}} to the family Flacourtiacea, located in tropical climates in Central- and South- America. The Indigenous population used the plant, which contains toxic alkaloids, against cockroaches. In the forties the ground wood was used as insecticide against different pests. In {{the first version of}} annex 2 b from the EC regulation 2092 / 91, <b>Ryania</b> was still listed, but it was subsequently cancelled due to its lack of registration as a pesticide in any European country. In organic farming, only a few insecticides are allowed, but in orchards there is a permanent need to control larvae such as coddling moth, etc. The Italian Ministry of Agriculture initiated a survey to investigate the possibility of developing an 'organic' pesticide based on <b>Ryania.</b> Basic research was done, working on extraction methods, synergists, spectrum of action, degradation, and efficacy in comparison with other modern pesticides including ecotoxicological investigations. Organic fruit growers hope that a company takes on <b>Ryania</b> to pass it through the registration procedure and puts some formulations on the market...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} botanical and {{structural}} {{composition of the}} woody vegetation present in 36 cocoa-AFS and four forest patches located on the Nicaraguan Atlantic slope. We set up a 1000 square meter plot (20 x 50 m) where we identified, counted and measured all trees with dbh 10 cm and we used a semi-structured interview process with 36 producers to investigate cacao agronomic management and the use and management of shade trees. Cacao plant density was 660 trees ha- 1; the cocoa-AFS had a total of 521 individuals (145 trees ha- 1) in 35 families, 57 genera and 70 species on 3. 6 ha. Musaceae were the most abundant species (182 stems ha- 1) followed by Cordia alliodora (22 trees ha- 1), Bactris gasipaes (20 individuals ha- 1) and <b>Ryania</b> speciosa (17 plants ha- 1). In the forest patches we counted 869 trees (2173 trees ha- 1) in 47 families, 80 genera and 90 species. The most abundant and common species in the forest plots were <b>Ryania</b> speciosa (173 plants ha- 1), Piper aduncum (143 trees ha- 1) and Parkinsonia aculeata (83 trees ha- 1). The diversity of woody species associated with cacao lower than the tree diversity recorded in forest patches, although it is within the ranges measured in other Central American cocoa orchards. The horizontal structure of the tree vegetation in cocoa-AFS was markedly {{different from that of}} forest patches. Up to 25 % of the tree species inventoried in forest patches were recorded for the cocoa-AFS. We suggest promoting the diversification of the cacao orchards and other areas of the farm with fruit trees and valuable timber trees and we recommend providing technical assistance to producers about the selection of species for shade, management of natural regeneration and the design and management of shade in cacao orchards.

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} insecticides {{are abundant}} and varied in their effects, though {{but a few}} are articles of commerce. Even for these, pyrethrum, nicotine, rotenone, hellebore, <b>ryania,</b> and sabadilla, there is a paucity of information on mammalian toxicology and environmental effects. In general, these materials are characterized favorably by low acute toxicity and ready dissipation in nature. Unfavorable aspects of natural insecticides are the contained mixture of active and inactive components and the low active ingredient content on a crop yield basis pointing to a high unit cost. Natural insecticides can serve additionally as leads to unnatural mimics, of which the commercially successful synthetic pyrethroids are prime examples. The chemical nature, relationship of insecticidal activity to chemical structure, occurrence, production, and utilization, registered uses, metabolism, and insect and mammalian toxicity are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|Botanical {{insecticides}} {{are natural}} compounds with insecticidal properties {{and their use}} in crop protection {{is as old as}} agricultural practice. Although they have been in use for over one hundred years, the advent of synthetic insecticides has unfortunately displaced their use today. Due to fast action, low cost, easy application and efficiency against a wide range of harmful species, synthetic insecticides have become an important part of pest management in modern agricultural systems. However, after decades of use, their negative side effects, such as toxicity to humans and animals, environmental contamination, and toxicity to non-target insects have become apparent and interest in less hazardous alternatives of pest control is therefore being renewed. Plant species with known insecticidal actions are being promoted and research is being conducted to find new sources of botanical insecticides. The most important botanical insecticide is pyrethrin, a secondary metabolite of Dalmatian pyrethrum, neem, followed by insecticides based on the essential oils, rotenone, quassia, <b>ryania</b> and sabadilla. Th ey have various chemical properties and modes of action. However, some general characteristics include fast degradation in sunlight, air and moisture, and selectivity to non-target insects. Unfortunately, neither of these insecticides is widely used as a pest control agent but is recognized by organic crop producers in industrialized countries...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Horizontal {{transfer}} of insecticide occurs when insects contact or ingest an insecticide, {{return to an}} aggregation or a nest, and transfer the insecticide to other conspecific insects through contact. This phenomenon {{has been reported in}} a number of insects including social insects, however it has not been reported in bed bugs. Since horizontal transfer can facilitate the spread of insecticide into hard to reach spaces, it could contribute greatly to the management of these public health pests. METHODOLOGY/RESULTS: To demonstrate horizontal {{transfer of}} diatomaceous earth and botanical insecticides in C. lectularius, an exposed (donor) bed bug, following a 10 -minute acquisition period, was placed with unexposed (recipient) bed bugs. Mortality data clearly demonstrates that diatomaceous earth (DE 51) was actively transferred from a single exposed bug to unexposed bugs in a concentration dependent manner. LC 50 values varied from 24. 4 mg at 48 h to 5. 1 mg at 216 h when a single exposed bed bug was placed with 5 unexposed bed bugs. LT 50 values also exhibited a concentration response. LT 50 values varied from 1. 8 days to 8. 4 days when a 'donor' bug exposed to 20 and 5 mg of dust respectively was placed with 5 'recipient' bugs. Dust was also actively transferred from adult bed bugs to the nymphs. In addition we observed horizontal transfer of botanical insecticides including neem, <b>ryania,</b> and rotenone to varying degrees. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data clearly demonstrate horizontal transfer of diatomaceous earth and botanical insecticides in the common bed bug, C. lectularius. Use of a fluorescent dust provided visual confirmation that contaminated bed bugs transfer dust to untreated bed bugs in harborage. This result is important because bedbugs live in hard-to-reach places and interaction between conspecifics can be exploited for delivery and dissemination of management products directed at this public health pest...|$|E
