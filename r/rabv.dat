[...] "Surveillance initiatives also confirmed the presence of lyssavirus in both Pteropid (Gould et al., 1998) and insectivorous bats (Gould et al., 2002; Hooper et al., 1997), and later, human infections were reported following encounters with both fruit and insectivorous bats (Allworth et al., 1996; Hanna et al., 2000; Warrilow, 2005; Warrilow et al., 2002). Indeed, ABLV has now been isolated from five different bat species, all four species of Pteropodidae in Australia and from an insectivorous bat species, the yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat (Saccolaimus flaviventris), with two distinct lineages apparently circulating in insectivorous and frugivorous bats (Fraser et al., 1996; Gould et al., 1998, 2002; Guyatt et al., 2003).

Although the black flying fox is a native fruit bat to Australia and is present on islands to the north, ABLV has only been isolated in Australia.

40|$|Rabies virus (<b>RABV)</b> is a {{neurotropic}} {{virus that}} depends on long distance axonal transport {{in order to reach}} the central nervous system (CNS). The strategy <b>RABV</b> uses to hijack the cellular transport machinery is still not clear. It is thought that <b>RABV</b> interacts with membrane receptors in order to internalize and exploit the endosomal trafficking pathway, yet this has never been demonstrated directly. The p 75 Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) receptor (p 75 NTR) binds <b>RABV</b> Glycoprotein (RABV-G) with high affinity. However, as p 75 NTR is not essential for <b>RABV</b> infection, the specific role of this interaction remains in question. Here we used live cell imaging to track <b>RABV</b> entry at nerve terminals and studied its retrograde transport along the axon with and without the p 75 NTR receptor. First, we found that NGF, an endogenous p 75 NTR ligand, and <b>RABV,</b> are localized in corresponding domains along nerve tips. <b>RABV</b> and NGF were internalized at similar time frames, suggesting comparable entry machineries. Next, we demonstrated that <b>RABV</b> could internalize together with p 75 NTR. Characterizing <b>RABV</b> retrograde movement along the axon, we showed the virus is transported in acidic compartments, mostly with p 75 NTR. Interestingly, <b>RABV</b> is transported faster than NGF, suggesting that <b>RABV</b> not only hijacks the transport machinery but can also manipulate it. Co-transport of <b>RABV</b> and NGF identified two modes of transport, slow and fast, that may represent a differential control of the trafficking machinery by <b>RABV.</b> Finally, we determined that p 75 NTR-dependent transport of <b>RABV</b> is faster and more directed than p 75 NTR-independent <b>RABV</b> transport.

ANIMALS 8 gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). PROCEDURESEndoscopy was used to place <b>RABV</b> PBV, alginate-encapsulated <b>RABV</b> PBV, or nonpreserved <b>RABV</b> into the duodenum of each fox. Blood samples were collected weekly to monitor the immune response. Saliva samples were collected weekly and tested for virus shedding by use of a conventional reverse-transcriptase PCR assay.

40|$|Rabies is {{an ancient}} disease but remains endemic {{in most parts of}} the world and causes {{approximately}} 59, 000 deaths annually. The mechanism through which the causative agent, rabies virus (<b>RABV),</b> evades the host immune response and infects the host central nervous system (CNS) has not been completely elucidated thus far. Our previous studies have shown that lab-attenuated, but not wild-type (wt), <b>RABV</b> activates the innate immune response in the mouse and dog models. In this present study, we demonstrate that lab-attenuated <b>RABV</b> causes abortive infection in astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the CNS. Furthermore, we found that lab-attenuated <b>RABV</b> produces more double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) than wt <b>RABV,</b> which is recognized by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA 5). Activation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), the common adaptor molecule for RIG-I and MDA 5, results in the production of type I interferon (IFN) and the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes, which suppress <b>RABV</b> replication and spread in astrocytes. Notably, lab-attenuated <b>RABV</b> replicates in a manner identical to that of wt <b>RABV</b> in MAVS−/− astrocytes. It was also found that lab-attenuated, but not wt, <b>RABV</b> induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines via the MAVS- p 38 /NF-κB signaling pathway. These inflammatory cytokines increase the blood–brain barrier permeability and thus enable immune cells and antibodies infiltrate the CNS parenchyma, resulting in <b>RABV</b> control and elimination. In contrast, wt <b>RABV</b> restricts dsRNA production and thus evades innate recognition by RIG-I/MDA 5 in astrocytes, which could be one of the mechanisms by which wt <b>RABV</b> evades the host immune response in resident CNS cells.

To {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} adeno-associated viruses serotype 2 (AAV 2) -mediated RNA interference (RNAi) as an antiviral agent against rabies, recombinant AAV 2 vectors expressing siRNA targeting the nucleoprotein (N) gene of rabies virus (<b>RAbV)</b> (rAAV-N 796) were constructed and evaluated. When NA cells pretreated with rAAV-N 796 were challenged with <b>RAbV,</b> there was a 37. 8 ± 3. 4 % to 55. 1 ± 5. 3 % reduction in <b>RAbV</b> virus titer.

40|$|Rabies virus (<b>RABV)</b> {{causes a}} fatal {{zoonotic}} encephalitis. Disease symptoms require replication and {{spread of the}} virus within neuronal cells; however, in infected animals {{as well as in}} cell culture the virus replicates in a broad range of cell types. Here we use a single-cycle <b>RABV</b> and a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) in which the glycoprotein (G) was replaced with that of <b>RABV</b> (rVSV RABVG) to examine <b>RABV</b> uptake into the African greenmonkey kidney cell line BS-C- 1. Combining bio-chemical studies and real-time spinning-disk confocal fluorescence microscopy, we show that the predominant entry pathway of <b>RABV</b> particles into BS-C- 1 cells is clathrin dependent. Viral particles enter cells in pits with elongated structures and incom-plete clathrin coats which depend upon actin to complete the internalization process. By measuring the time of internalization and the abundance of the clathrin adaptor protein AP 2, we further show that the pits that internalize <b>RABV</b> particles are similar to those that internalize VSV particles. Pharmacological perturbations of dynamin or of actin polymerization inhibit productive infection, linking our observations on particle uptake with viral infectivity.

40|$|Rabies virus (<b>RABV)</b> is {{the cause}} of rabies, and is {{associated}} with severe neurological symptoms, high mortality rate, and a serious threat to human health. Although cellular tubulin has recently been identified to be incorporated into <b>RABV</b> particles, the effects of <b>RABV</b> infection on the microtubule cytoskeleton remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that <b>RABV</b> infection induces microtubule depolymerization as observed by confocal microscopy, which is closely associated with the formation of the filamentous network of the <b>RABV</b> M protein. Depolymerization of microtubules significantly increases viral RNA synthesis, while the polymerization of microtubules notably inhibits viral RNA synthesis and prevents the viral M protein from inducing the formation of the filamentous network. Furthermore, the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC 6) expression level progressively increases during <b>RABV</b> infection, and the inhibition of HDAC 6 deacetylase activity significantly decreases viral RNA synthesis. In addition, the expression of viral M protein alone was found to significantly upregulate HDAC 6 expression, leading to a substantial reduction in its substrate, acetylated α-tubulin, eventually resulting in microtubule depolymerization.

40|$|The central goal of {{this thesis}} work was to advance the {{understanding}} of rabies virus (<b>RABV)</b> immunogenicity and pathogenicity {{in order to develop}} novel treatments for <b>RABV</b> and other infectious diseases. This was accomplished in two different studies, both using recombinant <b>RABV</b> in murine models of infection. The first study evaluated the effect that viral replication has on immunogenicity; the second evaluated <b>RABV</b> pathogenesis by elucidating neuronal cell fate after viral infection. ^ Previously, attenuated <b>RABV</b> was shown to be an effective viral vaccine vector, capable of eliciting immune responses to other pathogens. To address safety concerns {{associated with the use of}} live viral vectors, we developed a replication-deficient <b>RABV.</b> This was accomplished by the genomic deletion of the <b>RABV</b> glycoprotein, rendering the virus incapable of spread beyond the initially infected cell. Furthermore, this virus is apathogenic following intranasal inoculation. HIV- 1 Gag was incorporated into the <b>RABV</b> genome in order to measure antigen-specific immune responses in vivo. When directly compared to a replication-competent <b>RABV</b> expressing HIV- 1 Gag, we measured equivalent Gag-specific CD 8 + T-cell responses, but lower overall antibody responses. These data suggest <b>RABV</b> immunogenicity is not entirely dependent on replication and antigen dose, and highlights the potential for replication-deficient vaccine vectors. G-deleted <b>RABV</b> vectors hold great promise for development of safer human vaccines, though efficacy in non-human primate models are needed. ^ The second part of my thesis investigated the fate of the neuron after <b>RABV</b> infection. <b>RABV</b> pathogenesis—or how it causes disease—may be due to neuronal death or dysfunction, though this has not been determined. In order to study neuronal integrity after <b>RABV</b> infection in vivo, we used a Cre reporter mouse model. These mice constitutively and ubiquitously express membrane-targeted tandem dimer Tomato (tdTomato); upon exposure to Cre recombinase, the tdTomato gene is deleted, and membrane-targeted EGFP is induced. Cre reporter mice were infected with a sub-lethal dose of RABV-expressing Cre recombinase, and infected cells were permanently labeled with EGFP. We were able to monitor the long-term survival of RABV-infected cells after clearance of viral antigen by monitoring for EGFP-labeled cells. Our results show that experimental <b>RABV</b> does not induce cell loss as a result of direct or indirect cytopathic effects of the virus, nor a cytotoxic immune response. To determine if these surviving cells were functionally different from their uninfected neighbors, we isolated them by fluorescence activated cells sorting (FACS). Microarray analysis of previously-infected neurons showed transcriptional differences compared to uninfected cells, particularly in the areas of cell-to-cell signaling and nervous system development/function. Furthermore, gene expression patterns were predictive of defects in neurite growth and disorganization of the cytoskeleton, cytoplasm, and microtubule dynamics. These results may guide the treatment of rabies and other CNS infections by restoring impaired neuronal function. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{low rates}} of nonsynonymous {{evolution}} observed in natural rabies virus (<b>RABV)</b> isolates are suggested to have arisen {{in association with the}} structural and functional constraints operating on the virus protein and the infection strategies employed by <b>RABV</b> within infected hosts to avoid strong selection by the immune response. In order to investigate the relationship between the genetic characteristics of <b>RABV</b> populations within hosts and the virus evolution, the present study examined the genetic heterogeneities of <b>RABV</b> populations within naturally infected dogs and foxes in Brazil, {{as well as those of}} bat <b>RABV</b> populations that were passaged once in suckling mice. Sequence analyses of complete <b>RABV</b> glycoprotein (G) genes showed that <b>RABV</b> populations within infected hosts were genetically highly homogeneous whether they were infected naturally or experimentally (nucleotide diversities of 0 - 0. 95 x 10 (- 3)). In addition, amino acid mutations were randomly distributed over the entire region of the G protein, and the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios (d(N) /d(S)) for the G protein gene were less than 1.

Therefore, novel treatments and improved vaccines for <b>RABV</b> are still in need of being developed. To develop improved therapies we must first understand the activation of the immune system. The objective of this thesis was to examine how the immune system detects and prevents <b>RABV</b> infect. To address this we sought to determine: 1) the mechanism by which the inflammasome recognizes RNA viruses {{and its role in}} <b>RABV</b> pathogenicity and immunogenicity and 2) to examine the role of IFIT proteins in the restriction of <b>RABV</b> infection. The use of genetically modified mice have enabled the examination, both in vitro and in vivo, of the immunological effects and consequences on survival after the loss of specific genes. We demonstrate that inflammasome activation is important for the development of an effective host defense against <b>RABV.</b> Our results indicate that the infection of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) induces both the IPS- 1 dependent production of pro-interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) as well as its processing, resulting in the secretion of mature IL- 1 β through activation of the NLRP 3 -, ASC-, and caspase- 1 - dependent inflammasome. We demonstrate that both the production of pro-IL-β and activation of the inflammasome requires viral replication. Additionally, IL- 1 receptor-deficient mice show an increase in <b>RABV</b> pathogenicity. Furthermore, we characterize the <b>RABV</b> pathogenesis of mice deficient in ISG 54 /Ifit 2, ISG 56 /Ifit 1, and IFNAR in an effort to define their role in <b>RABV</b> replication and spread in vivo. We found that ISG 54 /Ifit 2 was important for controlling not only pathogenicity after i. n. infection, but also <b>RABV</b> invasion into the CNS after i. m. infection. In contrast, we found that the role of ISG 56 /Ifit 1 in <b>RABV</b> infection was limited to controlling <b>RABV</b> in the CNS. This thesis analyzed the mechanisms of an activated immune system that play an important role as the body 2 ̆ 7 s first line of defense against many invading pathogens. Our findings will not only contribute to the current knowledge on innate immune recognition of viral infection, but also translate into strategies for improving prevention and treatment of rabies. ...|$|E
40|$|In nature, {{rabies virus}} (RABV; genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae) {{represents}} {{an assemblage of}} phylogenetic lineages, associated with specific mammalian host species. Although it is generally accepted that <b>RABV</b> evolved originally in bats and further shifted to carnivores, mechanisms of such host shifts are poorly understood, and examples are rarely present in surveillance data. Outbreaks in carnivores caused by a <b>RABV</b> variant, associated with big brown bats, occurred repeatedly during 2001 – 2009 in the Flagstaff area of Arizona. After each outbreak, extensive control campaigns were undertaken, with no reports of further rabies cases in carnivores {{for the next several}} years. However, questions remained whether all outbreaks were caused by a single introduction and further perpetuation of bat <b>RABV</b> in carnivore populations, or each outbreak was caused by an independent introduction of a bat virus. Another question of concern was related to adaptive changes in the <b>RABV</b> genome associated with host shifts. To address these questions, we sequenced and analyzed 66 complete and 20 nearly complete <b>RABV</b> genomes, including those from the Flagstaff area and other similar outbreaks in carnivores, caused by bat RABVs, and representatives of the major <b>RABV</b> lineages circulating in North America and worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that each Flagstaff outbreak was caused by an independent introduction of bat <b>RABV</b> into populations of carnivores. Positive selection analysis confirmed the absence of post-shift changes in <b>RABV</b> genes. In contrast, convergent evolution analysis demonstrated several amino acids in the N, P, G and L proteins, which might be significant for pre-adaptation of bat viruses to cause effective infection in carnivores. The substitution S/T 242 in the viral glycoprotein is of particular merit, as a similar substitution was suggested for pathogenicity of Nishigahara <b>RABV</b> strain. Roles of the amino acid changes, detected in our study, require additional investigations, using reverse genetics and other approaches...|$|E
40|$|Vaccine {{potency testing}} is {{necessary}} to evaluate the immunogenicity of inactivated rabies virus (<b>RABV)</b> vaccine preparations before human or veterinary application. Currently, the NIH test is recommended by the WHO expert committee to evaluate <b>RABV</b> vaccine potency. However, numerous disadvantages are inherent concerning cost, number of animals and biosafety requirements. As such, several in vitro methods have been proposed {{for the evaluation of}} vaccines based on <b>RABV</b> glycoprotein (G) quality and quantity, which is expected to correlate with vaccine potency. In this study an antigen-capture electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay was developed utilizing anti-RABV G monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to quantify <b>RABV</b> G. One MAb 2 - 21 - 14 was specific for a conformational epitope so that only immunogenic, natively folded G was captured in the assay. MAb 2 - 21 - 14 or a second MAb (62 - 80 - 6) that binds a linear epitope was used for detection of <b>RABV</b> G. Vaccine efficacy was also assessed in vivo using pre-exposure vaccination of mice. Purified native <b>RABV</b> G induced a <b>RABV</b> neutralizing antibody (rVNA) response with a geometric mean titer of 4. 2 IU/ml and protected 100 % of immunized mice against <b>RABV</b> challenge, while an experimental vaccine with a lower quality and quantity of G induced a rVNA titer< 0. 05 IU/ml and protected < 50 % of immunized mice. These preliminary results support the hypothesis that in vivo immunogenicity may be predicted from the in vitro measurement of <b>RABV</b> G using an ECL assay. Based upon these results, the ECL assay may have utility in replacement of the NIH test. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 09 - 14 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 23742991 PMC 456898...|$|E
40|$|As {{with many}} viruses, rabies virus (<b>RABV)</b> {{infection}} induces type I interferon (IFN) production within the infected host cells. However, <b>RABV</b> has evolved {{mechanisms by which}} to inhibit IFN production in order to sustain infection. Here we show that <b>RABV</b> infection of dendritic cells (DC) induces potent type I IFN production and DC activation. Although DCs are infected by <b>RABV,</b> the viral replication is highly suppressed in DCs, rendering the infection non-productive. We exploited this finding in bone marrow derived DCs (BMDC) in order to differentiate which pattern recognition receptor(s) (PRR) is responsible for inducing type I IFN following infection with <b>RABV.</b> Our results indicate that BMDC activation and type I IFN production following a <b>RABV</b> infection is independent of TLR signaling. However, IPS- 1 is essential for both BMDC activation and IFN production. Interestingly, {{we see that the}} BMDC activation is primarily due to signaling through the IFNAR and only marginally induced by the initial infection. To further identify the receptor recognizing <b>RABV</b> infection, we next analyzed BMDC from Mda- 5 -/- and RIG-I-/- mice. In the absence of either receptor, there is a significant decrease in BMDC activation at 12 h post infection. However, only RIG-I-/- cells exhibit a delay in type I IFN production. In order to determine the role that IPS- 1 plays in vivo, we infected mice with pathogenic <b>RABV.</b> We see that IPS- 1 -/- mice are more susceptible to infection than IPS- 1 +/+ mice and have a significantly increased incident of limb paralysis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRabies {{virus is}} a highly {{neurotropic}} virus that can cause fatal infection of {{the central nervous system}} in warm-blooded animals. The <b>RABV</b> phosphoprotein (P), an essential cofactor of the virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is required for virus replication. In this study, the ribosomal protein L 9, which has functions in protein translation, is identified as P-interacting cellular factor using phage display analysis. Direct binding between the L 9 and P was confirmed by protein pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. It was further demonstrated that L 9 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it colocalizes with P in cells infected with <b>RABV</b> or transfected with P gene. <b>RABV</b> replication was reduced with L 9 overexpression and enhanced with L 9 knockdown. Thus, we propose that during <b>RABV</b> infection, P binds to L 9 that translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, inhibiting the initial stage of <b>RABV</b> transcription...|$|E

Here, we further characterize the pathogenesis of the live-attenuated RABV/EBOV vaccine candidates in mice {{in an effort to}} define their growth properties and potential for safety. <b>RABV</b> vaccines expressing GP (RV-GP) or a replication-deficient derivative with a deletion of the <b>RABV</b> G gene (RVΔG-GP) are both avirulent after intracerebral inoculation of adult mice. Furthermore, RVΔG-GP is completely avirulent upon intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice unlike parental <b>RABV</b> vaccine or RV-GP. Analysis of RVΔG-GP in the brain by quantitative PCR, determination of virus titer, and immunohistochemistry indicated greatly restricted virus replication. In summary, our findings indicate that RV-GP retains the attenuation phenotype of the live-attenuated <b>RABV</b> vaccine, and RVΔG-GP would appear to be an even safer alternative for use in wildlife or consideration for human use...|$|E
40|$|Rabies has {{affected}} mankind for several centuries {{and is one}} of the oldest known zoonoses. It is peculiar how little is known regarding the means by which rabies virus (<b>RABV)</b> evades the immune response and kills its host. This review investigates the complex interplay between <b>RABV</b> and the immune system, including the various means by which <b>RABV</b> evades, or advantageously utilizes, the host immune response in order to ensure successful replication and spread to another host. Different factors that influence immune responses—including age, sex, cerebral lateralization and temperature—are discussed, with specific reference to <b>RABV</b> and the effects on host morbidity and mortality. We also investigate the role of apoptosis and discuss whether it is a detrimental or beneficial mechanism of the host’s response to infection. The various <b>RABV</b> proteins and their roles in immune evasion are examined in depth with reference to important domains and the downstream effects of these interactions. Lastly, an overview of the means by which <b>RABV</b> evades important immune responses is provided.

40|$|Rabies virus (<b>RABV)</b> {{maintenance}} in bats is {{not well}} understood. Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), andMexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) {{are the most common}} bats species in the United States. These colonial bat species also have the most frequent contact with humans and domestic animals. However, the silver-haired bat (La-sionycteris noctivagans) <b>RABV</b> is associated with the majority of human rabies virus infections in the United States and Canada. This is of interest because silver-haired bats are more solitary bats with infrequent human interaction. Our goal was to deter-mine the likelihood of a colonial bat species becoming infected with and transmitting a heterologous <b>RABV.</b> To ascertain the potential of heterologous <b>RABV</b> infection in colonial bat species, little brown bats were inoculated with a homologous <b>RABV</b> or one of two heterologous RABVs. Additionally, to determine if the route of exposure influenced the disease process, bats were inoculated either intramuscularly (i. m.) or subcutaneously (s. c.) with a homologous or heterologous <b>RABV.</b> Our results demon-strate that intramuscular inoculation results in a more rapid progression of disease onset, whereas the incubation time in bats inoculated s. c. is significantly longer. Additionally, cross protection was not consistently achieved in bats previously inoculated with a heterologous <b>RABV</b> following a challenge with a homologous <b>RABV</b> 6 months later. Finally, bats that developed rabies following s. c. inoculation {{were significantly more likely to}} shed virus in their saliva and demonstrated increased viral dissemina-tion. In summary, bats inoculated via the s. c. route are more likely to shed virus, thus increasing the likelihood of transmission.

40|$|Inflammasome {{activation}} {{is important}} for the development of an effective host defense against many pathogens, including RNA viruses. However, the mechanism by which the inflammasome recognizes RNA viruses and its role in rabies virus (<b>RABV)</b> patho-genicity and immunogenicity remain poorly defined. To determine the function of the inflammasome in response to <b>RABV</b> in-fection, we infected murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with <b>RABV.</b> Our results indicate that the infection of BMDCs with <b>RABV</b> induces both the production of pro-interleukin- 1 (pro-IL- 1) and its processing, resulting in the secretion of active IL- 1 through activation of the NLRP 3 -, ASC-, and caspase- 1 -dependent inflammasome. As previously shown for the induction of type I interferon by <b>RABV,</b> the induction of pro-IL- 1 also depends upon IPS- 1. We demonstrate that both the pro-duction of pro-IL- 1 and activation of the inflammasome require viral replication. We also demonstrate that increased viral replication in BMDCs derived from IFNAR-deficient mice resulted in significantly more IL- 1 release. Additionally, IL- 1 recep-tor-deficient mice show an increase in <b>RABV</b> pathogenicity. Taken together, these results indicate an important role of the in-flammasome in innate immune recognition of <b>RABV.</b> Early recognition of viral infection by the innate immune sys-tem is essential for an effective host defense.

40|$|Rabies is an {{important}} zoonotic disease distributed worldwide. A key question in rabies epidemiology is the identification of factors that impact virus dispersion. Here we apply new analytical methods, based on phylogeographic reconstructions of viral lineage movement, to undertake a comparative evolutionary-epidemiological study of the spatial dynamics of rabies virus (<b>RABV)</b> epidemics in different hosts and habitats. We compiled <b>RABV</b> data sets from skunk, raccoon, bat and domestic dog populations in order to investigate the viral diffusivity of different <b>RABV</b> epidemics, and to detect and compare the environmental factors that impact the velocity of viral spread in continuous spatial landscapes. We build on a recently developed statistical framework that uses spatially- A nd temporally-referenced phylogenies. We estimate several spatial statistics of virus spread, which reveal a higher diffusivity of <b>RABV</b> in domestic dogs compared with <b>RABV</b> in other mammals. This finding is explained by subsequent analyses of environmental heterogeneity, which indicate that factors relating to human geography {{play a significant role}} in <b>RABV</b> dispersion in domestic dogs. More generally, our results suggest that human-related factors are important worldwide in explaining <b>RABV</b> dispersion in terrestrial host species. Our study shows that phylogenetically informed viral movements can be used to elucidate the factors that impact virus dispersal, opening new opportunities for a better understanding of the impact of host species and environmental conditions on the spatial dynamics of rapidly evolving populations.
