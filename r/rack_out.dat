40|$|Operation of {{pressurised}} water reactors involves shutdown periods for refuelling and maintenance. In {{preparation for}} this, the reactor system is cooled down, depressurised and partially drained. Although reactor coolant pressure {{is lower than}} during full-power operation, there remains {{the possibility of a}} Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA), with a certain but low probability. While the decay heat to be removed is lower than that from a LOCA at full power, the reduced availability of safety systems implies a risk of failing to maintain core cooling, and hence of core damage. This is recognised though probabilistic safety analyses (PSA), which identify low but non-negligible contributions to core damage frequency from accidents during cooldown and shutdown. Analyses are made for a typical two-loop Westinghouse PWR of the consequences of a range of LOCAs during hot and intermediate shutdown, 4 and 5 hours after reactor shutdown respectively. The accumulators are isolated, while power to some of the pumped safety injection systems (SIs) is <b>racked</b> <b>out.</b> The study assesses the effectiveness of the nominally assumed SIs in restoring coolant inventory and preventing core damage, and the margi...|$|R

Hemp-lime is a novel low carbon renewable construction material that is increasingly being used in the UK for insulating timber framed buildings. When combined, timber studwork framing and hemp-lime provide a highly insulating, low carbon, energy efficient building system. By encasing the timber studs in hemp-lime there is potential for the hemp-lime to indirectly enhance the structural performance of the timber framing. This paper presents results from structural testing undertaken on timber studwork frames both with and without hemp-lime with compressive, in plane <b>racking</b> and <b>out</b> of plane bending loads applied.

40|$|Fortlax is an {{air-cooled}} {{data center}} in Norrbotten. The potential of future investments in data centers is prosperous, but sustainability is {{an increasingly important}} factor. It is important {{to make sure that}} the data centers are sufficiently cooled while too much forced cooling leads to economical losses and a waste of energy. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a CFD model of a server room at Fortlax data center that accurately predicts the temperature and flow field. The goal is to develop the CFD model in order to evaluate different cooling systems and also improve the placement of the server racks. Most of the server racks are only half full at the moment, but the heat load is supposed to increase in the near future. Therefore, it has been assumed that all the server racks generate full heat load. The commercial CFD software ANSYS CFX 16. 0 has been used to perform the simulations. The current cooling system with the current placement of the server racks resulted in some insufficiently cooled server racks. The performance of the cooling system was significantly improved when the hard-floor configuration was replaced by a raised-floor configuration. The design strategy based on hot/cold-aisles has become the standard when raised-floor configurations are used. However, the raised-floor configuration with parallel rows of server <b>racks</b> turned <b>out</b> to be the setup that performed best based on the performance metrics that were used to evaluate the results in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Uptime, {{operating}} cost and serviceability {{are the major}} concerns for data center cooling. This paper will describe an air and liquid cooling system that is optimized for data centers and does not involve major infrastructure changes. This system uses a minimum heat exchanger volume and coolant volume {{in order to simplify}} the installation at the server and data center level. The goal is to reduce chiller and server power, and removing heat from the CPU and the air in the server achieves that goal. Secondary goals include reducing the volume of liquid inside the server and making it easy to swap <b>out</b> <b>racks,</b> servers or components. The proposed system uses a normal base plate and fin heat sink, with a high performance liquid cooled heat exchanger built into it. This allows heat to be extracted from the CPU as well as the air that flows through the heat sink, removing up to 100 % of the heat from the entire server with the liquid cooled heat sink which makes it a literal ‘heat sink’...|$|R

40|$|This project {{represents}} {{a new way}} to carry multiple ATVS on a truck without having to tow a trailer behind the truck. There are two ATV racks involved, one sits in the bed of the truck and will hold two ATV’s that are parallel with the truck. The second rack (new rack) attached to the first rack resting on and overhanging the open tailgate. The third ATV sits perpendicular to the truck. The rack extension has critical requirements like weight, load, and dimensional sizing. Analysis was conducted to ensure that the pins that connect the two racks would withstand the loads created by the ATV and moving vehicle and must be securely attached to the old rack while resisting the forces at highway speeds. The new <b>rack</b> was manufactured <b>out</b> of 1. 25 by 1. 25 inch square tubing of steel. Testing of this project has proven that the amount of weight being applied to the rack will be within the limitations that were calculated by using section of methods and calculated the amount of stress being applied to the rack. It has also shown that the deflection is less than an inch of movement downwards as well.

I had my newspaper, but seeing him in that overflowing mood I responded readily enough, for I was curious to know why he appeared so happy and who and what he was. Not a tradesman nor a bagman, and not a farmer, though he looked like an open-air man; nor could I form a guess from his speech and manner as to his native place. A robust man of thirty-eight or forty, with blue eyes and a Saxon face, he looked a thorough Englishman, and yet he struck me as most un-English in his lively, almost eager manner, his freedom with a stranger, and something, too, in his speech. From time to time his face lighted up, when, looking to the window, his eyes rested on some pretty scene--a glimpse of stately old elm trees in a field where cattle were grazing, of the vivid green valley of a chalk stream, the paler hills beyond, the grey church tower or spire of some tree-hidden village. When he discovered that these hills and streams and rustic villages had as great a charm for me as for himself, that I knew and loved the two or three places he named in a questioning way, he opened his heart and the secret of his present happiness.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{starts out}} {{describing}} the nonchalant nature of how General Hollingsworth eliminates his enemies {{and is not}} bothered by their deaths. After pinning two medals to the Colonel’s doctor for his outstanding efforts, Hollingsworth displays a map showing their next target. He states that the next mission for his team to complete is to free Routes 13 and 16 of any Viet Cong. Hollingsworth notes that these two roads were initially used to carry supplies up from Saigon to Phuoc Vinh. After the General motivates his team, he tells them all {{that they are going}} to [...] "zap" [...] all of the enemies so that no more remain. Once he gets situated in his helicopter, he tells the pilots that it hasn’t been a very productive day for his unit; The Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie Companies were unsuccessful in killing any enemies after finding a possible Viet Cong headquarters. When Hollingsworth learns that there has been some sniper activity in the area, he orders the pilots to take him to Battalion HQ. Despite the pilots’ hesitation, he demands that they fulfill his request. Once he arrives, Hollingsworth asks the soldiers if they have killed any Congs yet. After hearing that they have not, he is infuriated and demands that they start killing as soon as possible. Back in the helicopter, Hollingsworth sees the white smoke and then witnesses the air strike that is supposedly going to eliminate all enemy targets. He says that he wasn’t sure if the snipers were in this location, but if they weren’t, he was going to [...] "zap" [...] the whole forest if he had to. After the pilot points out two Congs running in the bushes, General Hollingsworth grabs his M16 off of the <b>rack</b> and leans <b>out</b> of the helicopter, ready to shoot and kill the two possible soldiers. Attempting to eliminate the two Congs, a smoke canister is dropped and a white vapor covers the scene. Hollingsworth circles the area five times to secure the enemies killing. These attempts were unsuccessful after the narrator admits that he just saw the running figures in the bushes. The chopper is flown low into the ground and the Lieutenant grabs the runner. General Hollingworth assures himself that the man they captured was in fact a Cong, and then they land at a base camp. An ambulance quickly arrives to administer health care to this victim. Hollingsworth discovers that this man’s objective was to mine at Route 16 and fire at enemy helicopters. The General compliments himself back and forth and says that he will attack whomever he has to in order to succeed. He then states that nothing is better than [...] "killin’ Cong".|$|R
6000|$|He wandered restlessly {{from room}} to room of the club, {{returning}} the greetings of his acquaintances with a certain vagueness, lingering nowhere for more than a moment or two. Finally, he took his hat from the <b>rack</b> and walked <b>out</b> into the street. Fronting him was the Thames. He leaned against the iron railing and looked out across the dusty, sun-baked gardens to where the river flowed down between the bridges. Something of the despair, which had so nearly broken his heart a short while since, seemed again to lay tormenting clutches upon him. After all, was not a man for ever the slave of his past? No present success, no future triumphs could ever wholly free him from the memory of that one merciless hour. As a rule his thoughts recoiled shuddering from even the slightest lingering about it. To-night there swept in upon him with irresistible force a crowd of vivid memories. He saw the quaint old village, its grey stone houses dotted about the hillside, the farmhouse which had been his home--bare, gaunt, everything outside and in typical of the man who ruled there and over the little neighbourhood, a tyrant and a despot. The misery of those days laid hold of him, He turned away from the railings and walked Strandwards, past the door of his lodgings and round many side streets, grimy and unpretentious. He walked like a man possessed, but his memories had taken firm hold of him, shadowy but inexorcisable fiends. It was Cicely now who was walking by his side, and his heart was beating with something of the old stir. What a change her coming had made in that strange corner of the world. Cicely, with her dainty figure and bright, sunny smile, wonderfully light-hearted, a gleam of brilliant colour thrown across their grey life. She loved poetry too, the hills, the sunsets, and those long walks across the purple moorland. It was a wonderful companionship into which they had drifted. He was her refuge in a life which she frankly declared to be insupportable. She was a revelation to him--the first he had had--of delicate femininity, full ever of suggestions of that wonderful world beyond, of which at that time he had only dared to dream. It was she who had kindled his ambitions, who had preached to him silently, but with convincing eloquence, of the glories of freedom, the heritage of his manhood. And all the while Joan, from apart, was watching them. No word crossed her lips, yet often on their return from a day's rambling he caught a look in her eyes which amazed him. Gideon Strong went his way unseeing, stern, and unbending as ever even to his younger daughter, but in those days there was thunder always in the air. Douglas remembered the sensation and shuddered. Once he had come across Joan and her sister together suddenly, and had found it hard work to keep from a shriek of terror. There was a light in Joan's eyes--it seemed to him that he had seen it there often lately. Was there another Joan whom he did not know? ...|$|R
