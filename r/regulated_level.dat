If the battery becomes disconnected while it is being charged the alternator load suddenly decreases.

5000|$|In 1951, Walter Byers rose as {{the head}} {{authority}} of the NCAA. Upon his appointment to his position, he created the term “student-athlete” in order to place emphasis on collegiate athletes being students first before athletes. This tactic was used {{in order to further}} discourage universities from treating their athletes as professionals with compensation beyond the <b>regulated</b> <b>level,</b> thus solidifying their amateur status. However, Byers views about the level of compensation for athletes would gradually change towards the end of his career. He initially aimed to support rules and regulations that helped to keep college athletics as a student activity versus a profession. But as the business of collegiate sports continued to expand and transform into a multi-billion dollar industry, Byers would go as far as to support the right of endorsement to be granted to student-athletes. [...] Although Byers would be pushed out of his position to lower his voice supporting commercial endorsement, the NCAA would add the right to having their room, board, and “laundry money” be covered by athletic scholarship before Byers ended his term. The next major regulation change occurred in 2011, when the president of the NCAA Mark Emmert allowed Division 1 institutions to give a $2000 stipend to student-athletes on top of their cost of attendance. Emmert continues to seek additional financial support for student-athletes that covers necessary expenses outside of what is covered by athletic scholarship.|$|E

Altered heat loss has been proposed {{as a response to}} altered gravitational environments, but remains documented only as changes in skin temperature. Changes in circadian timing, including the body temperature rhythm, have been shown in both hypergravity and microgravity, and probably contribute to alterations in sleep and performance. Changes in body temperature regulation may result from circadian disturbance, from the direct or indirect actions of gravity on the regulated temperature, or from changes in thermoregulatory effectors (heat production and heat loss) due to altered gravitational load and convective changes. To date, however, we have little data on the underlying thermoregulatory changes in altered gravity, and thus the precise mechanisms by which gravity alters temperature regulation remain largely unknown...|$|E

A 22 gauge stainless steel, 51 -mm needle packed with Tenax TA and Carboxen 1000 particles is used as the NTD. Three different HS-NTD sampling methodologies are evaluated and all give limits of detection for the target VOCs in the ng L− 1 range. Active (purge-and-trap) HS-NTD sampling is found to give the best sensitivity but requires exhaustive control of the sampling conditions. The use of the NTD to collect the headspace gas sample results in a combined adsorption/desorption mechanism. The testing of different temperatures for the HS thermostating reveals a greater desorption effect when the sample is allowed to diffuse, whether passively or actively, through the sorbent particles.

Type IIalpha PIPkin interacts with all three known type I PIPkins (alpha, beta and gamma), and in each case co-expression of the type I isoform with type IIalpha results in recruitment of the latter from the cytosol to the plasma membrane of the cell.

40|$|Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) {{have been}} used {{successfully}} to create genome-specific double-strand breaks and thereby stimulate gene targeting by several thousand fold. ZFNs are chimeric proteins composed of a specific DNA-binding domain linked to a non-specific DNA-cleavage domain. By changing key residues in the recognition helix of the specific DNAbinding domain, one can alter the ZFN binding specificity and thereby change the sequence to which a ZFN pair is being targeted. For these and other reasons, ZFNs are being pursued as reagents for genome modification, including use in gene therapy. In order for ZFNs to reach their full potential, {{it is important to}} attenuate the cytotoxic effects currently associated with many ZFNs. Here, we evaluate two potential strategies for reducing toxicity by <b>regulating</b> protein <b>levels.</b> Both strategies involve creating ZFNs with shortened half-lives and then <b>regulating</b> protein <b>level</b> with small molecules.

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the leaching of arsenic from sludge/waste of seven SONO filters that were operated in Rajarampur of Chapai Nawabganj district. For this, Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test was performed. To understand actual leaching of arsenic, a Simulated Natural Column (SNC) that {{is comparable to}} natural mature landfill was devised. Total arsenic concentration (AsT) was measured by HG-AAS. The studied arsenic waste/sludge, having 7. 0 - 9. 2 % solid content, were alkaline in nature (pH values of 7. 9 - 8. 7) and had arsenic and iron concentrations of 4. 54 - 5. 50 and 480 - 1039 mg kg- 1 respectively. The TCLP test reveals that 6. 4 - 19. 4 % (average 14 %) of arsenic was leached from the waste (average leachate AsT before and after TCLP were 5. 04 and 0. 71 mg kg- 1 respectively). After 102 days of continuous operation in SNC, AsT in the leachate {{was found to be}} 0. 223 mg L- 1, although initial AsT was 0. 350 mg L- 1. It was observed that AsT in SNC leachate increased up to 54 days (corresponding to 1. 741 mg L- 1) and then decreased in reciprocal quadratic pattern. Comparison shows that TCLP underpredicts 14. 2 % of arsenic leaching than that of SNC. Since leachate AsT in both methods did not exceed the USEPA <b>regulated</b> <b>level</b> of 5 mg L- 1, the studied waste/sludge was not hazardous...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} assay {{used for}} detecting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors has been optimised to detect pirimiphos-methyl in durum wheat. Pirimiphos-methyl is a phosphothionate insecticide {{and so it}} needs to be transformed into the corresponding oxo form to act as an effective AChE inhibitor. The inhibition assay was based on the electrochemical detection of the product of AChE, choline, via choline oxidase biosensors obtained with Prussian-Blue modified screen printed electrodes. The procedure for the oxidation of pirimiphos methyl via N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and AChE inhibition was optimised for reagent concentrations and inhibition time in a buffer solution. A calibration of the pirimiphos-methyl (25 - 1, 000 ng/ml) was obtained in the buffer. The intra-electrode CV ranged between 1. 6 and 15. 0, whereas the inter-electrode CV ranged between 4. 6 and 16. 0. The detection limit (LOD) was 38 ng/ml, and the I- 50 % was 360 ng/ml. The assay conditions were then re-optimised to work with durum wheat extracts, and the calibrations were obtained under different experimental conditions, such as sample pretreatment (milled or whole grains) and extract concentration. The calibrations were slightly affected by the sample matrix, resulting in an increased LOD (65 - 133 ng/ml) and I- 50 % (640 - 1, 650 ng/ml).

For biogenic amines biosensor, the basic principle is the action of diamine oxidase (DAO) that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of primary amines to the corresponding aldehydes, hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. Biogenic amines concentration can be measured by monitoring either the decrease in oxygen or the increase of hydrogen peroxide concentration. Recently, {{it has been found}} that DAO from pea seedlings shows higher activity compared to commercial porcine kidney diamine oxidase (PKAO). For that reason, in this research, DAO from Cicer arietinum (chick pea) seedlings will be used to develop the biogenic amines biosensor. Amine oxidases from chick pea (CPAO) was successfully purified following three chromatographic steps, giving a specific activity of 12. 7, 11. 7 and 0. 45 U/mg with putrescine, cadaverine and histamine as substrate, respectively. The molecular mass of the CPAO was 73 kDa, determined by SDS-PAGE. Immobilization of PKAO in crosslinked poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has been performed, and PVA concentration of 10 % and cross-linking ratio (CR) of 0. 06 were found to be the optimum parameters for CPAO immobilization.
