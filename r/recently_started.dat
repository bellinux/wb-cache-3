5|$|Unlike {{that of his}} contemporary, the Finn Jean Sibelius, Nielsen's {{reputation}} abroad did {{not start}} to evolve until after World War II. For some time, international interest was largely directed towards his symphonies while his other works, many of them highly popular in Denmark, have only <b>recently</b> <b>started</b> {{to become part of}} the world repertoire. Even in Denmark, many of his compositions failed to impress. It was only in 1897 after the first performance of Hymnus amoris that he received support from the critics, to be substantially reinforced in 1906 by their enthusiastic reception of Masquerade.|$|E

5|$|The 1990 New York Giants {{season was}} one of the most {{successful}} seasons in the professional football franchise's history. The Giants, who play in the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL), won their sixth championship and second Super Bowl. Led by linebacker Lawrence Taylor and quarterbacks Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler, the Giants posted a 13–3 record before defeating the Chicago Bears and the two-time defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in the NFC playoffs. In Super Bowl XXV, they defeated the Buffalo Bills 20–19 in Tampa Stadium against a patriotic backdrop inspired by the <b>recently</b> <b>started</b> Gulf War. The story of the season is the subject of a recent book, When the Cheering Stops, by defensive end Leonard Marshall and CBSsports.com co-writer William Bendetson.|$|E
5|$|The {{viability}} of a game's platform can also affect both the localization and the release, {{as in the}} case of the PlayStation Portable-exclusive Final Fantasy Type-0, which would eventually come West as a high definition port for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and Seiken Densetsu 3, which was not localized due to undefined technical problems. The company has also <b>recently</b> <b>started</b> releasing Japanese voice tracks as downloadable content, {{as in the case}} of Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII and one of the titles it has published, the Access Games-developed Drakengard 3. Another aspect of Square Enix's policy concerning the Western release of games was to make games that appealed to both Western and Japanese audiences, but the worldwide success of the Japan-aimed Bravely Default caused them to rethink their strategy. Although English was originally the main language of Square Enix's foreign releases, including in non-English speaking countries, it seems some titles may debut without an English release in the future, such as the Chinese version of Dragon Quest X before an North American or European release has been confirmed. Final Fantasy XV, on the other hand, was the first Final Fantasy game to feature nine languages in a simultaneous launch.|$|E
