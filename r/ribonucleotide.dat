5|$|From {{about three}} billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein {{families}} drive {{the evolution of}} selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells {{seem to have a}} bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish, and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin. One family of selenium-bearing molecules (the glutathione peroxidases) destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme <b>ribonucleotide</b> reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.|$|E
5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA <b>ribonucleotide</b> as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E
25|$|Many domains in {{eukaryotic}} multidomain proteins can {{be found}} as independent proteins in prokaryotes, suggesting that domains in multidomain proteins have once existed as independent proteins. For example, vertebrates have a multi-enzyme polypeptide containing the GAR synthetase, AIR synthetase and GAR transformylase domains (GARs-AIRs-GARt; GAR: glycinamide <b>ribonucleotide</b> synthetase/transferase; AIR: aminoimidazole <b>ribonucleotide</b> synthetase). In insects, the polypeptide appears as GARs-(AIRs)2-GARt, in yeast GARs-AIRs is encoded separately from GARt, and in bacteria each domain is encoded separately.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that <b>ribonucleotides</b> may represent {{one of the most}} common non-standard nucleotides found in genomic DNA. Therefore, it is important to understand the extent to which <b>ribonucleotides</b> alter genomic integrity and the cellular mechanisms that are responsible for removing them. We developed oligonucleotide-driven gene correction assays in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that, if not removed, mispaired and paired <b>ribonucleotides</b> embedded in genomic DNA serve as templates for DNA synthesis and could cause genetic change. We found that RNase H type 2 targets single paired and mispaired <b>ribonucleotides,</b> as well as a stretch of two or three <b>ribonucleotides</b> embedded in DNA, and the nucleotide excision repair system can target single paired <b>ribonucleotides</b> as damage...|$|R
50|$|<b>Ribonucleotides</b> {{are also}} {{utilized}} in other cellular functions. These special monomers are utilized in both cell regulation and cell signaling {{as seen in}} adenosine-monophosphate (AMP). Furthermore, <b>ribonucleotides</b> {{can be converted to}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency in organisms. <b>Ribonucleotides</b> can be converted to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) to regulate hormones in organisms as well. In living organisms, the most common bases for <b>ribonucleotides</b> are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or uracil (U). The nitrogenous bases are classified into two parent compounds, purine and pyrimidine.|$|R
50|$|In summary, {{this study}} {{highlights}} {{the fact that}} the <b>ribonucleotides</b> can be highly deleterious to the mammalian cell, causing genome instability, and that the RNaseH2 is a critical enzyme for ensuring integrity of genomic DNA. It also calls for attention and interest about the pathway(s) that remove <b>ribonucleotides</b> from genomic DNA, site and nature of <b>ribonucleotides</b> -induced DNA damage, and distribution of <b>ribonucleotides</b> in the genome. Knowing this, it may gain understanding about the pathological and physiological roles of RN in genomic DNA, of significance to both nucleic acid-driven autoimmunity and carcinogenesis.|$|R
25|$|The most {{abundant}} class of deoxyribozymes are ribonucleases, which catalyze the cleavage of a <b>ribonucleotide</b> phosphodiester bond through a transesterification reaction, forming a 2'3'-cyclic phosphate terminus and a 5'-hydroxyl terminus.|$|E
25|$|Prior to his move, Sanger began {{exploring}} {{the possibility of}} sequencing RNA molecules and began developing methods for separating <b>ribonucleotide</b> fragments generated with specific nucleases. This work he did while trying to refine the sequencing techniques he had developed during his work on insulin.|$|E
25|$|CrRNAs {{associate}} with Cas proteins to form <b>ribonucleotide</b> complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which {{is indicative of}} an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system. The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins bound to a single crRNA.|$|E
40|$|Established {{approaches}} {{to estimate the}} number of <b>ribonucleotides</b> present in a genome are limited to the quantitation of incorporated <b>ribonucleotides</b> using short synthetic DNA fragments or plasmids as templates and then extrapolating the results to the whole genome. Alternatively, the number of <b>ribonucleotides</b> present in a genome may be estimated using alkaline gels or Southern blots. More recent in vivo approaches employ Next-generation sequencing allowing genome-wide mapping of <b>ribonucleotides,</b> providing the position and identity of embedded <b>ribonucleotides.</b> However, they do not allow quantitation {{of the number of}} <b>ribonucleotides</b> which are incorporated into a genome. Here we describe how to simultaneously map and quantitate the number of <b>ribonucleotides</b> which are incorporated into human mitochondrial DNA in vivo by Next-generation sequencing. We use highly intact DNA and introduce sequence specific double strand breaks by digesting it with an endonuclease, subsequently hydrolyzing incorporated <b>ribonucleotides</b> with alkali. The generated ends are ligated with adapters and these ends are sequenced on a Next-generation sequencing machine. The absolute number of <b>ribonucleotides</b> can be calculated as the number of reads outside the recognition site per average number of reads at the recognition site for the sequence specific endonuclease. This protocol may also be utilized to map and quantitate free nicks in DNA and allows adaption to map other DNA lesions that can be processed to 5 ´-OH ends or 5 ´-phosphate ends. Furthermore, this method can be applied to any organism, given that a suitable reference genome is available. This protocol therefore provides an important tool to study DNA replication, 5 ´-end processing, DNA damage, and DNA repair...|$|R
50|$|During DNA synthesis, DNA polymerases must select against <b>ribonucleotides,</b> {{present at}} much higher levels {{compared}} with deoxyribonucleotides. It {{is crucial that}} there is selectivity as DNA replication has to be accurate to maintain the organism's genome. It {{has been shown that}} the active sites of Y-family DNA polymerases are responsible for maintaining a high selectivity against <b>ribonucleotides.</b> Most DNA polymerases are also equipped to exclude <b>ribonucleotides</b> from their active site through a bulky side chain residue that can sterically block the 2'-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring. However, many nuclear replicative and repair DNA polymerases incorporate <b>ribonucleotides</b> into DNA, suggesting that the exclusion mechanism is not perfect.|$|R

25|$|The iron-dependent enzyme, <b>ribonucleotide</b> reductase (RNR), is {{essential}} for DNA synthesis. Class I RNR enzymes are constructed from large RNR1 and small RNR2 subunits which associate to form an active heterodimeric tetramer. Since the enzyme catalyses the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), precursors to DNA synthesis, it {{is essential}} for cell proliferation.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide <b>ribonucleotide</b> formyltransferase and glycinamide <b>ribonucleotide</b> formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{mechanisms}} by which NO has been demonstrated to affect the biology of living cells. These include oxidation of iron-containing proteins such as <b>ribonucleotide</b> reductase and aconitase, activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase, ADP ribosylation of proteins, protein sulfhydryl group nitrosylation, and iron regulatory factor activation. NO has been demonstrated to activate NF-κB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, an important transcription factor in iNOS gene expression in response to inflammation.|$|E

40|$|Hammerhead ribozymes are {{efficient}} RNA enzymes {{characterized by}} a typical hammerhead secondary structure {{and a number of}} conserved bases. Little is known {{about the role of the}} ribose-phosphate backbone, although it is obviously important since a DNA molecule with the same base sequence is not a catalyst. Here we describe the synthesis of artificial ribozymes where modified (2 '-O-allyl- and 2 '-O-methyl-) <b>ribonucleotides</b> substitute for the corresponding <b>ribonucleotides.</b> A systematic analysis of partially substituted polymers identified a minimum set of six non-contiguous positions where insertion of modified <b>ribonucleotides</b> strongly affects catalytic activity. Surprisingly, ribozymes completely substituted except for these six <b>ribonucleotides</b> are still very active. These molecules efficiently cleave in trans target RNAs in a sequence-specific way, but, unlike RNA ribozymes, are very resistant to nuclease degradation and are very stable in serum. These properties make such synthetic polymers potentially useful for in vivo gene expression studies and therapeutic applications...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium smegmatis encodes several DNA repair polymerases {{that are}} adept at {{incorporating}} <b>ribonucleotides,</b> which {{raises questions about}} how <b>ribonucleotides</b> in DNA are sensed and removed. RNase H enzymes, of whichM. smegmatis encodes four, are strong candidates for a surveillance role. Here, we interrogate the biochemical activity and nucleic acid substrate speci-ficity ofM. smegmatis RnhC, a bifunctional RNase H and acid phosphatase. We report that (i) the RnhC nuclease is stringently specific for RNA:DNA hybrid duplexes; (ii) RnhC does not selectively recognize and cleave DNA-RNA or RNA-DNA junctions in duplex nucleic acid; (iii) RnhC cannot incise an embeddedmonoribonucleotide or diribonucleotide in duplex DNA; (iv) RnhC can incise tracts of 4 or more <b>ribonucleotides</b> embedded in duplex DNA, leaving two or more residual <b>ribonucleotides</b> at the cleaved 3 =-OH end {{and at least one}} or two <b>ribonucleotides</b> on the 5 =-PO 4 end; (v) the RNase H activity is inherent in an autono-mous 140 -amino-acid (aa) N-terminal domain of RnhC; and (vi) the C-terminal 211 -aa domain of RnhC is an autonomous acid phosphatase. The cleavage specificity of RnhC is clearly distinct from that of Escherichia coli RNase H 2, which selectively incises at an RNA-DNA junction. Thus, we classify RnhC as a type I RNase H. The properties of RnhC are consistent with a role in Oka-zaki fragment RNA primer removal or in surveillance of oligoribonucleotide tracts embedded in DNA but not in excision repair of single misincorporated <b>ribonucleotides.</b> IMPORTANC...|$|R
25|$|The enzyme <b>ribonucleotide</b> reductase (RNR) catalyzes the de novo {{synthesis}} of dNDPs. Catalysis of ribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (NDPs) involves a reduction at the 2’-carbon of ribose 5-phosphate to form the 2’-deoxy derivative-reduced 2’-deoxyribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (dNDPs). This reduction is initiated with the generation of a free radical. Following a single reduction, RNR requires electrons donated from the dithiol groups of the protein thioredoxin. Regeneration of thioredoxin occurs when {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) provides two hydrogen atoms that are used to reduce the disulfide groups of thioredoxin.|$|E
25|$|Flap {{endonuclease}} 1 (FEN1) {{is responsible}} for processing Okazaki fragments. It works with DNA polymerase to remove the RNA primer of an Okazaki fragment and can remove the 5' <b>ribonucleotide</b> and 5' flaps when DNA polymerase displaces the strands during lagging strand synthesis. The removal of these flaps involves a process called nick translation and creates a nick for ligation. Thus, FEN1's function is necessary to Okazaki fragment maturation in forming a long continuous DNA strand. Likewise, during DNA base repair, the damaged nucleotide is displaced into a flap and subsequently removed by FEN1.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to other genome editing techniques TALEN {{falls in the}} middle in terms of difficulty and cost. Unlike ZFNs, TALEN recognizes single nucleotides. It's far more straightforward to engineer interactions between TALEN DNA binding domains and their target nucleotides {{than it is to}} create interactions with ZNFs and their target nucleotide triplets. On the other hand, CRISPR relies on <b>ribonucleotide</b> complex formation instead of protein/DNA recognition. gRNAs can target nearly any sequence in the genome and they can be cheaply produced, thus making CRISPR more efficient and less expensive than both TALEN and ZFN. TALEN is ultimately 200 times more expensive than CRISPR and takes several months more to perform.|$|E

25|$|Heterozygous females can be {{difficult}} to diagnose. With the rise of sequencing techniques, molecular testing has become preferred, particularly when the disease causing mutations in the family are known. Historically, heterozygous females were often diagnosed using an allopurinol challenge. In a female with reduced enzyme activity, an oral dose of allopurinol would be metabolized to oxypurinol <b>ribonucleotide,</b> which blocks the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. When this induced enzymatic block is combined with reduced physiologic enzyme activity as seen in heterozygotes, the elevation of orotic acid could be used to differentiate heterozygotes from unaffected individuals. This test was not universally effective, as it had both false negative and false positive results.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{initiation}} complex is open, the first <b>ribonucleotide</b> {{is brought into}} the active site to initiate the polymerization reaction {{in the absence of}} a primer. This generates a nascent RNA chain that forms a hetero-duplex with the template DNA strand. However, before entering the elongation phase, polymerase may terminate prematurely and release a short, truncated transcript. This process is called abortive initiation. Many cycles of abortive initiation may occur before the transcript grows to sufficient length to promote polymerase escape from the promoter. Throughout abortive initiation cycles, RNA polymerase remains bound to the promoter and pulls downstream DNA into its catalytic cleft in a scrunching-kind of motion.|$|E

40|$|A new column, Dionex AS 4 A, (polystyrenedivinylbenzene matrix) {{used for}} the {{separation}} of <b>ribonucleotides</b> and deoxyribonucleotides for the first time, and previously used for ion analysis was found superior to conventional silica columns because it separates <b>ribonucleotides</b> and deoxyribonucleotides. Resolution of dGTP was not possible with the Dionex column and CTP and GDP often co-eluted. Using conventional silica columns, monophosphates separated from diphosphates and diphosphates from triphosphates. Using the new Dionex column resolves all three simultaneously. The Dionex column resolved nucleotides with sharper peaks than silica columns, and the longer its retention time the better was the resolution.

25|$|<b>Ribonucleotide</b> reductase (RNR), {{also known}} as {{ribonucleoside}} diphosphate reductase (rNDP), is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides. Deoxyribonucleotides in turn {{are used in the}} synthesis of DNA. The reaction catalyzed by RNR is strictly conserved in all living organisms. Furthermore, RNR plays a critical role in regulating the total rate of DNA synthesis so that DNA to cell mass is maintained at a constant ratio during cell division and DNA repair. A somewhat unusual feature of the RNR enzyme is that it catalyzes a reaction that proceeds via a free radical mechanism of action. The substrates for RNR are ADP, GDP, CDP and UDP. dTDP (deoxythymidine diphosphate) is synthesized by another enzyme (thymidylate kinase) from dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate).|$|E
25|$|Transcription {{fidelity}} {{is achieved}} through multiple mechanisms. RNA polymerases select correct nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate to prevent transcription errors. Only the NTP which correctly base pairs with the coding {{base in the}} DNA is admitted to the active center. RNA polymerase performs two known proof reading functions to detect and remove misincorporated nucleotides: pyrophosphorylytic editing and hydrolytic editing. The former removes the incorrectly inserted <b>ribonucleotide</b> by a simple reversal of the polymerization reaction, while the latter involves backtracking of the polymerase and cleaving of a segment of error-containing RNA product. Elongation factor TFIIS stimulates an inherent ribonuclease activity in the polymerase, allowing the removal of misincorporated bases through limited local RNA degradation. Note that all reactions (phosphodiester bond synthesis, pyrophosphorolysis, phosphodiester bond hydrolysis) are performed by RNA polymerase by using a single active center.|$|E
25|$|Pyrimidine ribonucleosides {{and their}} {{respective}} nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries. Sutherland has demonstrated high yielding routes to cytidine and uridine ribonucleotides built from small 2 and 3 carbon fragments such as glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, cyanamide and cyanoacetylene. One of the steps in this sequence allows the isolation of enantiopure ribose aminooxazoline if the enantiomeric excess of glyceraldehyde is 60% or greater. This {{can be viewed as}} a prebiotic purification step, where the said compound spontaneously crystallized out from a mixture of the other pentose aminooxazolines. Ribose aminooxazoline can then react with cyanoacetylene in a mild and highly efficient manner to give the alpha cytidine <b>ribonucleotide.</b> Photoanomerization with UV light allows for inversion about the 1' anomeric centre to give the correct beta stereochemistry. In 2009 they showed that the same simple building blocks allow access, via phosphate controlled nucleobase elaboration, to 2',3'-cyclic pyrimidine nucleotides directly, which are known to be able to polymerize into RNA. This paper also highlights the possibility for the photo-sanitization of the pyrimidine-2',3'-cyclic phosphates.|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{regulation}} of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate-limiting enzyme of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, we {{examined the effects of}} nucleosides, nucleotides, nucleotide analogs, or the IMPDH inhibitor mycophenolic acid (MPA) on the steady-state levels of IMPDH mRNA. The results indicated that IMPDH gene expression is regulated inversely by the intracellular level of guanine <b>ribonucleotides.</b> We have shown that treatment with guanosine increased the level of cellular guanine <b>ribonucleotides</b> and subsequently reduced IMPDH steady-state mRNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Conversely, MPA treatment diminished the level of guanine <b>ribonucleotides</b> and increased IMPDH mRNA levels. Both of these effects on the steady-state level of IMPDH mRNA could be negated by cotreatment with guanosine and MPA. The down regulation of IMPDH gene expression by guanosine or its up regulation by MPA was not due to major changes in transcriptional initiation and elongation or mRNA stability in the cytoplasm but rather was due to alterations in the levels of the IMPDH mRNA in the nucleus. These results suggest that IMPDH gene expression is regulated by a posttranscriptional, nuclear event in response to fluctuations in the intracellular level of guanine <b>ribonucleotides...</b>|$|R

Therefore, cancer reprogramming may be a useful treatment for chemo- or radiotherapy-resistant cancer cells. It was also reported that the introduction of endogenous small-sized, non-coding <b>ribonucleotides</b> such as microRNA (miR) 302 s and miR- 369 - 3 p or - 5 p resulted in the induction of cellular reprogramming. miRs are smaller than the genes of transcription factors, making them possibly suitable for use in clinical strategies.

This resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion and the stimulation of the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition phenotype in colon cancer cells. Importantly, the introduction of the <b>ribonucleotides</b> resulted in epigenetic reprogramming of DNA demethylation and histone modification events. Furthermore, in vivo administration of the <b>ribonucleotides</b> in mice elicited the induction of cancer cell apoptosis, which involves the mitochondrial Bcl 2 protein family. The present study shows that the introduction of miR- 302 s and miR- 369 s could induce cellular reprogramming and modulate malignant phenotypes of human colorectal cancer, suggesting that the appropriate delivery of functional small-sized <b>ribonucleotides</b> may open a new avenue for therapy against human malignant tumors...|$|R
