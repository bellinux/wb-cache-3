5|$|The {{geography}} of Ratanakiri Province is diverse, encompassing rolling hills, mountains, plateaus, lowland watersheds, and crater lakes. Two major rivers, Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, flow {{from east to}} west across the province. The province is known for its lush forests; as of 1997, 70–80% of the province was forested, either with old-growth forest or with secondary forest regrown after shifting cultivation. In the far north of the province are mountains of the Annamite Range; the area is characterized by dense broadleaf evergreen forests, relatively poor soil, and abundant wildlife. In the highlands between Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, the home of the vast majority of Ratanakiri's population, a hilly basalt plateau provides fertile <b>red</b> <b>soils.</b> Secondary forests dominate this region. South of the Srepok River is a flat area of tropical deciduous forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{neck of the}} emu is {{pale blue}} and shows through its sparse {{feathers}}. They have grey-brown plumage of shaggy appearance; the shafts and {{the tips of the}} feathers are black. Solar radiation is absorbed by the tips, and the inner plumage insulates the skin. This prevents the birds from overheating, allowing them to be active during the heat of the day. A unique feature of the emu feather is the double rachis emerging from a single shaft. Both of the rachis have the same length, and the texture is variable; the area near the skin is rather furry, but the more distant ends resemble grass. The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male's penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates. The plumage varies in colour due to environmental factors, giving the bird a natural camouflage. Feathers of emus in more arid areas with <b>red</b> <b>soils</b> have a rufous tint while birds residing in damp conditions are generally darker in hue. The juvenile plumage develops at about three months and is blackish finely barred with brown, with the head and neck being especially dark. The facial feathers gradually thin to expose the bluish skin. The adult plumage has developed by about fifteen months.|$|E
2500|$|The Red Hill ridge is said by geologists {{to be an}} [...] "erosion residual" [...] {{resulting}} from metamorphisis of sedimentary rock. The Yarralumla Formation sediments were toughened by thermal metamorphism from a small granite intrusion to the south thereby providing the resistant core of the ridge. The granite is deeply weathered and does not outcrop but is evident by the smooth slopes and deep <b>red</b> <b>soils</b> on the lower slopes to the north-west by {{the road to the}} Federal Golf Course. This intrusion is known as Federal Golf Course Tonalite. [...] It is dated at 417±8 Mya.

40|$|On Shibayama, a hill {{situated}} at the northern extremity of Nijozan Volcanic Group, a <b>red</b> colored <b>soil</b> (abbreviated as <b>red</b> <b>soil)</b> is distributed contacting with a brown soil derived from the same basaltic andesitic origin. Under the brown soil, floaters were found just as in commonly weathered basaltic soils, whereas intermediates which keep the original texture were seen under the <b>red</b> <b>soil.</b> To discuss the forming process and specificities of this <b>red</b> <b>soil,</b> some pedological studies were made on these <b>soils,</b> the <b>red</b> intermediates, two other brown basaltic soils for comparison, and their parent rocks. Shibayama basaltic andesite was a compact grayish black rock with phenocrysts of olivine, augite, and plagioclase. Its groundmass was mainly composed of plagioclase. With increasing red color in intermediates, olivine phenocrysts were first altered to chlorite and/or opaque clayey materials. Each sand fraction contained magnetite, augite (except Shibayama <b>red</b> <b>soil),</b> glass, and plagioclase. The predominant clay mineral in Shibayama <b>red</b> <b>soil</b> was montmorillonite, and in other soil samples, dehydrated halloysite. Shibayama <b>red</b> <b>soil</b> had more clay fraction than other brown soils, and cation exchange capacity of this specimen was very high, corresponding to its high montmorillonite content. The base content decreased and total iron content increased from the fresh basaltic andesite, through the red intermediates, to the <b>red</b> <b>soil.</b> Both total and free iron content {{were higher in the}} brown soil than in the <b>red</b> <b>soil,</b> while the content of hematite form iron oxide was higher in the <b>red</b> <b>soil</b> than in the brown soils. Based on the results thus obtained from field observation, as well as mineralogical and chemical researches, together with the data of some reports by other research workers on the <b>red</b> colored <b>soils,</b> it is assumed that the original material of Shibayama <b>red</b> basaltic <b>soil</b> had suffered certain primary alteration due to some geological effects before soil formation proceeded...|$|R

40|$|Now a days, a large {{acres of}} land is {{occupied}} by industrial waste. It not only creates land problem but also creates environmental problems. In order to utilise the industrial waste, an attempt is made to stabilise the <b>red</b> <b>soil</b> by adding blast furnace slag. This project work aims to evaluate the effect of addition of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % blast furnace slag in order to stabilize the <b>red</b> <b>soil</b> and to verify its suitability {{to be used as}} a construction material for road, embankment and structural fills. The blast furnace slag is collected from Rourkela Steel Plant and the <b>red</b> <b>soil</b> is collected from the campus of National Institute of Technology Rourkela for evaluating its suitability as a construction material for various geotechnical works. Its consistency properties, compaction properties, and strength parameter are tested. In this project the effects of addition of blast furnace slag is investigated and is compared with that of the virgin <b>red</b> <b>soil.</b> The overall testing program was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the physical, and chemical engineering properties of the <b>red</b> <b>soil</b> samples were studied by conducting Hydrometer analysis, Light compaction test and UCS test.

The isolates of the virus {{used in this study}} were CMB (Coimbatore), NGM (Negamum) and OTY (Ooty) all collected from Tamil Nadu, India. Two types of soils viz., black <b>soil</b> and <b>red</b> <b>soil</b> were selected to study the persistence of HearNPV. Each virus isolate (1 x 10 9 OB mL - 1) was added to 2 kg of each soil and kept in indoor and outdoor conditions in plastic troughs for 6 months. Assays were carried out with extracted viruses from each soil at monthly intervals against early second instar larvae of H. armigera. Results indicated that as the period of storage of virus in soil was advanced the mean mortality percentage declined. Also, the comparison of results showed that the virus treated black soil kept indoor could relatively retain its infectivity (52. 66, 58. 56 and 54. 35 % OAR with CMB, NGM and OTY isolates, respectively) longer period compared to the soil kept outdoor. Similar kind of trend was also noticed with <b>red</b> <b>soil.</b> However, the infectivity was relatively more in the case of HearNPV stored in <b>red</b> <b>soil</b> compared to those stored in black soil. This high amount of persistence in <b>red</b> <b>soil</b> {{may be due to the}} fact that adsorption rate was higher in <b>red</b> <b>soil</b> than black soil.
