5|$|The Memorial {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} some families of officers {{killed in the}} line of duty, regarding the high cost, and that the roll of honour lists only those officers killed during arrests or as a result of criminal acts, rather than all officers killed {{in the line of}} duty; also that, with the book being behind glass, friends and relatives of the deceased are not able to view the relevant page. Before construction, objections were also raised to the Memorial's construction by the London Historical Parks Group and the local residents' association. Concern was also raised by some Irish <b>republicans</b> <b>that</b> the Memorial includes the names of those RUC officers killed in The Troubles.|$|E
5|$|Barkley and {{his wife}} Dorothy took a {{vacation}} after the convention, returning to Kentucky in August 1928 to find that, in his absence, Barkley had been chosen state chairman of Smith's campaign. He campaigned for Smith, but Herbert Hoover won a landslide victory. After the election, Barkley led a coalition of liberal Democrats and <b>Republicans</b> <b>that</b> opposed Hoover's use of protective tariffs, a debate that took particular urgency following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Barkley opposed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, claiming it would cost Americans both jobs and exports, but Congress approved it, and Hoover signed it on June 17, 1930. When Congress adjourned, Barkley accompanied Sherwood Eddy and fellow senators Burton K. Wheeler and Bronson M. Cutting to the Soviet Union in August 1930. He {{was impressed by the}} industrial development brought about by Joseph Stalin's first five-year plan but did not advocate closer diplomatic ties with the Communist nation, as some of his colleagues did.|$|E
5|$|By December 1, 1864, all {{soldiers}} {{had left the}} county to search for armed resistance {{in other parts of}} Pennsylvania. Though widespread draft evasion was evidenced in Columbia County, there was never serious armed resistance. At the end of Columbia County's occupation, the county's Democrats were deeply embittered by the arrests. It is likely that the rumor of the fort originated from sightings of large piles of shingles gathered by draft-evading shingle makers. Wooden tubs for gathering sap from sugar maples seen from a distance were likely mistaken for the fort's cannons. A deserters' hideout on North Mountain, a cabin 20 feet (6 meters) square and two stories high, may {{have been the subject of}} exaggerated claims by <b>Republicans</b> <b>that</b> the cabin was a fort. A structure that may have once been this cabin was rediscovered on July 13, 2007. In December 1864, the soldiers who left Columbia County went on to Clearfield County to continue their search for deserters and draft evaders.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of <b>Republicans</b> <b>that</b> protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.|$|E
5|$|On Election Day in November 1876, Tillman {{served as}} an {{election}} official at a local poll, as did two black Republicans. One arrived late and was scared off by Tillman. As there was as yet no secret ballot in South Carolina, Tillman threatened to remember any votes cast for the <b>Republicans.</b> <b>That</b> precinct gave 211 votes for the Democrats and 2 for the Republicans. Although almost two-thirds of those eligible to vote in Edgefield were African Americans, the Democrats were able to suppress the (Republican) African-American vote, reporting a win for Hampton in Edgefield County with over 60 percent of the vote. Bolstered by this result, Hampton gained a narrow victory statewide, {{at least according to}} the official returns. The Red Shirts used violence and fraud to create Democratic majorities that did not exist, and give Hampton the election.|$|E
5|$|Willkie warned <b>Republicans</b> <b>that</b> only a full {{commitment}} to {{equal rights for}} minorities would woo African Americans back to the party, and he criticized Roosevelt for yielding to Southern racists among the Democrats. Willkie addressed a convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1942, {{one of the most}} prominent politicians to do so up to that point. He urged integration of the armed forces, and when a violent race riot broke out in Detroit in June 1943, he went on national radio in order to criticize both parties for ignoring racial issues. When the movie hearings of 1941 ended without further action, Willkie had been made chairman of the board of Twentieth-Century Fox. In 1943, he worked with Walter White, executive secretary of the NAACP, to try to convince Hollywood to give blacks better treatment in films. Movie moguls promised changes, and some films featured blacks in major roles, but faced with objections from white Southerners, they reverted to giving blacks stereotyped roles after Willkie's death in 1944, such as servants. After his death, the NAACP named its headquarters the Wendell Willkie Memorial Building.|$|E

25|$|Many radical Northerners withdrew {{their support}} for land reform in the years {{following}} the war. One reason for the shift in political opinion was fear by the <b>Republicans</b> <b>that</b> land ownership might lead Blacks to align with Democrats for economic reasons. In general, politicians turned their focus to the legal status of freedpeople. In the analysis of W. E. B. Du Bois, black suffrage became more politically palatable precisely as an inexpensive alternative to well-funded agrarian reform.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally {{the party}} had no {{consistent}} color identity. After the 2000 election, the color red became associated with <b>Republicans.</b> <b>That</b> election night, for the first time, {{all of the major}} broadcast networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: states won by Republican nominee George W. Bush were colored red, and states won by Democratic nominee Al Gore were colored blue. Although the assignment of colors to political parties is unofficial and informal, the media has come to represent the respective political parties using these colors. The party and its candidates have also come to embrace the color red.|$|E

After his resignation, Stanton possessed only the remnants of his salary, and a $500 loan.

25|$|After McCain {{announced}} Palin as {{his running}} mate, Newsweek and Time put Palin on their magazine covers, {{as some of the}} media alleged that McCain's campaign was restricting press access to Palin by allowing only three one-on-one interviews and no press conferences with her. Among the reasons that the news organizations criticized the restrictions was Palin's first major interview, with Charles Gibson of ABC News, met with mixed reviews. Her interview five days later with Fox News's Sean Hannity focuses on many of the same questions from Gibson's interview. However, Palin's performance in her third interview, with Katie Couric of CBS News, was widely criticized. Palin's responses to several of Couric's questions were considered embarrassing, most notably failing to name any newspapers she read. The fallout from the interview prompted a decline in her poll numbers, concern among <b>Republicans</b> <b>that</b> she was becoming a political liability, and calls from some conservative commentators for Palin to resign from the Presidential ticket. Other conservatives remain ardent in their support for Palin, accusing the columnists of elitism. Following this interview, some Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Bill Kristol, questioned the McCain campaign's strategy of sheltering Palin from unscripted encounters with the press.|$|E
500|$|Historian Hans Trefousse {{stated in}} a 1969 {{study of the}} Radical <b>Republicans</b> <b>that</b> Stevens's [...] "one abiding passion was equality." [...] In 1991, he noted that Stevens [...] "was {{one of the most}} {{influential}} representatives ever to serve in Congress. [...] the House with his wit, knowledge of parliamentary law, and sheer willpower, even though he was often unable to prevail." [...] In his 1997 biography of Stevens, though, he took a position similar to McKitrick's: that Stevens was a relatively marginal figure, with his influence often limited by his extremism. Trefousse believed that Brodie went too far both in deeming Stevens's clubfoot responsible for so much about him, and in giving full credence to the Stevens-Smith relationship: both those things cannot now be determined with certainty.|$|E
500|$|In the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries, McCain {{endorsed}} former 2008 rival Mitt Romney and {{campaigned for}} him, but compared the contest to a Greek tragedy {{due to its}} drawn-out nature with massive super PAC-funded attack ads damaging all the contenders. [...] He labeled the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision as [...] "uninformed, arrogant, naïve", and, decrying its effects and the future scandals {{he thought it would}} bring, said it would become considered the court's [...] "worst decision ... in the 21st century". McCain took the lead in opposing the defense spending sequestrations brought on by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and gained attention for defending State Department aide Huma Abedin against charges brought by a few House <b>Republicans</b> <b>that</b> she had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.|$|E

500|$|In 1911, the State Senator for the Hampshire County area {{retired and}} {{successfully}} encouraged Coolidge {{to run for}} his seat for the 1912 session; Coolidge defeated his Democratic opponent by a large margin. At the start of that term, he became chairman of a committee to arbitrate the [...] "Bread and Roses" [...] strike by the workers of the American Woolen Company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. After two tense months, the company agreed to the workers' demands, in a settlement proposed by the committee. A major issue affecting Massachusetts <b>Republicans</b> <b>that</b> year was the party split between the progressive wing, which favored Theodore Roosevelt, and the conservative wing, which favored William Howard Taft. Although he favored some progressive measures, Coolidge refused to leave the Republican party. When the new Progressive Party declined to run a candidate in his state senate district, Coolidge won reelection against his Democratic opponent by an increased margin.|$|E
500|$|The {{isolated}} area of Vizcaya, a predominantly Basque part of northern Spain, {{was the most}} immediate target, in {{what was called the}} War in the North. It was largely a Nationalist and Italian offensive, but was supported by a consistently re-equipping Condor Legion. [...] Sperrle remained in Salamanca; Wolfram von Richthofen replaced Holle in January as deputy and in actual command. [...] The Legion's air force initially attacked the towns of Ochandiano and Durango. Durango had no anti-aircraft defence, and only minor other defences. According to the Basques, 250 civilians died on 31 March, including the priest, nuns and congregation of a church ceremony. The Germans, with their air raids, were hated. The Basque ground forces were in full retreat towards Bilbao, through the town of Guernica, which was attacked on 26 April {{in one of the most}} controversial events of the Spanish Civil War. In Operation Rügen, waves of planes bombed and strafed targets in the town. The number of casualties is a matter of controversy, with between 200 and 300 people killed; the number reported dead by the Basques was 1,654 dead and 889 wounded. Several explanations were put forward by the Nationalists, including blaming the attack on the <b>Republicans,</b> <b>that</b> the attack on the town had been a prolonged offensive. However, the nature of the operation itself makes this seem unlikely. The offensive on Bilbao, when it eventually came on 11 July, was supported by ground units of the Condor Legion, and extensive air operations. It proved the worth of the Condor Legion to the Nationalist cause.|$|E
500|$|On December 17, 2011, the Senate passed {{legislation}} {{to extend the}} Social Security payroll tax cut which had been previously enacted during the FY2011 budget negotiations. [...] That legislation had reduced the rate from 6.2% to 4.2% for the 2011 calendar year only. [...] The initial 2012 extension was for two months, rather than the full-year extension which had been sought; the legislation also extended unemployment benefits {{as well as a}} measure preventing a drop in rates for Medicare reimbursement; the spending for these was offset by enacting new fees on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. [...] Points of contention included a Democratic plan to fund the tax cut with a new surtax on income over $1 million, which was dropped in later stages of negotiation, as well as attempts by Republicans to insert language which would speed the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, which had recently been delayed by the Obama administration. [...] The bill was initially rejected in the House, whose leaders insisted on a full-year extension, {{despite the fact that the}} Senate had already adjourned for the year. [...] However, after criticism from other <b>Republicans</b> <b>that</b> the impasse would harm their prospects in the upcoming 2012 elections, the House leadership on December 23, 2011 announced that it would pass the Senate bill in return for Democrats promptly beginning negotiations on a full-year extension. [...] The bill, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2011, was passed by the House and signed by the President later that day.|$|E
