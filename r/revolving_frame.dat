The first keepers of the Cromer Lighthouse were two young women who jointly received a pound a week for their wage. The lighthouse's position at Foulness was becoming precarious due to rapid cliff erosion along this part of the North Norfolk coast. The sea's encroachment {{at the base of the}} cliff caused several land slips with serious slides recorded in 1799, 1825 and 1852. The lighthouse succumbed to the waves' actions in 1866 when it finally slipped down into the sea.|$|E

40|$|AbstractClassical (Pavlovian) {{conditioning}} procedures {{can be used}} to bias {{the appearance}} of physical stimuli. Under natural conditions this form of perceptual learning could cause perception to become more accurate by changing prior belief to be in accord with what is statistically likely. However, for learning to be of functional significance, it must last until similar stimuli are encountered again. Here, we used the apparent rotation direction of a <b>revolving</b> wire <b>frame</b> (Necker) cube to test whether a learned perceptual bias is long lasting. Apparent rotation direction was trained to have a different bias at two different retinal locations by interleaving the presentation of ambiguous cubes with presentation of cubes that were disambiguated by disparity and occlusion cues. Four groups of eight subjects were subsequently tested either 1, 7, 14, or 28 days after initial training, respectively, using a counter-conditioning procedure. All four groups showed incomplete re-learning of the reversed contingency relationship during their second session. One group repeated the counter-conditioning and showed an increase in the reverse bias, showing that the first counter-conditioning session also had a long-lasting effect. The fact that the original learning was still evident four weeks after the initial training is consistent with the operation of a mechanism that ordinarily would improve the accuracy and efficiency of perception...|$|R

It was originally manned by three keepers.In 1901 the keeper's quarters went through major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of the}} steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light to a quick group flashing dioptric light. Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000 cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers. In 1932 the original gallery handrails, also supplied by H Wilkins & Co., were replaced with steel gas pipe and mild steel rods.|$|R

This thesis is based on the hypothesis that the Phase-Shifted Full Bridge (PSFB) topology can efectively utilise the parasitic components of the rotating transformer to achieve efficient (over 90 %) power conversion at the kW range. The first part of this work concentrates on the study of the magnetic interface and its electrical properties. Initially the magnetic structure of the transformer is studied in order to gain understanding {{of the effects of the}} physical layout of the component to its electrical behaviour. The problems of low magnetising and increased leakage inductance are quantified by measurements, calculations and finite element analysis. An accurate electrical model is built and used to calculate the transformer voltage and current gain. The second part of the research programme aims at the compilation of a design strategy for a PSFB incorporating a rotating transformer. An algorithm is presented, that optimises the magnetic component structure in order to achieve minimum switching losses and spread the conduction losses between the transformer and power switches. The last stage involves the evaluation of the design algorithm through prototyping and testing. Some topological variations are tested and compared with the original conventional PSFB converter.

40|$|Control {{can improve}} the {{performance}} of wind turbines by enhancing the energy capture and reducing dynamic, as well as static, loads. There are several possible configurations of the control system, depending on the available actuators. The control and optimal performance of two specific classes of plants are investigated in this thesis: fixed-pitch variable-speed plants and wind mills with two blades and active yaw regulation. The plant and its environment are structured as a system of interacting subsystems. The arrangement and contents of the subsystems are adapted to the specific problems. The subsystem models are gathered from the literature, derived from basic physical relationships or identified from experimental data. A specific problem arising when using a basic model-structure is that of finding a single scalar representation of the wind field over the rotor disc. It is suggested that the experienced wind speed should {{be defined as a}} weighted sum of the wind speeds in several points that are fixed in a <b>revolving</b> <b>frame</b> of reference. Models of the drive system and its two subsystems, the electrical and the mechanical parts, are identified from plant measurements. Physical parameters of a fundamental drive-train model are also identified. The estimated values are confirmed by plant data, although the uncertainties of the estimates are relatively large. The control of variable-speed plants is divided into three regions of operation: optimal, intermediate and stall region. In each of the regions, the optimal performance is determined in terms of some fundamental system parameters. These parameters characterize the turbulence, the plant and the criterion of optimality. Furthermore, a gain scheduled LQG controller is developed and compared with alternative schemes. Nonlinear simulations show that the differences in performance between the designs are comparatively small. The potential of continuous yaw-control is investigated. The idea is to actively attenuate structural-dynamic load-oscillations by means of the yaw servo. In three design examples various structural modes are studied. The tower lateral bending mode shows the best potential for active load reduction. The results also indicate the importance of considering the periodic dependence on time of the system in the controller design...|$|E

This paper analyses triangle-comparison based PWM techniques (TCPWM) such as sine-triangle PWM (SPWM) and common-mode voltage injection PWM during overmodulation from a space vector point of view. The average voltage vector produced by TCPWM during overmodulation is studied in the stationary (a-b) reference frame. This is compared and contrasted with the average voltage vector corresponding to the well-known standard two-zone algorithm for space vector modulated inverters. It is shown that the two-zone overmodulation algorithm itself {{can be derived from}} the variation of average voltage vector with TCPWM. The average voltage vector is further studied in a synchronously <b>revolving</b> (d-q) reference <b>frame.</b> The RMS value of low-order voltage ripple can be estimated, and can be used to compare harmonic distortion due to different PWM methods during overmodulation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the influence of inverter dead-time on steady as well as dynamic operation of an open-loop induction motor drive fed from a voltage source inverter (VSI). Towards this goal, this paper presents a systematic derivation of a dynamic model for an inverter-fed induction motor, incorporating the effect of inverter dead-time, in the synchronously <b>revolving</b> dq reference <b>frame.</b> Simulation results based on this dynamic model bring out the impact of inverter dead-time on both the transient response and steady-state operation of the motor drive. For the purpose of steady-state analysis, the dynamic model of the motor drive is used to derive a steady-state model, which is found to be non-linear. The steady-state model shows that the impact of dead-time can be seen as an additional resistance in the stator circuit, whose value depends on the stator current. Towards precise evaluation of this dead-time equivalent resistance, an analytical expression is proposed for the same in terms of inverter dead-time, switching frequency, modulation index and load impedance. The notion of dead-time equivalent resistance is shown to simplify the solution of the non-linear steady-state model. The analytically evaluated steady-state solutions are validated through numerical simulations and experiments...|$|R

As for the weaving skill, it is divided into plain weave, {{vertical}} weave, slant weaves, and <b>revolving</b> weaves. The <b>frame</b> starting is divided into two types: inner starting and outer starting. There are both regulatory pattern design and casual design varying from the artist’s personal preference. The pack basket ones must be mentioned here, because they are so uniquely characteristic in shape design. The artist tends to base on the common pack basket and start weaving from the outer side. Therefore, the whole basket is sturdy in structure and rich in poetic meaning out of its special shape; the artists also make some innovation on the decorative patterns of the jar-like basket with two ear-like handles: they {{make the most of the}} materials and decorate the basket with slim bamboo branches, which make the basket more elegant and classic. Then the most delicate must be the two bamboo gadgets, one being the earthworm cage and the other being grasshopper cage. In the past, we used to see the fishermen were caught to be fishing in the drawings from Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty in China. In the pictures, one would usually find a little bamboo cage around the fisherman’s waist. Though frequently thought to be the fish cage, it is actually carried to put the earthworms in; the earthworm cage has contracture strips and is equipped with wood plug; as a result, when the earthworm moves inside the cage, it cannot escape through the little holes though it can breathe freely. As for the grasshopper cage, it is designed to be gourd-shaped, which can be placed upon the breaking branches of ancient trees. It is suitable for the grasshoppers in summer and crickets in autumn.|$|R
40|$|The {{inverter}} dead-time {{is integral}} {{to the safety of}} a voltage source inverter (VSI). Dead-time is introduced between the complementary gating signals of the top and bottom switches in each VSI leg to prevent shoot-through fault. This thesis reports and investigates dead-time induced sub-harmonic oscillations in open-loop induction motor drives of different power levels, under light-load conditions. The thesis develops mathematical models that help understand and predict the oscillatory behaviour of such motor drives due to dead-time act. Models are also developed to study the impact of under-compensation and over-compensation of dead-time act on stability. The various models are validated through extensive simulations and experimental results. The thesis also proposes and validates active damping schemes for mitigation of such sub-harmonic oscillations. The thesis reports high-amplitude sub-harmonic oscillations in the stator current, torque and speed of a 100 -kW open-loop induction motor drive in the laboratory, operating under no-load. Experimental studies, carried out on 22 -kW, 11 -kW, 7. 5 -kW and 3. 7 -kW open-loop induction motor drives, establish the prevalence of dead-time induced sub-harmonic oscillations in open-loop motor drives of different power levels. An experimental procedure is established for systematic study of this phenomenon in industrial drives. This procedure yields the operating region, if any, where the motor drive is oscillatory. As a first step towards understanding the oscillatory behaviour of the motor drive, a mathematical model of the VSI is derived in a synchronously <b>revolving</b> reference <b>frame</b> (SRF), incorporating the of dead-time on the inverter output voltage. This leads to a modified dynamic model of the inverter-fed induction motor in the SRF, inclusive of the dead-time act. While the rotor dynamic equations are already non-linear, dead-time is found to introduce nonlinearities in the stator dynamic equations as well. The nonlinearities in the modified dynamic model make even the steady solution non-trivial. Under steady conditions, the dead-time can be modelled as the drop across an equivalent resistance (Req 0) in the stator circuit. A precise method to evaluate the equivalent resistance Req 0 and a simple method to arrive at the steady solution are proposed and validated. For the purpose of stability analysis, a small-signal model of the drive is then derived by linearizing the non-linear dynamic equations of the motor drive, about a steady-state operating point. The proposed small-signal model shows that dead-time contributes to different values of equivalent resistances along the q-axis and d-axis and also to equivalent cross-coupling reactance’s that appear in series with the stator windings. Stability analysis performed using the proposed model brings out the region of oscillatory behaviour (or region of small-signal instability) of the 100 -kW motor drive on the voltage versus frequency (V- f) plane, considering no-load. The oscillatory region predicted by the small-signal analysis is in good agreement with simulations and practical observations for the 100 -kW motor drive. The small-signal analysis is also able to predict the region of oscillatory behaviour of an 11 -kW motor drive, which is con consumed by simulations and experiments. The analysis also predicts the frequencies of sub-harmonic oscillations at different operating points quite well for both the drives. Having the validity of the small-signal analysis at different power levels, this analytical procedure is used to predict the regions of oscillatory behaviour of 2 -pole, 4 -pole, 6 -pole and 8 -pole induction motors rated 55 kW and 110 kW. The impact of dead-time on inverter output voltage has been studied widely in literature. This thesis studies the influence of dead-time on the inverter input current as well. Based on this study, the dynamic model of the inverter fed induction motor is extended to include the dc-link dynamics as well. Simulation results based on this extended model tally well with the experimentally measured dc-link voltage and stator current waveforms in the 100 -kW drive. Dead-time compensation may be employed to mitigate the dead-time and oscillatory behaviour of the drive. However, accurate dead-time compensation is challenging to achieve due to various factors such as delays in gate drivers, device switching characteristics, etc. Effects of under-compensation and over-compensation of dead time are investigated in this thesis. Under-compensation is shown to result {{in the same kind of}} oscillatory behaviour as observed with dead-time, but the fundamental frequency range over which such oscillations occur is reduced. On the other hand, over-compensation of dead-time effect is shown to result in a different kind of oscillatory behaviour. These two types of oscillatory behaviour due to under- and over-compensation, respectively, are distinguished and demonstrated by analyses, simulations and experiments on the 100 -kW drive. To mitigate the oscillatory behaviour of the drive, an active damping scheme is proposed. This scheme emulates the effect of an external inductor in series with the stator winding. A small-signal model is proposed for an induction motor drive with the proposed active damping scheme. Simulations and experiments on the 100 -kW drive demonstrate effective mitigation of light-load instability with this active damping scheme. In the above inductance emulation scheme, the emulated inductance is seen by the sub-harmonic components, fundamental component as well as low-order harmonic components of the motor current. Since the emulated inductance is also seen by the fundamental component, there is a fundamental voltage drop across the emulated inductance, leading to reduced co-operation of the induction motor. Hence, an improved active damping scheme is proposed wherein the emulated inductance is seen only by the sub-harmonic and low-order harmonic components. This is achieved through appropriate altering in the synchronously revolving domain. The proposed improved active damping scheme is shown to mitigate the sub-harmonic oscillation effectively without any reduction in flux...|$|R
