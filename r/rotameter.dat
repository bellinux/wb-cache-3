Flow measurement laboratory experiments were conducted using various instruments. These consisted of orifice plates, various sized <b>rotameters,</b> wet gas meter and soap bubble meter.

40|$|The use of {{multiphase}} flow meters (MPFMs) increase each year. The {{main reasons for}} this are the cost benefits connected {{to the use of}} such a meter by eliminating exclusive lines to the test separator and the test separator itself and the demand for a meter that can measure the produced fluids in real time without separating the phases. The MPFMs measures the flow rate by use of different measurement principles and techniques, and in combination of these, e. g. by means of Venturi and void fraction sensor. The scope of this thesis is to measure the flow rate of a two-phase flow by means of a flow meter device and a void fraction sensor and to check the applicability of several known calculation methods to the measurements. In order determine the flow rate of such a flow; a flow loop, flow meter, and a void fraction sensor are required to be designed and fabricated. The Venturi tube is a common flow meter and can offer high accuracy, high pressure recovery, a short straight pipe run is required upstream and has no moveable parts. No moveable parts are preferred throughout the industry, owing to expensive maintenance runs of any moveable part. The flow rate can be determined from the pressure drop over the Venturi from well known relationships. An impedance probe is used to determine the void fraction of the flow. This sensor is made from two full-ring electrodes flush mounted to the inner pipe wall making the impedance probe non-intrusive. To determine the mean void fraction from the impedance measurements the liquid holdup equation proposed by Andreussi et al. (1988) is used. Two <b>rotameters</b> are used as reference measurements in the flow loop, one for water and one for air. An electrical water pump and an air compressor are used in order to obtain a wide range of flow rates. The flow rates used in this study are ranging from 1. 185 up to 1. 975 m 3 /h for water and 0. 347 up to 2. 1 m 3 /h for air. Flow characteristics that are encountered are defined as bubbly and transition to slug flow, and the mean void fraction ranged from 18 % up to 44 % and the mass quality obtained ranged up to 0. 12 %. The uncertainty of the Venturi and impedance probe is obtained by the use of 90 % confidence interval, which is a common method used to present the uncertainty of a MPFM, Johnsen (2010). From the measurements the Chisholm correlation proved to achieve the best performance in predicting the flow rate of the two-phase flow and the homogenous model gives reasonable predictions of the flow. The uncertainty of the meters ability to measure the flow rate by the use of Chisholm correlation is ± 3. 5 %, ± 10. 23 %, and ± 4. 19 % for water, air, and total flow rate, respectively. The study shows that the measurement of a low quality (χ < 0. 12 %) two-phase flow is possible by the means of simple Venturi and impedance probe, when the mean void fraction ranged from 18 % up to 44 % and the flow is within the bubbly and transition to slug flow. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{variable}} area (VA) meter, also {{commonly called}} a <b>rotameter,</b> {{consists of a}} tapered tube, typically made of glass, with a float inside that is pushed up by fluid flow and pulled down by gravity.

Floats are made in many different shapes, with spheres and spherical ellipses being the most common. Some are designed to spin visibly in the fluid stream to aid the user in determining whether the float is stuck or not.

40|$|<b>Rotameter</b> is a {{variable}} area type of flow meter {{used to measure}} the flow rate of liquids and gases. In the present study design and analysis of <b>Rotameter</b> performance is done using ANSYS FLUENT 14 software. Validation of CFD methodology is done by using flow through pipe in a turbulent flow.

Le modèle proposé est aussi comparé avec succès à des résultats expérimentaux de la littérature à faible et moyenne concentrations pour des temps de contact beaucoup plus grands. Son domaine d’application couvre donc désormais l’absorption et la désorption du SO 2 pour des concentrations comprises entre quelques ppm et quelque %. Mass transfer in dispersed media {{is of interest}} to fields such as nuclear engineering, process engineering and environmental engineering. It occurs when two phases, not under chemical equilibrium, are in contact. Knowledge of mass transfer mechanisms {{in the case of}} gas absorption from and/or into droplets is necessary to understand the scavenging of trace gases in clouds, rain and wet scrubbers. Our studies focus on absorption and desorption phenomena involving free falling water droplets in a mixture of air and gas. For example, acid rain is formed when a drop of rain falls through an atmosphere contaminated with gaseous acid precursors. A similar phenomenon occurs in specific atmospheric scrubbers, where pollution is trapped at the source. In all cases, the transfer of trace gases from the air into the falling droplets is controlled by molecular diffusion and by convection outside and inside the drops. For droplets, falling inside a soluble gas medium, the main transfer resistance is located in the gas phase. A survey of published studies shows that a number of good numerical models exist, as well as experimental correlations for predictions of the mass transfer coefficient in the gas film. For the liquid phase controlled resistance, Saboni (1991) proposed a model based on local scales, interfacial liquid friction velocity and drop diameter. The model was validated experimentally by Amokrane et al. (1994). The experimental study and model validation in the case of sulfur dioxide absorption by water droplets falling through air with a high gas concentration (few %) has been described previously in detail by Amokrane et al. (1994). The purpose of the present article was to extend our previous model to predict SO 2 absorption and desorption by droplets (1 - 5 mm) falling in air with a low gas concentration. In the liquid phase, a model based on local scales, interfacial liquid friction velocity and droplet size diameter was used. In the continuous gas phase a more classical model was applied. To support the model, two types of experiments were carried out. The first type was adapted to measure the absorption of gas by droplets of known diameter. A second set of experiments gave the desorption rate from droplets with an initial concentration of sulfur dioxide falling through SO 2 -free air. Absorption occurred during the fall through a 2. 3 m long column for various gas concentrations and for various droplet diameters. A sketch of the experimental equipment is presented schematically in Figure 1. It consists of a cylindrical column 2. 3 m in height and 0. 104 m in diameter. Before each experiment, a gas mixture with the desired SO 2 concentration in air, ranging between 100 and 2000 ppm, was introduced into the column. The SO 2 concentration was set at the desired value by regulating the volumetric flow rates of sulfur dioxide and air with calibrated <b>rotameters.</b> The gas concentration in the column was measured continuously by a chemical cell analyzer. The air temperature and humidity were continually measured at the top, in the middle and {{at the bottom of the}} column. They ranged from 18 °C to 20 °C and from 40 % to 50 %, respectively. Droplets were generated using a specific injector consisting of a demineralized water tank at the base of which identical thin needles were placed. In the case of the smallest droplets, seven needles, 300 µm in diameter, were used. For the largest droplets, one needle of about 1 mm was used. The artificial rain was started by exerting an overpressure in the tank and it was stopped by exerting a depression. This device allowed the generation of almost identical water drops at a controlled rate. Droplets fell with zero initial velocity. Their diameters were determined by collecting a known number of droplets and weighing them on a precision balance. The droplets were collected in a special glass cup placed at the bottom of the rain shaft. This collector initially contained a known volume of kerosene. The presence of this organic compound allowed the creation of a film to prevent additional absorption of SO 2 during the experiment and natural desorption of sulfur after the experiment. An experiment consisted of dropping 10 to 20 mL of rain. This amount is enough to precisely measure the sulfur concentration. For reversible desorption, experimentation was undertaken directly in a lab atmosphere. For these experiments, the 4. 31 mm diameter droplets free fall occurred over 16. 3 m. Three intermediate levels were also examined with falling times varying from 0. 7 to 2. 4 s. The ambient temperature was measured in the surrounding area of both the injector and the collector and the maximum variation was 2 °C. Various initial sulfurous acid concentrations were obtained as a result of various contact times of demineralized water with air-SO 2 mixtures. Initial concentrations ranged from 0. 5 10 - 3 mol·L- 1 to 1. 8 10 - 3 mol·L- 1. In this case, the collector initially contained a known volume of hydrogen peroxide to immediately convert sulfurous acid into sulfuric acid. This avoided additional desorption of sulfurous acid during and after the experiments. In this case, the presence of the organic film was not necessary. The results achieved with the theoretical model were compared to the experimental results. The present model was successful in correlating the experimental results carried out for various droplet diameters ranging between 2. 04 and 4. 31 mm, and gas concentrations ranging between 100 and 2000 ppm. The model also compared successfully with experimental results from the literature in the case of much longer contact times. The applicability of the model thus covers the absorption and desorption of SO 2 for concentrations ranging between ppm to a few %...|$|R
