5|$|The {{production}} of the metals itself is difficult due to their reactivity. The formation of oxides, nitrides and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally achieved by the Kroll process. The oxides (MO2) are <b>reacted</b> with coal and chlorine to form the chlorides (MCl4). The chlorides of the metals are then <b>reacted</b> with magnesium, yielding magnesium chloride and the metals.|$|E

5|$|Potassium <b>reacts</b> violently with halogens and detonates in the {{presence}} of bromine. It also <b>reacts</b> explosively with sulfuric acid.

Both peroxides and superoxides may <b>react</b> explosively with metallic potassium.|$|R
5|$|Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are {{the easiest}} to isolate. Thorium is {{extracted}} mostly from monazite: thorium pyrophosphate (ThP2O7) is <b>reacted</b> with nitric acid, and the produced thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate. Rare-earth impurities are separated by increasing the pH in sulfate solution.|$|E

50|$|To {{ensure that}} the skin is <b>reacting</b> {{in the way it}} is {{supposed}} to, all skin allergy tests are also performed with proven allergens like histamine or glycerin. The majority of people do <b>react</b> to histamine and do not <b>react</b> to glycerin. If the skin does not <b>react</b> appropriately to these allergens then it most likely will not <b>react</b> to the other allergens. These results are interpreted as falsely negative.|$|R
50|$|<b>React</b> {{was created}} by Jordan Walke, a {{software}} engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by Angular (application platform) and XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013. <b>React</b> Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with <b>React,</b> was announced at Facebook's React.js Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015.On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced <b>React</b> Fiber, a new core algorithm of <b>React</b> framework library for building user interfaces. <b>React</b> Fiber will become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of the <b>React</b> framework.|$|R

5|$|In 2011, an Australian ant allergy venom {{study was}} conducted, {{with the goal}} of {{determining}} which native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis. It showed that the jack jumper ant was responsible for the majority of patients' reactions to Myrmecia ant stings. Of the 265 patients who <b>reacted</b> to a sting from an ant belonging to the Myrmecia genus, 176 were from the jack jumper. 15 from M. nigrocincta and three from M. ludlowi, while 56 patients had <b>reacted</b> to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four native species of Australian ants caused anaphylaxis. Apart from Myrmecia species, the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) was also responsible for several systemic reactions.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Arsenal invited Galatasaray {{to compete}} at their annual Emirates Cup tournament.
