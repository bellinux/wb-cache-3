500|$|The film {{features}} {{a number of}} scenes which involve Detectives Frazier and Mitchell (Chiwitel Ejiofor) interrogating several hostages during {{the aftermath of the}} heist. Libatique described these scenes as a [...] "flash-forward" [...] to events, explaining that Lee [...] "wanted a look that would jump out and tell you you’re somewhere else." [...] Libatique photographed the scenes with Kodak Ektachrome 100D 5285 <b>reversal</b> <b>film.</b> Technicolor then cross-processed the filmed footage before it was put through a bleach bypass, which neutralized color temperature and created more contrast. Libatique explained, [...] "Basically, it unifies all the color...When you try to apply correction, the film moves in very strange ways." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 12, Hooper read a book {{entitled}} How to Make Film and Television and {{decided he wanted to}} become a director. For the next year Hooper researched filmmaking from publications such as On Camera by Harris Watts. Aged 13, he made his first film, entitled Runaway Dog, using a clockwork 16mm Bolex camera his uncle had given to him. Hooper said: [...] "The clockwork would run out after thirty seconds, so the maximum shot length was thirty seconds. I could only afford a hundred feet of Kodachrome <b>reversal</b> <b>film,</b> which cost about twenty-five , and you had to send off for two weeks to be processed. I could only make silent movies, because sound was too expensive and complicated." [...] He slowed down the frame rate of the camera so he could maximise what little film stock he had. Hooper classified the short, about a dog which kept running away from its owner, as a comedy, and filmed it on location in Oxfordshire.|$|E
2500|$|Flashback {{sequences}} {{became an}} important element in two episodes this season, [...] "Lineage" [...] and [...] "Suspect". Greg Beeman, who directed [...] "Lineage", worked off the same inspiration as Ken Biller, who used John Sayles’ Lone Star when writing the flashback sequences for the episode. Beeman tried to visually shift from the present to past without any effects shots; this included changing night to day in the same shot, and removing/inserting actors from shots when they were out of the view of the camera. In his directorial debut, Ken Biller was met with the challenge of creating flashbacks for all the scenes that retold the event of the attack on Lionel. Biller had already seen Beeman’s take on flashback scenes from his work on [...] "Lineage", but Biller wanted to do something different. Alongside director of photography Glen Winter, Biller opted to shoot all the flashback sequences on 16mm color <b>reversal</b> <b>film,</b> which would give the flashbacks a [...] "grainy, dirty look" [...] that Biller thought gave an interesting quality to the flashback scenes.|$|E

50|$|Early color {{negative}} film had many shortcomings, including {{the high cost of}} the film, processing and printing, the mediocre color quality, rapid fading and discoloration of highlights of some types of print that became noticeable after several years. Amateurs who owned projection equipment used <b>reversal</b> <b>films</b> extensively because the cost of projection equipment and slide film was offset by not having to pay for prints. Eventually, print quality improved and prices decreased, and, by the 1970s, color {{negative film}} and color prints had largely displaced slides as the primary method of amateur photography.|$|R

5000|$|In photography, <b>reversal</b> <b>film</b> {{is a type}} of {{photographic}} film that produces a positive image on a transparent base. The film is processed to produce transparencies or diapositives (abbreviated as [...] "diafilm" [...] in many countries) instead of negatives and prints. <b>Reversal</b> <b>film</b> is produced in various sizes, from 35 mm roll film to 8×10 inch sheet film.|$|E

50|$|Many {{photographic}} processes create negative images: {{the chemicals}} involved react {{when exposed to}} light, so that during development they produce deposits of microscopic dark silver particles or colored dyes {{in proportion to the}} amount of exposure. However, when a negative image is created from a negative image (just like multiplying two negative numbers in mathematics) a positive image results. This makes most chemical-based photography a two-step process, which uses negative film and ordinary processing. Special films and development processes have been devised so that positive images can be created directly on the film; these are called positive, or slide, or (perhaps confusingly) <b>reversal</b> <b>films</b> and <b>reversal</b> processing.|$|R

40|$|Systematic {{studies of}} cadmium {{selenide}} thin films were prepared by without and with pulse reversal plating technique.

The thin film of CdSe was deposited on cleaned conducting substrates like titanium, SnO 2, nickel and stainless steel, respectively.

If mounted in small metal, plastic or cardboard frames for use in a slide projector or slide viewer they are commonly called slides. <b>Reversal</b> <b>film</b> is often marketed as [...] "slide film". Large-format color reversal sheet film is used by some professional photographers, typically to originate very-high-resolution imagery for digital scanning into color separations for mass photomechanical reproduction. Photographic prints can be produced from <b>reversal</b> <b>film</b> transparencies, but positive-to-positive print materials for doing this directly (e.g. Ektachrome paper, Cibachrome/Ilfochrome) have all been discontinued, so that it now requires the use of an internegative to convert the positive transparency image into a negative transparency, which is then printed as a positive print.|$|E
