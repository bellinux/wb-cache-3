5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} including pigeonhole sort, counting sort, and <b>radix</b> sort {{are widely}} used and practical. Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. Many such algorithms are known, with performance depending {{on a combination of}} the number of items to be sorted, number of bits per key, and number of bits per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm.|$|E
5|$|Pigeonhole sort, {{counting}} sort, <b>radix</b> sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting {{all work}} best when the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word size is very large {{relative to the}} number of items (or equivalently when the number of items is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E
25|$|This {{algorithm}} {{is a form}} of <b>radix</b> sort.|$|E
25|$|The {{locations}} or provinces {{in which}} herbs are grown often figure into herb names. For example, Bei Sha Shen (<b>Radix</b> glehniae) is grown and harvested in northern China, whereas Nan Sha Shen (<b>Radix</b> adenophorae) originated in southern China. And the Chinese words for {{north and south}} are respectively bei and nan.|$|E
25|$|Binary may be {{converted}} to and from hexadecimal somewhat more easily. This is because the <b>radix</b> of the hexadecimal system (16) is a power of the <b>radix</b> of the binary system (2). More specifically, 16 = 24, so it takes four digits of binary to represent one digit of hexadecimal, {{as shown in the}} adjacent table.|$|E
25|$|A {{symbol for}} square roots, written as an {{elaborate}} R, {{was invented by}} Regiomontanus (1436–1476). An R was also used for <b>Radix</b> to indicate square roots in Gerolamo Cardano's Ars Magna.|$|E
25|$|Two {{original}} video animation series {{were created}} based around the Paris Assault Group. The first three-episode series, Sakura Wars: École de Paris, was released between March and August 2003. Produced by <b>Radix</b> Ace Entertainment and Overworks, with script by Kawasaki and music by Tanaka, the stories {{focused on the}} Paris Assault Force {{before and during the}} early events of Sakura Wars 3. The second three-episode series, Sakura Wars: Le Nouveau Paris, was released between October 2004 and March 2005. Again produced by <b>Radix</b> Ace Entertainment, the story focused on the Paris Assault Force's exploits following the end of Sakura Wars 3.|$|E
25|$|In {{the base}} 10 numeral system, in almost {{universal}} use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The <b>radix</b> or base {{is the number}} of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the <b>radix</b> is 10). In this base10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a place value of1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.|$|E
25|$|Any number can be {{represented}} as an integer component followed by a <b>radix</b> point (the generalization of a decimal point to non-decimal systems) followed by a finite or infinite number of digits.|$|E
25|$|Two's {{complement}} is {{a mathematical}} operation on binary numbers, {{as well as}} a binary signed number representation based on this operation. Its wide use in computing makes it the most important example of a <b>radix</b> complement.|$|E
25|$|For more {{restricted}} data, such as {{numbers in}} a fixed interval, distribution sorts such as counting sort or <b>radix</b> sort are widely used. Bubble sort and variants are rarely used in practice, but are {{commonly found in}} teaching and theoretical discussions.|$|E
25|$|The sort {{operation}} transforms an {{unordered set}} of elements into an ordered set of elements. The most common implementation on GPUs is using <b>radix</b> sort for integer and floating point data and coarse-grained merge sort and fine-grained sorting networks for general comparable data.|$|E
25|$|The base-2 {{numeral system}} is a {{positional}} notation with a <b>radix</b> of 2. Each digit {{is referred to as}} a bit. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices.|$|E
25|$|Compound unit {{arithmetic}} is {{the application}} of arithmetic operations to mixed <b>radix</b> quantities such as feet and inches, gallons and pints, pounds shillings and pence, and so on. Prior {{to the use of}} decimal-based systems of money and units of measure, the use of compound unit arithmetic formed a significant part of commerce and industry.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematics}} and computing, hexadecimal (also base , or hex) is a positional numeral {{system with a}} <b>radix,</b> or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen.|$|E
25|$|To derive {{the value}} of the floating-point number, the significand is multiplied by the base raised {{to the power of the}} exponent, {{equivalent}} to shifting the <b>radix</b> point from its implied position by a number of places equal to {{the value of}} the exponent—to the right if the exponent is positive or to the left if the exponent is negative.|$|E
25|$|Within each suit, {{the stable}} sort {{preserves}} the ordering by rank {{that was already}} done. This idea can be extended to any number of keys, and is leveraged by <b>radix</b> sort. The same effect can be achieved with an unstable sort by using a lexicographic key comparison, which, e.g., compares first by suit, and then compares by rank if the suits are the same.|$|E
25|$|A {{rational}} number has an infinitely repeating sequence of finite length {{less than the}} value of the fully reduced fraction's denominator if the reduced fraction's denominator contains a prime factor that is not a factor of the base. The repeating sequence is preceded after the <b>radix</b> point by a transient of finite length if the reduced fraction also shares a prime factor with the base.|$|E
25|$|For centuries, {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas such as the Aymaras of the Altiplano, have chewed coca leaves to try to alleviate the symptoms of mild altitude sickness. In Chinese and Tibetan traditional medicine, an extract of the root tissue of <b>Radix</b> rhodiola is often taken {{in order to prevent}} the same symptoms, though neither of these therapies has been proven effective in clinical study.|$|E
25|$|In {{honor of}} Tomizawa's {{retirement}} from {{the role of}} Sumire following Sakura Wars 4, an original video animation titled Sakura Wars; Sumire Kanzaki Retirement Memorial—Su・Me・Re was developed by <b>Radix</b> Ace Entertainment and Overworks; Tanaka created the music, while Kawasaki wrote the script. Depicting Sumire's retirement from the Imperial Assault Troop and featuring Tomizawa's last performance in the role, the animation was released for VHS and DVD on December 18, 2002.|$|E
25|$|In a {{positional}} base b {{numeral system}} (with b a natural number greater than 1 {{known as the}} <b>radix),</b> b basic symbols (or digits) corresponding to the first b natural numbers including zero are used. To generate {{the rest of the}} numerals, the position of the symbol in the figure is used. The symbol in the last position has its own value, and as it moves to the left its value is multiplied by b.|$|E
25|$|As {{another example}} of a divide and conquer {{algorithm}} that did not originally involve computers, Donald Knuth gives the method a post office typically uses to route mail: letters are sorted into separate bags for different geographical areas, each of these bags is itself sorted into batches for smaller sub-regions, and so on until they are delivered. This is related to a <b>radix</b> sort, described for punch-card sorting machines as early as 1929.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{conversion}} factor 1.609344 for miles to kilometers {{is close to}} the golden ratio (denoted φ), the decomposition of distance in miles into a sum of Fibonacci numbers becomes nearly the kilometer sum when the Fibonacci numbers are replaced by their successors. This method amounts to a <b>radix</b> 2 number register in golden ratio base φ being shifted. To convert from kilometers to miles, shift the register down the Fibonacci sequence instead.|$|E
25|$|A {{rational}} number has a terminating sequence after the <b>radix</b> point {{if all the}} prime factors of the denominator of the fully reduced fractional form are also factors of the base. This terminating representation is equivalent to a representation with a repeating sequence that can be constructed from the terminating form by decreasing the last digit by 1 and appending an infinite sequence of a digit representing a number that is one less than the base.|$|E
25|$|Binary is also easily {{converted}} to the octal numeral system, since octal uses a <b>radix</b> of 8, {{which is a}} power of two (namely, 23, so it takes exactly three binary digits to represent an octal digit). The correspondence between octal and binary numerals {{is the same as}} for the first eight digits of hexadecimal in the table above. Binary 000 is equivalent to the octal digit 0, binary 111 is equivalent to octal 7, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Sexagesimal numerals were a mixed <b>radix</b> {{system that}} {{retained}} the alternating base10 and base6 {{in a sequence}} of cuneiform vertical wedges and chevrons. By 1950BC, this was a positional notation system. Sexagesimal numerals came to be widely used in commerce, but were also used in astronomical and other calculations. This system was exported from Babylonia and used throughout Mesopotamia, and by every Mediterranean nation that used standard Babylonian units of measure and counting, including the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians. Babylonian-style sexagesimal numeration is still used in modern societies to measure time (minutes per hour) and angles (degrees).|$|E
25|$|RadiSys {{was founded}} in 1987 as <b>Radix</b> Microsystems in Beaverton, Oregon, by former Intel {{engineers}} Dave Budde and Glen Myers. The first investors were employees who put up $50,000 each, with Tektronix later investing additional funds into the company. Originally located in space leased from Sequent Computer Systems, by 1994 the company had grown to annual sales of $20 million. The company's products were computers used in end products such as automated teller machines to paint mixers. On October 20, 1995, the company became a publicly traded company when it held {{an initial public offering}} (IPO). The IPO raised $19.6 million for RadiSys after selling 2.7 million shares at $12 per share.|$|E
25|$|With its {{combination}} of grassland, riparian habitat, coulees and badlands, the Milk River Natural Area and Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve host {{a variety of}} amphibians and reptiles, including rare northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), listed as threatened in Alberta and both a Canadian species at risk (SARA) and Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) species of special concern, as well as prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis), bullsnake (Pituophis catenifer sayi), western hognose snake (Heterodon nasicus), western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta), garter snake (Thamnophis <b>radix),</b> and the nationally and provincially endangered short-horned lizard (Phrynosoma douglassi), {{which is at the}} northern limit of its geographical range here. The northern leopard frog and prairie rattlesnake in particular are indicator species of the ecological health of the Milk River watershed.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} science, a trie, {{also called}} digital tree and sometimes <b>radix</b> tree or prefix tree (as {{they can be}} searched by prefixes), {{is a kind of}} search tree—an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string. Values are not necessarily associated with every node. Rather, values tend only to be associated with leaves, and with some inner nodes that correspond to keys of interest. For the space-optimized presentation of prefix tree, see compact prefix tree.|$|E
25|$|They invented and {{developed}} arithmetic by using several different number systems including a mixed <b>radix</b> system with an alternating base 10 and base 6. This sexagesimal system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia. They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between infantry, cavalry, and archers. They developed {{the first known}} codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. The first true city-states arose in Sumer, roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now Syria and Lebanon. Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records, and other pursuits. Conjointly with the spread of writing, the first formal schools were established, usually {{under the auspices of}} a city-state's primary temple.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{represent}} permutations of n is by an integer N with 0nbsp&≤nbsp&Nnbsp&<nbsp&n!, provided convenient methods {{are given to}} convert between the number and the representation of a permutation as an ordered arrangement (sequence). This gives the most compact representation of arbitrary permutations, and in computing is particularly attractive when n is small enough that N can be held in a machine word; for 32-bit words this means nnbsp&≤nbsp&12, and for 64-bit words this means nnbsp&≤nbsp&20. The conversion can be done via the intermediate form of a sequence of numbers d'n, d'n−1, …, d2, d1, where d'i is a non-negative integer less than i (one may omit d1, as it is always 0, but its presence makes the subsequent conversion to a permutation easier to describe). The first step then is to simply express N in the factorial number system, {{which is just a}} particular mixed <b>radix</b> representation, where for numbers up to n! the bases for successive digits are n, , …, 2, 1. The second step interprets this sequence as a Lehmer code or (almost equivalently) as an inversion table.|$|E
25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (<b>radix),</b> it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E
25|$|Maya {{scholarship}} {{long has}} considered the ancient Maya in a temporal and geographic sense {{to have come}} into being, thermometer-fashion – as things began to “warm up,” socially and culturally – at the “bottom,” that is, in Southern Mesoamerica, in the Early Preclassic period: events and processes coalesced on the Pacific coast {{of what is now}} Guatemala and southern Mexico and in the piedmont and highlands of Guatemala and in northern El Salvador, moved north in Classic period times to the Maya Lowlands of northern Guatemala and southern Chiapas, Mexico; and migrated still further north into Yucatán following the Maya “collapse” in the 10th century AD. Mayanists from the New World Archaeological Foundation as well as other institutions have pioneered the efforts to discover the <b>radix</b> of Maya civilization from work at such sites as Chiapa de Corzo and Izapa building on efforts by Michael Coe at La Victoria, on the southern Pacific coast of Mexico, and followed up by the work of scholars such as John E. Clark, Barbara Voorhies, Barbara Stark, Robert Sharer and others. Notable, as well, is the work of Franz Termer at Palo Gordo. Work by Carnegie archaeologists A. V. Kidder and Edwin M. Shook at Kaminaljuyu has been fundamental in moving attention to the origins of Maya civilization to the South. Since their work, many other sites have been identified and at which investigations have either been carried out or are contemplated in determining the role of the Southern area in the trajectory of Maya civilization.|$|E
500|$|This {{is known}} as carrying. When {{the result of an}} {{addition}} exceeds the value of a digit, the procedure is to [...] "carry" [...] the excess amount divided by the <b>radix</b> (that is, 10/10) to the left, adding it to the next positional value. This is correct since the next position has a weight that is higher by a factor equal to the <b>radix.</b> Carrying works the same way in binary: ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Radix</b> sort is a sorting {{algorithm}} {{that works}} for larger keys than pigeonhole sort or counting sort by performing multiple passes over the data.
