5000|$|The {{cause of}} {{cracking}} {{did not become}} clear until metallographic results were combined with stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement tests, followed by fracture mechanics analysis. It appeared that an already existing crack had extended through more than 90% of the wall thickness and was about 800 mm in length. Further, {{it was determined that}} hydrogen embrittlement had reduced the fracture resistance of the steel by more than half. The vessel had been put into service in 1970 and had undergone several repairs and modifications before the July 1984 incident. The vessel was fractured along a path that was weakened by extensive cracking adjacent to a repair weld joining a replacement section to the original vessel. These pre-existing cracks initiated in areas of hard microstructure known to be susceptible to hydrogen stress cracking. This hard microstructure formed during the <b>repair</b> <b>welding</b> of the replacement section. The cracks grew through the vessel wall as a result of hydrogen pressure cracking.|$|E
50|$|The DR too had {{difficulties}} with boilers made of St 47 K steel. The reduction of boiler overpressure from 20 to 16 bar had certainly slowed down their susceptibility to damage, {{but could not}} prevent it entirely. Of the 112 locomotives recorded in the DR fleet in 1955, only 12 had already been equipped with a '1943 Type' replacement boiler and were therefore safe. Problems with the St 47 K boilers, however, increased massively. <b>Repair</b> <b>welding</b> did not produce the desired effect, but made the material even more brittle and the danger of cracks developing and boiler explosions was greater than before. And {{it was not just}} the Class 41 that was affected. Classes 03, 03.10 and 50, with boilers made of non-aging St 47 K, were also prone to damage. As a result of increasing difficulties the DR had to withdraw over 300 locomotives from service in 1956 which abruptly led to an enormous shortage of engines. The urgent call for action which then resulted led at last to the development and subsequent ordering of a new boiler (later called the 39E) that, with a few minor alterations, was also usable on locomotive classe 03, 03.10 and 39.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of welding residual stresses {{is known to}} influence fracture of welded metallic structures. Where there is significant ductile deformation prior to fracture, welding residual stresses are often perceived to be removed as plasticity is accumulated and do not subsequently contribute to fracture. To explore this, a large scale experiment was conducted {{as part of the}} EU-STYLE project. One experiment was performed on a <b>repair</b> <b>welded</b> stainless steel pipe subjected to four-point bending. There was evidence of limited ductile tearing prior to collapse of the pipe. Prior to testing, residual stress measurements were made through the <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> and opposite the <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> in the original girth weld of the pipe. These measurements were used as input to a finite element (FE) model. An iterative technique was employed to map measured residual stresses onto an uncracked FE model, and an equilibrium state determined. The residual stress state was then mapped onto a cracked pipe FE model which was then used to simulate the pipe's behaviour. The simulations reveal that the {{presence of}} tensile residual stresses contributes significantly to initial yielding behaviour but as plasticity progresses the residual stresses are removed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Metal {{materials}} {{are subjected to}} innumerable time-dependent degradation mechanisms when operate in power, petrochemical and refinery plant. These {{materials are}} subjected to multiaxial stresses, creep, fatigue, corrosion and abrasion. As a result of service especially at high temperatures and high pressures, can lead to forming cracks, damages or failures. In situation of breakdown in such systems {{there is a need}} for weld repair on plant components and repair work can be expensive and time-consuming. Most weld repairs of low alloy steels require high-temperature post weld heat treatment (PWHT); but in certain repairs, however, this is not always possible. Expenses of the repair work could be reduced if the weld repairing is performed on site. Also, application of the nickel based filler metal can be alternative to performing PWHT.
