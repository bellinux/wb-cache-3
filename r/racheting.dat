40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hierarchical clustering method named <b>RACHET</b> (Recursive Agglomeration of Clustering Hierarchies by Encircling Tactic) for analyzing multi-dimensional distributed data. A typical clustering algorithm requires bringing {{all the data}} in a centralized warehouse. This results in O (nd) transmission cost, where n {{is the number of}} items and d is the number of features. For massive datasets, this is prohibitively expensive. In contrast, <b>RACHET</b> runs with at most O (n) time, space, and communication costs to build a global hierarchy of comparable clustering quality by merging locally generated clustering hierarchies. <b>RACHET</b> employs the encircling tactic in which the merges at each stage are chosen to minimize the volume of a covering hypersphere. For each cluster centroid, <b>RACHET</b> maintains descriptive statistics of constant complexity to enable these choices. <b>RACHET’s</b> framework is applicable to a wide class of centroid-based hierarchical clustering algorithms, such as centroid, medoid, and Ward. ...|$|R

It further argues that if strengthened measures on the control orders model are needed—on the argument that TPIMs in their current form cannot answer effectively to the current threat—consideration should be given to introducing enhanced TPIMs, already available under the ETPIMs Bill, which are accompanied by safeguards not available in relation to TPIMs. So doing, it will be argued, would tend to focus minds on the temporary and "emergency" status of such measures rather than normalising them...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} different aircraft configurations from three different data sources using four well-known criteria to predict adverse aircraft-pilot coupling (APC) problems in the roll axis. 17 representative configurations were selected for further analyses and experiments. All evaluations were performed using a MATLAB based software package. The LATHOS program provides {{a large number of}} configurations covering a wide range regarding the criterion parameters. Generally, a good correlation can be observed between criterion parameters and pilot ratings, while mainly the configurations with <b>Racheting</b> problems are out of place. For the F- 18 A in-flight simulation program some discrepancies regarding pilot ratings and criterion results were detected. Therefore, this data-base is not suitable to validate the application of the longitudinal frequency domain criteria to the roll axis. The YF- 16 first flight configuration has been shown as a very interesting case regarding the understanding of the APC phenomenon; at this time it is not quite clear whether the APC occurred during the first flight is mainly due to bad linear aircraft dynamics or due to rate saturation. Therefore, further nonlinear analysis and simulator experiments are required.

40|$|The {{history of}} the present is {{assessed}} in terms of forecasts {{that proved to be}} spectacularly incorrect. Debate about power in the past was largely state-centred but the realisation that the opposite of the state is not a free market but a political anarchy seems to have been forgotten. The society of the spectacle, to use Guy Debord's concept, reigns supreme today, but in ways unimagined by European situationists. The spectacle ignites a new politics of identity, constituted in terms that depart radically from the older terms of class analysis. While some analysts have spoken of the rise of the risk society it is necessary today to add the state of insecurity to contemporary characterisations, whether represented in reality or rhetoric. Global identities constituted by religiosity sit uneasily within nation states as containers of identity and the attempts of states to reaffirm national identity in the face of its rejection by significant subsections of the population is most likely to achieve a rhetorical <b>racheting</b> up of tensions. Consequently, the state of insecurity leads to increasing surveillance and control as a societal project for which every failure is the guarantee of further resources, tighter surveillance and an increasing simulacrum of control. power; terrorism; state of insecurity; identity; security; business; surveillance; control. ...|$|E
40|$|Advanced Plasma Material Interaction (PMI) science {{requires}} in-situ {{time and}} space-resolved measurements {{over a large}} area of Plasma Facing Component (PFC) surfaces to study fuel retention & recovery, erosion & redeposition, material mixing, etc. A novel PFC diagnostic technique Accelerator-based In-situ Materials Surveillance (AIMS) has been developed for Alcator C-Mod. At present, the AIMS covers a relatively small (35 cm) poloidal section of the inner wall PFCs at a single toroidal angle; an upgrade has been proposed which will enable nearly full poloidal (124 cm) and 40 degree toroidal PFC coverage. This paper introduces the design, analysis and fabrication of the new TF magnet power supply system for this upgrade. First, {{the design of the}} busbar system and its support structure is described, which are required to carry 15 kA current for long pulse operation of up to 25 minutes and fault condition of 400 kA for 1 second. Additional elements in the power supply system include a bidirectional crowbar, varistor protection assemblies, and a high current bus switch. Secondly, multi-physics analyses involved in the design are presented. Electro-magnetic analysis is performed to evaluate the spreading load of the two current-carrying busbars while Joule heating with thermal <b>racheting</b> analysis is to estimate the temperature rise in the components. Structural analysis taking into account dead weight, thermal expansion, spreading load and seismic load is performed. All analyses are completed using finite element analysis software COMSOL. Analytical calculations are included to validate the FEA results. The power supply system is ready for fabrication. United States. Department of Energy (award DE-FC 02 - 99 ER 54512...|$|E

In the Janossy effect, the threshold intensity for the optical Freedericksz transition is dramatically reduced by the additon of {{a small amount of}} dye to the sample. This has been interpreted as an optically pumped orientational <b>rachet</b> mechanism, similar to the <b>rachet</b> mechanism in biological molecular motors. To interpret the evolution system proposed for this effect requires an innovative gradient flow.

An existence theorem for the evolution problem follows as well. Furthermore, we consider the time independent problem and show its local asymptotic stability. Finally we progress toward showing that the proposed model correctly predicts the onset of the Janossy effect. ...|$|R

40|$|Software {{components}} are increasingly assembled from other components. Each component may further depend on oth-ers, and each may have multiple active versions. The to-tal number of configurations—combinations of components and their versions—deployed {{by end users}} can be very large. Component developers, therefore, spend considerable time and effort doing compatibility testing – determining whether their components can be built correctly for all deployed con-figurations. In previous work we developed <b>Rachet</b> to sup-port large-scale compatibility testing of components. In this paper, we describe and evaluate methods to enable <b>Rachet</b> to perform incremental compatibility testing. We de-scribe algorithms to compute differences in component com-patibilities between current and previous component builds, a formal test adequacy criterion based on covering the differ-ences, and cache-aware configuration sampling and testing methods that attempt to reuse effort from previous testing sessions. We evaluate our approach using the 5 -year evo-lution history of a scientific middleware component. Our results show significant performance improvements over Ra-chet’s previous retest-all approach, making the process of compatibility testing practical for evolving components...|$|R
40|$|Software {{compatibility}} testing {{is an important}} quality assurance task aimed at ensuring that component-based software systems build and/or execute properly across {{a broad range of}} user system configurations. Because each configuration can involve multiple components with different versions, and because there are complex and changing interdependencies between components and their versions, it is generally infeasible to test all potential configurations. Therefore, {{compatibility testing}} usually means examining only a handful of default or popular configurations to detect problems, and as a result costly errors can and do escape to the field. This paper presents an improved approach to compatibility testing called <b>RACHET.</b> We formally model the configuration space for component-based systems and use the model to generate test plans covering user-specified portion of the space – the example in this paper is covering all direct dependencies between components. The test plan is executed efficiently in parallel, by distributing work so as to best utilize test resources. We conducted experiments and simulation studies applying our approach to a large-scale data management middleware system. The results showed that for this system <b>RACHET</b> discovered incompatibilities between components at {{a small fraction of the}} cost for exhaustive testing without compromising test quality...|$|R
