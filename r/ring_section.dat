50|$|Another way of fitting more balls into a radial {{ball bearing}} is by {{radially}} 'fracturing' (slicing) one of the rings all the way through, loading the balls in, re-assembling the fractured portion, and then using a pair of steel bands to hold the fractured <b>ring</b> <b>sections</b> together in alignment. Again, this allows more balls, including full ball complement, however unlike with either slot fill or relieved race constructions, it can support significant axial loading in either direction.|$|R

Moreover, we will give two dualities on n-Gorenstein <b>rings</b> (<b>Sections</b> 1. 2, 1. 3), where one of them is closely related to the Auslander–Reiten theory (Section  1. 3. 1) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} multiplicative ideal {{structure}} of commutative rings {{in which every}} finitely generated ideal is quasi-projective. Section 2 provides some preliminaries on quasi-projective modules over commutative <b>rings.</b> <b>Section</b> 3 investigates the correlation with well-known Prufer conditions; namely, we prove that this class of rings stands strictly between the two classes of arithmetical rings and Gaussian rings. Thereby, we generalize Osofsky's theorem on the weak global dimension of arithmetical rings and partially resolve Bazzoni-Glaz's related conjecture on Gaussian rings. We also establish an analogue of Bazzoni-Glaz results on the transfer of Prufer conditions between a ring and its total <b>ring</b> of quotients. <b>Section</b> 4 examines various contexts of trivial ring extensions {{in order to build}} new and original examples of rings where all finitely generated ideals are subject to quasi-projectivity, marking their distinction from related classes of Prufer rings.

The advantages of such a chamber over the conventional metal or glass chamber are given especially as regards the electric field configuration, high voltage lead-in, and the ease of construction.

50|$|Known as the Papa pump, this utilises the low {{pressure}} generated by high velocity water flow around a curve-shaped elastomeric valve (with {{low pressure}} loss) {{to allow a}} valve design that enables rapid closure and with a relatively small cross sectional area and low weight. The venturi valve is configured as a <b>ring</b> <b>section</b> positioned around the supply inlet of the pump with the delivery outlet of the pump being directly in line. The design allowed the pump structure to be concentric and therefore inherently strong and upon closure of the valve, permits efficient water delivery by acting {{in line with the}} supply via a second smaller venturi effect delivery non return valve. The elastomeric material and operation of these valves also allows them to self-return without weight or spring assistance. A pressure vessel installed on a tee connected to the delivery port of the pump provides the pulsed flow accumulation means. This unique technology and design dramatically reduced the weight, manufacturing cost and number of components required - as well as provided an overall improvement in efficiency.|$|E

40|$|A {{previous}} study {{suggested that the}} ultrasonic spectroscopy technique identified possible disbonds or delaminations in polymer matrix composite (PMC) <b>rings</b> <b>sectioned</b> from flywheel rotors (ref. 1). These results went unsubstantiated by other nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods. To explain the results, PMC rings were further investigated with ultrasonic spectroscopy (ref. 2). The ultrasonic spectroscopy system utilizes a continuous-swept sine waveform as the input. After the swept sine wave traverses the material, the captured waveform is subjected to two fast Fourier transforms. The second fast Fourier transform along with equalization of the frequency spectrum, allows for evaluation of the fundamental resonant frequency. The full-thickness resonance, the resonance corresponding {{to the location of}} the intentional disbond, and the frequency spectrum were examined in an effort to characterize the sensitivity of the NDE method to various delamination conditions...|$|R
