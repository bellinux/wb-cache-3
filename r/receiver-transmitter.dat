30|$|I/O {{ports of}} the entity allow the FPGA {{communicating}} with outside signals in every transaction. A logic controller {{is responsible for}} the exchange of the question-response signals between MCD and ADC. When DR (data ready) gives MCD a ready status to collect data, MCD returns two pulses (ACC (accepted) and ECON (enable conversion)) to ADC with variable thresholds establishing differentiated window for carrying out data acquisition. As the track signal (peak detection) appears, dead-time (DT) pulse allows the logic controller sending a pulse to the FPGA for timestamp (as a percentage). In parallel with the signal recognition logic and the question-and-response interface, the memory read/write function, living time (LT), dead time (DT) and real-time (RT) are done via other control logic pulses. To locate the address for SRAM write cycle, ADC pulse opens two byte buffers of 13 -bit address. Peak amplitude content (reflecting energy information) existing in DR will be written on each cell of SRAM memory when OE (open enable) is low and RW (read-write) is high. Existing data on the local exchange line MIO [D 0 - D 7] written by each byte data via a series of internal logic control pulses ADCL (ADC latch), CI (Carry input), CO (Carry output) and ADC* (ADC ative low). To download the content contained in the SRAM, a memory read cycle is carried out by detecting low and high address with the decoded signal CS 3. When two bytes of address read cycle have positioned SRAM, then contents will be read out via CS 2. Data <b>receiver-transmitters</b> from peripheral to PC via bidirectional buffer the signal selected port (read or write) PSEL and choose the direction DIR signal effect. timers is programmable (2 bytes each) will be calculated from DT, LT clocks by 1  second.

Transponders are {{an adaptation of}} military {{identification friend or foe}} technology. Most current AVI systems rely on radio-frequency identification, where an antenna at the toll gate communicates with a transponder on the vehicle via dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). Some early AVI systems used barcodes affixed to each vehicle, to be read optically at the toll booth. Optical systems proved to have poor reading reliability, especially when faced with inclement weather and dirty vehicles.|$|E

50|$|The VRC-12 series {{includes}} the VRC-12 and VRC-43 to 49. which consist of various combinations of three basic components, two <b>receiver-transmitter</b> models, the RT-246 and the RT-524, and an auxiliary receiver, the R-442. The RT-246 can select one of ten frequencies preset by the operator. The operator has to select each frequency manually on the RT-542, {{which has a}} built-in loudspeaker in the space occupied by push buttons on the RT-246. The RT-524 was developed primarily for use in vehicles where the operator could reach the control panel easily; the RT-246 was designed for use in tracked vehicles where the operator could not reach the control panel. In Vietnam these radios were often removed from vehicles for use in bases such as forward tactical command posts. In most cases, major tactical units were issued the VRC-12 family of radios just before or shortly after their deployment to Vietnam during 1965 and 1966.|$|E

The adopted algorithm is {{able to keep the}} false alarm rate constant, if the disturbance samples associated to each <b>receiver-Transmitter</b> pair are distributed according to a Compound-Gaussian model. In particular, we analyze the performance of the adopted detection algorithm, in order to evaluate the impact of clutter diversity on the detection performance. To this aim, we simulated the clutter samples by varying the shape parameter of the clutter distribution associated to each <b>receiver-Transmitter</b> pair. The results highlight that clutter diversity has a strong impact on the detection performance. In the case of two channels, i. e.

A rubidium vapor standard serves as the primary reference.

For a given flight path, a single <b>receiver-transmitter</b> pair produces one arc of data in Fourier space. Since the resulting Fourier sampling patterns bear a superficial resemblance {{to those found}} in radio astronomy, we consider using deconvolution techniques borrowed from radio astronomy, namely the CLEAN algorithm, to form images from passive radar data...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete characterization and solution to microphone position self-calibration problem for time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements. This {{is the problem}} of determining the positions of receivers and transmitters given all <b>receiver-transmitter</b> distances. Such calibration problems arise in application such as calibration of radio antenna networks, audio or ultra-sound arrays and WiFi transmitter arrays. We show for what cases such calibration problems are well-defined and derive efficient and numerically stable algorithms for the minimal TOA calibration problems. The proposed algorithms are non-iterative and require no assumptions on the sensor positions. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed minimal solvers are numerically stable and perform well on noisy data. The solvers are also tested on two real datasets with good results...|$|E
30|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} target detection for multistatic radars. We propose an algorithm that is able to keep constant the false alarm rate, when the disturbance samples associated with each <b>receiver-transmitter</b> pair are distributed according to a compound Gaussian model. The performance of the proposed detection algorithm are analysed {{to assess the impact}} of clutter diversity on detection performance. The results show that clutter statistical diversity has a strong impact on detection performance. The performance of both single-channel and multichannel detection schemes are evaluated by processing real sea clutter data collected by the NetRAD nodes, in order to evaluate which of the two channels, i.e. the bistatic and monostatic channels, is more favourable for target detection. Furthermore, the gain achieved by using a multistatic detection algorithm is also analysed.|$|E
40|$|The need to {{recharge}} the batteries of a mobile robot has presented an important challenge {{for a long}} time. In this paper, a vision-based wireless charging method for robot energy trophallaxis between two robots is presented. Even though wireless power transmission allows more positional error between <b>receiver-transmitter</b> coils than with a contact-type charging system, both coils have to be aligned as accurately as possible for efficient power transfer. To align the coils, a transmitter robot recognizes the coarse pose of a receiver robot via a camera image and the ambiguity of the estimated pose is removed with a Bayesian estimator. The precise pose of the receiver coil is calculated using a marker image attached to a receiver robot. Experiments with several types of receiver robots have been conducted to verify the proposed method...|$|E

The design comprises an implantable transmitter for short to medium range transmission, a receiver retransmitter collar to be worn for long-range transmission, and a signal conditioner interface circuit to assist in signal discrimination and demodulation of receiver or tape-recorded audio outputs. Implanted electrodes are used to obtain an ECG, from which R-wave characteristics are selected to trigger a short RF pulse.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedIn this thesis, the principals of Software Defined Radio are demonstrated by implementing a Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK) <b>receiver-transmitter</b> in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). After introducing {{the theory behind}} the Non-Coherent BFSK demodulation implemented at the receiver, the design of transmitter and receiver is illustrated. The design environment of choice is Mathworks'Â® Simulink and XilinxÂ® System Generator, a dedicated library for Mathworks' Simulink. The design is downloaded to a Virtex- 4 FPGA. The receiver is Non-Coherent (NC) {{in the sense that}} the receiver need not know the phase of the incoming signal. A feedback circuit is responsible for both packet and bit synchronization. Also, the receiver is implemented using non-coherent match filters instead of low pass filters which would be easier, but would degrade the performance. Finally, some interesting experiences that were gained during the learning process are discussed. In Appendix A, we evaluate different technological options in implementing communication modulating techniques and Software Defined Radio. These options include Digital Signal Processors, Field Programmable Gate Arrays, General Purpose Processors and Application Specific Integrated Circuits and a comparison between these choices is made.

40|$|A {{computational}} model for {{radio wave propagation}} through tree orchards is presented. Trees are modeled as collections of branches, geometrically approximated by cylinders, whose dimensions are determined {{on the basis of}} measurements in a cherry orchard. Tree canopies are modeled as dielectric spheres of appropriate size. A single row of trees was modeled by creating copies of a representative tree model positioned on top of a rectangular, lossy dielectric slab that simulated the ground. The complete scattering model, including soil and trees, enhanced by periodicity conditions corresponding to the array, was characterized via a commercial computational software tool for simulating the wave propagation by means of the Finite Element Method. The attenuation of the simulated signal was compared to measurements taken in the cherry orchard, using two ZigBee <b>receiver-transmitter</b> modules. Near the top of the tree canopies (at 3 m), the predicted attenuation was close to the measured one—just slightly underestimated. However, at 1. 5 m the solver underestimated the measured attenuation significantly, especially when leaves were present and, as distances grew longer. This suggests that the effects of scattering from neighboring tree rows need to be incorporated into the model. However, complex geometries result in ill conditioned linear systems that affect the solver’s convergence...|$|E
40|$|Transient {{electromagnetic}} sounding methods (TEM) {{have several}} advantages over DC resistivity soundings. The principal {{advantage is that}} sounding depths several times the <b>receiver-transmitter</b> spacing can be achieved, resulting in less cumbersome field work and more flexible sounding site selection. The TEM method was tested using a commercially available instrument (Geonics EM- 37) in the Gulf Springs region of west-central Florida to locate the saltwater interface in the Floridan Aquifer. The Floridan is a thick (200 m), unconfined, karstic, carbonate aquifer within the study area. High annual rainfall and internal drainage create a deep and dynamic interface. Eighty transient soundings were completed in 18 field days. Seventy-one soundings used a square 80 m × 80 m transmitter loop, and the other nine used a 160 m × 160 m coil. The interface was easily detected from a minimum depth of 60 m to its maximum depth of about 140 meters. Also, a high-resistivity, low-porosity zone was detected at depths ranging from 180 – 250 meters. The TEM data compare well with available chloride concentration data. The TEM interface corresponds to chloride values in excess of 200 – 400 mg/ 1. The sounding curves obtained suggest that with presently available instruments the TEM method is not well-suited for shallow soundings (less than 40 – 50 meters) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of using the}} transient electromagnetic sounding (TS or TDEM) method for groundwater exploration can be studied by means of numerical models. As examples of its applicability to groundwater exploration, we study four groundwater exploration problems: (1) mapping of alluvial fill and gravel zones over bedrock; (2) mapping of sand and gravel lenses in till; (3) detection of salt or brackish water interfaces in freshwater aquifers; and (4) determination of hydrostratigraphy. These groundwater problems require determination of the depth to bedrock; location of resistive, high-porosity zones associated with fresh water; determination of formation resistivity to assess water quality; and determination of lithology and geometry, respectively. The TS method is best suited for locating conductive targets, and has very good vertical resolution. Unlike other sounding techniques where the <b>receiver-transmitter</b> array must be expanded to sound more deeply, the depth of investigation for the TS method {{is a function of}} the length of time the transient is recorded. Present equipment limitations require that exploration targets with resistivities of 50 Ω m or more be at least 50 m deep to determine their resistivity. The maximum depth of exploration is controlled by the geoelectrical section and background electromagnetic (EM) noise. For a particular exploration problem, numerical studies arc recommended to determine if the target is detectable...|$|E
40|$|A report {{describes}} a non-standard {{direct digital synthesizer}} (DDS) implementation {{that can be used}} as part of a coherent transponder so as to allow any rational turnaround ratio to be exactly achieved and maintained while the received frequency varies. (A coherent transponder is a <b>receiver-transmitter</b> in which the transmitted carrier is locked to a pre-determined multiple of the received carrier's frequency and phase. That multiple is called the turnaround ratio.) The report also {{describes a}} general model for coherent transponders that are partly digital. A partially digital transponder is one in which analog signal processing is used to convert the signals between high frequencies at which they are radiated and relatively low frequencies at which they are converted to or from digital form, with most of the complex processing performed digitally. There is a variety of possible architectures for such a transponder, and different ones can be selected by choosing different parameter values in the general model. Such a transponder uses a DDS to create a low-frequency quasi-sinusoidal signal that tracks the received carrier s phase, and another DDS to generate an IF or near-baseband version of the transmitted carrier. With conventional DDS implementations, a given turnaround ratio can be achieved only approximately, and the error varies slightly as the received frequency changes. The non-conventional implementation employed here allows any rational turnaround ratio to be exactly maintained...|$|E
