5|$|After these events, Ueshiba {{seemed to}} slowly grow away from Takeda, {{and he began}} to change his art. These changes are {{reflected}} in the differing names with which he <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> system, first as aiki-jūjutsu, then Ueshiba-ryū, Asahi-ryū, and aiki budō. In 1942, when Ueshiba's group joined the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, the martial art that Ueshiba developed finally {{came to be known as}} aikido.|$|E
5|$|Andrée gave a glowingly optimistic {{account of}} {{the ease with which}} these {{requirements}} could be met. Larger balloons had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more airtight, too. Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site could easily be done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own drag-rope experiments with the Svea, stating that a deviation of 27degrees from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.|$|E

5|$|Fluent in Pashto, English, and Urdu, Yousafzai {{was educated}} mostly by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, {{who is a}} poet, school owner, and an {{educational}} activist himself, running a chain of private schools known as the Khushal Public School. She once stated to an interviewer that {{she would like to}} become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead. Ziauddin <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> daughter as something entirely special, allowing her to stay up at night and talk about politics after her two brothers had been sent to bed.|$|E
5|$|In his {{writings}} Henson <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> two regrets in life. The first {{was that he}} had not been at a public school, a fact to which he ascribed his lifelong feeling of being an outsider. The second regret was {{that he and his wife}} had been unable to have children. They unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education. At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E
5|$|Ranulf Flambard (c. 1060– 5 September 1128) was {{a medieval}} Norman Bishop of Durham and an {{influential}} government minister of King William Rufus of England. Ranulf {{was the son}} of a priest of Bayeux, Normandy, and his nickname Flambard means incendiary or torch-bearer, and may have <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> personality. He started his career under King William I of England, probably in the compilation of the Domesday Book, as well as being the keeper of the king's seal. On the death of William I, Ranulf chose to serve the new king of England, William Rufus.|$|E

5|$|Interspersed {{throughout}} his scientific essays for Natural History magazine, Gould frequently <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> nonscientific interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected baseball cards and remained a New York Yankees fan {{throughout his}} life. As an adult he {{was fond of}} science fiction movies, but often deplored their poor storytelling and presentation of science. His other interests included singing baritone in the Boston Cecilia, and he was a great aficionado of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He collected rare antiquarian books, possessed an enthusiasm for architecture, and enjoyed city walks. He often traveled to Europe, and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. He sometimes alluded ruefully to his tendency to put on weight.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bricius's earlier appeal, it was {{not until}} Andreas de Moravia's episcopate that Pope Honorius III issued his bull on 10 April 1224 authorising his legates Gilbert de Moravia, Bishop of Caithness, Robert, Abbot of Kinloss and Henry, Dean of Ross to examine the {{suitability}} of transferring the cathedra to Elgin. The Bishop of Caithness and the Dean of Ross performed the translation ceremony on 19 July 1224. On 10 July, Alexander II (Alaxandair mac Uilliam) had agreed to the transference in an edict that <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> having given the land previously for this purpose. The land grant predated the Papal mandate and there is evidence that building had started in around 1215.Construction of the cathedral was completed after 1242. Chronicler John of Fordun recorded without explanation that in 1270 the cathedral church and the canons' houses had burned down. The cathedral was rebuilt in a larger and grander style to form the greater part of the structure that is now visible, work that is supposed to have been completed by the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1296. Although Edward I of England took an army to Elgin in 1296 and again in 1303, the cathedral was left unscathed, as it was by his grandson Edward III during his assault on Moray in 1336.|$|E
5|$|Disputes among European powers {{led to the}} {{formation}} of two coalitions in the late 1140s. One alliance was formed by the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos and Conrad III against Roger II of Sicily who had invaded Byzantine territories. Géza sided with Roger II and his allies, including the rebellious German prince, Welf VI and Uroš II of Rascia. Géza sent reinforcements to his brother-in-law, Grand Prince Iziaslav II, against Prince Vladimir of Chernigov in the spring of 1148. The Serbs of Rascia rebelled in 1149, forcing Emperor Manuel I to interrupt his preparations for an invasion of Southern Italy and invade Rascia in 1149. According to the emperor's panegyrist Theodore Prodromus, Hungarian forces supported the Serbs during the emperor's campaign. The Hypatian Codex says that Géza <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> war against Emperor Manuel when excusing himself for refusing to send reinforcements to Iziaslav II whom Yuri Dolgorukiy, Prince of Suzdal, expelled from Kiev in August 1149. Hungarian auxiliaries supported Iziaslav II to reoccupy Kiev in the early spring of 1150, but before long Yuri Dolgorukiy expelled Iziaslav from the town. In autumn, Géza led his army against Volodimirko of Halych, who was Yuri Dolgorukiy's close ally. He captured Sanok, but Volodimirko bribed the Hungarian commanders, who persuaded Géza to leave Halych before November.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, Fairley {{received}} an appointment in London as Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Although he and Kellaway convinced the governors to delay Fairley's commencement until their major venom work was completed, he departed for London {{by the end}} of that year. He also opened a consulting practice in Harley Street. In London he encountered patients with filariasis and devised a test to diagnose the disease at an early stage; but when he went to write up his results he discovered that details of a similar test had already been published. In 1934, a sewer worker was <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> ward with acute jaundice which Fairley diagnosed as caused by filariasis. The disease was revealed to be an occupational hazard of sewer workers, and steps were taken to protect the workers. Perhaps his most important work in this period was research into blackwater fever. Since malaria cases were uncommon in the United Kingdom, he made annual visits to the Malaria Research Laboratory of the League of Nations at the Refugee Hospital in Salonika. In the process, he described methaemalbumin, a previously unknown blood pigment. For his scientific accomplishments in London, Fairley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942.|$|E
5|$|In early 1994, Levesque {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In his first televised match, Levesque debuted as a villain named Terror Risin', defeating Keith Cole. His ring name was soon modified to Terra Ryzing, which he used until mid-1994, when he was renamed Jean-Paul Lévesque. This gimmick <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> surname's French origins and {{he was asked to}} speak with a French accent, as he could not speak French. During this time, he began using his finishing maneuver, the Pedigree. Lévesque had a brief feud with Alex Wright that ended at Starrcade with Wright pinning him. Between late 1994 and early 1995, Lévesque briefly teamed with Lord Steven Regal, whose upper class British persona was similar to Lévesque's character. However, the team was short-lived, as Levesque left for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in January 1995 after WCW turned down his request to be promoted as a singles competitor.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Creangă's death, efforts began {{to collect his}} {{manuscript}} writings and the updated versions of his printed works. This project involved his son Constantin, alongside A. D. Xenopol, Grigore Alexandrescu and Eduard Gruber, the latter of whom obtained the works from Tinca Vartic. The first edition was published as two volumes, in 1890–1892, but the project {{came to an abrupt}} halt due to Gruber's insanity and death. Creangă's final known work, the fragment of Făt-frumos, fiul iepei, was published by Convorbiri Literare in 1898. The Gruber copies were sold to a Dr. Mendel, and only a part of them was recovered by exegetes, alongside various fragments accidentally discovered at Iași market, where they were being used for wrapping paper. The collection, structured into a whole by folklorist Gheorghe T. Kirileanu, was published by Editura Minerva in 1902 and 1906. In addition to being mentioned in the memoirs of several prominent Junimists, Creangă had his political career fictionalized and satirized by Iacob Negruzzi, who transformed him, as Popa Smântână, into a character of his satirical poems Electorale ("Electorals"). The same author <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> counterpart in one of his epigrams.|$|E
