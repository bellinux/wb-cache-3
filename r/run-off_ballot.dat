25|$|By {{the time}} of the presidential {{election}} of 2010, Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko — allies during the Orange Revolution — had become bitter enemies. Tymoshenko ran for president against both Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych, creating a three-way race. Yushchenko, whose popularity had plummeted, persisted in running, and many pro-Orange voters stayed home.

40|$|We look to {{forecast}} {{the number of}} seats the Front National (FN) will win in the 2017 legislative election. We use the most recent subnational ballot, the 2015 regional election, to estimate support for the party, and model reallocation of first-round legislative votes {{in the second round}} by applying the pattern seen between the 2011 cantonal and 2012 legislative elections. Using different levels of turnout and four different scenarios of Left-bloc coalition arrangements, both of which strongly influence how the FN performs in <b>run-off</b> <b>ballots,</b> we estimate that a likely, but conservative, scenario would result in 29 FN seats, if a similar pattern to 2011 – 2012 obtains. This number of seats would allow the FN to form a Parliamentary group in the National Assembly...|$|R

50|$|Originally {{scheduled}} to take place on 29 March 2015, the date was changed to 25 May 2014 following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. Petro Poroshenko won the elections with 54.7% of the votes. His closest competitor was Yulia Tymoshenko, who emerged with 12.81% of the votes. The Central Election Commission reported voter turnout at over 60% excluding those regions not under government control, Crimea and {{a large part of}} the Donbass. Since Poroshenko obtained an absolute majority in the first round, a <b>run-off</b> second <b>ballot</b> was unnecessary.|$|R
50|$|As {{no single}} {{candidate}} had received 50% or more {{votes in the}} first round ballot the two highest polling candidates, Viktor Yanukovych (35.32%) and Yulia Tymoshenko (25.05%) progressed to the second final <b>run-off</b> <b>ballot</b> which was held on February 7, 2010.|$|E

Originally scheduled to take place on 29 March 2015, the date was changed following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. Poroshenko won the elections with 54.7% of the votes, enough to win in a single round. His closest competitor was Yulia Tymoshenko, who emerged with 12.81% of the votes.

Tymoshenko ran for president against both Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych, creating a three-way race. Yushchenko, whose popularity had plummeted, refused to close ranks and support Tymoshenko, thus dividing the anti-Yanukovych vote. Many pro-Orange voters stayed home. Yanukovych received 48% of the vote and Yushchenko less than 6%, an amount which, if thrown to Tymoshenko, who received 45%, would have prevented Yanukovych from gaining the presidency; since no candidate obtained an absolute majority {{in the first round of}} voting the two highest polling candidates contested in a <b>run-off</b> second <b>ballot</b> which Yanukovych won.|$|R

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the content}} of three referring orders (from Court of Messina, Torino and Perugia) challenging the new electoral statute approved by Italian Parliament (l. n. 52 / 2015). The analysis is carried out {{against the background of}} the most recent case law of the Italian Constitutional Court. In the judgment n. 1 / 2014, indeed, the Court tried to shed a light on the notions of “freedom” and “personality” of the voting right in a really innovative way. The Author specially focuses on controversial profiles stemming from the new orders, paying special attention to the “majority bonus” and to the <b>run-off</b> second <b>ballot,</b> {{as well as to the}} system of “partially blocked lists”...|$|R
50|$|Poll {{results are}} listed in the table below in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first. The highest {{percentage}} figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the two leading candidates respective colours. In the instance that there is a tie, then no figure is bolded. If no candidate obtains an absolute majority in the first round, then the two highest polling candidates will contest a <b>run-off</b> second <b>ballot.</b> The lead column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the two candidates with the highest figures. Poll results use the date the survey's fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. However, if such date is unknown, the date of publication will be given instead.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, Mme Lepage {{launched}} {{herself into}} the Presidential race and received 1.88% {{of the vote in}} the first ballot. In the regional elections of 2004, she {{was at the top of}} the list of the Paris départment on the slate of André Santini (Union for French Democracy, UDF). She did not participate in the second <b>ballot</b> <b>run-off</b> on the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) roster of Jean-François Copé. In the European elections of June 2004, her list for the constituency of Ile de France would receive 3.6%. She was elected to the European Parliament elected in the 2009 European election in North-West constituency as the MoDem's top candidate.|$|R
5000|$|Following the November 21 <b>run-off</b> <b>ballot,</b> Ukraine's electoral {{commission}} declared Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych with 49.42% of {{the vote}} the winner with Viktor Yushchenko receiving 46.69% of the ballots cast. Observers for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said the run-off vote [...] "did not meet international standards" [...] and U.S. senior election observer, Senator Richard Lugar, called it a [...] "concerted and forceful program of election day fraud".|$|E
50|$|According to Ukraine's electoral law, a two-round {{system is}} used to elect the President in which a {{candidate}} must win a majority (50% or more) of all ballots cast. The first round of voting was held on October 31, 2004. As no candidate had 50% {{or more of the}} votes cast a <b>run-off</b> <b>ballot</b> between the two-highest polling candidates, Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych, was held on November 21. According to official Central Election Commission results announced on November 23, the run-off election was won by Viktor Yanukovych. The election results were challenged by Viktor Yushchenko and his supporters with many international observers claiming that the election was rigged.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the strongest}} criticisms against the two-round voting system is the cost {{required}} to conduct two ballots. The two-round voting system also {{has the potential to}} cause political instability between the two rounds of voting, adding further to the economic impact of the two-round electoral system. Under an instant <b>run-off</b> <b>ballot</b> method there is only one round. It is alleged that the results of the election are known in days as opposed to months {{depending on the size of}} the electorate, but this is not always the case depending on the ability to count the rounds of the more complex instant runoff voting.|$|E
50|$|The {{election}} was conducted using a one member, one vote formula. Each {{member of the}} Parti Quebecois was allowed to vote by phone or on the web from May 13 until May 15. If {{there is not a}} majority for a candidate (50% +1) on the first ballot, there will be a <b>run-off</b> <b>ballot</b> between the two candidates who had the most votes on the first ballot. If a second ballot was required, it would have been held from May 20 until May 22. To be nominated, a candidate needed to collect 2,000 signatures aggregated from 50 ridings, in 10 regions and pay $20,000 to be listed on the first ballot. If there were a second ballot, candidates would have had to pay an additional $5,000. The spending limit was $400,000. A proposal to allow a vote open to non-members was defeated.|$|E
5000|$|ASLEF's Rules stated [...] "The General Secretary {{shall be}} {{elected by the}} votes of the {{majority}} of the whole of the members of the Society". However, only 4,369 of ASLEF's 10,502 members (41.6%) had voted and Fox won only 42.6% of the votes that had been cast. The runner up was an EC member and former Organising Secretary, Harry Parfitt, with 1,536 votes. After the votes were counted on 8 December an EC member proposed a run-off election between Fox and Parfitt but the EC voted to take legal advice. On 9 December the EC voted to declare Fox elected as General Secretary and the Assistant General Secretary, Henry Shuttleworth, quickly issued a circular to all branches to that effect. Parfitt challenged the decision and issued his own circular to branches asserting the members' right to demand a <b>run-off</b> <b>ballot,</b> but none was held and Fox took office without further challenge.|$|E
40|$|The author {{looks into}} the role of TV debates in presidential campaigns, how the {{pioneering}} attempt at their production in Croatia in 2005 was received by Croatian voters and how these TV debates differed from the American model. Namely, a novelty in the Croatian 2005 presidential campaign were three TV debates between the leading contenders, Sjepan Mesić and Jadranka Kosor, who competed in the <b>run-off</b> <b>ballot.</b> The debates were organized by the three national TV networks (HRT, RTL and Nova TV) and the ratings were high...|$|E
