40|$|In {{competitive}} electricity markets, {{the costs}} for each <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> should be charged {{to those who}} cause the costs to be incurred with charges based on the {{factors that contribute to}} these costs. For example, the amount of generating capacity assigned to the regulation service {{is a function of the}} short-term volatility of system load. Therefore, the charges for regulation should be related to the volatility of each load, not to its average demand. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requires this as well. In its recent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FERC wrote (1999), “The Commission believes that, whenever it is economically feasible, it is important for the RTO [regional transmission organization] to provide accurate price signals that reflect the costs <b>of</b> supplying <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> to particular customers. ” Earlier, FERC (1996) wrote in its Order 888, “Because customers that take similar amounts of transmission service may require different amounts <b>of</b> some <b>ancillary</b> <b>services,</b> bundling these services with basic transmission service would result in some customers having to take and pay for more or less <b>of</b> an <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> than they use.

40|$|All {{users of}} an {{electrical}} power system expect that the frequency and voltages are maintained within acceptable boundaries at all times. Some participants, mainly generating units, provide the necessary frequency and voltage control <b>services,</b> called <b>ancillary</b> <b>services.</b> Since these participants are entitled to receive a payment for the services provided, markets for <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> have been developed along with the liberalisation of electricity markets. However, current arrangements vary widely from a power system to another. This thesis provides a comprehensive assessment of markets for frequency and voltage control <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> along three axes: (a) defining the needs for frequency and voltages, as well as specifying the <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> that can fulfil these needs; (b) assessing the cost <b>of</b> <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> for a producer; and (c) discussing the market design of an efficient procurement <b>of</b> <b>ancillary</b> <b>services.</b> Such a comprehensive assessment exhibits several advantages: (a) stakeholders can quickly grasp the issues related to ancillary services; (b) participants benefit from a standardised method to assess their system; (c) solutions are proposed to improve current arrangements; and (d) theoretical limitations that need future work are identified...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the amount}} of wind {{turbines}} in the power system has increased tremendously. As the current wind turbines {{do not participate in}} the provision <b>of</b> <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> such as frequency control and voltage control, this may compromise the proper functioning of the electric power system. However, since the modern wind turbines are equipped with a power-electronic converter, they can assist in the provision <b>of</b> <b>ancillary</b> <b>services.</b> To achieve this, additional control loops have {{to be added to the}} wind turbine controller. In this paper, an overview <b>of</b> the different <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> is given. The ability to provide them with wind turbines is discussed. Since frequency and voltage control are the most important, these two services are further elaborated. It can be concluded that wind turbines are suited to provide frequency control, especially when they are operated slightly below their maximum power point. They can also assist in voltage control, while operation in the maximum power point is usually possible, so few energy is lost. These are important outcomes, since wind turbines which provide <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> can contribute in allowing a higher penetration of renewable energy in the power system without compromising its proper functioning...|$|R

40|$|Due to an {{increasing}} amount of wind turbines {{in the power}} system, which have a volatile power output, the need for flexibility increases. This flexibility {{can be obtained by}} <b>ancillary</b> <b>services.</b> Therefore, the provision <b>of</b> <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> with wind turbines is gaining interest. As they currently do not participate in the frequency control, this might compromise the proper functioning of the power system. The modern turbines are equipped with a power-electronic converter, so they can be used to provide a variety <b>of</b> <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> when the appropriate control strategies are used. In this paper, the provision of active power reserves for frequency control is considered. Three state-of-the-art power control strategies, i. e., constant power control, linear slope control and percentage control are compared to determine their ability to maintain reserves. It is concluded that all the strategies are able to provide reserves, but linear slope control and percentage control perform the best, especially when the wind turbines are aggregated in wind farms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Increased {{penetration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources poses new challenges for the power grid, mostly due to their inherent variability. In the presence of such variability, reliable operation of the grid will require increased amounts <b>of</b> <b>ancillary</b> <b>services.</b> We consider a case where wind generators are the primary energy source with energy storage and spinning re-serves from conventional sources available to provide <b>ancillary</b> <b>services.</b> The problem is formulated as a risk-mitigated optimal power flow (OPF) problem, where the objective is the scheduling of spinning reserves to minimize the cost <b>of</b> <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> and a chance constraint is used as the risk-mitigating factor that compensates for uncertainties in generation and load. This OPF with energy storage dynamics is solved as a finite-horizon optimal control problem that we apply to several case studies using the topology of the IEEE 14 bus benchmark system. We then extend the framework to investigate the optimal distribu-tion of storage capacity across different network topologies. The results of the case studies quantify the need for <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> and suggest a strategy for their scheduling and placement. I...|$|R

The uncertainty of the market clearing procedure is represented by a stochastic model. Thus, the market clearing process is expressed as a stochastic optimization problem in which the expected objective function is minimized, while meeting AC power flow constraints, system reserve requirements and Lost Opportunity Cost (LOC). The model is applied to the IEEE 24 -bus Reliability Test System (IEEE 24 -bus RTS), and simulation studies carried out to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method.
