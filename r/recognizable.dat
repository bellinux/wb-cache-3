5|$|Archaeological {{work had}} failed to find {{artefacts}} and <b>recognizable</b> phytoliths, also the site seemed {{too close to the}} sea – even though the dimensions, layout and orientation approximated published descriptions by both Delahaye and Labillardière.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently <b>recognizable</b> pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately <b>recognizable</b> form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} by many to be one of 50 Cent's best songs, if not his best song, by many fans and is one of his many well known and <b>recognizable</b> songs, even in rap in general.|$|E
5|$|The city of Steelport was {{designed}} {{such that the}} player could identify locations without needing a minimap, with a spatially <b>recognizable</b> skyline and iconic gang vehicles in specific regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoreline}} {{is particularly}} visible at Travertine Point in the Santa Rosa Mountains, where the color {{contrast between the}} dark desert varnish above the shoreline and the travertine below is <b>recognizable</b> from US highway 99.|$|E
5|$|A specific, <b>recognizable</b> {{feature of}} Purkinje neurons is the {{expression}} of calbindin. Calbindin staining of rat brain after unilateral chronic sciatic nerve injury suggests that Purkinje neurons may be newly generated in the adult brain, initiating the organization of new cerebellar lobules.|$|E
5|$|Belgrade has a {{reputation}} for offering a vibrant nightlife; many clubs that are open until dawn can be found throughout the city. The most <b>recognizable</b> nightlife features of Belgrade are the barges (splav), spread {{along the banks of the}} Sava and Danube Rivers.|$|E
5|$|English {{physician}} John Langdon Down {{first described}} Down syndrome in 1862, recognizing it {{as a distinct}} type of mental disability, and again in a more widely published report in 1866. Édouard Séguin described it as separate from cretinism in 1944. By the 20th century, Down syndrome had become the most <b>recognizable</b> form of mental disability.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Sunoco {{was awarded}} the {{franchise}} to operate the filling stations at the Sideling Hill and now-closed Hempfield travel plazas. This led to a bidding war among three of Pennsylvania's most <b>recognizable</b> gasoline brands each time a travel plaza franchise came up for renewal.|$|E
5|$|Martin Glaessner {{proposed}} in The Dawn of Animal Life (1984) that the Ediacaran biota were <b>recognizable</b> crown group members of modern phyla, but were unfamiliar {{because they had}} yet to evolve the characteristic features we use in modern classification.|$|E
5|$|Most tornadoes from supercells {{follow a}} <b>recognizable</b> life cycle. That begins when {{increasing}} rainfall drags with it {{an area of}} quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo Power {{reviewed}} Snake Rattle 'n' Roll {{as part of}} {{an overview}} of NES games which the magazine felt were overlooked or otherwise did not sell well. Their main criticism was that the main characters were not <b>recognizable</b> to anyone, giving the game a lack of visibility amongst consumers. Otherwise, they praised the game for its precise controls and for its blend of puzzle and action elements.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} <b>recognizable</b> {{characteristic}} of Noh stage is its independent roof that hangs over the stage even in indoor theatres. Supported by four columns, the roof symbolizes {{the sanctity of the}} stage, with its architectural design derived from the worship pavilion (haiden) or sacred dance pavilion (kagura-den) of Shinto shrines. The roof also unifies the theatre space and defines the stage as an architectural entity.|$|E
5|$|The Clio Awards is {{an annual}} award program that recognizes {{innovation}} and creative excellence in advertising, design and communication, as judged {{by an international}} panel of advertising professionals. Time magazine described the event as the world's most <b>recognizable</b> international advertising awards. Gaga has received 12 awards.|$|E
5|$|The art {{team also}} spent {{a large amount}} of time on Covenant weaponry, in order to make them {{suitably}} alien yet still <b>recognizable</b> to players. At the same time, the designers wanted all aspects of Covenant technology, especially the vehicles, to act plausibly. Bungie ended up looking at films and other media for inspiration on almost every aspect of the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of an}} American Cocker Spaniel {{makes the}} breed {{immediately}} <b>recognizable,</b> with the rounded dome of the skull, well-pronounced stop, and a square shaped lip. The drop ears are long, low set, with long silky fur, and the eyes are dark, large, and rounded. The nose can be black or brown depending on the colour of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>recognizable</b> {{symptoms}} in Parkinson's disease are movement ("motor") related. Non-motor symptoms, which include autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory (especially altered sense of smell) and sleep difficulties, are also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms {{may be present}} {{at the time of}} diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The painting, one of Matejko's most <b>recognizable</b> {{works and}} one of the best known {{paintings}} in Poland, likely has contributed to the popular image of the battle of Grunwald, and its enduring fame in Polish consciousness. The painting inspired Stanisław Wyspiański, who mentioned it in several of his works.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} {{types of}} {{existing}} bilaterians that lack a <b>recognizable</b> brain, including echinoderms and tunicates. It has not been definitively established whether {{the existence of these}} brainless species indicates that the earliest bilaterians lacked a brain, or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to the disappearance of a previously existing brain structure.|$|E
5|$|This star lies at a vertex of {{a widely}} spaced {{asterism}} called the Summer Triangle, {{which consists of}} Vega plus the two first-magnitude stars Altair, in Aquila, and Deneb in Cygnus. This formation is the approximate shape of a right triangle, with Vega located at its right angle. The Summer Triangle is <b>recognizable</b> in the northern skies for there are few other bright stars in its vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Though not a full cover, {{the song}} Oh! by Girls' Generation on their album Run Devil Run begins with long and <b>recognizable</b> {{section of the}} melody of Shut Up And Drive that is {{repeated}} in the chorus. The Girls' Generation version is faster (144 bpm) and higher (by 1 semitone).|$|E
5|$|While the {{volcanic}} {{history of the}} area extends back far further, the earliest fully <b>recognizable</b> events {{in the region are}} recorded in the pyroclastic Campanario Formation. This sequence appears to begin at Laguna de la Invernada and ranges from 15 to 6mya. Remnants of magma intrusions as young as 7mya {{can be found at the}} lake (Laguna de la Invernada).|$|E
5|$|XTR Energy Company Ltd. has a {{deal with}} Gulf Oil International U.K. Ltd. {{for the rights to}} the retail brand name in Canada. XTR {{provides}} petroleum to roughly 150 independently operated gas stations – many of them in rural areas. The company now wants to move into urban markets with a more <b>recognizable</b> brand.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{immigrants}} were from China. Several hundred Chinese arrived in California in 1849 and 1850, and in 1852 more than 20,000 landed in San Francisco. Their distinctive dress and appearance was highly <b>recognizable</b> in the goldfields. Chinese miners suffered enormously, enduring violent racism from white miners who aimed their frustrations at foreigners. To this day, {{there has been}} no justice for known victims. Further animosity toward the Chinese led to legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and Foreign Miners Tax.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the films}} were not popular with critics, Friday the 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not only for the success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own Friday the 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with Friday the 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most <b>recognizable</b> images in horror and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{debuted in}} the Sonic the Hedgehog manga series created by Kenji Terada in 1992. Her first video-game {{appearance}} was in 1993's Sonic CD {{and she was}} first playable in 1994's Sonic Drift. Amy {{has become one of}} the series' most popular and <b>recognizable</b> characters, appearing in dozens of main-series and spinoff titles, several comic book series, the anime Sonic X, and the computer-animated Sonic Boom. She has received an average response from critics. Although some found her cute and powerful, others criticized her for her voice acting and personality. She has frequently appeared in Sonic merchandise.|$|E
5|$|As {{head of the}} Construction Division of the Quartermaster Corps in 1941, Somervell {{took charge}} of the {{construction}} of a series of camps to house the large numbers of draftees who entering into the Army. Once again, Somervell was able to deliver vital projects on time. The most enduring of these projects was the Pentagon, which is today one of the most <b>recognizable</b> buildings in the world. From 1942 to 1945, Somervell commanded the Army Service Forces, the logistical arm of the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} <b>recognizable</b> {{symbol of the}} best-selling video game series in Japan, the Slime has been {{featured}} prominently in Dragon Quest-related merchandise. It has its own section called 'Smile Slime' on the Square Enix JP shopping website. Slime merchandise includes plush toys, pencil cases, keychains, game controllers, a stylus, and several boardgames including one titled Dragon Quest Slime Racing. In Japan, pork filled steam buns shaped like slimes have been sold. For Dragon Quest's 25th anniversary, special items were sold including business cards, tote bags, and crystal figurines.|$|E
5|$|Bearing a large bony frill {{and three}} horns on its large four-legged body, and {{possessing}} similarities {{with the modern}} rhinoceros, Triceratops {{is one of the}} most <b>recognizable</b> of all dinosaurs and the best known ceratopsid. It shared the landscape with and was probably preyed upon by Tyrannosaurus, though it is less certain that the two did battle in the manner often depicted in traditional museum displays and popular images.|$|E
5|$|Because Poe {{was found}} on the day of an election, it was {{suggested}} as early as 1872 that he was the victim of cooping. This was a ballot-box-stuffing scam in which victims were shanghaied, drugged, and used as a pawn to vote for a political party at multiple locations. Cooping had become the standard explanation for Poe's death in most of his biographies for several decades, though his status in Baltimore may have made him too <b>recognizable</b> for this scam to have worked. More recently, analysis suggesting that Poe's death resulted from rabies has been presented.|$|E
5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily <b>recognizable</b> as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1940, Johnson was {{a member}} of the State Democratic National Committee, serving until 1948. On June 6, 1942, he was named to the board of regents of Eastern State College (now Eastern Kentucky University or EKU), a {{position}} he held for eight years. EKU's Keen Johnson Building, a 1939 Works Progress Administration project, was named in honor of him. The building and its clock tower is one of the most <b>recognizable</b> landmarks on the university's campus.|$|E
5|$|By the Visean (mid-Carboniferous) stage, {{the early}} {{tetrapods}} had radiated into {{at least three}} or four main branches. <b>Recognizable</b> basal-group tetrapods {{are representative of the}} temnospondyls (e.g. Eryops) lepospondyls (e.g. Diplocaulus), anthracosaurs, which were the relatives and ancestors of the Amniota, and possibly the baphetids, which are thought to be related to temnospondyls and whose status as a main branch is yet unresolved. Depending on which authorities one follows, modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) are most probably derived from either temnospondyls or lepospondyls (or possibly both, although this is now a minority position).|$|E
5|$|CNN cited {{a senior}} U.S. {{official}} as saying {{three sets of}} photographs of bin Laden's body exist: Photos taken at an aircraft hangar in Afghanistan, described as the most <b>recognizable</b> and gruesome; photos taken from the burial at sea on the USS Carl Vinson before a shroud was placed around his body; and photos from the raid itself, which include shots of {{the interior of the}} compound as well as three of the others who died in the raid.|$|E
5|$|Columbia's most {{commonly}} <b>recognizable</b> architectural attributes reside downtown {{and within the}} university campuses. Widely used icons of the city are the University of Missouri's Jesse Hall and the neo-gothic Memorial Union. The David R. Francis Quadrangle {{is an example of}} Thomas Jefferson's academic village concept. There are four historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places within the city: Downtown Columbia, the East Campus Neighborhood, Francis Quadrangle, and the North Ninth Street Historic District. The downtown skyline is relatively low and is dominated by the 10-story Tiger Hotel and the 15-story Paquin Tower.|$|E
5|$|During the {{negotiations}} to create OSAS, the airlines quickly {{agreed that they}} would need a common profile and naming style. Referencing Vikings allowed the airline to play on a common history between the Scandinavian countries, while giving a global distinctive and <b>recognizable</b> mark. The aircraft were painted with a livery consisting of a dragon's head, iconic of the Viking longships, in combination with a cheatline which intersected with the windows such as to visualize the shields hung {{on the side of}} the longships.|$|E
