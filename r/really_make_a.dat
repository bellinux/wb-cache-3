On January 7, 2009, Continental partnered with GE Aviation {{to conduct a}} biofuel demonstration flight, making the airline the first U.S. carrier to conduct tests using biofuels. The test bed, a Boeing 737–800 (registered as N76516), ran one of its engines on a mix of 50% kerosene, 6% algae, and 44% jatropha, a weed that bears oil producing seeds. The engine running partly on biofuel burned 46kg less fuel than the conventional engine in 1 {{and a half hours}} while producing more thrust using the same volume of fuel. Continental's CEO, Larry Kellner, commented [...] "This is a good step forward, an opportunity to <b>really</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> difference to the environment" [...] citing jatropha's 50–60% lower CO2 emissions as opposed to Jet-A1 in its lifecycle.|$|E

60|$|Patriotism is {{not merely}} dying for the nation. It is dying with the nation. It is {{regarding}} the fatherland not merely as a real resting-place like an inn, but as a final resting-place, like a house or even a grave. Even the most Jingo of the Jews do not feel like this about their adopted country; and I doubt if the most intelligent of the Jews would pretend that they did. Even if we can bring ourselves to believe that Disraeli lived for England, we cannot {{think that he would}} have died with her. If England had sunk in the Atlantic he would not have sunk with her, but easily floated over to America to stand for the Presidency. Even if we are profoundly convinced that Mr. Beit or Mr. Eckstein had patriotic tears in his eyes when he obtained a gold concession from Queen Victoria, we cannot believe that in her absence he would have refused a similar concession from the German Emperor. When the Jew in France or in England says he is a good patriot he only means that he is a good citizen, and he would put it more truly if he said he was a good exile. Sometimes indeed he is an abominably bad citizen, and a most exasperating and execrable exile, but I am not talking of that side of the case. I am assuming that a man like Disraeli did <b>really</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> romance of England, that a man like Dernburg did <b>really</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> romance of Germany, and it is still true that though it was a romance, they would not have allowed it to be a tragedy. They would have seen that the story had a happy ending, especially for themselves. These Jews would not have died with any Christian nation.|$|E

About once in two months I expect her to reappear, on the same errand, and meanwhile to quite forget my existence. I believe I melted down to the point of telling her that I would find some good, quiet, affectionate husband for her; but she declared, almost with fury, that she was sick unto death of husbands, and begged I would never again mention the word. And, in fact, it was a rash offer; for I am sure {{that there is not a}} man of the kind that might <b>really</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> woman happy but would be afraid to marry mademoiselle. Looked at in that way she is certainly very much to be pitied, and indeed, altogether, though I don't think she either means all she says or, by a great deal, says all that she means.

60|$|THE Rev. Jeffrey Wortle, D.D., {{was a man}} much esteemed by others,--and by himself. He {{combined}} two professions, in both {{of which}} he had been successful,--had been, and continued to be, at the time in which we speak of him. I will introduce him to the reader in the present tense as Rector of Bowick, and proprietor and head-master of the school established in the village of that name. The seminary at Bowick had for some time enjoyed a reputation under him;--not that he had ever himself used so new-fangled and unpalatable a word in speaking of his school. Bowick School had been established by himself as preparatory to Eton. Dr. Wortle had been elected to an assistant-mastership at Eton early in life soon after he had become a Fellow of Exeter. There he had worked successfully for ten years, and had then retired to the living of Bowick. On going there he had determined to occupy his leisure, and if possible to make his fortune, by taking a few boys into his house. By dint of charging high prices and giving good food,--perhaps in part, also, by the quality of the education which he imparted,--his establishment had become popular and had outgrown the capacity of the parsonage. He had been enabled to purchase a field or two close abutting on the glebe gardens, and had there built convenient premises. He now limited his number to thirty boys, for each of which he charged £200 a-year. It was said of him by his friends that if he would only raise his price to £250, he might double the number, and <b>really</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> fortune. In answer to this, he told his friends that he knew his own business best;--he declared that his charge was the only sum that was compatible both with regard to himself and honesty to his customers, and asserted that the labours he endured were already quite heavy enough. In fact, he recommended all those who gave him advice to mind their own business.|$|E
6000|$|By-and-by, {{when the}} time came for Francois to choose a trade, he being then a big lad of about nineteen, it was {{suggested}} to his father that young Millet might <b>really</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> regular painter--that is to say, an artist. In France, the general tastes of the people are far more artistic than with us; and the number of painters who find work for their brushes in Paris is something immensely greater than the number in our own smoky, money-making London. So there was nothing very remarkable, from a French point of view, in the idea of the young peasant turning for a livelihood to the profession of an artist. But Millet's father was a sober and austere man, a person of great dignity and solemnity, who decided to put his son's powers to the test in a very regular and critical fashion. He had often watched Francois drawing, and he thought well of the boy's work. If he had a real talent for painting, a painter he should be; if not, he must take to some other craft, where he would have the chance of making himself a decent livelihood. So he told Francois to prepare a couple of drawings, which he would submit to the judgment of M. Mouchel, a local painter at Cherbourg, the nearest large town, and capital of the department. Francois duly prepared the drawings, and Millet the elder went with his, son to submit them in proper form for M. Mouchel's opinion. Happily, M. Mouchel had judgment enough to see at a glance that the drawings possessed remarkable merit. [...] "You must be playing me a trick," [...] he said; [...] "that lad could never have made these drawings." [...] "I saw him do them with my own eyes," [...] answered the father warmly. [...] "Then," [...] said Mouchel, [...] "all I can say is this: he has in him the making of a great painter." [...] He accepted Millet as his pupil; and the young man set off for Cherbourg accordingly, to study with care and diligence under his new master.|$|E
