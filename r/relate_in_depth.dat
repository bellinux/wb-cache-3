40|$|This paper explores a {{mechanism}} of memory in human brain from a viewpoint of sentence understanding. We {{pointed out the}} following: (1) Some complexity must be incorporated into memory coding {{in order to be}} capable of representing binding in a meaning of a sentence. (2) When temporal coding is used to achieve the complexity, some mechanism is required to arbitrate phases (temporal slots) among memorized items. (3) Considering its implementation, the mechanism is likely to be global, which resembles a sort of structured memory, such as push-down stack. (4) Episodic memory, which is thought to be formed through mammal hippocampus, can be regarded as a phase arbitration mechanism and is possibly <b>related</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> to sentence understanding. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{disruption}} of any critical infrastructural sector {{has the potential}} to create significant direct consequences and cross-sectoral effects {{in a short period of}} time. In this article, we suggest a consequence-, time- and interdependency-based risk assessment approach that seeks to identify which direct consequences and intersectoral effects are likely to emerge in what time frame. We argue that critical infrastructures with the capacity to cause the greatest societal consequences and strongest intersectoral negative effects in the shortest time represent the most risky infrastructures. Such a direct risk assessment was further improved by a network-based risk calculation that takes not only first-order effects into account, but also then-order intersectoral cascading effects. Applying this model to 17 infrastructural subsectors in Slovenia shows that the network transfer of effects among critical infrastructures can considerably and unpredictably change their initially calculated risk. The riskiest subsectors at the maximal level of network effects turned out to be those on which other subsectors heavily directly and indirectly depend: electricity, ICT, road transport and financial instruments. Risk management in the critical infrastructure protection field and <b>related</b> defence <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> should focus its limited resources on those infrastructures with the biggest network-based ris...|$|R
40|$|In the Japanese modern era, the {{experience}} of consumption had changed drastically by the flood of new commodities which had imported from the West and made by newly formed modern industry. This article scrutinizes the transformation of experience of consumption around 1900 s and investigates the characteristics of modern consumer society. Firstly I focus on {{the experience}} of Kankoba, a type of supermarket which was famous in the city from 1880 - 1910. Although Kankoba had been originally built by the government in order to modernize shopping custom, it became recognized as a place of spectacular in the city, like an old typed bazaar, fair booth and small exhibitions which had been actively held in Edo era. In Kankoba, pale imitations of foreign goods and gadgets were accumulated, and middle and lower class in the city enjoyed mainly seeing varieties of such merchandise. In other words, this newly invented shopping place compensated experience of consumption of city residents which didn’t have enough purchasing power yet. However, around 1900 s there had grown middle class family who could purchase industry products and foreign merchandise in everyday life. In order to meet the need of such people and to affirm their lifestyle, department stores developed. Department stores not only sold high quality products, but also elaborated fine advertisement and often held cultural exhibitions, concerts and plays for city residents. That is, department stores functioned as a kind of infrastructure to enrich the cultural life in the city and provided growing middle class families with an ideal leisure place in the city. By scrutinizing the structure of shopping experience in department stores, this paper claims that the transformation to consumption society had started around 1900 s in Japan and that it <b>related</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> to the social formation of middle class lives in cities. The growth of the consumption experience in that era supported the newly formed life style of middle class families who had departed from the large family ”Ie” and compensated their anxieties of their living in cities. This consideration leads to more understanding of the crucial relationships betweenthe growth of consumer society and the historical transformation of lives in cities in Japan...|$|R

Geographical information, particularly as presented on charts, has always been central to the process of delimiting and managing maritime boundaries. More recently modern Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been widely employed for boundary creation, management and dispute resolution. However, the use of GIS raises a number of questions in itself. For instance paper charts can be accessed and interpreted by anyone, whereas information stored in a GIS requires specialised software and skills to view and interpret the data. Other questions that arise include: Who really uses maritime boundaries information and what is the most suitable format for them to access this information? How important are charts as a source of baseline data? How accurately should a Coastal State determine their maritime boundaries? Can a Geographic Information System (GIS) be used to maintain maritime boundaries data? Does this conflict with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea?

Post-fire responses {{depend upon the}} characteristics of the plant species on the site, their susceptibility to fire, and the means by which they recover after fire (DeBano et al. 1998). Many herbaceous and shrub species can regenerate from seed and from rootstock (Lyon and Stickney 1976, Stickney 1986, Anderson and Romme 1991). Lyon and Stickney (1976) found that 86 % of individuals dominant in Pinus contorta stands in the first few years after fire were present before the fire, and 75 % resprouted. Anderson and Romme (1991) found that 67 % of post-fire species survived and that all resprouted after the 1988 Yellowstone fires in Pinus contorta forests.

40|$|Depth {{of field}} (DOF) {{is defined as}} the {{distance}} range within which objects are perceived as sharp. Previous research has focused on blur discrimination in artificial stimuli and natural photographs. The discrimination of DOF, however, has received less attention. Since DOF introduces blur which is <b>related</b> to distance <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> many levels of blur are simultaneously present. As a consequence, it is unclear whether discrimination thresholds for blur are appropriate for predicting discrimination thresholds for DOF. We therefore measured discrimination thresholds for DOF using a two-alternative forced-choice task. Ten participants were asked to observe two images and to select the one with the larger DOF. We manipulated the scale of the scene—that is, the actual <b>depth</b> <b>in</b> the scene. We conducted the experiment under stereoscopic and nonstereoscopic viewing conditions. We found that the threshold for a large DOF (39. 1 mm) was higher than for a small DOF (10. 1 mm), and the thresholds decreased when scale of scene increased. We also found that {{there was no significant difference}} between stereoscopic and nonstereoscopic conditions. We compared our results with thresholds predicted from the literature. We concluded that using blur discrimination thresholds to discriminate DOF may lead to erroneous conclusions because the <b>depth</b> <b>in</b> the scene significantly affects people’s DOF discrimination ability.

With the intention of proposing simplified relationships to evaluate the fundamental period of reinforced concrete buildings, scientists and engineers performed several numerical and experimental campaigns, on different structures all around the world, to calibrate different kind of formulas. Most of formulas retrieved from both numerical and experimental analyses provides vibration periods smaller than those suggested by the Italian seismic code. However, {{it is well known that}} the fundamental period of a structure play a key role in the correct evaluation of the spectral acceleration for seismic static analyses. Generally speaking, simplified approaches impose the use of safety factors greater than those <b>related</b> to <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> nonlinear analyses with the aim to cover possible unexpected uncertainties. Using the simplified formula proposed by the Italian seismic code the fundamental period is quite higher than fundamental periods experimentally evaluated on real structures, with the consequence that the spectral acceleration adopted in the seismic static analysis may be significantly different than real spectral acceleration. This approach could produces a decreasing in safety factors obtained using linear and nonlinear seismic static analyses. Finally, the authors suggest a possible update of the Italian seismic code formula for the simplified estimation of the fundamental period of vibration of existing RC buildings, taking into account both elastic and inelastic structural behaviour and the interaction between structural and non-structural elements...|$|R

However, unmatched features can arise when a binocular object occludes more distant features in one eye but not the other. The presence and extent of such features can provide quantitative depth information, although perceived depth relative to geometrical predictions may vary from one such arrangement to another. The ability of humans to perceive motion <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> from unmatched stimuli has not previously been explored. Here, we use B. Gillam, S. Blackburn, and K.

The changes in canopy area of phreatophytes over time is <b>related</b> to changes <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> to groundwater, distance from a stream or river, and hydrologic soil group. Remote sensing {{was used to determine}} the location of trees with pre-development and post-development aerial photography over the Ogallala Aquifer in the central plains of the United States.

This subsequently limited the extent of phreatophytes to within 700 m of the river. It was also found that phreatophytes have a higher likelihood of growing on hydrologic soil groups with higher saturated hydraulic conductivity. Phreatophytes exist along portions of the Arkansas River corridor where significant decreases in groundwater occurred as long as alluvium exists to create perched conditions where trees survive dry periods. Significant decreases (more that 50 %) in canopy cover exists along river segments where groundwater declined by more than 10 m, indicating areas with good hydraulic connectivity between surface water and groundwater. Thus, interpretation of changes in phreatophyte distribution using historical and recent aerial photography is important in delineating zones of enhanced recharge where aquifers might be effectively recharged through diversion of surface water runoff...|$|R

This allows stereoscopic perception of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> {{to be based on}} either one or both of two different visual signals: inter-ocular velocity differences, and binocular disparity change over time. Disparity change over time can produce the perception of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> However, demonstrating the same for inter-ocular velocity differences has proved elusive because of the difficulty of isolating this cue from disparity change (the inverse can easily be done). No physiological data are available, and existing psychophysical data are inconclusive as to whether inter-ocular velocity differences are used in primate vision. Here, we use motion adaptation to assess the contribution of inter-ocular velocity differences to the perception of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> If inter-ocular velocity differences contribute to motion <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> we would expect that discriminability of direction of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> should be improved after adaptation to frontoparallel motion. This is because an inter-ocular velocity difference is a comparison between two monocular frontoparallel motion signals, and because frontoparallel speed discrimination improves after motion adaptation. We show that adapting to frontoparallel motion does improve both frontoparallel speed discrimination and motion-in-depth direction discrimination. No improvement would be expected if only disparity change over time contributes to motion <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> Furthermore, we found that frontoparallel motion adaptation diminishes discrimination of both speed and direction of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> <b>in</b> dynamic random dot stereograms, in which changing disparity is the only cue available. The results provide strong evidence that inter-ocular velocity differences contribute to the perception of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> and thus that the human visual system contains mechanisms for detecting differences in velocity between the two eyes’ retinal images...|$|R

Or in a hospital, by spatial querying hospital datasets we can ask what the surgery schedule is in that operating room? What medical equipment is installed in that room? How far is it to move from this room to another? Linking spatial data and business data helps to enrich the user experience by fulfilling more user needs, in particular for applications that need to explore detailed local scale data such as in a Zoo, Museum, Hospital, Campus, Business Park, etc. There are normally two types of users for such applications: public users (e. g. visitors to an area) and local users (e. g. staff and students). Access privileges and query levels depend on the user type...|$|R
