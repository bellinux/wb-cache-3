50|$|This clause {{has created}} {{difficulties}} {{for children who}} are born to an Australian parent and a Norwegian parent outside Australia, because Australian nationality law explicitly states that a child born outside Australia does not automatically acquire Australian citizenship at birth, instead the Australian parent must voluntarily <b>register</b> the child's <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> Australian missions abroad in order to confer Australian citizenship to the child. In this case, Norwegian citizenship is automatically lost when the Australian parent <b>registered</b> the child's <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> Australian authorities. This applies even when the child was born on Norwegian soil, and also applies when the other parent is a citizen of a country with a similar nationality law to Australia's, e.g. New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|In other countries, {{such as the}} U.S. and the Ireland, the {{majority}} of teenage mothers are not married to the father of their children. In the UK, half of all teenagers with children are lone parents, 40% are cohabitating as a couple and 10% are married. Teenage parents are frequently in a romantic relationship {{at the time of}} birth, but many adolescent fathers do not stay with the mother and this often disrupts their relationship with the child. U.S. surveys tend to under-report the prevalence of teen fatherhood.In many cases, [...] "teenage father" [...] may be a misnomer. Studies by the Population Reference Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics found that about two-thirds of <b>births</b> <b>to</b> teenage girls in the United States are fathered by adult men aged over 20.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{document}} {{the outcome of}} planned and unplanned births outside hospital. DESIGN: Confidential review of every pregnancy ending in stillbirth or neonatal death in which plans had been made for home delivery, irrespective of where delivery eventually occurred. The review {{was part of a}} sustained collaborative survey of all perinatal deaths. SETTING: Northern Regional Health Authority area. SUBJECTS: All 558, 691 <b>registered</b> <b>births</b> <b>to</b> women normally resident in the former Northern Regional Health Authority area during 1981 - 94. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Perinatal death. RESULTS: The estimated perinatal mortality during 1981 - 94 among women booked for a home birth was 14 deaths in 2888 births. This was less than half that among all women in the region. Only three of the 14 women delivered outside hospital. Independent review suggested that two of the 14 deaths might have been averted by different management. Both births occurred in hospital, and in only one was management before admission of the mother judged inappropriate. Perinatal loss to the 64 women who booked for hospital delivery but delivered outside and to the 67 women who delivered outside hospital without ever making arrangements to receive professional care during labour accounted for the high perinatal mortality (134 deaths in 3466 deliveries) among all births outside hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The perinatal hazard associated with planned home birth in the few women who exercised this option (< 1 %) was low and mostly unavoidable. Health authorities purchasing maternity care need to address the much greater hazard associated with unplanned delivery outside hospital...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of the thesis were to study associations between size at birth, short adult stature and risks of subnormal intellectual performance, high blood pressure, and overweight among males, and to study associations between size at birth, short adult stature and risk of overweight and giving <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> small for gestational age (SGA) infants among females. The effect of short adult stature on intellectual performance among males was analyzed in two population-based cohort studies. Data {{were obtained from the}} Swedish <b>Birth</b> <b>Register</b> which was individually linked to the Swedish Conscript Register. Being born SGA was associated with increased risks of subnormal intellectual performance in all four dimensions included in the test, and lack of catch-up growth leading to short adult stature further increased this risk. If anything, logical performance was found to be most affected. To estimate the risk of high blood pressure in males born SGA we used the <b>Birth</b> <b>Register</b> linked <b>to</b> the Conscript Register. Being born SGA was associated with a slightly increased risk of high systolic blood pressure, and being born light and ending up with short adult stature further increased this risk. Association between short adult stature and overweight was analyzed in both males and females born SGA, in two different studies. In the male cohort data from the <b>Birth</b> <b>Register</b> was linked <b>to</b> the Conscript Register. In females the <b>Birth</b> <b>Register</b> was used twice, when the females were born and when they gave <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> their first child. In both the male and female cohort, there was an increased risk of becoming overweight among those born SGA who also ended up with short adult stature. Finally, an intergeneration study was performed using the <b>Birth</b> <b>Register</b> <b>to</b> analyze associations between being born short for gestational age and giving <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> short infants. Catch-up growth to normal adult stature among women born short-for-gestational age was associated with reduced risk of giving <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> a short-for-gestational age infant. Conclusions. Among males born SGA, short adult stature is associated with increased risk of subnormal intellectual performance, high blood pressure and overweight compared to those with normal adult stature. Similarly, among females born SGA, there is an increased risk of becoming overweight in those with short adult stature, compared with those not short as adult. Females born short for gestational age, with short adult stature are at increased risk of giving <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> a short infant...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the system, it was up to each local {{registrar}} to find out what births, marriages and deaths had taken place in his sub-district.

It has been estimated that in some parts of England up <b>to</b> 15% of <b>births</b> were not <b>registered</b> between 1837 and 1875.
