5|$|Instead {{of solving}} {{for the two}} hyperbolas, Newton {{constructs}} their directrix lines instead. For any hyperbola, the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> distances from a point Z to a focus A and to the directrix is a fixed constant called the eccentricity. The two directrices intersect at a point T, and from their two known distance ratios, Newton constructs a line passing through T on which Z must lie. However, the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a circle {{can be defined as}} the set of points that have a given <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this definition is the basis of bipolar coordinates.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.|$|E

30|$|Effective lateral {{resistance}} of multiple anchorbolt joints was estimated by considering sill thickness or length/diameter <b>ratios</b> <b>of</b> anchor bolts. Load-slip relationships of single anchor bolt joints {{were analyzed by}} the stepwise linear approximation based on the generalized theory of a beam on an elastic foundation and the criterion of “fracture bearing displacement” for several sill thicknesses or length/diameter <b>ratios</b> <b>of</b> anchor bolts. Monte Carlo simulations of the effective {{lateral resistance}} of multiple anchor-bolt joints were conducted using the analyzed load-slip curves of single anchor-bolt joints. Effective resistance <b>ratios</b> <b>of</b> multiple anchor-bolt joints were simulated for some combinations <b>of</b> length/diameter <b>ratios</b> <b>of</b> anchor bolts, lead-hole clearances, and number of anchor bolts. The simulated results are: (1) the influence of lead-hole clearance becomes more apparent as length/diameter <b>ratios</b> <b>of</b> single anchor-bolt joints decrease; (2) there is no obvious effect of number of anchor-bolts over the range of 5 to 15; (3) average effective resistance ratios can be adopted for allowable stress design; and (4) reduction <b>of</b> effective resistance <b>ratios</b> should be considered particularly for small length/diameter <b>ratios</b> <b>of</b> anchor-bolt joints.|$|R
