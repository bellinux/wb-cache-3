40|$|Recently, Buta etal. (2009) {{examined}} the question "Do Bars Drive Spiral Density Waves?", an idea supported by theoretical studies {{and also from}} a preliminary observational analysis Block etal (2004). They estimated maximum bar strengths Q_b, maximum spiral strengths Q_s, and maximum m= 2 arm contrasts A_ 2 s for 23 galaxies with deep AAT K_s-band images. These were combined with previously published Q_b and Q_s values for 147 galaxies from the OSUBSGS sample and with the 12 galaxies from Block etal(2004). Weak correlation between Q_b and Q_s was confirmed for the combined sample, whereas the AAT subset alone showed no significant correlations between Q_b and Q_s, nor between Q_b and A_ 2 s. A similar negative result was obtained in Durbala etal. (2009) for 46 galaxies. Based on these studies, {{the answer to the}} above question remains uncertain. Here we use a novel approach, and show that although the correlation between the maximum bar and spiral parameters is weak, these parameters do correlate when compared locally. For the OSUBSGS sample a statistically significant correlation is found between the local spiral amplitude, and the forcing due to the bar's potential at the same distance, out to 1. 6 <b>bar</b> <b>radii</b> (the typical <b>bar</b> perturbation is then of the order of a few percent).

40|$|We have {{performed}} two-dimensional multicomponent decomposition of 144 local barred spiral galaxies using 3. 6 μm {{images from the}} Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies. Our model fit includes up to four components (bulge, disk, bar, and a point source) and, most importantly, takes into account disk breaks. We find that ignoring the disk break and using a single disk scale length in the model fit for Type II (down-bending) disk galaxies can lead to differences of 40 % in the disk scale length, 10 % in bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T), and 25 % in bar-to-total luminosity ratios. We find that for galaxies with B/T ≥ 0. 1, the break <b>radius</b> to <b>bar</b> <b>radius,</b> r_br/R_bar, varies between 1 and 3, but {{as a function of}} B/T the ratio remains roughly constant. This suggests that in bulge-dominated galaxies the disk break is likely related to the outer Lindblad resonance of the bar and thus moves outward as the bar grows. For galaxies with small bulges, B/T < 0. 1, r_br/R_bar spans a wide range from 1 to 6. This suggests that the mechanism that produces the break in these galaxies may be different from that in galaxies with more massive bulges. Consistent with previous studies, we conclude that disk breaks in galaxies with small bulges may originate from bar resonances that may be also coupled with the spiral arms, or be related to star formation thresholds...|$|R

40|$|We study {{dynamics}} of bars in models of disk galaxies embeded in realistic dark matter halos. We find that disk thickness plays an important, if not dominant, {{role in the}} evolution {{and structure of the}} bars. We also make extensive numerical tests of different N-body codes used to study bar dynamics. Models with thick disks typically used in this type of modeling (height-to-length ratio hz/Rd = 0. 2) produce slowly rotating, and very long, bars. In contrast, more realistic thin disks with the same parameters as in our Galaxy (hz/Rd ≈ 0. 1) produce bars with normal length Rbar ≈ Rd, which rotate quickly with the ratio of the corotation <b>radius</b> to the <b>bar</b> <b>radius</b> R = 1. 2 − 1. 4 compatible with observations. Bars in these models do not show a tendency to slow down, and may lose as little as 2 - 3 percent of their angular momentum due to dynamical friction with the dark matter over cosmological time.

The grain size distribution {{and the number of}} particles located at grain boundaries were determined as a function of time. When particles are present during the nucleation of the grains, most particles are located at grain boundaries and the final mean grain <b>radius</b> (R) over <b>bar</b> (lim) is predicted by (R) over bar (lim) = 1. 28 r/f(a) (0. 50), with r the radius and f(a) the area fraction of the particles. When particles nucleate homogeneously in a polycrystalline system with initial grain <b>radius</b> (R) over <b>bar</b> (0), many particles lie within the grains and the final grain size depends on (R) over bar (0). It was also observed that the peak of the normalized grain size distribution shifts towards smaller grain sizes due to the pinning effect.

Similar to previous numerical simulations of unbarred, multiple-arm spirals, {{we find that}} grand-design spiral arms in barred galaxies are not stationary, but rather dynamic. This means that the amplitudes, pitch angles, and rotational frequencies of the spiral arms are not constant, but change within a few hundred million years (i. e. the typical rotational period of a galaxy). We also find that the clear grand-design spirals in barred galaxies appear it only when the spirals connect with {{the ends of the}} bar. Furthermore, we find that the short-term behaviour of spiral arms in the outer regions ($R>$ 1. 5 [...] 2 <b>bar</b> <b>radius)</b> {{can be explained by the}} swing amplification theory and that the effects of the bar are not negligible in the inner regions ($R<$ 1. 5 [...] 2 <b>bar</b> <b>radius).</b> These results suggest that, although grand-design spiral arms in barred galaxies are affected by the stellar bar, the grand-design spiral arms essentially originate not as bar-driven stationary density waves, but rather as self-excited dynamic patterns. We imply that a rigidly rotating grand-design spiral could not be a reasonable dynamical model for investigating gas flows and cloud formation even in barred spiral galaxies.

40|$|ESO 566 - 24 is an {{extraordinary}} barred galaxy, which has four regularly spaced spiral arms in blue light images. This type of four-armed spiral structure, which is rare among the spiral population, is clearly seen also in near-infrared images, and thus {{is present in the}} old stellar population. We have constructed dynamical models of ESO 566 - 24 {{in order to understand the}} cause of its four-armed structure. The disk gravitational potential is determined from near-infrared photometry, and the gas dynamics is modelled as inelastically colliding particles. The resulting morphology and kinematics with different assumed pattern speeds, disk vertical thicknesses and dark halo contributions is compared with observations. Our models can reproduce the main morphological features of this galaxy: the four-armed spiral, and the inner and nuclear rings. The pattern speed of the bar in this galaxy is such that the corotation resonance is well outside the <b>bar</b> <b>radius,</b> the resonance radius is 1. 6 +/- 0. 3 times the <b>bar</b> <b>radius.</b> The four-armed spiral resides in the region between inner and outer 4 / 1 -resonances. Also, the main kinematical features, including bar-induced deviations from circular rotation, are explained by our models. The best fit is obtained when the dark halo contribution is just enough to make the modelled rotation curve match the observed one. This ``minimum halo'' is rather moderate: luminous matter dominates the rotation curve within the disk region.

We build a dynamical model for the gravitational potential by applying the analytic solution to the equations of motion, within the epicyclic approximation. Our model reproduces all the significant kinematic and structural signatures of this galaxy. We find that the primary bar is 7. 9 +/- 0. 6 kpc long and has a pattern speed of 36 +/- 2 km s^- 1 kpc^- 1. This places the corotation radius at 8. 6 +/- 0. 5 kpc, the outer Lindblad resonance at 14. 9 +/- 0. 9 kpc and two inner Lindblad resonances at 60 +/- 5 pc and 2. 9 +/- 0. 1 kpc.
