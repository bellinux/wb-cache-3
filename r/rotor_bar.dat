A rotor-bar model {{is derived from the}} electromagnetic theory. A leakage inductance of the corrosion {{model of a}} <b>rotor</b> <b>bar</b> is calculated from the relations of magnetic energy, inductance, current, and magnetic-field intensity by Ampere's law. The leakage inductance and resistance of a <b>rotor</b> <b>bar</b> varies when the <b>rotor</b> <b>bar</b> rusts. In addition, the skin effect is considered to establish the practical model of a <b>rotor</b> <b>bar.</b> Consequently, the variation of resistance and leakage inductance has an effect on the results of motor dynamic simulations and experiments, since a corrosive <b>rotor</b> <b>bar</b> is one model of a <b>rotor</b> <b>bar</b> in fault progress. The results of simulations and experiments are shown to be in good agreement with the spectral analysis of stator-current harmonics. From the proposed corrosion model, motor current signature analysis can detect the fault of a corrosive <b>rotor</b> <b>bar</b> as the progress of a rotor-bar fault. Computer simulations were achieved using the MATLAB Simulink with an electrical model of a 3. 7 -kW, three-phase, and squirrel-cage induction motor.
