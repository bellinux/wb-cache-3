500|$|McKinley soothed <b>ruffled</b> <b>feathers</b> {{of party}} bigwigs by mail and in person. Though former {{president}} Harrison refused to tour, {{he gave a}} speech in New York where he railed against free silver, stating, [...] "the first dirty errand that a dirty dollar does is to cheat the workingman". The public was closely following the campaign, and the Republican efforts had their effect. In September, polls showed the midwestern states leaning Republican, though silver-supporting Iowa was still close. McKinley's running mate, Hobart, continued to look after his law practice and business interests, and was apparently {{a major contributor to}} the Republican campaign. He helped to run the New York office, gave some speeches from his own front porch in Paterson, and in October went on a short campaign tour of New Jersey, though he was a reluctant public speaker. Hobart was much stronger for the gold standard than was McKinley, and made clear his views in his speeches.|$|E

2500|$|These {{educational}} successes aside, Hewett's {{appointment at}} the School <b>ruffled</b> <b>feathers</b> among {{the old school}} of American archaeology, which was largely centered on the East Coast and took a decidedly condescending stance toward the [...] "amateur" [...] Hewett, Alice Fletcher's backing notwithstanding. One of his most vocal critics was Franz Boas, who had started the first archaeology PhD program in the United States at Columbia University in New York. Boas {{and several of his}} colleagues wanted to control the School and the education it afforded its students, and to have the [...] "incompetent" [...] Hewett sacked. Local pressures sufficed to keep him in the job, and eventually Boas and colleagues were placated through formation of a similar institute in Mexico City.|$|E

5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They <b>ruffle</b> <b>feathers</b> to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|R
50|$|Do-kyung's unflappability is put to {{the test}} when she meets rash National Intelligence Service agent Kim Ji-sung (Lee Jung-jae).

After being stationed at the airport, he encounters doctor Seo Myung-woo (Moon Jung-hee), his ex-girlfriend who is now working at the airport clinic, with whom he parted on painful terms.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to promoting democracy, Lai's publication often <b>ruffle</b> <b>feathers</b> of fellow Hong Kong tycoons by exposing their personal foibles and relations with local government.

Lai managed to list the company in 1999 by acquiring Paramount Publishing Group in October of that year.|$|R
60|$|As {{he thought}} this, Tommy {{smoothed}} the <b>ruffled</b> <b>feathers</b> {{of the dead}} thrush, and, making a little grave under the pine, buried it wrapped in green leaves, and left it there where its mate could sing over it, and no rude hands disturb its rest.|$|E
60|$|Having vented their valor in this fierce effervescence, the Bannack braves {{gradually}} calmed down, {{lowered their}} crests, smoothed their <b>ruffled</b> <b>feathers,</b> and betook themselves to sleep, without placing a single guard over their camp; so that, had the Blackfeet taken {{them at their}} word, but few of these braggart heroes might have survived for any further boasting.|$|E

60|$|Poor Gulliver struggled, pecked and screamed; {{but little}} Dora held him fast, and shut {{him in a}} basket till they reached the shore. Then she {{put him in a}} lobster pot,--a large wooden thing, {{something}} like a cage,--and left him on the lawn, where he could catch glimpses of the sea, and watch the light-house tower, as he sat alone in this dreadful prison. If Dora had known the truth, she would have let him go, and done her best to help him; but she could not understand his speech, as Davy did, for very few people have the power of talking with birds, beasts, insects, and plants. To her, his prayers and cries were only harsh screams; and, when he sat silent, with drooping head and <b>ruffled</b> <b>feathers,</b> she thought he was sleepy: but he was mourning for Davy, and wondering what his little friend would do.|$|E
60|$|Ronda is set deep {{among the}} {{mountains}} between Algeciras and Seville; they hem it in on all sides, and it straggles {{up and down}} little hills, timidly, as though its presence were an affront to the wild rocks around it. The houses are huddled against the churches, which look like portly hens squatting with <b>ruffled</b> <b>feathers,</b> while their chicks, for warmth, press up against them. It is very cold in Ronda. I saw it first quite early: over the town hung a grey mist shining in the sunlight, and the mountains, opalescent in the morning glow, were so luminous that they seemed hardly solid; they looked as if one could walk through them. The people, covering their mouths in dread of a pulmonia, hastened by, closely muffled in long cloaks. As I passed the open doors I saw them standing round the brasero, warming themselves; for fireplaces are unknown to Andalusia, {{the only means of}} heat being the copa, a round brass dish in which is placed burning charcoal.|$|E

6000|$|Tu-Kila-Kila, with an effort, {{tried to}} hide in his robe his wounded finger. But the Frenchman caught at {{the meaning of the}} whole scene at once, and {{interposed}} himself hastily between the parrot and its assailant. [...] "Hé! my Methuselah," [...] he cried, in French, stroking the exultant bird with his hand, and smoothing its <b>ruffled</b> <b>feathers,</b> [...] "did he try to choke you, then? Did he try to get over you? That was a brave bird! You did well, mon ami, to bite him!... No, no, Life of the World, and Measurer of the Sun's Course," [...] he went on, in Polynesian, [...] "you shall not go near him. Keep your distance, I beg of you. You may be a high god--though you were a scurvy wretch enough, don't you recollect, when you were only Lavita, the son of Sami--but I know your tricks. Hands off from my birds, say I. A curse is on the head of the Soul of dead parrots. You tried to hurt him, and see how the curse has worked itself out! The blood of the great god, the Pillar of Heaven, has stained the gray dust of the island of Boupari." ...|$|E

All Japanese characters are portrayed badly." [...] Later it was reported that these types of reviews surprised the author. The Chicago Sun-Times wrote [...] "he knew Rising Sun would <b>ruffle</b> <b>feathers,</b> the vehemence of the reaction came as a surprise. Challenges to his economic premise - that the United States is selling its future to Japan - failed to materialize. Instead, he recalls with obvious annoyance, American critics labelled him racist." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{origin of}} the term partlet (attested from 1515) is uncertain, but it may derive from Dame Partlet, a {{traditional}} name for a hen, perhaps {{in reference to the}} <b>ruffle</b> of <b>feathers</b> on some hens' necks. For similar garments, see guimpe and chemisette.|$|R
