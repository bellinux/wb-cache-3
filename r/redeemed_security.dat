50|$|The spens clause protects lenders or {{investors in}} {{securities}} in two related ways - by requiring {{the payment of}} a make whole payment it makes calling unattractive to a borrower and hence less likely (since it might prove too expensive to <b>redeem</b> the <b>security),</b> but if the borrower does proceed with calling the bond, the lender receives compensation {{in the form of}} the make whole payment.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of this agreement, a pre-tax charge of $45 million was {{recorded}} in the quarter ending June 30, 2011.

50|$|Adoption of the Constitution {{meant the}} {{elimination}} {{of many of the}} economic ills under which industry and commerce had struggled since the war. A reorganization was essential and the immediate economic results were salutary. Its most important additions to the power of Congress were those relating to finance and commerce: it enabled the federal government to levy taxes, regulate trade, coin money, protect industry, and direct the settlement of the West, and, as later events proved, to establish credit and <b>redeem</b> its <b>securities.</b> Under it, freedom of trade was insured throughout the young republic.|$|R
50|$|The {{trust funds}} run {{surpluses}} {{in that the}} amount paid in by current workers {{is more than the}} amount paid out to current beneficiaries. These surpluses are given to the U.S. Treasury (and thus become part of the general federal budget) in exchange for special U.S. government securities, which are deposited into the trust funds. If the trust funds begin running deficits, meaning more in benefits are paid out than contributions paid in, the Social Security Administration is empowered to <b>redeem</b> the <b>securities</b> and use those funds to cover the deficit.|$|R

25|$|The Federal Reserve {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the U.S. payments system. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and <b>redeeming</b> U.S. government <b>securities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Budget deficit ballooned and {{inflation}} was developing {{coming out of}} control. The government struggled to cut expenditure, {{and as a result}} often came into conflict with the Sejm. However, the government could not allow hyperinflation to reoccur.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} pricing of knock-in reverse {{exchangeable}} securities (RES). They are securities that are initially issued as straight bonds paying regular coupons. During {{the life of}} the securities, if prices of underlying stocks hit pre-determined triggers, the securities will be knocked in, which gives issuers options at maturity date to either <b>redeem</b> the <b>securities</b> in cash, or to deliver a per-specified number of shares. In this paper, the payoffs of RES are initially replicated with bonds and options, and then building block approach is used to value each compon ent. It is thereby possible to estimate theoretically "fair" terms of issuance, and contrast these with effective terms. A significant overpricing of 5. 48 % is found if knock-in features are artificially removed, but if the features are added back, an underpricing of - 1. 98 % is observed, which shows that the knock-in feature of the securities is significantly undervalued by issuers...|$|R
50|$|If {{the debt}} ceiling is not raised and {{extraordinary}} measures are exhausted, the United States government is legally unable {{to borrow money}} to pay its financial obligations. At that point, it must cease making payments unless the treasury has cash on hand to cover them. In addition, the government {{would not have the}} resources to pay the interest on (and sometime <b>redeem)</b> government <b>securities</b> when due, which would be characterized as a default. A default may affect the United States' sovereign risk rating and the interest rate that it will be required to pay on future debt. The United States has never defaulted on its financial obligations, but the periodic crises relating to the debt ceiling has led to a rating downgrade by several rating agencies and a warning by others. The GAO estimated that the delay in raising the debt ceiling during the debt ceiling crisis of 2011 raised borrowing costs for the government by $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011 and noted that the delay would also raise costs in later years. The Bipartisan Policy Center extended the GAO's estimates and found that the delay raised borrowing costs by $18.9 billion over ten years.|$|R

As part of these audits, we performed {{a review of the}} general and application computer controls over key financial systems maintained and operated by the Federal Reserve Banks (FRB) on behalf of the Department of the Treasury's BPD. Many of the FRBs perform fiscal agent services on behalf of the U. S. government, including BPD. The debt-related services primarily consist of issuing, servicing, and <b>redeeming</b> Treasury <b>securities</b> and processing secondary market securities transfers. In fiscal year 2003, the FRBs issued about $ 4. 1 trillion in federal debt securities to the public, redeemed about $ 3. 8 trillion of debt held by the public, and processed about $ 125 billion in interest payments on debt held by the public. FRBs maintain and operate key financial applications on behalf of BPD and an array of financial and information systems to process and reconcile monies disbursed and collected on behalf of BPD. ...|$|R
25|$|In {{its role}} as the central bank of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and {{efficiency}} of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the U.S. Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and <b>redeems</b> U.S. government <b>securities</b> such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's coin and paper currency. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. During the Fiscal Year 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note.|$|R
5000|$|The capital {{assessment}} {{is intended to}} capture all aspects of a financial institution’s business that would be impacted under the baseline and more adverse scenarios. [...] Supervisors will carefully evaluate the forecasts submitted by each financial institution to ensure they are appropriate, consistent with the firm’s underlying portfolio performance and reflective of each entity’s particular business activities and risk profile. The assessment of the firm’s capital {{and the size of}} any potential needed additions to capital will be determined by the supervisors. [...] The assessment of capital adequacy considers many factors including: the inherent risks of the institution’s exposures and business activities, the quality of its balance sheet assets and its off-balance-sheet commitments, the firm’s earning projections, expectations regarding economic conditions and the composition and quality of its capital. Specific factors supervisors consider include: uncertainty about the potential impact on earnings and capital from current and prospective economic conditions; asset quality and concentrations of credit exposures; the potential for unanticipated losses and declines in asset values; off‐balance sheet and contingent liabilities (e.g., implicit and explicit liquidity and credit commitments); the composition, level and quality of capital; the ability of the institution to raise additional common stock and other forms of capital in the market; and other risks that are not fully captured in regulatory capital calculations. Under current rules for bank holding companies, supervisors expect bank holding companies to hold capital above minimum regulatory capital levels, commensurate with the level and nature of the risks to which they are exposed. That amount of capital held in excess of minimum capital requirements should be commensurate with their firm‐specific risk profiles, and account for all material risks. The assessment of capital under the two macroeconomic scenarios being used in the capital assessment program will permit supervisors to ascertain whether the buffer over the regulatory capital minimum is appropriate under more severe but plausible scenarios. [...] An institution that requires additional capital will enter into a commitment to issue a CAP convertible preferred security to the U.S. Treasury in an amount sufficient to meet the capital requirement determined through the supervisory assessment. Each institution will be permitted up to six months to raise private capital in public markets to meet this requirement and would be able to cancel the capital commitment without penalty. The CAP convertible preferred securities will be converted into common equity shares on an as‐needed basis. Financial institutions that issued preferred capital under Treasury’s existing Capital Purchase Program (TARP 1) will have the option of <b>redeeming</b> those <b>securities</b> and replacing them with the new CAP convertible preferred securities. [...] The capital {{assessment is}} part of the supervisory process and thus subject to the same framework used for bank examinations or bank holding company inspections. There will be ample opportunity for discussions between the financial institutions and supervisory agencies regarding the loss estimates and earnings forecasts during the capital assessment process.|$|R
40|$|The capital {{maintenance}} rules {{stem from the}} English company law and were primarily aimed at protecting the rights of a company’s creditors. Before {{the introduction of the}} Companies Amendment Act 37 of 1998, a company was prohibited from purchasing its own shares. After this legislation was passed, a company was able to do so, provided that it satisfied the solvency and liquidity test and also complied with the new statutory provisions set out by sections 85 to 89 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973. Section 48 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 now regulates the acquisition by a company of its own shares, as well as the acquisition of shares in its holding company by a subsidiary company. The above actions also fall under the ambit of a “distribution” as defined in the Act and therefore need to satisfy the requirements of section 46 of the Act as well. Unlike its predecessor, the provisions in the new Act are very broad and devoid of guidelines. The emphasis is placed on companies satisfying the principles of solvency and liquidity. Non-adherence to these provisions gives rise to the personal liability of the company’s directors. The provisions of section 48 do not apply where a dissenting shareholder exercises his appraisal rights in terms of section 164 of the new Act, or where a company <b>redeems</b> redeemable <b>securities.</b> These exceptions do, however, still amount to “distributions” and will accordingly need to satisfy the requirements contained in section 46 of the Act. Redeemable securities were initially not exempted from the provisions of section 48. This would potentially have given rise to a situation where a company could approach a court in terms of section 48 (6) to reverse a redemption of its securities. It would have had dire consequences for financing by way of redeemable securities. In terms of the Companies Amendment Act 3 of 2011 redeemable securities are now specifically exempted from the provisions of section 48. In terms of the new Act a subsidiary company is allowed to purchase shares in its holding company to a maximum of 10 % in the aggregate of the issued shares of any share class, provided that no voting rights attached to such shares may be exercised. The new Act fails to properly address some of the issues regarding the “round-tripping” of dividends and the declaration of a dividend in specie that were already identified as far back as 2001. Where the consideration for a repurchase constitutes a “dividend” as defined in the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, the company will be liable to pay secondary tax on companies in respect thereof. If a distribution does not constitute a dividend, capital gains tax is payable with regard to it. Share repurchases are allowed in terms of Canadian corporate law after the legislative reform which occurred in that country during the 1970 ’s. The Canadian Business Corporations Act contains provisions that bear a striking resemblance to the provisions of the new Act adopted in South Africa. Whilst the basis and rationale behind the new corporate legislation cannot be faulted, a host of issues and concerns still remain. The unfortunate consequence is that the new Act lacks transparency and is fraught with clumsy errors. CopyrightDissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012. Mercantile Lawunrestricte...|$|R
5000|$|Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress {{gave the}} Federal Reserve {{statutory}} {{authority to pay}} interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on banks' reserves, the Federal Reserve {{will be able to}} put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer-term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally....As an additional means of draining reserves, the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits, which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers. A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register, and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received. After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board, we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter. The use of reverse repos and the deposit facility would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} of reserves from the banking system quite quickly, should it choose to do so.When these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system, they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities; the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet remain unchanged. If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of <b>redeeming</b> or selling <b>securities.</b> The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. In any case, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.In sum, in response to severe threats to our economy, the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses. As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved, these programs have been terminated or are being phased out. The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large-scale purchases of securities. The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies. However, we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse, at the appropriate time, the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus. We have full confidence that, when the time comes, we will be ready to do so.|$|R
