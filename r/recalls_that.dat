5|$|A {{number of}} white jazz musicians {{regularly}} {{performed at the}} club alongside blacks. Jazz guitarist Pat Martino <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> he began playing at the club as a teenager (in the late 1950s), and would often play until 4am in the morning. After the clubs closed he would then join guitarists such as Wes Montgomery and Grant Green for breakfast.|$|E
5|$|Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis {{wrote the}} scripts for Blackadder episodes {{separately}} using word processors and then swapped the disks containing the scripts {{for each other}} to add or remove jokes and dialogue. Curtis <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> they stuck to a policy whereby if one removed a line for not being funny, then it was never put back.|$|E
5|$|As he grew older, Sadler {{generally}} {{remained in}} good health, {{with the exception}} of a condition that led to the removal of an eye. He died on April 26, 1969, at 93 years of age. Christensen <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> Sadler was visited by friends and family while on his deathbed; he spoke to them of his confidence in a joyful life after death. He received a full-column obituary in the Chicago Tribune, which discussed his success as a doctor but not his association with The Urantia Book.|$|E

5|$|By {{the rules}} of war of the period, the victor possessed {{absolute}} rights over the vanquished, whether they were soldiers or not. Enslavement, while not systematic, was common practice. Thucydides <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> 7,000 inhabitants of Hyccara in Sicily were taken prisoner by Nicias and sold for 120 talents in the neighbouring village of Catania. Likewise in 348 BC the population of Olynthus was reduced to slavery, as was that of Thebes in 335 BC by Alexander the Great and that of Mantineia by the Achaean League.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{discussed}} the song at length in a 1987 interview for Musician magazine, {{during which he}} <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> his mother developed a brain tumour late in 1969 but then recovered for seven months. After hearing of the initial diagnosis in September 1969, Harrison cancelled a recording session with Apple Records artist Jackie Lomax to see her; author Peter Doggett comments that, because {{of the severity of}} this news, Harrison would later have no recollection of how he heard of John Lennon's decision to leave the Beatles, on 20 September.|$|E
5|$|In 82 Agricola crossed an {{unidentified}} {{body of water}} and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then. He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few auxiliaries. He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest never happened, but some historians believe that the crossing referred to {{was in fact a}} small-scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Mirzoeff <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> A Passion for Churches {{created a}} minor {{internal}} disagreement at the BBC since the film, {{produced by the}} General Features Department, discussed a subject {{considered to be the}} territory of the Religious Broadcasting Department. The head of the department insisted on a screening, but was placated by the presence of the poet and Prime Minister Harold Wilson's wife, Mary, at a private showing held in November 1974, and he gave the film his approval.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell's tour {{in support}} of her {{critically}} acclaimed Court and Spark album arrived in London in April 1974. While backstage at her and Scott's show at the New Victoria Theatre, Harrison invited the {{five members of the}} L.A. Express to come out to his Oxfordshire home, Friar Park, the following day. Bennett <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> they arrived by limousine and he mistook the property's grand gatehouse for the main residence.|$|E
5|$|Moran {{finished}} {{his career with}} the Bulldogs, retiring after the NHA's last season. He played four more seasons, during which he played 69games, winning 34 of them. Over his career, Moran's teams often had losing records, or they had a winning percentage barely over 50%. Some hockey legends often <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> he was the best goaltender of them all. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1958, with the help of Senator Chubby Power, once a teammate. He is still the earliest goaltender in HHOF, starting his senior hockey venture in 1901.|$|E

5|$|Pile and her co-writers {{initially}} used {{battery packs}} to represent characters, moving them around {{on her desk}} to develop scenarios for the show. The decision to make the characters doctors came later. Pile <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> she mentioned to Peter Fincham that a hospital setting would work well and that he subsequently reported that Channel 4 were enthusiastic about a hospital location, which settled the matter. Even later still, a plot was developed and wall charts were used to mark up story arcs.|$|E
5|$|She {{also claims}} Jake holds {{the secret to}} the aliens' {{whereabouts}} and argues that they must defeat the aliens before the invaders exterminate all life on earth. After taking medicine offered by the Apaches' medicine man, Jake <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> Alice was euthanized after she was used in an alien experiment, but he had escaped, inadvertently stealing the gauntlet-like alien weapon encasing his wrist. He then also remembers {{the location of the}} aliens' base of operations.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise, {{along with}} other ships in the sector, {{experience}} a localized time-distortion, and soon after receive a distress-call from Dr. Paul Manheim in a nearby system. Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> Manheim was ejected from the Federation Science Institute for conducting unauthorized experiments. They find the distress signal coming from a facility on a planetoid surrounded by a force-field. When they {{make contact with the}} facility, a woman requests help to save her husband, Dr. Manheim, and lowers the shields.|$|E

5|$|The {{appearance}} of the Space Exploration Center's Inquiry Room was influenced by Sylvia Anderson, who {{in her role as}} producer supervised design aspects and wanted the light-blue uniforms of the SEC officials to be vividly contrasted with a tangerine and black duotone backdrop. Director David Lane <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> the Inquiry Room scene depicted a panel made up of 20 puppets, an achievement which {{would not have been possible}} in one of the Thunderbirds television episodes due to the smaller budget.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} through {{a network of}} caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis. They are greeted by Kida who resembles a young woman and discover that the Atlantean language {{is the basis of}} many existing languages. Kida enlists Milo's aid in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> a page is missing.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E

5|$|Kim's {{associates}} {{characterize the}} director as an eccentric individual. Tokyo International Film Festival programming director Kenji Ishizaka <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> Kim's way {{of writing a}} screenplay was {{to walk away from}} home for three months. He would shut himself up in a cheap hotel, listen to neighborhood gossip, and write all night in the dark. South Korean film critic Lee Young-il remembers that Kim's shoes were never shined, and that one of his few material pleasures was high-quality coffee. Kim Ki-young's unconventional and nonconformist nature also prevented him from participating in South Korea's mainstream film industry. The only official title he held within the film community was member of The National Academy of Arts, which he joined in 1997, and he did not cultivate friendships with journalists who could further his career.|$|E
5|$|Schwimmer {{was born}} in Flushing, Queens, New York City, to {{attorneys}} Arthur and Arlene Coleman-Schwimmer. He has an older sister named Ellie (born 1965). His family subsequently moved to Los Angeles, where Schwimmer had his first experiences of acting {{at the age of}} 10 when he was cast as the fairy godmother in a Jewish version of Cinderella. In 1979, Schwimmer went to a Shakespeare workshop given by English actor Ian McKellen in Los Angeles. He <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> he was riveted by the experience. Schwimmer then entered a contest in the Southern California Shakespeare Festival three years in a row, winning two first prizes.|$|E
5|$|Shuu admits {{defeat and}} offers {{to lead them}} out of the school through a safe passage, but Kazuaki pulls out a gun and shoots him as the group prepares to escape. Shuu then <b>recalls</b> <b>that</b> Nageki's only relative—his adoptive brother—was, like Kazuaki, a quail. The {{terrorist}} incident occurred at Kazuaki and Nageki's orphanage and left them as the only survivors; witnessing Nageki's subsequent suicide drove Kazuaki insane, leading him to fake his own death, assume a new identity, and join the school's faculty to take revenge against Shuu, the head of Operation Hatoful. Ryouta, channeling Nageki, eases Kazuaki's guilt and convinces him to move on.|$|E
