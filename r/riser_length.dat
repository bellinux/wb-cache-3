40|$|The {{presented}} work {{studied the}} vortex-induced motion (VIM) response of a free-standing riser (FSR) with varied <b>riser</b> <b>length</b> and buoyancy can (BC) mass with an ultimate aim {{to find a}} combination that would reduce {{the motion of the}} system. Specifically, four model configurations were experimentally tested in a flume tank over a range of flow velocities, with the BC motion recorded by a submersible camera positioned directly above the model; consequently, inline (IL) and crossflow (CF) amplitudes were estimated with a motion tracking software. In the pre-resonant flow regime, non-dimensionally, minimal differences were observed between the CF amplitudes, and the IL motion was reduced with a longer riser. Given the extreme length of full-scale FSRs and inherent low natural frequency, it is impractical to increase the riser tension to a point where VIM would not occur under normal environmental conditions. Alternatively, increasing the mass ratio of the BC so that it is above the critical mass ratio of 0. 54 (the ratio of the mass of the body to the mass of the fluid) would limit the resonant flow velocities to a finite range, but a larger BC may not be an economically viable solution, and because of the increased diameter, it would experience a larger CF amplitude during resonance.

This thesis will examine a method called BOP sailing, which may expedite the process of moving {{a drilling}} rig and its subsea equipment from one location to another. It will also {{make sure that the}} BOP sailing method is feasible from a safety and design point of view. The BOP sailing operation is modelled and simulated in the riser analysis software RIFLEX for three riser column lengths: 	 311 m 	 800 m 	 1225 m The riser joints for each of the <b>riser</b> column <b>length</b> have the same diameters and submerged weight per unit length. Weather conditions, current profiles and sailing speeds were defined prior to running the simulations. The results obtained from RIFLEX is then further analyzed by calculating a usage factor, n, based on the combined loading equation from the DNV-OS-F 201 standard. This equation is used to perform riser analysis using tension and bending moments, and the value of the calculated usage factor may not exceed a critical value. The usage factor is calculated at two locations on each of the riser columns for all of the weather conditions. One of the locations is located {{at the top of the}} riser column where the riser column is attached to the drilling vessel.

Analytical solutions to the equations are presented for the systems air-water at atmospheric pressure and saturated steam-water. Numerical simulations are performed for {{a large number of}} input data. Calculated drop trajectories indicate that the drops travel {{only a small part of}} the <b>riser</b> tube <b>length</b> before they are deflected to the frontside of the riser tube. For the system air-water the drop radial velocity when hitting the tube does not exceed 50 % of the gas velocity, while with the system steam-water the radial velocity can be up to 90 % of the gas velocity. The azimuthal drop velocities are in the range 2 - 10 m/s. The condensate slip relative to the cylinder results in an initial backward motion of the drops before they are accelerated to the frontside. Thus, part of the drops will hit the backside wall resulting, in the formation of a liquid film. This film will also be subjected to the coriolis force resulting in a liquid redistribution to the frontside wall.

40|$|Realistic {{predictions}} of service life of steel catenary risers (SCR) require an accurate characterization of seafloor stiffness {{in the zone}} where the riser contacts the seafloor, the so- called touchdown area (TDA). This paper describes the key features of a seafloor-riser interaction model based on the previous experimental model tests. The seafloor is represented in terms of non-linear load-deflection (P-y) relationships, which are also able to account for soil stiffness degradation due to vertical cyclic loading. The P-y approach has some limitations, but simulations show good agreement with experimental data. Hence, stiffness degradation and rate effects during penetration and uplift motion (suction force increase) of the riser are well captured through comparison with previous experimental tests carried out at the Centre for Offshore Foundation Systems (COFS) and Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI). The analytical framework considers the riser-seafloor interaction problem {{in terms of a}} pipe resting on a bed of springs, and requires the iterative solution of a fourth-order ordinary differential equation. A series of simulations is used to illustrate the capabilities of the model. Due to the non-linear soil springs with stiffness degradation it is possible to simulate the trench formation process and estimate deflections and moments along the <b>riser</b> <b>length.</b> The seabed model is used to perform parametric studies to assess the effects of stiffness, soil strength, amplitude of pipe displacements, and riser tension on pipe deflections and bending stresses.

30|$|The risers are {{generally}} connected {{at right angles}} to the manifold, thus forming a tee joint at each connection which leads to local disturbances. A varying local pressure drop for a flow through such a manifold results in an uneven flow distribution through the whole collector. Wang and Yu[5] developed a numerical model to calculate the isothermal flow distribution using mass and momentum equations at each branch of the header system. Wang and Wu[6] proposed a discrete numerical model and demonstrated the flow and temperature distribution in a flat-plate solar collector for U- and Z-configurations by taking into account the effects of buoyancy and longitudinal heat conduction. Jones and Lior[7] developed a discrete hydrodynamic model, and the resulting nonlinear algebraic equations were solved numerically. For negligible buoyancy effects, they investigated the effects of geometrical parameters of the collector such as the ratio of riser to manifold diameter, number of <b>risers,</b> and <b>length</b> of <b>risers</b> on the flow nonuniformity. Fan et al.[4] carried out CFD calculations to estimate the flow and temperature distribution in a flat-plate solar collector consisting of 16 risers connected in U-configuration, having a tilt of 40 °. The influences of flow rate, fluid properties, collector tilt, and collector inlet fluid temperature were investigated. Later, for the same collector, Fan and Furbo[8] studied the buoyancy effects on fluid and temperature distribution by means of CFD calculations. They found that at a certain low flow rate, buoyancy effects are of the same order as the pressure drop in the risers or even larger, which results in a more nonuniform flow distribution. The pattern of flow distribution reverses as compared to the case of high flow rate (25 l/min) with negligible buoyancy effects. Glembin et al.[2] experimentally investigated the flow distribution in a horizontally placed coaxial vacuum tube solar collector consisting of 60 parallel vacuum tubes connected in U-configuration. They adopted a procedure where flow distribution was calculated from the measured tube outlet temperatures for a range of inlet temperatures and mass flow rates.|$|R

No thermal effects, such as buoyancy, are taken into account. A discrete hydrodynamic model was developed for this system, and the resulting set of simultaneous nonlinear algebraic equations was solved numerically for 54 different combinations of the major independent variables. Quantitative flow distribution results are presented. In the investigated range, it was determined that the three parameters which have the major influence on flow distribution are, in the order of significance, the ratio of riser diameter to manifold diameter, the number of <b>risers,</b> and the <b>length</b> of the <b>risers,</b> with maldistribution increasing with the increase of the first two and with the decrease of the third one.

40|$|Oil and gas {{exploration}} and production activities in deep and ultra deep waters in hostile environments necessitates {{the need to develop}} innovative riser systems capable of ensuring transfer of fluids from the seabed to a floating vessel and vice versa, with little or no issues with respect to influences of environmental loads and vessel motions. Over the years, {{studies have shown that the}} conventional flexible riser and steel catenary riser configurations cannot function effectively under such environmental and vessel motion influences as a result of issues such as collapse (predominant in flexible risers when used in deep waters), and fatigue (predominant in steel catenary risers). Nevertheless, a riser system known as the hybrid riser which is a combination of a vertical rigid riser and a flexible riser has been used effectively under these seeming adverse conditions and has been found effective. However, it is regarded as an expensive option considering the cost of its components, in addition to its limitation in terms of step-out distance between the floating vessel and a subsea well. The limitations of the aforementioned riser systems are conveniently accommodated by a riser system presently undergoing development. It is known as “steel catenary risers supported by subsurface buoy”. This riser solution combines the best properties of flexible risers (ability to uncouple a system from vessel motions) and steel catenary risers (usability in deep waters). In addition to this, it offers flexibility in terms of achievable step-out distance between a floater and a subsea well. This riser system is the thrust of this thesis. This write-up begins with a review of the previously mentioned riser solutions, pros and cons related to their usage in harsh deep water environments, and some essential design code requirements to be fulfilled in a riser design activity. This is followed by design analysis of the thesis example riser system. In-depth analysis is done with two different buoy types (rectangular buoy and H-shaped buoy) by conducting sensitivity studies to understand the contribution of factors such as the buoy size and submerged weight, flowline content density, <b>riser</b> anchor <b>length,</b> and so on, to the performance of the riser system in a typical North Sea environment. Observation was made that whilst both buoy shapes result in good flexible risers and steel catenary risers strength performance, the H-shaped buoy had line clashing issues when subjected to cross flow environmental loads. This was however eradicated through the use of another buoy shape referred to as the modified H-buoy. The rectangular and H-shaped buoys were further studied for possibility of resonance with peak waves obtainable in the North Sea environment and were found to have satisfactory sway and heave periods. In addition, a brief fatigue assessment was carried out with the rectangular buoy to show that the riser system helps in alleviating fatigue issues prominent in conventional steel catenary risers. The study concludes by showing that while both the conventional buoy and the H-shaped buoy offer appreciable strength performance and stability to the riser system, the latter has better stability in comparison with the former while the former offers better strength performance to the steel catenary risers.

30|$|Figure  5 {{shows the}} {{temperature}} profile for solid and fluid phases along {{the height of}} the RFCUU-riser reactor. There is a rapid increase in the temperature of the gas phase for both models of instantaneous and one-dimensional vaporization of feedstock near the inlet of the riser reactor (at about 2.3  m). This agrees with theory that vaporization occurs towards the inlet of the riser reactor. The solid-phase temperature drops rapidly from 927  K to about 765.5  K for the instantaneous model near the inlet of the riser reactor, and both the solid and gas phases’ temperatures reached a constant value of 765.5  K from 2  m till the end of the riser reactor. The predicted exit temperature of 765.5  K using instantaneous vaporization of feedstock is in excellent agreement with the RFCCU-riser reactor of 755  K, with % error being ±[*] 1.39. However, for the one-dimensional vaporization of the feedstock, the solid and gas phases attained a constant temperature of about 907.5  K near the inlet of the reactor, and afterwards, their temperature profile dropped more evenly across {{the height of the}} reactor, reaching a value of 798.15  K {{at the end of the}} reactor.

40|$|Due {{to their}} long and {{flexible}} structures, deep-water risers may experience multi-modal vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) with very high mode number. These multi-modal vibration responses usually {{depend on the}} modal parameters of riser vibration systems, such as modal natural frequencies, modal mass, modal damping and modal stiffness.

40|$|Oil and gas {{production}} systems consist of flows in wells, in horizontal and inclined flowlines and in risers. Due to the reservoir composition {{and changes in}} pressure and temperature, the flow is often under multiphase conditions. With time, the reservoir matures and the reservoir pressure decreases. The gas rate drops below a critical gas rate, that is required to produce the liquid to the wellhead and the facilities. As a result, liquids build up down-hole in the well. This phenomenon is known as liquid loading, which may kill the well. One of the deliquification methods is to use surfactants, which are injected through a capillary {{at the bottom of}} the well. Recent field trials have shown that the injection of surfactants down-hole in a well can prevent liquid loading problems. The surfactants create a foam which forms relatively thick interfacial waves along the wall of the production tubing. The gas core gets more grip on the liquid film, making it easier to produce the liquid to the surface. Due to the success of the application of surfactants in subsurface vertical wells, it is of interest to investigate whether surfactants can also help to overcome liquid management problems in flowline-riser systems on the surface. The objective of this work is therefore to find the effect of surfactants on two-phase (air-water) flows in flowlines and risers. Experiments were carried out in the Severe Slugging Loop at the Shell Research and Technology Centre Amsterdam. The flow loop consists of a 100 m horizontal and downward inclined flowline with an inner diameter of 0. 051 m, followed by a 16. 8 m riser with an inner diameter of 0. 044 m. The working fluids are air and water, and operation is at atmospheric outlet pressure. Two configurations of the SSL were used. In configuration # 1, both water and air are injected into the flowline. The mixture is transported through the flowline to the riser. In configuration # 2, water is injected into the flowline. Air is injected directly into the riser base. The dish washing detergent Dreft is used as a surfactant to create foam. The concentration was systematically increased to find the effect on different types of slugging (in the flowline, in the riser and severe slugging at the riser base), the pressure gradient in the <b>riser,</b> the developing <b>length</b> in the <b>riser</b> and the liquid and foam holdup in the riser. Various measurement techniques were used: Differential Pressure Indicators (DPIs), Pressure Indicators (PIs), Distributed Acoustic Sensors (DAS), quick closing valves and flow visualization. When operating the SSL in configuration # 1 with a superficial gas and liquid velocity of u_sg= 1. 21 m/s and u_sl= 0. 4 m/s, slugging in the flowline is observed. The slugs are identified as growing slugs: the stratified flow builds up regularly due to a growing instability, forming a slug. The average length of the liquid body of the slug is 32 m, the average passing time of the liquid body of the slug is 51 s, and the average slug velocity is 0. 66 m/s. Through DAS and pressure measurements one can see that the slugs are mitigated when the surfactant is added. The slugs completely disappear when an effective surfactant concentration of 1000 ppm is added to the air-water mixture. When operating the SSL in configuration # 1 with a superficial gas and liquid velocity of u_sg= 1. 4 m/s and u_sl= 0. 27 m/s, a severe slugging cycle is found. Without surfactants, the cycle has a period of 109 s in which the riser is filled entirely with the liquid body of the slug before is is pushed out by the air. Pressure drop measurements over the riser show that adding surfactants does not prevent the slugging cycle to occur. However, the creation of foam does increase the amount of gas in the riser, making the pressure build-ups more irregular. The slugging cycle reduces to 89 s when an effective surfactant concentration of 3000 ppm is added to the air-water mixture. When operating the SSL in configuration # 2 with a superficial gas and liquid velocity of u_sg= 0. 37 m/s and u_sl= 0. 27 m/s, slugging in the riser is observed. Differential pressure measurements were taken over a distance of 3 m at multiple locations: one at the riser base, and two at the top of the riser. The surfactant reduces the differential pressure along the riser. For a concentration of 3000 ppm, the differential pressure reduces by 5. 1 % at the riser base and by 18. 9 % at the top of the riser. The pressure drop curve is used to analyze the flow behaviour for a range of superficial velocities. Two types of pressure drop curves were considered: 1) for a constant superficial liquid velocity (u_sl= 0. 05 m/s), and 2) for constant gas-to-liquid ratio (GLR= 60 and GLR= 100). For the low gas flow rate region, i. e. the gravity dominated part of the curve, both methods show a decrease in pressure gradient for a surfactant concentration of 500 ppm or greater. In the high gas flow rate region, i. e. the friction dominated part of the curve, an increase in the effective concentration leads to an increase in the pressure gradient. The developing length of the air-water mixture with and without surfactants is analyzed by means of differential pressure measurements. Measurements were taken over a distance of 3 m at multiple locations: one at the riser base, and two at the top of the riser. With an effective concentration of 3000 ppm, the differential pressure is slightly different for the two locations on top of the riser. This indicates that the flow is not fully developed at the top of the <b>riser.</b> The developing <b>length</b> is slightly increased with the addition of the surfactant. The foam holdup is analyzed by measuring the height of the foam between two simultaneously closed quick closing valves on the riser. The experimental results are compared with the simulation results from the Shell Flow Correlations. The experimental results show a spread due to the transient behavior of the flow. Despite the spread, the experimental results follow the trend of the simulations. At low gas flow rates, surfactants decrease the foam holdup. At high gas flow rates, surfactants increase the foam holdup. However, the foam holdup decreases for increasing gas flow rates and eventually levels off to a constant holdup value. It can be concluded from the small-scale experiments that surfactants: 1) mitigate (growing) slugs in flowlines, 2) do not remove the severe slugging cycle, 3) decrease the pressure gradient in the riser for small gas flow rates, 4) slightly increase the development length of the flow in the riser, and 5) decrease the foam holdup for low gas flow rates, and increase the foam holdup for high gas flow rates in the riser. It is recommended to carry out the experiments on a larger scale, i. e. at higher temperatures, for larger pipe diameters, to better relate to existing flowline-riser production systems. It is also recommended to perform similar experiments to find the effect of the surfactant on other slug types, such as terrain slugs and hydrodynamic slugs, in the flowline...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis presents new research {{results on the}} control of top tensioned risers in deep waters. The main motivation for this work {{is the development of}} a riser control system which control the top tension of the individual risers in an array, such that collisions between adjacent risers are prevented. The risk of collision increases with increasing water depth, and as {{the oil and gas industry}} is moving to ever deeper waters, riser interaction has become an issue of considerable concern. The two main design parameters to avoid collision are riser spacing and top tension, which both are expensive alternatives. Hence, new solutions are needed and dynamic control of the top tension is the solution proposed here. A mathematical model of the riser system is developed. It includes two risers in a tandem arrangement which are connected to a tension leg platform (TLP) through their top nodes, forcing the risers to follow the prescribed motions of the TLP in the horizontal direction. In the vertical direction the riser motion is decided by the actuator which is a tensioner system. The risers are also exposed to current forces which are found by considering hydrodynamic interaction. The risers are modeled using the finite element method (FEM). This model is verified by the commercial software RIFLEX. For the purpose of control applications, the model needs to be computationally fast, but still be able to describe the main physics of the real system. The number of elements needed to keep a desired level of accuracy is therefore investigated. Different means to measure the performance of the model are considered, and among these, payout measurements reflected the displacement of the riser in the best manner. In addition measurements at the wellhead, like payout and tension, are both accurate and available at most installations today. Hence, the proposed control objectives are mainly based on keeping the top tension, payout or total <b>riser</b> <b>length</b> equal for the risers of concern. A simulation study showed that the dynamic variation of the riser elongation needed to be taken into account in the control algorithm for deep water risers. The reason was that the large difference between tension in the two risers resulted in a significant length difference that had to be compensated for by different payout. In shallow waters the difference between the riser elongations is smaller, and equal payout is shown to be appropriate. Equal tension, which is used by the industry today, could be applied for small current velocities. A second control objective principle was to measure the relative horizontal distance between the risers keeping it at a desired distance. This method showed promising results, but is dependent on measurements that are not easily available today. The best control objective used in the controller design was found to be equal effective length, meaning that the sum of the payout and the actual <b>riser</b> <b>length</b> should be equal for all risers. Introducing this method may reduce the needed spacing between the risers and thereby reduce the wellbay area on the TLP. A simulation study with model based supervisory switched control showed how the different controller structures and parameters could be included in the feedback loop depending on the operational conditions and riser behavior. The main contributions in this work are the mathematical modeling of the riser/TLP system, the model analysis, and the proposed controller architecture, including the control objectives and the supervisory switched control concept.

The riser is the key {{component}} of the CFB being the process reactor. The important design parameters are the operating gas velocity (U) and the solids concentration flux (G). The CFB operation starts at moderate to high superficial gas velocities. Its voidage exceeds ∼ 0. 9 and {{is a function of}} the solids circulation flux. Different flow modes have been presented in literature, and result in an operation diagram where G and U delineate specific operations, from dilute riser flow, through core-annulus flow, to dense riser upflow (mostly at any U, G exceeding 80 to 120 kg m- 2 s- 1). Increasing G whilst maintaining the gas velocity will cause an increase in suspension concentration. The riser flow can hence be characterized by its apparent voidage, ɛ. In the core-annulus operation, clusters of particles reflux near the wall, thus influencing the local radial voidage in the cross section of the riser, and also extending over a given distance, δ, from the wall to the core. Through measurements in CFBs of 0. 1 and 0. 14 m I. D., the research has been able to determine the average axial and radial voidages of the dense phase within the different regimes, whilst also determining the thickness of the annulus (in CAF-mode). Experimental results will be illustrated and compared with previous empirical equations, shown to have a limited accuracy only both for ɛ, and for the thickness of the annulus in CAF operation. Within the operating conditions tested, results demonstrate that the annulus thickness is about 15 to 20 % of the riser diameter in CAF, and that the voidage in the riser is a function of U and G, with riser diameter and distance along the <b>riser</b> <b>length</b> as secondary parameters...|$|E
40|$|Vortex induced {{vibration}} (VIV) of long flexible riser subjecting to {{ocean currents}} is ubiquitous in offshore industry. Although significant efforts {{have done to}} understand this complicated fluid structure interaction problem, the numerical modeling and predicting is still a big challenge. The primary objective of this thesis is to characterize the frequency components of VIV response measured in flexible riser model tests under shear current, and try to establish a general frequency competition system for semi-empirical model VIVANA. As the base of present work, experimental data from Norwegian Deepwater Programme (NDP) and Hanoytangen tests are studied. Wavelet analysis method is applied to reveal the frequency components included in measured signals, time-varying intensity of each active frequency will be present as wavelet result. Peak frequency and frequency range defined as two key parameter of wavelet result for further studying. In experiment, the neighbored locations on the riser often display same time-varying peak frequency, rather the whole <b>riser</b> <b>length</b> as assumed by VIVANA. In the other word, the time sharing method maybe better to perform in different zones separately. Based on the observation above, an ideal model combined time sharing and space sharing are proposed. In addition, by observations of VIVANA results, energy limit and excitation length are attempted to limit the active frequency range in VIVANA. The frequency components in measured signal are compared with eigenfrequencies in still water and eigenfrequencies calculated by Riflex, the differences are stated after discussion. Displacement histories corresponding to single participating mode are composed by modal analysis method, the frequency components of these signals are analyzed by wavelet, an unexpected observation that all decomposed signals have similar frequency components is found, Rayleigh-Ritz method and mono-frequency response are proposed as explanation. Some other study like high harmonic effects and coexistence of chaotic and stationary signals in NDP are included in this thesis, these can induced more interesting topics for future research. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{oil and gas}} {{sources are}} found in deeper water depths and in more hostile environments. This results in {{the need for more}} advance technologies. Riser system is a key element in {{providing}} safety. Riser failure results in spillage or pollution and could endanger lives. Hence, it is important to establish a high degree of reliability for riser design. Steel catenary risers (SCRs) have been a preferred riser solution for deep-water field developments due to its simple engineering concept, cost effective, flexibility in using different host platform and flexibility in geographical and environmental conditions. Flexible riser, on the other hand, is limited by technical and economical reasons when it comes to deep water field. Larger diameter is required in deep water to increase collapse resistance due to high hydrostatic pressure. Consequently, increase in cost and limit the option of host platform. Alternatively, Hybrid riser is a robust design for deepwater and harsh environments. It is insensitive to motion induced fatigue. However, hybrid riser is considered to be an expensive solution because it comprises a number of complex components (buoyancy can, riser bundle, flex joint, etc). A number of SCRs have been installed worldwide over the past years and more to come in the future oil and gas explorations. However, there is no SCR that has been installed in deepwater with harsh environments to date. It is mainly because SCRs in harsh environments experience a great challenge due to large motions from host platform such as semi-submersibles and FPSOs. Therefore, significant design effort is required to prove that the SCRs could safely withstand environmental loads in harsh environments and the effects of deep water. The study investigates the feasibility of 10 inch production SCR for Offshore Norway in a 1000 m water depth with SCR attached to a semi-submersible vessel. Conventional SCR was analyzed and found difficulty in meeting strength design criteria at the touch down point (TDP) and at the riser hang off location. From previous industry work, the weight variation along the <b>riser</b> <b>length</b> has demonstrated a remarkable improvement to SCR response, particularly at TDP. This study concentrates on fundamental aspects related to improvement from conventional SCR to weight distributed SCR. A number of insightful sensitivity analyses were performed {{in order to understand the}} correlation between the peak response and some fundamental parameters such as displacement, velocity and acceleration. Feasibility enhancement of present weight distributed SCR concept was also studied to provide more applicable SCR configuration solution. The study addresses global design considerations including analysis of strength and fatigue. Deepwater SCR Installation scheme was also discussed. The study concludes that there is significant improvement in SCR response from conventional SCR to weight distributed SCR concept.

40|$|With {{oil and gas}} {{reserves}} moving into deeper waters Floating Production Units (FPUs) {{have been widely used}} for production purpose. Selection of FPU for deepwater field development is a complicated task is mainly governed by factors like water depth, location of field (remoteness), environmental conditions, deck space requirements, storage requirements and offloading requirements etc. Amongst all the available FPU alternatives ship shaped FPSO has undoubtedly dominated the concept selection and are generally used in marginal and remote fields lacking pipeline infrastructure. Selecting riser concept for FPSO stationed in deepwater has posed challenges due high hydrostatic pressure and large vessel payload. The condition is worsened if besides deepwater, FPSO is also stationed in harsh environmental conditions. Under such conditions FPSO is subjected to large offsets and dynamics which are directly transferred along the <b>riser</b> <b>length</b> to its base unless riser is uncoupled from the FPSO. One of the major factors governing the riser concept selection for deepwater FPSO is the geographical location and weather conditions prevalent there. For example free hanging flexible riser has been mostly used in moderate environments of offshore Brazil while concepts like Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) and Hybrid Riser Tower (HRT) are dominant in calm weather conditions of West of Africa (WoA). Flexible risers in various configurations are currently the most widely used concept with turret moored FPSO in water depth up to 1500 m. This can be accounted to their flexibility which allows them to accommodate large vessel offsets and also to be spooled on reels/carrousels for storage and installation purposes. But other factors like requirement of large diameter to increase collapse resistance, tendency to birdcage, large cost and increased weight limits its use beyond 2000 m. For past decade on of the alternatives to flexible riser for spread moored FPSO in deepwater benign environments has been SCR. SCR is not only a cheaper option but also permits use of large diameter sizes as required to withstand high hydrostatic pressure at larger depths. However SCRs are yet to find its application with deepwater FPSO in moderate to harsh environments due to their reduced fatigue life at hang-off and Touch Down Zone (TDZ). One way of improving the fatigue life of SCR is by changing the riser configuration from catenary to wave shaped (SLWR) by adding buoyancy to it and such a configuration is installed with turret moored FPSO (1780 m) in offshore Brazil. Two overcome the disadvantage of coupled riser systems like SCR, un-coupled riser concepts namely Hybrid Riser Tower (HRT), Single Hybrid Riser (SHR) and Buoyancy Supported Riser (BSR) have been installed. Fairly new un-coupled riser concepts like Grouped Single Line Offset Riser (SLOR), Catenary Offset Buoyant Riser Assembly (COBRA) and Tethered Catenary Riser (TCR) are being studied and developed for deepwater application. Till date there is no FPSO stationed in water depths exceeding 1000 m in Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). Case study is performed at the end of thesis with the aim of recommending suitable riser concept which can be hooked to internal turret moored FPSO stationed in 1500 m water depth and harsh environmental conditions of Northern Norwegian Sea. Based on the literature review lazy wave configuration of flexible riser and Steel Lazy Wave Riser (SLWR) have been considered as a viable riser concept. Main aim of this case study is to compare the two riser concepts on basis of vessel payload, fabrication cost and installation cost while the scope of study involves preforming static, dynamic and fatigue analysis of both the riser systems by using Orcaflex.

40|$|Today, with {{conventional}} drilling technology, {{the cost of}} drilling deep and ultra-deepwater wells is very high, thus many reservoirs are classified as non-economical. Some reservoirs may also be impossible to reach {{with conventional}} drilling technology. However, progress in technology has introduced a new drilling offensive in the offshore industry called Dual Gradient Drilling. Both time and expenditures are reduced so that un-drillable wells may become drillable. A new method for handling minor gas influxes with a dual gradient system that uses a partly evacuated riser is discussed. The method {{is based on the}} dual gradient method from Ocean Riser System, called the ‘Low Riser Return System’. It is argued that a minor influx could be circulated out through an open riser, avoiding a hard shut-in and circulation through the subsea choke. When the influx is observed, mud level in the riser is increased to stop the influx. Then the gas is circulated out through the annulus, into the riser and away from the wellbore by the wiper element {{in the top of the}} riser. Evaluation of this proposed method is carried out by simulation of two distinct cases, the Macondo wellbore in the Gulf of Mexico and a typical wellbore on the Norwegian continental shelf. Simulations are conducted by a program made in Matlab, a fourth-generation programming language. Several extensions have been developed for the simulation program. Inclusion of traffic lights to indicate kick size, pressure dependent influx using productivity index, gas compressibility, a tapered wellbore, a fill-up pump for initial mud level increase and a frictional pressure calculation based on the Moody chart are the most important extensions. Results from the simulations conducted are promising. Initial gas influx volume on the Macondo case was 1. 83 m 3. Although this is above the proposed influx limit of 1. 0 m 3 for when the well should be shut in, it appears that the method should handle the influx safely. The 1544 m long 19. 5 ” inner diameter riser gives the ability to have a large volume free of mud, allowing gas to expand when it reaches the mud surface. A long riser section is also favorable to reduce the probability for slug flow. &# 8195; For the well on the Norwegian continental shelf results are also promising, but with a higher degree of uncertainty regarding gas behavior in the riser. A <b>riser</b> <b>length</b> of 362 m is used, which is in the lower end of where such a dual gradient system is favorable. Influx volumes above 0. 5 m 3 at 1675 m for the specific case will exceed the formation integrity test for the last set casing shoe. However, influxes up to 1. 0 m 3 should be manageable with respect to gas behavior in the riser. Full-scale field tests conducted on deepwater drilling risers described in the literature show that gas is being dispersed throughout the entire riser, rather than rising as a slug. An air volume of 8. 0 m 3 released at the bottom of a 950 m long riser unloaded a maximum of 12. 1 m 3 of mud, whereas the surface volume of gas was 2166 m 3. An air bubble of 1. 6 m 3 released in the same conditions did not unload any mud at all, only gas cut mud was observed at surface. Water based mud with a density of 1. 58 g/cc was used for the field tests. Simulations of field test scenarios show that the simulation program has room for improvement when it comes to modeling of gas flow in risers. As a consequence, results from simulations are based on the field test for flow development in the riser. Use of strengthened surface equipment to raise the level of safety is proposed, as well as the benefits of using a fill-up pump to reduce the influx size. A fill-up pump provides faster mud level increase in the riser so that the influx is stopped at an earlier stage. </p...|$|E

40|$|Offshore energy {{exploration}} {{has been}} moving into ever increasing water depths. For floating offshore drilling structures, the riser system is a crucial element. Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) {{is a major concern}} for deepwater riser developments, as vortex-induced vibration is a major cause of riser fatigue damage. For deepwater risers, current is the dominant factor causing VIV responses. Due to the increased water depth, deep-water risers have long and flexible structures, so that they have the potential to be subject to very high modes of vibration, i. e. multi-modal VIV. The frequencies, amplitudes and modes of VIV responses are usually the focus of deepwater riser design, as they, along with riser material properties, directly determine the riser fatigue life. In recent years, much effort has been devoted into the investigation of riser VIV response, but there are still many uncertainties, especially for the risers with multi-mode VIV responses in currents. For example, frequency lock-in phenomena and modal resonances are still not fully understood for multi-modal VIV responses; the vibration shapes over <b>riser</b> <b>length</b> and the motion trajectories in the cross-sectional plane for a flexible riser with multimodal VIV cannot be found in the literature. The frequency and mode components contained in the multi-modal VIV responses in both in-line and cross-flow directions have not been published in previous work. [...] This research aims to improve the understanding of multi-modal VIV in currents. The research objectives include i) frequency characteristics for multi-modal VIV responses, such as frequency versus current velocity and frequency lock-in phenomenon; ii) amplitude characteristics for multi-modal VIV responses, such as amplitude versus current velocity, amplitude range and amplitude resonance; iii) spectral characteristics for multi-modal VIV responses, such as dominant frequencies, power spectrum versus current velocity and power spectrum versus location on the riser; iv) modal characteristics for multi-modal VIV responses, such as modal distribution, dominant mode and mode versus current velocity; v) modal system parameters for a flexible riser in calm water, including modal mass, modal damping, modal stiffness and non-linear damping; and vi) the correlation between the modal parameters and the VIV responses. [...] After a review of the state-of-the-art literature involving VIV investigation, an experimental method was proposed for this research. Based on a prototype riser, a length distorted model riser was designed with similarity of the mass, the bending stiffness and the frequency ratio. Two model riser tests were designed and conducted. The first one was a shaker-excitation test, which was designed to investigate the modal system parameters. A shaker was used to generate an excitation to the riser, and the riser responses were measured. The modal system parameters were estimated from the frequency response functions based on a simplified governing equation for the shaker/riser system. Modal analysis was used to estimate the linear modal system parameters, and Bendat's technique was used to estimate the non-linear damping for the flexible riser. [...] Another model riser test was a current-excitation test. This test was designed to investigate the VIV responses in currents. The uniform currents were generated by towing carriage. Sixteen pairs of accelerometers were used to measure the VIV responses at sixteen locations on the riser. Spectral analysis and modal analysis are two major tools to analyze the measured data. [...] It was found that the frequencies of the multi-modal VIV responses in both the crossflow and in-line directions follow the Strouhal frequencies for a flexible riser. The measured Strouhal number was about 0. 12. The frequency lock-in phenomena occurred in both the in-line and cross-flow directions at some modal natural frequencies. The vibration amplitudes fluctuate from 0. 3 to 0. 9 D (D denotes the riser diameter) in both the in-line and cross-flow directions for the flexible riser tested, and no increasing trend existed as the current velocity increases. The resonances are not strong as the vibration energy is shared by several modes. The VIV responses for a flexible riser contained a number of modal components, but one or two were the dominant modes. [...] It was also found that flexible risers have a variety of natural frequencies, which correspond to a variety of mode shapes. The modal natural frequencies depend on the tension. The estimated added mass coefficients Ca depend on the tensions and mode shapes for a flexible riser, ranging from 1. 0 to 3. 7, and the estimated damping coefficients Cd have a relatively big scatter, ranging from 0. 5 to 2. 5. There is a degree of correlation between the estimated modal parameters and the VIV responses...|$|E
