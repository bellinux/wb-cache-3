5|$|Given these risks, as {{smallpox}} became effectively eradicated and {{the number}} of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine-induced illnesses and deaths, routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the United States in 1972, and was abandoned in most European countries in the early 1970s. <b>Routine</b> <b>vaccination</b> of health care workers was discontinued in the U.S. in 1976, and among military recruits in 1990 (although military personnel deploying to the Middle East and Korea still receive the vaccination). By 1986, <b>routine</b> <b>vaccination</b> had ceased in all countries. It is now primarily recommended for laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure.|$|E
5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is given at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence. <b>Routine</b> <b>vaccination</b> of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of vaccines, the impact of vaccinations has been immeasurable. Under the current immunization guidelines, infants receive the first of their <b>routine</b> infant <b>vaccinations</b> at 2 months of age. While the benefits of <b>routine</b> infant <b>vaccinations</b> in premature infants have been demonstrated, there is relatively little data on the dosing of these vaccines in premature infants. The medical records of two premature infants who developed intramuscular abscesses after receiving their <b>routine</b> infant <b>vaccinations</b> were reviewed. Both patients developed pain {{in the area of}} the injection after receiving their vaccinations. Magnetic resonance imaging findings confirmed the formation of an abscess. No other causes of abscess formation were observed. Both patients required surgical intervention and were treated with a course of antibiotics. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to suggest <b>routine</b> <b>vaccinations</b> as a potential cause of abscess formation in premature infants...|$|R

The British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain had previously recommended against general mumps vaccination, changing that recommendation in 1987.|$|E
25|$|BCG is very efficacious against tuberculous {{meningitis}} in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis {{appears to be}} variable.

25|$|Japan {{was among}} the first {{countries}} to vaccinate for chickenpox. <b>Routine</b> <b>vaccination</b> against varicella zoster virus is also performed in the United States, and the incidence of chickenpox has been dramatically reduced there (from 4 million cases per year in the pre-vaccine era to approximately 400,000 cases per year as of 2005). In Europe most countries do not currently vaccinate against varicella, though the vaccine is gaining wider acceptance. Australia, Canada, and other countries have now adopted recommendations for routine immunization of children and susceptible adults against chickenpox.|$|E

50|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{recommends}} that rotavirus vaccine {{be included in}} national <b>routine</b> <b>vaccinations</b> programs, especially {{in areas where the}} disease is common.

Either one or two doses of the vaccine is recommended. In the United States two doses are recommended starting at twelve to fifteen months of age. As of 2012 most European countries either recommend it for all children or just those at high risk, but not all countries provide the vaccine due to its cost.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Angola {{launched}} {{a national campaign}} of vaccination against measles, extended to every child under ten years old and aiming to go to all 18 provinces in the country. The measure {{is part of the}} Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Measles 2014–2020 created by the Angolan Ministry of Health which includes strengthening routine immunisation, a proper dealing with measles cases, national campaigns, introducing a second dose of vaccination in the national <b>routine</b> <b>vaccination</b> calendar and active epidemiological surveillance for measles. This campaign took place together with the vaccination against polio and vitamin A supplementation.|$|E
25|$|Since human plague {{is rare in}} {{most parts}} of the world, <b>routine</b> <b>vaccination</b> is not needed other than for those at {{particularly}} high risk of exposure, nor for people living in areas with enzootic plague, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas, such as the western United States. It is not even indicated for most travellers to countries with known recent reported cases, particularly if their travel is limited to urban areas with modern hotels. The CDC thus only recommends vaccination for: (1) all laboratory and field personnel who are working with Y. pestis organisms resistant to antimicrobials; (2) people engaged in aerosol experiments with Y. pestis; and (3) people engaged in field operations in areas with enzootic plague where preventing exposure is not possible (such as some disaster areas).|$|E
40|$|AbstractBacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) {{vaccination}} {{has been}} reported to protect neonates from non-tuberculous pathogens, but no biological mechanism to explain such effects is known. We hypothesised that BCG produces broad-spectrum anti-microbial protection via a hepcidin-mediated hypoferraemia, limiting iron availability for pathogens. To test this we conducted a trial in 120 Gambian neonates comparing iron status in the first 5 -days of life after allocation to: (1) All <b>routine</b> <b>vaccinations</b> at birth (BCG/Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) /Hepatitis B Vaccine (HBV)); (2) BCG delayed until after the study period (at day 5); and (3) All <b>routine</b> <b>vaccinations</b> delayed until after the study period.

2500|$|In {{order to}} provide the best protection, {{children}} are recommended to receive vaccinations as soon as their immune systems are sufficiently developed to respond to particular vaccines, with additional [...] "booster" [...] shots often required to achieve [...] "full immunity".

In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends schedule additions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends <b>routine</b> <b>vaccination</b> of children against: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HiB, chickenpox, rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease and pneumonia. A large number of vaccines and boosters recommended (up to 24 injections by age two) has led to problems with achieving full compliance. In order to combat declining compliance rates, various notification systems have been instituted and a number of combination injections are now marketed (e.g., Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and MMRV vaccine), which provide protection against multiple diseases.|$|E
