25|$|The {{interior}} of the T1 is a two-seat configuration, lacking any amenities and luxuries to reduce excess weight. The passenger's seat is set back from the driver's seat slightly, allowing the seats to be placed closer together, thereby reducing the overall width of the T1. Offered are a head protection system, six-point harnesses for the driver and passenger, compatible with a HANS device, and is designed with a central safety cell made of a high-strength steel <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> with a fire system. The dashboard is multi-function with race data logging and speed sensors for traction control and launch control.|$|E
25|$|For 1999, Diniz partnered {{experienced}} driver Jean Alesi at Sauber. He {{endured a}} torrid start: He {{was forced into}} retirement {{in the first five}} races held in the season; and in the sixth race of the season held in Canada, he managed to score his first point of the season with a sixth-place finish. Diniz suffered a retirement at the next round in France, before clinching consecutive sixth-place finishes in the next two races and later suffered further consecutive retirements in the following six races. In late August, it was announced that Diniz would remain at Sauber for 2000. At the European Grand Prix, Diniz was hit by Benetton driver Alexander Wurz who sent the Sauber driver into a barrel roll and suffered a bruised knee and shoulder, resulting from his car's <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> becoming damaged. Diniz finished the season fourteenth in the Drivers' Championship and scored three points.|$|E
500|$|Pryce was {{directly}} behind Stuck's car {{along the main}} straight. Stuck saw Jansen van Vuuren {{and moved to the}} right to avoid both marshals, missing Bill by what Tremayne calls [...] "millimetres". From his position Pryce could not see Jansen van Vuuren and was unable to react as quickly as Stuck had done. He struck the teenage marshal at approximately 270km/h (170mph). Jansen van Vuuren was thrown into the air and landed in front of Zorzi and Bill. He died on impact, and his body was badly mutilated by Pryce's car. The fire extinguisher he had been carrying smashed into Pryce's head, before striking the Shadow's <b>roll</b> <b>hoop.</b> The force of the impact was such that the extinguisher was thrown up and over the adjacent grandstand. It landed in the car park {{to the rear of the}} stand, where it hit a parked car and jammed its door shut.|$|E
50|$|A newer form of {{rollover}} protection, pioneered on the Mercedes-Benz R129 in 1989, is deployable <b>roll</b> <b>hoops</b> {{that are}} normally hidden {{within the body}} of a car.

2500|$|Some notable {{changes to}} the design of the Mk III for the Mk III C were {{concentrated}} on the cockpit and nose areas. [...] While the Mk III had a <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> which ran the full width of the cockpit, the Mk III C was designed to share the <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> design of the Northstar LMP. [...] This standard hoop was positioned immediately behind the drivers seat and integrated the intakes for the engine, although an option <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> extension was offered as it was required for the Rolex Sports Car Series. [...] The front of the cockpit was also redesigned, as an aerodynamic windshield was added immediately in front of the driver.|$|E
2500|$|The {{redesigned}} {{carbon fiber}} and kevlar bodywork of the Mk III {{was developed by}} aircraft designer John Roncz, who assisted Bob Riley in using early computational fluid dynamics programs to refine the aerodynamics of the new car. [...] Final aerodynamic testing was performed at a Lockheed windtunnel. [...] The nose of the final Mk III was {{very similar to the}} original design model from 1993, featuring a nose which sloped downward towards a splitter extended {{from the front of the}} car. [...] In the center, a wide intake allowed air into the radiator mounted flat under the nose. [...] The air exited the radiator from two openings on top of the nose and in front of the cockpit. [...] Between these exit vents, teams had the option of installing extra headlights for night races. [...] A circular duct was placed on either side of the radiator intake to allow air to the front brakes for cooling. [...] Behind the front wheels the bodywork was now relatively square and flat, with full sidepods running the full width of the car. [...] A rules-mandated full width <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> was positioned behind cockpit. [...] Positioned under the <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> was an arched intake for the engine airbox.|$|E
2500|$|Riley & Scott {{had ended}} their {{progressing}} {{development of the}} Mk III during the 1999 season, {{in part due to}} the company being contracted by General Motors (GM) to construct a Le Mans Prototype for their Cadillac brand. [...] The resulting Northstar LMP borrowed elements of the Mk III's design and layout. [...] Modern features were however included on the Cadillac, including a carbon fiber monocoque replacing the composite monocoque of the Mk III, a <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> over only the driver's seat instead of the full width of the cockpit, and a relocation of the radiators to lower the nose. [...] An evolved Riley & Scott-built Northstar LMP design appeared in 2001, but the company was not contracted to build the 2002 version of the car.|$|E

2500|$|... 1965 saw Clay Regazzoni {{behind the}} wheel of an open-wheeled car for the first time, as he entered the European Formula Three {{championship}} with a Brabham. This first season brought moderate success, and improving form during 1966 (this time driving a De Tomaso) brought him to the attention of ambitious Italian constructor Tecno. Tecno offered Regazzoni the use of one of their F3 chassis for 1967, where his reliable, fast performances earned him the offer of a works Tecno drive in Formula Two for the following year. Despite this, Regazzoni continued to drive in Formula Three events during 1968 and, not for the last time, was lucky to survive a major accident. Exiting the chicane during the Monaco Grand Prix Formula 3 support race, Regazzoni lost control of his car and collided heavily with the crash barrier. The diminutive size of the Formula 3 machine allowed it to pass under the rail, the sharp metal edge of the Armco slicing {{across the top of the}} open cockpit. Regazzoni managed to duck down low enough in the driving seat for the rail to pass above him, missing his head by a tiny margin. The car eventually came to a halt when the <b>roll</b> <b>hoop,</b> behind Regazzoni's head and significantly lower than the top of his helmet, wedged itself underneath the barrier.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{drama of}} the day {{occurred}} after the practice session had ended. Inoue had spun and stalled his Footwork, which was being towed back to the pit lane by a recovery vehicle when it was struck from behind by the Renault Clio safety carwhich was being taken on quick demonstration laps of the circuit {{in the hands of}} rally driver Jean Ragnotti, with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile's press delegate as passengerin the middle of the Piscine complex. The impact was sufficient to overturn the Footwork and render it a write-off: the FA16 sustained severe rear-end damage to the engine and gearbox, whilst the tow rope, attached to the car's crash structure behind the driver's head, pulled the <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> from the chassis. Inoue, who still sitting in the cockpit with his helmet on but his seatbelts unfastened, sustained two impacts to the head, the severity of which was shown by the fact that a chunk had been taken out of his helmet. He was taken to The Princess Grace Hospital Centre for a brain scan and, although he was found to have sustained only a slight concussion, was not permitted {{to take part in the}} afternoon qualifying session as a precaution. The Footwork team principal, Jackie Oliver, was infuriated by the incident, and wrote an official letter of complaint to the Automobile Club de Monaco, the body responsible for organising the event. He said that Inoue would have been killed had he not been wearing his helmet, and questioned the organisation of the ACM and Ragnotti's attitude: [...] "Why was Ragnotti out there? It's just lack of discipline. I understand he had accomplished a couple of laps before at a million miles an hour with handbrake turns at the Loews hairpin. What was the purpose of him doing it? Was it to give officials a thrill?" [...] The stewards tacitly acknowledged that the incident was not Inoue's fault by authorising him to use the team's spare car for qualifying, but this was rendered academic by his non-participation in the session.|$|E

50|$|Some {{automobile}} {{models have}} begun to adopt the phrase, substituting system for structure in the ROPS acronym, notably the Volvo C70 convertible models, and Jaguar XK. Their ROPS structures consist of two pyrotechnically charged <b>roll</b> <b>hoops</b> hidden behind the rear seats that will pop up {{in the case of}} a roll-over to protect the occupants. If the roof is up, the system will still work, shattering the rear window at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|The C70 {{retractable}} hardtop {{also features}} a roll over protection structure (ROPS) with two pyrotechnically charged <b>roll</b> <b>hoops</b> hidden behind the rear seats that deploy under roll-over conditions whether the roof is retracted or not.

Cars must have two steel <b>roll</b> <b>hoops</b> of designated thickness and alloy, regardless of {{the composition of the}} rest of the chassis. There must be an impact attenuator in the nose, and impact testing data on this attenuator must be submitted prior to competing. Cars must also have two hydraulic brake circuits, full five-point racing harnesses, and must meet geometric templates for driver location in the cockpit for all drivers competing. Tilt-tests ensure that no fluids will spill from the car under heavy cornering, and there must be no line-of-sight between the driver and fuel, coolant, or oil lines.|$|R
