He was dressed in a dark thin coat, <b>ribbed</b> <b>velvet</b> pantaloons, and a sort of moccasins, or shoes, {{appended}} to the legs of woollen stockings. He had on a straw hat, and his hair was gray, with a long, thin visage. His nuts were contained in a square tin box, having two compartments, one for the nuts, and another for maple sugar, which he sells in small cakes. He had three small tin measures for nuts,--one at one cent, others at two, four, and six cents; and as fast as they were emptied, he filled them again, {{and put them on the}} top of his box. He smoked a pipe, and talked with one man about whether it would be worth while to grow young again, and the duty of being contented with old age; about predestination and freewill and other metaphysics. I asked him what his sales amounted to in the course of a day. He said that butternuts did not sell so well as walnuts, which are not yet in season; that he might to-day have sold fifty cents' worth of walnuts, never less than a dollar's worth, often more; and when he went round with a caravan, he had sold fifteen dollars' worth per day, and once as much as twenty dollars' worth. This promises to be an excellent year for walnuts. Chestnuts have been scarce for two or three years. He had one hundred chestnut-trees on his own land, and last year he offered a man twenty-five cents if he would find him a quart of good chestnuts on them. A bushel of walnuts would cost about ten dollars. He wears a pair of silver-rimmed spectacles.|$|E

50|$|Velveteen (or velveret) is a cloth made in {{imitation}} of velvet. Normally cotton, the term is sometimes applied to a mixture of silk and cotton. Some velveteens {{are a kind of}} fustian, having a <b>rib</b> of <b>velvet</b> pile alternating with a plain depression. This fabric has a pile that is short (never more than 3 mm deep) and is closely set. It has a firm hand and a slightly sloping pile. Compared to true velvet, velveteen has greater body, does not drape as easily, and has less sheen.|$|R
