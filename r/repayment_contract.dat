40|$|Whether a {{microfinance}} institution {{should use}} a state-contingent repayment {{or not is}} very important since a state-contingent loan can provide insurance for borrowers. However, the classic Grameen bank used state non-contingent repayment, which is puzzling since it forces poor borrowers to make their payments even under hard circumstances. This paper provides an explanation to this puzzle. We consider two modes of lending, group and individual lending, and for each mode we characterize the optimal lending and supervisory contracts when a staff member (a supervisor) can embezzle borrowers' repayments by misrepresenting realized returns. We identify the main trade-off between the insurance gain {{and the cost of}} controlling the supervisor's misbehavior.

40|$|Repayment {{rigidity}} in microfinance contracts {{has always}} been crucial in order to discipline borrowers and ensure repayments. However, a strict repayment schedule might also inhibit entrepreneurship and force borrowers to undertake low-risk but also low-return investments. A possible solution is therefore to introduce more flexibility in the repayment mechanism. We build a simple adverse selection model where a monopolistic microfinance lender faces two types of present-biased borrowers who have different misperceptions about their future utility; the MFI's problem is {{to decide whether or}} not to provide a flexible repayment schedule within the microfinance contract. Our main result is that if the pool of clients is made of a sufficiently high share of entrepreneurial borrowers, it is always more profitable for the lender to provide both a rigid and a flexible repayment schedule than simply a rigid <b>repayment</b> <b>contract.</b> Surprisingly, it is still more profitable even though the contract doesn't perfectly screen out very present-biased borrowers who enter the flexible schedule but end up not being able to repay in the final period. However, this implies that more entrepreneurial borrowers are always charged a higher repayment rate in order to compensate the other borrowers' potential default...|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} that {{migration}} does not provide insurance to migrants and their family of origin, there may be another family arrangement that explains the existence of remittances. That {{is the case of}} an implicit family loan <b>repayment</b> <b>contract</b> which ties migrants to their family. As part of this family contract, remittances are seen as a return on investment; they are simply the repayment of costs incurred by the migratory family (the cost of education and/or the cost of migration). The financing of these costs is subject to an implicit agreement. Under this agreement, parents lend to their children and finance their education, travel and settlement in a foreign country. By doing this, they make an investment that is profitable and sustainable. This investment starts to pay off when migrants repay the loan (and its interest). In this model, remittances are not expected to decrease over time as in the altruistic model because a share of these funds may be used to finance migration costs for future generations. Poirine (1997) provides a further analysis of remittances as an implicit family loan arrangement by considering these remittances as a repayment of educational costs. In their theoretical model, Ilahi and Jafarey (1999) insist not on the educational costs like Poirine (1997), but on the costs of migration.|$|E

To answer this question, this paper studies an overlapping generations model in which the equilibrium contract form is optimal, given the contracts elsewhere in the economy. Nominal contracts turn out to be optimal in the presence of aggregate price level risk under two circumstances. First, if individuals have the same constant degree of relative risk aversion, nominal contracts (eventually coupled with equity contracts) lead to optimal risk sharing. Second, nominal contracts can be optimal, even if this condition is not met, if the <b>repayment</b> of <b>contracts</b> is subject to a binding cash-in-advance constraint.

The contract is written by the entrepreneur knowing that this equilibrium will subsequently occur. With a second group of investors who have no monitoring rights, cheating and monitoring probabilities are chosen in a similar way. The non monitoring investors learn the results of any moni-toring for free. A main result is that without commitment there is a negative correlation between repayments to the two investor groups: the contract uses the non-monitoring group to smooth out the repayments of the entrepreneur optimally. This reduces his incentive to make false reports and mitigates the investor’s incentive to monitor. A second result is that the two investor scenario is Pareto superior to the single investor model. A third result is that the possible extent of this smoothing depends on whether the investors have limited liability; it is found that in some circumstances investors should make repayments to the …rm rather than receive them. A further result is that, by restricting to of-fers coming from the informed party, the three party contract is collusion-proof and renegotiation-proof.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Clinical research is critical {{for the development of}} strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and cure of diseases. Clinical research has been defined as patient-oriented research, epidemiologic and behavioral studies, and outcomes research and health services research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the principal federal agency that funds clinical research supporting individual clinical investigators, clinical trials, general and specialized clinical research centers, and clinical research training. For many years, there have been concerns that clinical research proposals are viewed less favorably than basic research during the peer review process at NIH and that clinical research has not received its fair share of NIH funding. In November 2000, the Clinical Research Enhancement Act was enacted to address some of these concerns. NIH reports that it has increased its financial support of clinical research and that spending on clinical research has kept pace with total NIH research spending. NIH has taken some steps to improve its peer review of clinical research applications. The Center for Scientific Review recently added two new peer review study sections for the review of clinical research applications [...] one for clinical cardiovascular science and other for clinical oncology. NIH has increased its support of general clinical research centers, as required by the act, although the program has grown more slowly than NIH's overall estimated expenditures on clinical research. NIH has established the four clinical research career enhancement award programs mandated by the act. Three of these programs have been implemented, and they support new and midcareer clinical investigators and institutional clinical research teaching programs. The fourth program is designed to support graduate training in clinical investigation. NIH has initiated a new extramural loan repayment program specifically for clinical investigators as required by the act. This program was launched in December 2001.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} promotes commitment {{products as}} a new remedy for overcoming self-control problems and savings constraints. This thesis argues {{that the effects of}} commitment may be very heterogeneous, and highlights the mechanisms under which commitment may reduce welfare, rather than increase it. It also examines a new type of commitment contract: A formal commitment savings account with fixed regular instalments, introduced in a developing-country context. Chapter 1 proposes that the popularity of costly or inflexible savings mechanisms as well as of high-interest consumption loans may represent a demand for commitment to fixed instalments. Using a newly collected dataset from Bangladesh, it shows that the introduction of a regular-instalment commitment savings product was associated with a large increase in average savings contributions. The theoretical framework in Chapter 2 highlights the potential heterogeneity behind such positive average effects: Commitment improves welfare when agents have full knowledge of their preferences, including biases and inconsistencies. If agents are imperfectly informed about their preferences, they may choose ill-suited commitment contracts. I formally show that commitment contracts can reduce welfare if the commitment is not strong enough to discipline the agent, resulting in costly default. I further show that such insufficient commitment contracts are likely to be selected by time-inconsistent agents with ‘partially sophisticated’ preferences: Agents who are neither completely unaware nor fully aware of their time-inconsistency, but anywhere in between those two extremes. Chapter 3 describes a randomised experiment in the Philippines: I designed and introduced a regular-instalment commitment savings product, intended to improve on pure withdrawal-restriction products by mimicking the fixed-instalment nature of loan <b>repayment</b> <b>contracts.</b> Individuals from a general low-income pop ulation were randomly offered to take up the product, and were asked to choose the stakes of the contract (in the form of a default penalty) themselves. The result is that a majority appears to choose a harmful contract: While the intent-to-treat effect on bank savings for individuals assigned to the treatment group is four times that of a withdrawal-restriction product (offered as a control treatment), 55 percent of clients default on their savings contract. The explanation most strongly supported by the data is that the chosen stakes were too low (the commitment was too weak) to overcome clients’ self-control problems. Moreover, both take-up and default are negatively predicted by measures of sophisticated hyperbolic discounting, suggesting that those who are fully aware of their bias realise the commitment is too weak for them, and avoid the product. The study suggests that research on new commitment products should carefully consider the risk of adverse welfare effects, particularly for naïve and partially sophisticated hyperbolic discounters...|$|R

While existing contractual provisions, and guidelines issued by creditor committees, establish fundamental principles about creditor treatment, they seem to remain too vague to guide debt restructuring processes effectively. The paper focuses on distribution, and argues that lack of clear guidelines for distribution may complicate and delay the resolution process and induce undue uncertainty about the predictability and viability of the restructuring outcome.

Lenders allocate endowments between loans and a safe investment, while borrowers demand loans to undertake investments. Borrowers may incompletely repay their loans when investment productivity {{turns out to}} be low ex post. We characterize market equilibrium, the <b>contracted</b> <b>repayment</b> rate being the price variable that equilibrates loan supply and demand. We explore market dynamics when a credit market that is initially in steady state experiences an unanticipated shock that temporarily lowers the productivity of borrower investments. The shock reduces loan repayment and lenders, not knowing whether the shock is temporary, then reduce loan supply. We study two forms of government intervention to restore the steady state. One policy manipulates the return on the safe investment and the other guarantees a minimum loan return to lenders. We conclude that the minimum-return guarantee is preferable. This policy directly reduces lender ambiguity in a transparent manner...|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} of Myanmar had {{laid down the}} policy of giving export licenses to RSCs which has contract farming records for overcoming the problems of un–pure seeds, lower quality agro–chemical, lack of improved technologies and credit and underdeveloped agricultural infrastructure. So, RSCs have endeavored in Myanmar rice supply chain in 2008. However, the activities of RSCs have been decreased due {{to change in the}} above policy and poor <b>repayment</b> rate of <b>contract</b> farmers since 2011 – 2012. It is said that the decline in RSCs is negatively affected supply chain activities. Therefore, it is required to determine how to contribute RSCs in Myanmar rice supply chain. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the activities of RSCs on the rice supply chain in Myanmar. We make a comparison between traditional supply chain and RSCs supply chain with descriptive analysis. The results of this study indicate that RSCs supply chain is superior to traditional supply chain by supporting better quality agricultural–inputs to farmers, producing high quality milled rice and competing in international market by exporting it...|$|R
40|$|This paper finds optimal {{fiscal rule}} {{parameter}} values and measures {{the effects of}} imposing fiscal rules using a default model calibrated to an economy that {{in the absence of}} a fiscal rule pays a significant sovereign default premium. The paper also studies the case in which the government conducts a voluntary debt restructuring to capture the capital gains from the increase in its debt market value implied by a rule announcement. In addition, the paper shows how debt ceilings may reduce the procyclicality of fiscal policy and thus consumption volatility.

40|$|We study a {{competitive}} credit market in which lenders with partial knowledge of loan repayment {{use one of}} three decision criteria – maximization of expected utility, maximin, or minimax regret – to make lending decisions. Lenders allocate endowments between loans and a safe asset, while borrowers demand loans to undertake investments. Borrowers may incompletely repay their loans when investment productivity {{turns out to be}} low ex post. We characterize market equilibrium, the <b>contracted</b> <b>repayment</b> rate being the price variable that equilibrates loan supply and demand. Supposing that a public Authority wants to maximize the net social return to borrowing, we study two interventions in the credit market to achieve this objective. One intervention manipulates the return on the safe asset and the other guarantees a minimum loan return to lenders. In a simple scenario, we find that manipulation of the return on the safe asset can be an effective way to achieve the socially desired outcome if lender beliefs about the return to lending are not too pessimistic relative to the beliefs of the Authority. Contrariwise, guaranteeing a minimum loan return can be effective if lender beliefs are not too optimistic relative to the beliefs of the Authority. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the efficiency of}} the different segments of India''s financial system using firm-level data on corporate financing patterns. Firms are increasingly relying on external funds to finance their investment in most recent years. Empirical analyses indicate that (1) the financial system in India is not channeling funds into industries with higher external finance dependence; (2) the debt financing system does not allocate funds according to firms'' external finance dependence, while equity financing system does; and (3) firms in an industry that are more dependent on external finance grow more slowly.
