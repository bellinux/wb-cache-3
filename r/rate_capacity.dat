40|$|Molecular {{communication}} {{emerges as}} a promising communication paradigm for nanotechnology. However, solid mathematical foundations for information-theoretic analysis of molecular communication {{have not yet been}} built. In particular, no one has ever proven that the channel coding theorem applies for molecular communication, and no relationship between information <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> (maximum mutual information) and code <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> (supremum achievable code rate) has been established. In this paper, we focus on a major subclass of molecular communication - the diffusion-based molecular communication. We provide solid mathematical foundations for information theory in diffusion-based molecular communication by creating a general diffusion-based molecular channel model in measure-theoretic form and prove its channel coding theorems. Various equivalence relationships between statistical and operational definitions of channel capacity are also established, including the most classic information <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> and code <b>rate</b> <b>capacity.</b> As byproducts, we have shown that the diffusion-based molecular channel is with "asymptotically decreasing input memory and anticipation" and "d-continuous". Other properties of diffusion-based molecular channel such as stationarity or ergodicity are also proven...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of generalized channel inversion (GCI) technique for a multiuser MIMO system operating under antenna mutual coupling conditions is investigated. The investigation is performed via theoretical derivations and computer simulations. The theoretical derivations show {{that the presence of}} mutual coupling may result in an increased performance in terms of sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity.</b> The simulation experiments confirm the theoretical findings in examples of three groups of numerical results. These results show that the existence of mutual coupling in an array antenna at base station (BS) results in an increased sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> when antenna interelement spacing at BS is smaller than 0. 55 [*]λ. Also it is shown that the presence of mutual coupling at mobile user (MS) terminals results in an increased sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> when antenna inter-element spacing at MSs is smaller than 0. 4 [*]λ.

40|$|Abstract — In a {{broadcast}} channel with random packet arrival and transmission queues, {{the stability of}} the system is achieved by maximizing a weighted sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> with suitable weights that depend on the queue size. The weighted sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> using Dirty Paper Coding (DPC) and Zero Forcing (ZF) is asymptotically equivalent to the weighted sum capacity over parallel single-channels.

40|$|Generalized channel {{inversion}} (GCI) is a precoding {{technique for}} multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system. While producing each user 2 ̆ 7 s precoding matrix, GCI {{takes into account}} noise and thus it is more robust compared with alternative techniques such as block diagonalization technique in terms of sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> and frame error rate. In this paper, two suboptimal multiuser scheduling schemes for GCI are proposed that by scheduling a subset of mobile users nearly maximize the sum <b>rate</b> <b>capacity.</b> They employ an iterative approach involving a number of search steps. At each step, unselected mobile users are evaluated one by one, and {{only one of them}} is chosen according to given criteria.

The performance of the proposed multiuser scheduling schemes is evaluated when the antenna mutual coupling effects are taken into account at the mobile users 2 ̆ 7 sides.
