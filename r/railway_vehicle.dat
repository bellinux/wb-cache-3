30|$|With the {{development}} of urban railway transportation, the metro and lower floor light rail vehicles {{have been widely used}} in many cities. Whereas, compared with the main line <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the urban <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles</b> meet more challenges because of the limitation of circumstance [1, 2, 3], which means that the urban <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles</b> may encounter a large number of curved tracks in daily operations, especially tight curves. Therefore, urban <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles</b> require a good steering capability to negotiate the curve with small radius. However, according to the previous operation experience of urban <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the conventional wheelset cannot provide sufficient self-steering capability to negotiate the sharp curve, which may leads to severe wheel/rail wear and noise [2, 3, 4].|$|R

25|$|Two main matters i.e. {{assuming}} {{the body as}} a fixed support and influence of the nonlinear elements in calculation of the hunting speed are mostly focused in studies. A real <b>railway</b> <b>vehicle</b> has many more degrees of freedom and, consequently, may {{have more than one}} critical speed; {{it is by no means}} certain that the lowest is dictated by the wheelset motion.|$|E
25|$|A {{classical}} hunting oscillation is a swaying {{motion of}} a <b>railway</b> <b>vehicle</b> (often called truck hunting) {{caused by the}} coning action on which the directional stability of an adhesion railway depends. It arises from the interaction of adhesion forces and inertial forces. At low speed, adhesion dominates but, as the speed increases, the adhesion forces and inertial forces become comparable in magnitude and the oscillation begins at a critical speed. Above this speed, the motion can be violent, damaging track and wheels and potentially causing derailment. The problem does not occur on systems with a differential because the action depends on both wheels of a wheelset rotating at the same angular rate, although differentials tend to be rare, and conventional trains have their wheels fixed to the axles in pairs instead.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{non-destructive}} testing methods adapted to <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles</b> permit timely repair or discarding of built-in parts, and, consequently, reliable operation. Rapid advances in testing equipment for <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{make it possible}} to employ them in practice although purchasing options are very limited. Users, i. e. operators, shall have good knowledge of theory and practical experience in using these techniques. The paper focuses on the employment of ultrasonic testing methods developed for and adapted to testing of <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles.</b> For timely detection of initial cracks at vital parts such as king bolts, spring suspensions and particularly axles and shafts of bogies for locomotives and coaches, good testing equipment and software support shall be provided. This is a basis of quality testing and assessment of the state of vital parts of <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles,</b> which will eventually assure safe and reliable railway traffic. Recently ultrasonic testing has shown exceptional advances in apparatuses for measurement, storage, and processing of ultrasonic signals. The advances in equipment shall be accompanied by advances in software since {{this is the only way}} to provide adequate graphical representations and support in an analysis to result in reliable assessment of the state of vital parts of <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Adequate software will allow checking of the state of individual vital parts between periodic checks, good statistical processing of the data obtained, and quality assessment of the momentary state of <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles</b> resulting in efficient and rational scheduling of periodic checks. Some recent approaches to testing of vital parts <b>railway</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as locomotives and coaches will be described. 1...|$|R

2500|$|The {{motion of}} a wheel set {{is much more}} {{complicated}} than this analysis would indicate. There are additional restraining forces applied by the vehicle suspension and, at high speed, the wheel set will generate additional gyroscopic torques, which will modify the estimate of the critical speed. Conventionally a <b>railway</b> <b>vehicle</b> has stable motion in low speeds, when it reaches to high speeds stability changes to unstable form. The main purpose of nonlinear analysis of rail vehicle system dynamics is to show the view of analytical investigation of bifurcation, nonlinear lateral stability and hunting behavior of rail vehicles in a tangent track.

2500|$|When {{used on a}} tram or {{trolley car}} (i.e. a <b>railway</b> <b>vehicle),</b> a single trolley pole usually {{collects}} current from the overhead wire, and the steel rails on the tracks act as the electrical return.

[...] The tramway system in Havana, Cuba, also utilized the dual-wire system, as did the Cincinnati, Ohio streetcar system.|$|E

In 2006 they applied for planning permission for the shed; this was rejected due to badger setts discovered on site. The reinstatement of the line is going ahead with ballast being donated from the quarry it served. The total length being reinstated is [...] It is intended a halt will be built at the quarry end, offering train rides up the line to add an extra attraction to the Great Central Railway, with services either run by a DMU or else a push-pull fitted steam/diesel locomotive. The line is now fully ballasted for half of its length with tracklaying well underway. Tracklaying has recently passed through the Wood Lane bridge and officially entered Mountsorrel Parish.|$|E
