40|$|To help us {{identify}} appropriate {{techniques and}} laboratories for measuring hormones, we studied the variability and reproducibility of assay measurements of androstanediol glucuronide, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate, dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, androstanediol, androsterone glucuronide, and androsterone sulfate for five men. Four sets of two aliquots from each sample {{were sent to}} participating laboratories, and one set was used for analyses monthly for four consecutive months. For each assay, estimates of components of variance were then used to estimate the coefficient of variation, the intraclass correlation between measurements on different days from a given individual, and the minimum detectable relative difference for a standard design. These data indicate that {{for at least one}} of the <b>laboratories</b> a single <b>sample</b> with two <b>laboratory</b> <b>replicates</b> per <b>sample</b> of androstanediol glucuronide, androstenedrone, DHEA, DHEA sulfate, and dihydrotestosterone yields an intraclass correlation coefficient exceeding 0. 80 and can be used to discriminate reliably among men. The results for testosterone, androstanediol, androsterone, glucuronide, and androsterone sulfate do not meet this test. These data do not allow us to estimate the component of variation that corresponds to repeated blood samples taken over time from the same man. This reliability study design is, however, entirely appropriate for the typical case-control study which utilizes only one sample per subject...|$|R

The purpose of these visits was to conduct confirmatory surveys of soils associated with the Argyle Street sewer line that was being removed. Soil samples were collected from six different, judgmentally determined locations in the Argyle Street sewer trench. In addition to the six soil samples collected by ORISE, four replicate soil samples were collected by Cabrera Services, Inc. (CSI) for analysis by the ORISE <b>laboratory.</b> <b>Replicate</b> <b>samples</b> S 0010 and S 0011 were final status survey (FSS) bias samples; S 0012 was an FSS systematic sample; and S 0015 was a waste characterization sample. Six soil samples were also collected for background determination. Uranium- 235 and uranium- 238 concentrations were determined via gamma spectroscopy; the spectra were also reviewed for other identifiable photopeaks. Radionuclide concentrations for these soil samples are provided. In addition to the replicate samples and the samples collected by ORISE, CSI submitted three soil samples for inter-laboratory comparison analyses. One sample was from the background reference area, one was from waste characterization efforts (material inside the sewer line), and one was a FSS sample. The inter-laboratory comparison analyses results between ORISE and CSI were in agreement, except for one sample collected in the reference area.

40|$|An {{open-source}} 3 -D printable <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> rotator mixer {{is developed}} here in two variants that allow users {{to opt for}} the level of functionality, cost saving and associated complexity needed in their laboratories. First, a <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> rotator is designed and demonstrated {{that can be used}} for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$ 30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $ 20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90 % of the costs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A hybrid ANN-FE {{solution}} {{is presented as}} a result of two level analysis of soils: a level of a <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> and a level of engineering geotechnical problem. Engineering properties of soils (sands) are represented directly in the form of ANN (this is in contrast with our former paper where ANN approximated constitutive relationships). Initially the ANN is trained with Duncan for-mula (Duncan and Chang [2]), then it is re-trained (calibrated) with some available experimental data, specific for the soil consid-ered. The obtained approximation of the constitutive parameters is used directly in finite element method at the level of a single ele-ment at the scale of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> to check the correct representation of the laboratory test. Then, the finite element that was successfully tested at the level of <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> is used at the macro level to solve engineering problems involving the soil for which it was calibrated...|$|R

40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracks (SCC) {{had been}} found in a natural gas transmission pipeline during a dig-up and inspection program. The question was raised as to whether the SCC was active or dormant. This paper describes the resultant investigation to determine if a particular service crack was actively growing. The strategy adopted was to assess the appearance of the fracture surface of the service crack and to compare with expectations from laboratory specimens with active SCC. The conclusions from this study are as follows. To judge whether a crack in the service pipe is active or dormant, it is reasonable to compare the very crack tip of the service crack and a fresh crack in a <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample.</b> If the crack tip of the active <b>laboratory</b> <b>sample</b> {{is similar to that of}} the service pipe, it means the crack in the service pipe is likely to be active. From the comparison of the crack tip between the service pipe and the <b>laboratory</b> <b>samples,</b> it appears likely that the cracks in the samples extracted from service were most likely to have been active intergranular stress corrosion cracks.

Grazing by Daphnia and by nanoflagellates reduced the proportion of MOB in the microbial community and the methanotrophic activity decreased significantly at higher Daphnia densities. Thus, the hypothesis arising from previous field observations was supported experimentally, but field studies are required to quantify the influence of grazers on methanotrophic activity and CH 4 effluxes of lakes...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of three different}} techniques, designed to improve the bending fatigue life in comparison to conventionally processed gas-carburized 8620 steel, were evaluated with modified Brugger bending fatigue specimens and actual ring and pinion gears. The bending fatigue samples were machined from forged gear blanks from the same lot of material used for the pinion gear tests, and all processing of <b>laboratory</b> <b>samples</b> and gears was done together. Fatigue data were obtained on standard as-carburized parts and after three special processing histories: shot-peening to increase surface residual stresses; double heat treating to refined austenite grain size; and vacuum carburizing to minimize intergranular oxidation. Standard room-temperature S-N curves and endurance limits were obtained with the <b>laboratory</b> <b>samples.</b> The pinions were run {{as part of a}} complete gear set on a laboratory dynamometer and data were obtained at two imposed torque levels. The number of cycles to failure was used to evaluate the effects of processing history. Based on laboratory endurance limits, shown in parentheses, the processing histories ranked as follows: shot-peened (1410 MPa), vacuum carburized (1210 MPa), reheated to refine grain size (1140 MPa), and as-gas-carburized (1000 MPa). In the gear set tests, shot peening also proved to be {{the most effective way to}} improve fatigue life at both imposed torque levels. The results of this study show that data on <b>laboratory</b> <b>samples</b> can be used to interpret the fatigue performance of gears...|$|R
