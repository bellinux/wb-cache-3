5|$|Few at {{the time}} <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> {{important}} the issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so {{there was no need to}} include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E

5|$|Soule {{was born}} in Keokuk, Iowa to a public school music teacher father and a graphic {{designer}} mother. He became interested in music and symphony orchestras {{at the age of}} five. Soule began taking piano lessons at an early age and became entranced with music, even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework; after his teachers and his father realized his talent, he began taking private lessons with professors from Western Illinois University when he was in sixth grade. He claims to have earned the equivalent of a master's degree in composition before completing high school, though, as he never enrolled in the school, he did not earn a degree. He was split between trying to become a concert pianist and a composer when he grew up; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> difficult it would be to do both.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius' brother Gaius {{was elected}} Plebeian Tribune in 123 BC. Gaius Gracchus' {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} weaken the senate and to strengthen the democratic forces, so he first enacted a law which put the knights (equites, or upper-middle class citizens) on the jury courts instead of the senators. He then passed a grain law which greatly disadvantaged the provincial governors, {{most of whom were}} senators. The knights, on the other hand, stood to profit greatly from these grain reforms, and so the result was that Gaius managed to turn the most powerful class of non-senators against the senate. In the past, the senate eliminated political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a senatus consultum ultimum ("ultimate decree of the senate). Both devices allowed the senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared the senatus consultum ultimum to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a law which granted citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies, but the selfish democracy in Rome, which jealously guarded its privileged status, deserted him over this proposal. He stood for reelection to a third term in 121 BC, but was defeated and then murdered. The democracy, however, had finally <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> weak the senate had become.|$|E

The character Zoë was based on the stuntwoman herself and includes small stories based around her real life experiences, some with Tarantino.

25|$|The {{population}} of the general area increased enormously and reached 30,000, composed largely of American prospectors. Some <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> difficult the trek ahead would be {{en route to the}} gold fields, and chose to stay behind to supply goods and services to miners. Within weeks, stores, saloons, and offices lined the muddy streets of Skagway. The population was estimated at 8,000 residents during the spring of 1898 with approximately 1,000 prospective miners passing through town each week. By June 1898, with a population between 8,000 and 10,000, Skagway was the largest city in Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{emphasized}} the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. Jackson Pollock, for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the USFS <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> much its renovations had damaged an architecturally {{significant}} {{structure and}} {{began trying to}} undo {{some of the changes}} it had made. It developed a plan to restore the house and estate to a condition similar to the way it had been in Pinchot's era, in consultation with the Park Service's Harper's Ferry Center, and hired staff with expertise in landscape and architecture. After a brief closing for this renovation, it reopened on August 11, 2001, Gifford Pinchot's birthday. The state of Pennsylvania's Department of Natural Resources also made a $2 million grant available for renovations to the entrance, entry road and parking facilities. In 2007 the USFS restored the swimming pool.|$|E

25|$|In 1946, Welden was {{a sophomore}} at Bennington College in North Bennington, Vermont. Her college {{dormitory}} was Dewey House {{one of the older}} dormitories on the college grounds, and which remains to this day. She was an art major but, dissatisfied with the faculty and her progress, was contemplating changing her major; she had discovered a newfound love of botany. Welden, a typical student, was sorting out her own interests from those of her parents and was trying to expand her circle of friends. She and her roommate were quite close and both <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> dependent they were on one another for a social life. Paula started to befriend other students and became involved in square dancing and hiking with groups of friends from Bennington College and Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Kring {{designed}} the series {{to have an}} ever-shifting cast. However, his motivation changed when he <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> popular the original cast was with audiences; therefore, he brought back most of the first-season cast for the second season, with a few additions who received star billing. In its first season, the show features an ensemble cast of twelve main characters making it the third largest cast in American primetime television behind Desperate Housewives and Lost. Although NBC's first-season cast page listed only ten characters, Leonard Roberts, who {{first appeared in the}} series' fifth episode as D. L. Hawkins, was an additional member of the original full-time cast. In episode eleven of the first season, Jack Coleman, who portrays Noah Bennet, was upgraded from a recurring role to become the twelfth full-time cast member.|$|E
25|$|The BGP 001 was {{designed}} throughout 2008 and 2009 by Honda and then Brawn after the change over. It {{was designed}} by Loïc Bigois, in similar respects {{to all the other}} cars on the grid with a moulded carbon fibre and honeycomb composite monocoque and a front and rear wishbone and pushrod activated suspension system. Remarkably, it was revealed that the modifications made to the car to accommodate its Mercedes engine saw six inches removed from the rear end, severely compromising the car's center of gravity {{and by the time the}} team <b>realized</b> <b>how</b> much the car's balance had changed, there was no time to commission a new design. Ross Brawn also admitted that there were fundamental problems with the car, stating that it was too heavy, and that some of the parts were not good for the car.|$|E
