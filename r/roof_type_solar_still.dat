The design parameters affecting {{the performance of a}} stepped <b>type</b> <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> are depth of water, thickness of glass cover, insulation thickness, condensing cover material, shape of the absorber surface, absorbing material provided over the basin surface, angle of inclination of the still, enhancement of heat transfer etc. The climatic parameters include solar intensity, ambient temperature and wind velocity. The effect of various climatic parameters listed above on the distillate yield of different designs of stepped <b>type</b> <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> is presented in this paper. In this work, four number of stepped <b>type</b> <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> with different designs have been selected for studying the effect of climatic parameters like solar intensity, ambient temperature and wind velocity. The absorber area of each stepped <b>type</b> <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is 0. 5093 m 2. After conducting experiments for the different designs of stepped <b>type</b> <b>solar</b> <b>still,</b> it has been observed that the intensity of solar radiation goes on increasing from the morning hours with maximum occurring at noon and then it goes on decreasing in the afternoon hours. The hourly variation in ambient temperature follows the same trend as that of solar intensity. It has been observed that the distillate yield increases with increase in solar intensity and ambient air temperature. Also it has been observed that as the wind velocity over the <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> increases, the distillate yield of the <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> increases continuously...|$|R

50|$|The “wick” <b>type</b> <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is a glass-topped box {{constructed}} and held at angle to allow sunlight in. Salt water poured {{in from the}} top is heated by sunlight, evaporating the water. It condenses {{on the underside of}} the glass and drips to the bottom. A pool of brine in the still attached to the wicks which separates the water into banks to increase surface area for heating. The distilled water comes out of the bottom and depending on the quality of construction most of the salt has been purged from the water. The more wicks, the more heat can be transferred to the salt water and more product can be made. A plastic net can also catch salt water before it falls into the container and give it more time to heat up and separate into brine and water. The wick <b>type</b> <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is made vapor tight, as in the vapor does not escape to the atmosphere. To aid in absorbing more heat, some wicks are blackened to take in more heat. Glass’s absorption of heat is negligible compared to plastic at higher temperatures. A problem, depending on application, with glass is that it is not flexible if the <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is not a standard shape.|$|R

50|$|One <b>type</b> of <b>solar</b> {{desalination}} unit is a <b>solar</b> <b>still,</b> {{it is also}} {{similar to}} a condensation trap. A <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is a simple way of distilling water, using {{the heat of the}} Sun to drive evaporation from humid soil, and ambient air to cool a condenser film. Two basic <b>types</b> of <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> are box and pit <b>stills.</b> In a <b>solar</b> <b>still,</b> impure water is contained outside the collector, where it is evaporated by sunlight shining through clear plastic. The pure water vapor condenses on the cool inside plastic surface and drips down from the weighted low point, where it is collected and removed. The box type is more sophisticated. The basic principles of solar water distillation are simple, yet effective, as distillation replicates the way nature makes rain. The sun's energy heats water to the point of evaporation. As the water evaporates, water vapor rises, condensing on the glass surface for collection. This process removes impurities, such as salts and heavy metals, and eliminates microbiological organisms. The end result is water cleaner than the purest rainwater.|$|R

It is observed that water temperature plays a vital role in the distillate output (the yield) since it increases significantly with the rise of basin water temperature. Double slope step <b>type</b> <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> of area 1 m 2 is constructed using a glass pieces. Top Glass cover with 10 ° slope ensures a very good transmission of solar radiation inside the still. The distillate water productivity is in the range of 2. 758 litres to 2. 805 liters per day for still performance study. Similarly the instantaneous efficiency for still performance study is in the range of 17. 84 % to 18. 25 %. Dimensionless numbers such as the Nusselt number (Nu), the Grashof number (Gr), the Reynolds number (Re) and the Prandtl number (Pr) were also estimated. Heat transfer coefficient were estimated for the present system since the system overall efficiency depend on heat transfer modes. Internal (convection, evaporation and radiation) and external (convection, conduction and radiation) heat transfer modes were calculated for the present system and it is found that because of rise in water temperature, evaporative heat transfer coefficient value rises significantly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the experimental work conducted on Conventional Basin <b>type</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Still</b> {{in order to}} investigate the effect of some design and operating parameters {{on the performance of}} the still. The vapour leakage from the still may significantly vary the performance, lot of literature can be found on this topic. The misalignment or crookedness of distillate channel may be seemingly ignorable, but has significant effect on the distillate output, this aspect has been investigated in this work. So far no reasonable work has been done on this aspect. The effect of still wall inner lining colour, which is normally black or white, has also been studied. The condensed distillate droplets on the glass cover cause the scattering and reflection of the incident solar radiation on the still and thus reduce the total incident energy on the still basin. This aspect has also not been experimentally or theoretically investigated significantly by the researchers so far. The experimental study on this aspect is also presented in this paper. It was observed that the <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> with black inner wall and basin lining was operating at higher basin water, glass cover and inside air temperatures as compared to that with white inner wall lining and black basin lining. Around 10 % more distillate output was obtained in black lined still. The effect of the crookedness of the distillate channel was found to be quite significant. A small 5 o upward bend in the mid length of the channel gave a decrease in distillate yield by around 22 % in case of black lined still while around 15 % lower yield was obtained in white lined still. Due to the scattering of incident solar radiation caused by the condensed distillate droplets on the glass cover nearly 9 % lesser distillate output was obtained as compared to the condition of clear glass cover...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> of 1 m 2 area {{consists}} of {{upper and lower}} chambers separated by a thin cupper sheet that was built for indoor experimental purposes. The <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> has the advantage, over the conventional basin and tilted wick <b>type</b> <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> of recycling the condensation heat of distillate to heat up the saline water feed and the wet tilted wick. The tilted still surface was covered with black thin textile. The feed water is fed to the lower chamber in a serpentine tube to the upper chamber of the still where water is collected in a weir from which is distributed on the textile. While water is descending down the still; is heated up by solar radiation and evaporated. A stream of air is blown to the upper chamber counter currently to the descending water and used to carry up the water vapor and circulated {{to the bottom of}} the solar heated surface where it loses its energy to heat up the middle sheet still surface as well as the serpentine tube carrying the saline feed water. Large part of water vapor is condensed at lower part of the still and collected in a container outside of the lower chamber. The vapor remained in air stream is further condenses in an external heat exchanger. The steady state distillate yield and temperature variations as a function of air flow rate were determined experimentally for single, double glass, metal cover and metal cover covered with glass. The productivity of the still at 670 W/m 2. h simulated incident radiation; For condensation energy recycled is around, 1 kg. /m 2. h for double glass cover, 0. 75 for single glass cover, 0. 7 kg. /m 2. h for metal cover and 0. 98 kg. /m 2. h for metal cover covered further by glass cover. For no recycling of the condensation energy, the productivity is around, 0. 5 kg/m 2. h for double glass, 0. 45 kg/m 2. h for single glass cover, 0. 36 kg/m 2. h for metal cover, and 0. 425 kg. /m 2. h for metal cover covered further by glass cover...|$|R

Solar distillation (desalination) of salt water is suitable for supplying water for drinking and agricultural purposes to small communities where the supply of fresh water is inadequate or of poor quality and where solar radiation is abundant. Historical reviews and theoretical developments of solar distillation, including the physical and technical results of the various designs and configurations, are reported. This research is confined mainly to one <b>type</b> of <b>solar</b> <b>still,</b> an inclined free flow flat plate <b>solar</b> <b>still.</b> To study the effect of significant parameters, a mathematical two dimensional flow analysis was carried out based on continuity, momentum and energy equations for liquid and vapour flow. It is presented together with an iterative computational procedure. A dimensional set of equations is developed and solved by the Runge-Kutta method. It is shown that the Significant parameters of the combined two phase flow are the film thickness, the liquid flow rate, the collector length and inclination and the solar radiation. A small scale free flow flat plate <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> was designed and constructed, and experimental studies conducted under laboratory and direct solar conditions to investigate features which would seem to affect the still performance such as solar radiation, wind velocity, ambient air temperature, liquid flow rate and angle of inclination.
