5|$|The {{years of}} {{conflict}} which {{resulted from the}} Theban attempts to reorganise Greece had left {{much of the country}} war-weary and exhausted; a general peace (excluding only a recalcitrant Sparta) was therefore concluded between all the states of Greece in the aftermath of Mantinea. With the death of Epaminondas and significant loss of manpower at Mantinea, the Thebans returned to their more traditional defensive policy, and within a few years, Athens had replaced them at the pinnacle of the Greek political system, and Theban influence faded quickly in the rest of Greece. It was the Athenians, and their second confederacy, who would be Macedon's main rivals for control of the lands of the north Aegean, and a major theme during the period was the <b>regular</b> <b>state</b> of war between Macedon and Athens.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} some classical and frustrated lattice spin models with global O(3) spin symmetry. There is no general analytical method {{to find a}} ground-state if the spin dependence of the Hamiltonian is more than quadratic (i. e. beyond the Heisenberg model) and/or if the lattice {{has more than one}} site per unit cell. To deal with these situations, we introduce a family of variational spin configurations, dubbed "regular states", which respect all the lattice symmetries modulo global O(3) spin transformations (rotations and/or spin flips). The construction of these states is explicited through a group theoretical approach, and all the <b>regular</b> <b>states</b> on the square, triangular, honeycomb and kagome lattices are listed. Their equal time structure factors and powder-averages are shown for comparison with experiments. All the well known Néel states with 2 or 3 sublattices appear amongst <b>regular</b> <b>states</b> on various lattices, but the <b>regular</b> <b>states</b> also encompass exotic non-planar states with cubic, tetrahedral or cuboctahedral geometry of the T= 0 order parameter. Whatever the details of the Hamiltonian (with the same symmetry group), a large fraction of these <b>regular</b> <b>states</b> are energetically stationary with respect to small deviations of the spins. In fact these <b>regular</b> <b>states</b> appear as exact ground-states in a very large range of parameter space of the simplest models that we have been looking at. As examples, we display the variational phase diagrams of the J 1 -J 2 -J 3 Heisenberg model on all the previous lattices {{as well as that of}} the J 1 -J 2 -K ring-exchange model on square and triangular lattices.

25|$|The {{elections}} for the Second Confederate Congress {{took place at the}} time of the <b>regular</b> <b>state</b> and local elections held in each state. As a result, their dates ranged from May 1863 and May 1864. Only Virginia's on May 28, 1863 was held before the reverses at Vicksburg and Gettysburg, and it had a turnover of forty percent. The war was going badly for the South during the other elections, and citizens were adversely affected by conscription, taxes, food supply and the economy generally. Unlike the earlier personality contests over most enthusiastic support of secession in the elections to the First Congress, Congressmen facing re-election had roll-call voting records that they had to defend. In Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas, the state delegations saw a turnover of half or more. At the time of elections in each state, just over forty percent of the House was occupied or disrupted by Union forces, yet the fragmentary Congressional results from army and refugee camps were accepted as representative of the majority of residents in each state, a practice that one historian has called delusional.|$|E
25|$|At the {{instigation}} of Christian Friedrich Schönbein, the Voluntary Museum Association of Basel (Freiwilliger Museumsverein) {{was initiated}} in 1850 as {{the successor to}} an earlier association founded in 1841 {{for the construction of}} the museum. Modelled after the Royal Institution in London, it was established to “stimulate the appreciation of science and art”. Open to all residents of Basel, the association promoted the collections with financial means and sought to generate interest in the museum through public lectures to which women were also admitted. It was unable to sustain the initial enthusiasm, however, and experienced losses in membership despite Basel’s rapid population growth {{in the latter half of}} the century. The museum did not embrace the function of popular education that had been promoted by its founders and supporters. The ideational socialization role of the museum was very slow to proceed, with the museum long holding onto former organizational structures. The art collection furthermore did not get an academically trained conservator until 1887. In addition, the renewed University Act of 1866 discontinued <b>regular</b> <b>state</b> appropriations for the antiquarian, medieval and art collections and left them dependent on proceeds from entry fees and the support of associations and private individuals, the most significant of these being the Birrmann Foundation and the Emilie Linder Foundation on behalf of the art collection. It was this support that enabled an active collection policy that went beyond the receipt of inherited cultural assets.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} the semiclassical, or Wigner, measures associated to <b>regular</b> <b>states</b> that {{act on the}} tensor product of a unitary C*-representation of the Heisenberg group of arbitrary dimension, and a C*-algebra A. The Wigner measures are identified with the cluster points of (generalized) sequences of <b>regular</b> <b>states,</b> indexed by the semiclassical parameter h→ 0. All the measures are vector-valued, with values in the positive continuous functionals of A. If the Heisenberg group is infinite dimensional, the Wigner measures are cylindrical measures, i. e. finitely additive measures on the algebra of (dual) cylinders. Our analysis shows that, for infinite-dimensional Heisenberg groups, the semiclassical structure that emerges in the limit is richer than in the finite-dimensional case. Comment: 38 pages.

In his first biennial speech, Johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system, abolition of the Bank of Tennessee, and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures; the last was passed. Johnson was critical of the Tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes, either statewide or county by county—a mixture of the two was passed.

Giant Bombs Dan Ryckert referred to Resident Evil 7 as the reinvigoration of earlier components in the series {{while at the same time}} yielding a fresh outlook with a yet-unrivaled story. The main antagonists bore substantial weight to Ryckert's cause for worry, and gave way to thrills when prompted to flee them. He viewed the first-person perspective as [...] "bold", and attributed to the PlayStation VR, an earnest addition to the [...] "scare factor". Chloi Rad of IGN endorsed the pervading tone of eeriness in the game, owed entirely to the plantation, which she thought was [...] "one of the creepiest single settings since the Spencer Mansion". Also, she observed that the game world gave off a robust sense of place with unwavering exploration.
