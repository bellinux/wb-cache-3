5|$|The 57 <b>raids</b> {{were all}} between 1940 and 1944 and were mostly against targets in France, which had 36 <b>raids.</b> There were 12 <b>raids</b> in Norway, seven <b>raids</b> in the Channel Islands and one each in Belgium and the Netherlands. The <b>raids</b> {{met with a}} mixture of fortunes. Operation Chariot—the raid against dock {{installations}} at Saint-Nazaire—has since been called the greatest raid of all. Others, like Operation Aquatint and Operation Musketoon, resulted in the capture or death of all the commandos involved.|$|E
5|$|Air <b>raids</b> by the EEF {{were carried}} out during the night of 1/2 November, with twelve bombs being dropped on Gaza, and on 3 and 4 November, with air <b>raids</b> over the hills north of Beersheba.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{conducted}} many air <b>raids</b> on Japan during World War II, causing extensive destruction to the country's {{cities and}} killing between 241,000 and 900,000 people. During {{the first years}} of the Pacific War these attacks were limited to the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 and small-scale <b>raids</b> on military positions in the Kuril Islands from mid-1943. Strategic bombing <b>raids</b> began in June 1944 and continued until the end of the war in August 1945. Allied naval and land-based tactical air units also attacked Japan during 1945.|$|E
5000|$|Nested <b>RAID</b> {{levels are}} usually {{numbered}} using {{a series of}} numbers, where {{the most commonly used}} levels use two numbers. The first number in the numeric designation denotes the lowest <b>RAID</b> level in the [...] "stack", while the rightmost one denotes the highest layered <b>RAID</b> level; for example, <b>RAID</b> 50 layers the data striping of <b>RAID</b> 0 on top of the distributed parity of <b>RAID</b> 5. Nested <b>RAID</b> levels include <b>RAID</b> 01, <b>RAID</b> 10, <b>RAID</b> 100, <b>RAID</b> 50 and <b>RAID</b> 60, which all combine data striping with other <b>RAID</b> techniques; {{as a result of the}} layering scheme, <b>RAID</b> 01 and <b>RAID</b> 10 represent significantly different nested <b>RAID</b> levels.|$|R
50|$|Intel Matrix <b>RAID</b> {{is not a}} new <b>RAID</b> level. It allows {{different}} areas (e.g. partitions or logical volumes) on the same disk to be assigned to different <b>RAID</b> devices, unlike some other <b>RAID</b> controllers. The ICH10R supports <b>RAID</b> 0, <b>RAID</b> 1, <b>RAID</b> 10, and <b>RAID</b> 5.|$|R
5000|$|Linux's md {{supports}} <b>RAID</b> 0, <b>RAID</b> 1, <b>RAID</b> 4, <b>RAID</b> 5, <b>RAID</b> 6, and all nestings. Certain reshaping/resizing/expanding {{operations are}} also supported.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, {{for the first time since}} the Napoleonic Wars, the {{population}} of the British Isles was in danger of attack from naval <b>raids.</b> The country also came under attack from air <b>raids</b> by zeppelins and fixed-wing aircraft, another first.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Germans {{carried out}} 51 airship <b>raids</b> and 52 {{fixed-wing}} bomber <b>raids</b> on England, which together dropped 280 tons of bombs. The casualties amounted to 1,413 killed, and 3,409 wounded. The success of anti-air defence measures was limited; of the 397 aircraft {{that had taken}} part in <b>raids,</b> only 24 Gothas were shot down (though 37 more were lost in accidents), despite an estimated rate of 14,540 anti-air rounds per aircraft. Anti-zeppelin defences were more successful, with 17 shot down and 21 lost in accidents.|$|E
5|$|French and Wabanaki Confederacy raiding {{activity}} {{continued in}} northern Massachusetts in 1705, {{against which the}} English colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. The <b>raids</b> happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal <b>raids</b> usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a lull in the raiding while the French and English leaders negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success. <b>Raids</b> by Indians persisted {{until the end of}} the war, sometimes with French participation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>RAID</b> 100, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} <b>RAID</b> 10+0, is a stripe of <b>RAID</b> 10s. This is logically {{equivalent to a}} wider <b>RAID</b> 10 array, but is generally implemented using software <b>RAID</b> 0 over hardware <b>RAID</b> 10. Being [...] "striped two ways", <b>RAID</b> 100 {{is described as a}} [...] "plaid RAID".|$|R
50|$|<b>RAID</b> 10, {{also called}} <b>RAID</b> 1+0 and {{sometimes}} <b>RAID</b> 1&0, {{is similar to}} <b>RAID</b> 01 with an exception that two used standard <b>RAID</b> levels are layered in the opposite order; thus, <b>RAID</b> 10 is a stripe of mirrors.|$|R
50|$|<b>RAID</b> 60, {{also called}} <b>RAID</b> 6+0, {{combines}} the straight block-level striping of <b>RAID</b> 0 with the distributed double parity of <b>RAID</b> 6, {{resulting in a}} <b>RAID</b> 0 array striped across <b>RAID</b> 6 elements. It requires at least eight disks.|$|R
5|$|The Welsh border {{situation}} remained unsettled however, and in {{the decades}} after 1250 security grew significantly worse, as the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd conducted numerous <b>raids</b> into English territories. The Wye valley and Goodrich were particularly affected by these <b>raids.</b>|$|E
5|$|The day {{had been}} bad for the Luftwaffe. Losses {{amounted}} to 18 Ju 52s; four belonged to III./KG.z.b.V 1. <b>Raids</b> by RAF Vickers Wellington bombers continued during the night. Ju 88 night fighters from NJG 2 downed two Wellingtons. The results of the <b>raids</b> are not known.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} raiding force {{depended}} on the objective. The smallest raid was conducted by two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest was the 10,500 man Operation Jubilee. Most of the <b>raids</b> were scheduled to only last overnight although some, like Operation Gauntlet, were conducted {{over a number of}} days. In north west Europe there were 57 <b>raids</b> made between 1940 and 1944. Of these 36 were against targets in France. There were 12 <b>raids</b> against Norway, seven <b>raids</b> in the Channel Islands, and single <b>raids</b> were made in Belgium and the Netherlands. The success of the <b>raids</b> varied; Operation Chariot, the raid against dock installations at St Nazaire, has been hailed as the greatest raid of all time, but others, like Operation Aquatint and Operation Musketoon, resulted in the capture or death of all involved. The smaller <b>raids</b> ended in mid-1944 on the orders of Major General Robert Laycock, who suggested that they were no longer as effective and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, something that could be extremely detrimental to Allied plans.|$|E
5000|$|Btrfs {{supports}} <b>RAID</b> 0, <b>RAID</b> 1 and <b>RAID</b> 10 (<b>RAID</b> 5 and 6 {{are under}} development).|$|R
5000|$|<b>RAID</b> 50, {{also called}} <b>RAID</b> 5+0, {{combines}} the straight block-level striping of <b>RAID</b> 0 with the distributed parity of <b>RAID</b> 5. [...] As a <b>RAID</b> 0 array striped across <b>RAID</b> 5 elements, minimal <b>RAID</b> 50 configuration requires six drives. On {{the right is}} an example where three collections of 120 GB <b>RAID</b> 5s are striped together to make 720 GB of total storage space.|$|R
50|$|After the <b>Raid</b> on St. Stephen, Church {{moved on}} to <b>raid</b> other Acadian villages in the <b>Raid</b> on Grand Pré, the <b>Raid</b> on Piziquid, and the <b>Raid</b> on Chignecto.|$|R
5|$|Warfare was not {{uncommon}} in the Yavapai world, and they made changing alliances for security. Wi:pukba (Wipukepa) and Guwevkabaya (Kwevkepaya) bands formed alliances with Western Apache bands, to attack and defend against <b>raids</b> by the Pima and Maricopa bands from the south. Because of the greater strength of the Pima/Maricopa, Yavapai/Apache <b>raids</b> generally conducted small-scale quick <b>raids,</b> followed by a retreat to avoid counter-attack. The Yavapai defended their lands against Pima incursions, when the Pima would invade to harvest saguaro fruits.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Major-General Charles Blackader {{left the}} {{division}} on medical grounds {{and was replaced}} by Major-General Thomas Cubitt. The division received replacements for casualties, disbanded the sniper company and engaged in rifle training. Once back on the line, the division return to its previous routine of static warfare: conducting patrols and <b>raids,</b> as well as being subjected to <b>raids</b> and artillery bombardments.|$|E
5|$|Australians {{participated in}} attacks on German defences in France {{in the weeks}} before D-Day. No.453 Squadron made four <b>raids</b> on radar {{stations}} in late May and early June, and RAAF pilots serving with British fighter and fighter-bomber squadrons took part in other such attacks. The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons contributed aircraft to <b>raids</b> on radar stations and communications facilities in the week before the landing. These units also struck German coastal batteries along the channel coast on nine occasions between 8 and 29 May; Australians serving with British light bomber units took part in a further 14 <b>raids</b> on German batteries. The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF light and heavy bomber units also participated in <b>raids</b> against German Army camps in France and Belgium during May. The Australian squadrons suffered heavy losses in several of these attacks, including seven aircraft lost during a raid on the 21stPanzer Division's facilities at Mailly-le-Camp on the night of 3/4 May. In addition to these attacks on German positions, Bomber Command struck the seven largest German munitions factories and ammunition dumps in France during late April and early May; the four Australian squadrons participated in five of these operations, and no Australian aircraft were lost.|$|E
5000|$|This term is also {{associated}} with <b>RAID</b> levels that perform actual write operations as atomic read-modify-write sequences. [...] Such <b>RAID</b> levels include <b>RAID</b> 4, <b>RAID</b> 5 and <b>RAID</b> 6.|$|R
5000|$|JBOD <b>RAID</b> N+N: With JBOD (just a {{bunch of}} disks), it is {{possible}} to concatenate disks, but also volumes such as <b>RAID</b> sets. With larger drive capacities, write and rebuilding time may increase dramatically (especially, as described above, with <b>RAID</b> 5 and <b>RAID</b> 6). By splitting larger <b>RAID</b> sets into smaller subsets and concatenating them with JBOD, write and rebuilding time may be reduced. If a hardware <b>RAID</b> controller is not capable of nesting JBOD with <b>RAID,</b> then JBOD can be achieved with software <b>RAID</b> in combination with <b>RAID</b> set volumes offered by the hardware <b>RAID</b> controller. There is another advantage in the form of disaster recovery, if a small <b>RAID</b> subset fails, then the data on the other <b>RAID</b> subsets is not lost, reducing restore time.|$|R
5000|$|FreeBSD {{supports}} <b>RAID</b> 0, <b>RAID</b> 1, <b>RAID</b> 3, and <b>RAID</b> 5, and all nestings via GEOM modules and ccd.|$|R
5|$|Commando <b>raids</b> {{during the}} Second World War became so {{effective}} that by October 1942 Adolf Hitler issued the Commando Order, which required {{the execution of}} all commandos captured.|$|E
5|$|Commando <b>raids</b> {{were made}} by the Western Allies during much of the Second World War against the Atlantic Wall. The <b>raids</b> were {{conducted}} by the armed forces of Britain, the Commonwealth and a small number of men from the occupied territories serving with No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando during the Second World War. All the operations took place between the Arctic Circle in Norway to the French border with Spain, along what was known as the Atlantic Wall.|$|E
5|$|Due to Zog's {{concerns}} about safety during air <b>raids,</b> the ladies' cloakroom was {{converted into a}} private shelter for the Albanians. Following an air raid, when a bomb fell between the Ritz and the Berkeley in Piccadilly, shattering glass in the Ritz, most of the Albanian royal family moved to Chelsea, but Zog remained until the spring of 1941 until he was offered Lord Parmoor's house in Buckinghamshire. In total, the Ritz was damaged nine times during bombing <b>raids,</b> and the Restaurant had to be closed twice.|$|E
50|$|The RAIDXpert is {{a remote}} <b>RAID</b> {{configuration}} tool, {{for changing the}} <b>RAID</b> level of the <b>RAID</b> setup connected via SATA 3.0 Gbit/s ports (connected to SB600, excluding extra SATA 3.0 Gbit/s ports through additional SATA chip on some motherboard implementations), including <b>RAID</b> 0, <b>RAID</b> 1, and <b>RAID</b> 0+1.|$|R
50|$|Infortrend {{has been}} a leader in the storage market, {{launching}} the world's first 8Gbit/s Fibre Channel-host (FC-host) <b>RAID</b> array, the world's first 16Gbit/s FC-host <b>RAID</b> array, 2.5"-drive <b>RAID</b> array, SAS-drive <b>RAID</b> array and SATA-drive <b>RAID</b> array.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, Fusil {{left the}} <b>Raid</b> {{to begin a}} new {{adventure}} race series, the Elf Authentic Adventure. Patrick Brignoli and Alain Gaimard continued to organize the <b>Raid</b> with their company RGO and Saga d'Aventures (The 1997 <b>Raid</b> in Ecuador was the first <b>raid</b> organized without Fusil). 2003 was {{the last year for}} the <b>Raid</b> Gauloises. In 2004 the <b>Raid</b> Gauloises was retooled into the <b>Raid</b> World Championship.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of Japanese air {{opposition}} to the American bomber <b>raids,</b> VIIFighter Command was solely tasked with ground attack missions from July. These <b>raids</b> were frequently made against airfields to destroy aircraft being held in reserve to attack the expected Allied invasion fleet. While the P-51 pilots only occasionally encountered Japanese fighters in the air, the airfields were protected by anti-aircraft batteries and barrage balloons. By the end of the war, VIIFighter Command had conducted 51 ground attack <b>raids,</b> of which 41 were considered successful. The fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed or damaged 1,062 aircraft and 254 ships along with large numbers of buildings and railway rolling stock. American losses were 91 pilots killed and 157 Mustangs destroyed.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{a series}} of Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands took place between November 1944 and January 1945. These <b>raids</b> {{targeted}} United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bases and sought to disrupt the bombing of Japan by B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers operating from the islands. The Japanese lost 37 aircraft during this operation, but destroyed 11 B-29s and damaged a further 43. Preparations were also made for commando <b>raids</b> on the bases in early and mid-1945 but these did not go ahead.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{between the}} evening of 25April and the early morning of 27April 1942, Bath {{suffered}} three air <b>raids</b> in reprisal for RAF <b>raids</b> on the German cities of Lübeck and Rostock, part of the Luftwaffe campaign popularly known as the Baedeker Blitz. Over 400people were killed, and more than 19,000buildings were damaged or destroyed. Houses in the Royal Crescent, Circus and Paragon were burnt out along with the Assembly Rooms, while part of {{the south side of}} Queen Square was destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|The final array {{is known}} as the top array. When the top array is <b>RAID</b> 0 (such as in <b>RAID</b> 1+0 and <b>RAID</b> 5+0), most vendors omit the [...] "+" [...] (yielding <b>RAID</b> 10 and <b>RAID</b> 50, respectively).|$|R
25|$|During Queen Anne's War, in {{response}} to the French <b>Raid</b> on Deerfield, New Englander Major Benjamin Church <b>raided</b> the Acadian village of Castine before gathering at Mount Desert Island with other ships to continue with the <b>Raid</b> on St. Stephen, <b>Raid</b> on Grand Pré, the <b>Raid</b> on Piziquid, and the <b>Raid</b> on Chignecto.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{traditional}} nested <b>RAID</b> configurations, such as <b>RAID</b> 51 (a {{mirror of}} <b>RAID</b> 5 groups), are not configurable in ZFS. Vdevs {{can only be}} composed of raw disks or files, not other vdevs. However, a ZFS pool effectively creates a stripe (<b>RAID</b> 0) across its vdevs, so {{the equivalent of a}} <b>RAID</b> 50 or <b>RAID</b> 60 is common.|$|R
