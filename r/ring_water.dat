In this work, a miniature test cell for PEM electrolysis is presented that hugely increases data throughput in comparison to contemporary cell tests.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{idealized}} numerical experiments {{is presented to}} study the evolution of an Agulhas ring. The modeled ring is a circular symmetric idealization of ring Astrid, as measured by a cruise in March 2000. In particular, the hypothesis is tested that mixing is mainly due to cross-frontal secondary circulations. Both the role of beta-decay and shear instabilities in setting-up cross-frontal mixing is studied. The largest mixing of <b>ring</b> <b>water</b> with its surroundings occurs in the first months after shedding when the heat loss is maximal. Therefore, it is tested whether buoyancy forcing is able to enhance cross-frontal circulations. It is concluded that for realistic initial conditions the observed decay can {{be accounted for by}} adiabatic decay associated with cross-frontal circulations. The adiabatic decay appears to be a nonlinear function of the ring strength, possibly enhanced by the instability of the ring. The relative decay for weaker, stable rings is more than twice as weak. For a wide parameter range all modeled rings are unstable for a mode- 2 perturbation and split. Observations suggest that most rings do not split and are not as unstable as suggested by the model. What causes this mismatch and how it a#ects the decay rate is still unclear. Realistic cooling is observed to slightly retard the split and marginally stabilize the ring. The decay rate is enhanced with typically 30 %. For weaker rings the impact of cooling becomes less...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Water {{inhibits}} sorption of uncharged {{organic compounds}} on montmorillonites saturated with small alkylammonium cations such as tetramethylammonium (TMA) and trimethylphenylammonium (TMPA). As {{a first step}} toward understanding the mechanism by which water inhibits arene sorption on TMA- and TMPA-montmorillonites, infrared spectroscopy and water sorption isotherm experiments were conducted to determine whether water preferentially hydrates adsorbed TMA and TMPA cations rather than the siloxane surface. Infrared spectra of normal-charge and reduced-charge TMA- and TMPA-mont-morillonites were obtained at partial water vapor pressures from 0. 075 to 0. 92 to determine if water vapor hydrates the adsorbed cations. Water adsorbed at partial pressures from 0 to about 0. 2 caused the wave-number position of the HOH deformation vibration of adsorbed water to shift 4 to 10 cm 1 to higher wavenumber and the methyl deformation vibrations of adsorbed TMA and TMPA cations to shift 1 to 2 cm 1 to higher wavenumber, providing evidence that water interacts directly with adsorbed TMA and TMPA ions. There were no shifts in the ring stretching or C-H out-of-plane vibrations of TMPA, which indicates that water interacts with the methyl groups of TMPA, not with TMPA's aromatic <b>ring.</b> <b>Water</b> vapor sorption isotherms showed that normal-charge montmorillonites adsorb more water than do reduced-charge montmorillonites, consistent with the higher concentration of adsorbed cations on normal-charge clay. More water was adsorbed by TMA-montmorillonite han by TMPA-montmorillonite, consistent with the higher hydration energy of TMA. Thus, both the infrared and sorption isotherm results show that water preferentially hydrates adsorbed TMA and TMPA, not the siloxane surface of montmorillonite...|$|E

As a rule, for shopping centers with a lot of water consumers it is necessary to make not less than three inputs, each of them should be connected to different areas of {{an external}} <b>ring</b> <b>water</b> supply system {{in order to make the}} work of the system more reliable. The places for water folding fittings in shopping centers are the following. The water folding devices: mixers are placed in sanitary cabins of shopping centers. Usually, for for water saving in buildings with a big pass-through capacity per hour it is reasonable to use contactless mixers, which are turned on upon raising a hand with a help of motion sensor or light sensor. Another important argument in favor of such mixers is prevention of infections spread for the reason that the consumer doesn't touch the device, so, the risk of bacteria transmission via the device decreases. Such mixer supplies water with a demanded expense and temperature. As a rule, water for such mixers moves from the centralized internal water supply system of hot water, mixing up with cold water. If there is no centralized hot water supply system, it is possible to use hot water storage heaters in case of a small number of visitors or to reject mixers at all in favor of the cranes giving water of only one temperature (cold), which is also practiced. For the branch of economic and household the water receivers are used, which are present in sanitary cabins in most cases by toilet bowls, wash basins, urinals...|$|E
40|$|In a numerical, isopycnal, ocean {{model the}} mixing is {{investigated}} {{with the environment}} of two idealized Agulhas rings, one that splits, and one that remains coherent. The evolution of a passive tracer, initially contained within the rings, shows that tracer leakage {{is associated with the}} formation of filaments in the early stage of ring evolution. These filaments reach down to the thermocline. In the deepest layers leakage occurs on a larger scale. Self-advection of the rings is very irregular, and {{it is not possible to}} compute a Lagrangian boundary in order to estimate the transport of leakage from the rings. To describe the processes that govern tracer leakage, in a coordinate frame moving with the ring a kinematic separatrix is defined in the streamfunction field for the nondivergent flow. Initially, filaments arise because of the elongation of the ring, which is mainly governed by an m � 2 instability that is collaborating with differential rotation. Because of beta, the symmetry is destroyed related to the separatrix associated with a stagnation point in the flow. The filament upstream of the stagnation point grows much faster and is associated with the bulk of tracer leakage. Mixing is enhanced by time dependence of the separatrix. As a result, there are no large differences between the leakage from a coherent ring, where the m � 2 instability equilibrates, and from a splitting ring, where the m � 2 instability keeps growing, which confirms that the amount of leakage is mainly governed by the ring’s initial deformation combined with unsteady self-advection of the ring and not by the splitting of the ring. The decay of tracer content in the thermocline shows that in the first months up to 40 % of the <b>ring</b> <b>water</b> can be mixed with the environment.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The water {{saturation}} of {{a natural}} snow cover varies, in general, from zero to approxi-mately 20 % of the pore volume, whereby two essentially different types of water geometry- pendu-lar mode and funicular mode- can be observed. The pendular mode covers the low-saturation range (typically S:s; 7 % for old coarse grainded Alpine snow) and {{it is assumed that}} the water component is arranged in isolated menisci or pendular rings around a contact zone between spheroidal ice grains. However, the <b>water</b> <b>rings</b> or menisci are, thennodynamically, in a very critical- may be in an unstable- configuration. As <b>water</b> <b>rings</b> or menisci represent closed electrically conducting loops, they may be responsible for an induced diamagnetic behaviour of snow, especially in the microwave regime; and this offers a way to measure the amount of water stored in this geometrical configuration. From a carefull analysis of the measured dielectric and magnetic penneability in the microwave C to K-bands of moderate wet coarse grained Alpine snow results, that <b>water</b> <b>rings</b> seem only to exist at saturations lower than ~ 8 %. For saturations exceeding this critical value, <b>water</b> <b>rings</b> begin to merge fonning clusters, whereby the number of ring-like geometries decreases in favour of larger but open-ended structures...|$|R
