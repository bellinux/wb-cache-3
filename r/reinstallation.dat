5|$|A severe {{fire at the}} Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration train and manual operation had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle train on track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train on Track 1 was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The <b>reinstallation</b> of Track 3 was delayed {{because of the need}} to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision was not made concerning whether or not the automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 Francis D'Arcy-Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, died, leaving Conisbrough to his nephew, Sackville Lane-Fox, the Baron Conyers. The keep {{remained}} in good condition, but by 1884 {{it was apparent}} that repairs were needed and the antiquarian George Clark recommended urgent work to repair the stonework. If finances allowed it, he also urged the <b>reinstallation</b> of a roof and wooden floors. Limited repairs were subsequently approved by the trustees of Lord Conyers, although Clark's colleague, A. Ellis, expressed concerns that railings to protect the visitors who routinely {{climbed to the top of}} the keep had not been funded. A reported £500 was spent by the trustees renovating the castle ruins, including the construction of a lodge in the outer bailey for the castle keeper, completed in 1885, and improvements to the footpaths.|$|E
5|$|Stations {{along the}} three-tracked {{stretch of the}} Culver Line are being renovated until early 2018 (excluding Ditmas Avenue and the {{northbound}} platform of Avenue X, which were rehabilitated in 2015–2016), with the center track being used to bypass closed stations. The Coney Island-bound platforms were rehabiliated between June 7, 2016 and May 1, 2017 (May 8 for Avenue U and Avenue X). During {{the second phase of}} the project, beginning on May 22, 2017, the Manhattan-bound platforms will be closed between Avenue U and 18th Avenue until early 2018. Even after the rehabilitation, though, peak-direction express service between Church Avenue and Kings Highway will not be restored due to limitations caused by current track configurations, as the switches at Kings Highway previously used were removed in the 1990s. The interlocking at Kings Highway is scheduled to be modernized as part of the 2020–2024 MTA Capital Plan, and the modernization could include the <b>reinstallation</b> of the necessary track switches.|$|E

50|$|Born at Vendrest (Seine-et-Marne), {{he formed}} his style {{working in the}} Manufacture royale des Gobelins {{organized}} by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who {{saw to it that}} he was admitted to the newly founded French Academy at Rome in 1675. Following the successive <b>reinstallations</b> of the Academy, in the company of his wife, Théodon remained in Rome for three decades, working for the popes at the Lateran and the Basilica of St. Peter, and above all for the Jesuits. After a brief visit to Paris in 1704, he returned once and for all in 1705, to participate, among sculptors of greater renown, in the installation of the Chapelle Royale at Versailles under the general direction of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, whose last major project this was, and the more immediate supervision of Robert de Cotte.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{collection}} at the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, illustrates concepts of race {{in the development of}} museums in Canada from before Confederation to today. Located at intersections of Art History, Museology, Postcolonial Studies and Native Studies, this thesis uses discourse theory to trouble definitions of nation and problematize them as inherently racial constructs wherein 'Canadianness' is institutionalized as a dominant white, Euro-Canadian discourse that mediates belonging. The recent <b>reinstallations</b> of the permanent Canadian historical art galleries at the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts are significant in their illustration of contemporary colonial collection practices. The effectiveness of each installation is discussed in relation to the demands and resistances raised by Indigenous and non-Native artists and cultural professionals over the last 40 years, against racist treatment of Indigenous arts...|$|R
5|$|In January 2006 Queen Mary 2 {{embarked}} on a circumnavigation of South America. Upon departure from Fort Lauderdale, one of her propeller pods was damaged when it struck a channel wall, forcing the ship to sail at a reduced speed, which resulted in Commodore Warwick's decision to skip several calls on its voyage to Rio de Janeiro. Many of her passengers threatened to stage a sit-in protest because of the missed calls, before Cunard offered to refund the voyage costs. Queen Mary 2 continued to operate at a reduced service speed and several itinerary changes were necessary until repairs had been completed after the ship returned to Europe in June, where Queen Mary 2 {{paid a visit to}} dry dock and the damaged propeller pod was unseated. In November, Queen Mary 2 was drydocked once more at the Blohm + Voss yard in Hamburg (drydock Elbe 17) for the <b>reinstallation</b> of the repaired propeller pod. At the same time, sprinkler systems were installed in all of the vessel's balconies to comply with new safety regulations which had come into effect since the MS Star Princess fire. Additionally, both bridge wings were extended by two metres to improve visibility.|$|E

25|$|Following a {{successful}} campaign to raise £2.3 {{million for a}} full restoration and <b>reinstallation</b> of the organ, the original organ builders, Harrison & Harrison, finally completed the <b>reinstallation</b> on 29 August 2013. Further work including re-balancing the pipework followed and was completed {{in time for the}} re-inauguration of the organ on 18 March 2014, exactly 60 years since it was first inaugurated. The first orchestral and organ concert was on 26 March 2014 and was recorded for the London Philharmonic Orchestra's own live label. The organ remains the third largest organ in Great Britain by number of pipes, with 7,866 pipes and 103 speaking stops.|$|E
5000|$|From 1990 to 2002 Storr was Curator, then Senior Curator, in the Department of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art. As a curator, Storr {{made his}} mark early {{with a number of}} major {{exhibitions}} at MoMA and elsewhere, which enhanced the public prominence of such artists as Elizabeth Murray, Gerhard Richter, Max Beckmann, Tony Smith and Robert Ryman. He also organized a number of <b>reinstallations</b> of MoMA's permanent collection, covering such topics as abstraction and the modern grotesque. From 2002 to 2006 he was the first Rosalie Solow Professor of Modern Art at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. He is considered {{to be one of the}} most influential Americans in the art world. [...] Storr has been described as [...] "an artist who's logged enough studio time to have a special regard for painters' painters ... and a gifted writer who can make us appreciate them, too." [...] and a [...] "vital link between the museum world and academia." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} fifteen years there has been an {{increase}} is Islamic art exhibitions in the United States and Europe. Islamic art exhibition includes both <b>reinstallations</b> of permanent collections and temporary exhibitions. Often Islamic art exhibitions are equated with broader social and political contexts and infused with beliefs like Islamic art can “bridge divides” (Flood, 2007; Winegar, 2008) and “speak” for the humanity of Islam and Muslim peoples. This conflation or slippage is unique to the coverage of Islamic art exhibition and may, at least in part, be rooted in societal and religious ideologies like Orientalism and Islamophobia. Contemporaneously, there has been a steadily growing body of research on interpretative theory in new museology. However, no significant attempt has been made to amalgamate and apply the recent academic research in interpretative theory, including design interpretation, museum graphics and written interpretation to the analysis of Islamic art exhibitions. This thesis examines the interpretation, the process(es) of interpretation production and visitors responses in two Islamic art exhibitions in the United States: the New Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia (New Galleries) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and Pearls on a String: Artists, Poets, and Patrons at the Great Islamic Courts (Pearls) at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. This thesis utilizes a triangulated methodological approach where the theoretical research in interpretative theory is applied to a case study of New Galleries interpretation. A critical reflection method is adopted to examine the author’s professional involvement in the Pearls exhibition. Summative visitor evaluations of both exhibitions were undertaken in order to better understand the meanings visitors’ make. Ultimately this thesis argues that a unified, process-based approach (Whitehead, 2012) to interpretation with both design and written interpretation is important because of the association or slippage between Islamic art exhibitions and the broader social and political contexts...|$|R
25|$|Vulcan was re-erected on a steel {{armature}} {{atop his}} tower during June 2003, {{restored to its}} original appearance as intended by Moretti, reoriented to the east. Television stations WVTM and WBRC both provided live webcams of the <b>reinstallation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Between 2002 and 2006, {{the roof}} construction, {{which is a}} listed building, was renovated. This {{involved}} the exchange of aged steel girders, <b>reinstallation</b> of windows that were replaced by panels after World War II and a general clean-up of the hall construction.|$|E
25|$|Traditional storm {{windows and}} screens are time {{consuming}} and very labor-intensive, requiring removal and storage {{of the storm}} windows in the spring, and <b>reinstallation</b> {{in the fall and}} storage of the screens. The weight of the large storm window frame and glass makes replacement on upper-stories of tall buildings a difficult task requiring repeatedly climbing a ladder with each window and trying to hold the window in place while securing retaining clips around the edges.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} sequence was as follows. First, temporary protection for those plants {{that could not}} be moved was provided. Then, the glass was carefully removed from the building, and historic glazing was salvaged. Structural wood elements of the building (arches), as well as muntins that held the glazing, were disassembled. The location of each element was recorded for <b>reinstallation.</b> The lead-based coatings were stripped from the wood members. Each wooden piece was then tested for its strength and determined if repair or replacement was appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Rootkit {{detection}} {{is difficult}} because a rootkit {{may be able to}} subvert the software that is intended to find it. Detection methods include using an alternative and trusted operating system, behavioral-based methods, signature scanning, difference scanning, and memory dump analysis. Removal can be complicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the kernel; <b>reinstallation</b> of the operating system may be the only available solution to the problem. When dealing with firmware rootkits, removal may require hardware replacement, or specialized equipment.|$|E
25|$|With {{the first}} {{production}} car {{shown to the}} public in 1993, Porsche had only to meet certain design criteria--the requirement that production-based cars have storage space for a typical suitcase had already been fulfilled, as the Dauer road car was able to carry luggage. The flat bottom of the 962 Le Mans also fit with GT rules. Three more modifications were necessary to fully comply: Narrower tires than the 962 had run in Group C, a larger fuel tank (now up to 120 litres), and the <b>reinstallation</b> of a restrictor for the engine, although this one would be larger than the one they had run in Group C.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with other}} museums that have {{consigned}} works to auction in the past, LACMA has been sharply criticized for pruning its art holdings. In 2005, {{on the occasion}} of the expansion, reorganization and <b>reinstallation</b> of its collection in 2007, LACMA auctioned 43 works at Sotheby's. The works sold included paintings by Amedeo Modigliani, Camille Pissarro and Max Beckmann, sculptures by Alberto Giacometti and Henry Moore, and works on paper by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Edgar Degas. The biggest sale of works by the museum since the early 1980s, it was expected to fetch $10.4 million to $15.4 million; it eventually resulted in a total of $13 million. Among the most valuable was a Modigliani portrait of the Spanish landscape painter Manuel Humbert, which sold for $4.9 million.|$|E
25|$|Some {{discoloration}} of the pedestals and statues {{occurred after}} <b>reinstallation.</b> The National Bureau of Standards discovered that dark substance was electroplating solution {{had not been}} thoroughly removed. It was washed off, and the problem fixed. Music and Harvest and Aspiration and Literature were inspected 10 months after their restoration. Corrosion was seen developing at several cracks, seams, and small holes, {{and in some cases}} gypsum and water migrated out of pores in the bronze to the outside. The smaller corrosion spots were cleaned and relacquered. The larger ones were drilled out, soldered, replated, and relacquered. A second inspection occurred two years later. Only very small corrosion spots were discovered, and these were cleaned and relacquered. After 1974, the refinishing seemed to have worked well and corrosion of the exterior was minimal.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) was reinstalled on {{its current}} campus in Hsinchu, Taiwan.Since its <b>reinstallation,</b> NTHU has {{developed}} from an institute focusing on Nuclear Science and Technology {{to that of}} a comprehensive research university offering degrees programs ranging from baccalaureate to doctorate in science, technology, engineering, humanities and social sciences, as well as management. NTHU has been consistently ranked as one of the premier universities in Taiwan and is widely recognized as the best incubator for future leaders in industries as well as academics. Such stellar records are particularly exemplified by the outstanding achievements of alumni, including two Nobel laureates in physics Dr. Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, one Nobel laureate in chemistry Dr. Yuan-Tseh Lee and one Wolf Prize winner in mathematics Dr. Shiing-Shen Chern.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to have holes in the {{benchtop}} that tools or jigs can be bolted to. In applications where repeated removal and <b>reinstallation</b> of the tool or jig is desirable, screwing into the wood of the benchtop with woodscrews or lag bolts is not an ideal solution, because the wooden threads don't lend themselves to repeated disassembly and reassembly. In such cases, {{it is useful to}} create hardpoints, which are metal threads embedded in the wood. These hardpoints make repeated disassembly and reassembly trouble-free. They are essentially nuts that are embedded into the wood in one way or another. T-nuts (aka tee nuts) are an easy way to create a hardpoint. Custom nuts similar to T-nuts but with holes for woodscrews in place of the spikes are sometimes machined for the purpose.|$|E

500|$|Symantec {{introduced}} Version 2005 on August 17, 2004. This {{version is}} {{sometimes referred to}} with the tagline of [...] "AntiSpyware Edition", since spyware detection is integrated with Norton and is by default enabled. Found threats are listed, separating the ones already dealt with and the ones requiring user interaction. More detailed information is provided through a link to Symantec's website. However, PC Pro and PC Magazine noted lengthy scan times. A full scan took 24 minutes to over half an hour, respectively. In PC Pro testing, Norton detected 61 percent of the spyware samples, compared {{to an average of}} 68 percent for all the tested products. Removal rates were above average, 72 percent versus the average of 68 percent. Norton blocked <b>reinstallation</b> with a score of 48 percent, compared to the group average of 43 percent. Overall, Norton ranked fifth among the tested products. In PC Magazine testing, Norton installed slowly on infected systems and failed to install on one altogether. Contacting Symantec did not resolve the issue.|$|E
2500|$|In some infections, the spyware is {{not even}} evident. Users assume in those {{situations}} that the performance issues relate to faulty hardware, Windows installation problems, or another malware infection.

2500|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was revealed to be a catastrophic failure of the engine's third stage turbine disk, resulting from a loss of operating clearance between the disk and the third stage inner sealing ring. Improper positioning of the turbine rotor, use of the wrong type of tool and worn parts included in the engine assembly process were blamed for that loss of clearance. The CAB accident report states that the inspector on duty during the <b>reinstallation</b> of the turbine rotor [...] "signed off on work he had not inspected".|$|E

2500|$|Permanent denial-of-service (PDoS), {{also known}} loosely as phlashing, {{is an attack}} that damages a system so badly that it {{requires}} replacement or <b>reinstallation</b> of hardware. Unlike the distributed denial-of-service attack, a PDoS attack exploits security flaws which allow remote administration on the management interfaces of the victim's hardware, such as routers, printers, or other networking hardware. The attacker uses these vulnerabilities to replace a device's firmware with a modified, corrupt, or defective firmware image—a process which when done legitimately is known as flashing. This therefore [...] "bricks" [...] the device, rendering it unusable for its original purpose until it can be repaired or replaced.|$|E
