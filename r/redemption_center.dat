5000|$|The Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co. (S&H) {{was in the}} {{business}} of issuing and [...] "redeeming" [...] S&H trading stamps. As explained in the Court’s opinion, trading stamps are a form of “scrip.” They can be used to purchase goods but only at a designated “store.” S&H sold the stamps to merchants, such as supermarket chains, which then “gave” the stamps to their customers, typically at the rate of one stamp for each ten cents' worth of purchases. The customers were instructed to paste the S&H stamps into booklets, and when they had accumulated enough booklets full of S&H stamps they could “redeem” them at an S&H <b>redemption</b> <b>center</b> for “gifts”—merchandise, such as golf clubs or blenders. S&H accounted for 40% of the US trading stamp business and more than 60% of US consumers saved S&H stamps; the industry annually issued 400 billion stamps to more than 200,000 stores, and they were distributed to the public in connection with retail sales of $40 billion.|$|E
5000|$|S&H placed {{restrictive}} notices in the booklets, advising consumers {{that they}} did not own the stamps, that their only right was to paste the stamps into the booklets and redeem booklets at an S&H <b>redemption</b> <b>center,</b> and that they could not buy, sell, or swap stamps. [...] Other trading stamp companies (such as Gold Bond) operated on a similar basis. S&H enforced the restrictions by suing merchants who “trafficked” in S&H stamps, for example, by accepting them in partial payment for merchandise. S&H also sued “trading stamp exchanges,” which were businesses that permitted consumers, for a fee, to swap one kind of stamp for another, in order to consolidate the consumers’ stamp holdings into one brand and thus more rapidly redeem their stamp holdings. Some consumers, the Court noted, “may seek to sell their stamps in order to use the resulting cash to make more basic purchases (food, shoes, etc.) than redemption centers normally provide.” S&H attempted to suppress all such “trafficking.” ...|$|E

50|$|A {{referendum}} {{on the ballot in}} November 2014, concerned whether to expand the bill to cover containers for some non-carbonated beverages. This would address growing concern over the nearly 1.4billion containers not covered by existing legislation that are found in litter and landfill waste. The goal of the initiative petition that placed the measure on the ballot was to broaden the scope of beverage types requiring a deposit in order to be more responsive to consumer preferences as well as establishing a mechanism for stabilizing the recycling industry by tying the handling fees paid to <b>redemption</b> <b>centers</b> to the Consumer Price Index. Opponents argued that the change would increase costs and red tape for the beverage industry.|$|R

5000|$|The Massachusetts Bottle Bill (Mass.

Implemented in 1983, the law requires containers of carbonated beverages to be returnable with a minimum return value of $0.05. The bottle bill does not cover containers of non-carbonated beverages like water, tea, or sports drinks. The law also establishes the handling fee paid by distributors to <b>redemption</b> <b>centers,</b> $0.0325 per unit as of July 5, 2013, and to retailers $0.0225 per unit.

Additional studies indicate that beverage containers covered by the state's container deposit system are redeemed at approximately 70% and another 9% are recycled via curbside programs.

5000|$|Deposit-refund {{systems or}} {{container}} deposit legislation, {{also known as}} [...] "bottle bills", can be viewed either as a tax on producing waste {{in the form of}} beverage containers or as a subsidy for properly recycling these containers. When a retailer buys products from a distributor, it must pay a deposit for each beverage container it purchases. The retailer then includes the cost of the deposit in the item's price, passing it to the consumer. However, the consumer is refunded this money by properly disposing of the used beverage container at a retail or <b>redemption</b> <b>center.</b> The retailer also recoups the deposit from the distributor. This system encourages consumers to properly dispose of the waste they generate by buying beverages in disposable containers. It also creates a privately funded system for the handling of this waste. A deposit-refund bill named National Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act was introduced by the House of Representatives in 1994 but never became federal law.Bottle bills are currently in place in ten states as well as in Guam. Delaware repealed its bottle bill in 2010. Oregon was the first state to institute a bottle bill in 1971. The most common deposit is five cents, but this varies by state and by the type of container.|$|E
5000|$|In 1896 the Sperry and Hutchinson Company {{was created}} as an {{independent}} trading stamp company in the United States and by 1957 {{it was estimated that}} there were approximately 200 trading stamp companies in operation. [...] Typically, merchants would pay a third-party trading stamp company for the stamps and would then advertise that they gave away trading stamps with purchases. Large retailers were usually given a discount on the stamps while smaller retailers generally had to pay the full cost of adopting the trading stamp program for their business. The intent of this was to get customers to be loyal to the merchant, so that they would continue shopping there to obtain enough stamps to redeem for merchandise. Customers would fill books with stamps, and take the books to a trading stamp company <b>redemption</b> <b>center</b> to exchange them for premiums. [...] Books could also be sent to the trading stamp company in exchange for premium merchandise via mail order catalogs. An example of the value of trading stamps would be during the 1970s and 1980s where the typical rate issued by a merchant was one stamp for each 10¢ of merchandise purchased. A typical book took approximately 1200 stamps to fill, or the equivalent of US $120.00 in purchases.|$|E
40|$|No {{portion of}} the Old Testament scripture is as {{essential}} to unlocking {{the mysteries of the}} prophetic plan for God’s future program for Israel and the nations than the book of Daniel and, of all Daniel’s prophecies, the prophecy of the Seventy Weeks provides the indispensable chronological key to New Testament prophecy. It is this prophecy which concerns both the beginning and ending of “the desolation of Jerusalem ” (from the Babylonian Conquest to the Second Advent of Christ) and defines that period as “the times of the Gentiles ” (Luke 21 : 24), after which Israel’s time of restoration will begin (cf. Isaiah 2 : 2 - 4; Zechariah 8 : 1 - 15; 14 : 3 - 21). The prophecy of the Seventy Weeks (Daniel 9 : 24 - 27) therefore belongs to the larger corpus of prophetic restoration texts given to national Israel as a comfort in her captivity and as a continued promise of the fulfillment of the program of messianic <b>redemption</b> <b>centered</b> in the Davidic dynasty in Jerusalem (Isaiah 40 : 1 - 66 : 24; Jeremiah 30 : 1 - 33 : 26; Ezekiel 33 : 1 - 48 : 35).

C.) and recording their role in the restoration of the Jewish People to the city of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} ‘Improving Recycling: An Analysis Of Formal & Informal Recycling In New York City’ {{is to make}} policy {{recommendations}} for the long-term systemic change to New York State’s bottle bill legislation and the city’s municipal recycling programs. The policy recommendations seek to increase recycling productivity while providing benefits to informal recyclers, commonly called “canners”. As such, this thesis will investigate the New York Department of Sanitation’s public space recycling program and systems of recycling as mandated by the state’s bottle bill; including but not limited to, describing processes of deposit and redemption for bottles and cans. This thesis also includes descriptive analysis {{of the practice of}} redeeming bottles and cans for their five cent deposit value. Through a general quantitative and qualitative analysis of formal and informal recycling systems for bottles and cans, several policy recommendations for legislators at the city and state level are proposed. This thesis has direct implications to the field of urban planning by seeking to remediate environmental and social justice issues and improve urban quality of life. By diverting municipal solid waste from landfills and incinerators air quality is improved and greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. It is concluded that the public space recycling program is a valuable component of municipal recycling; <b>redemption</b> <b>centers</b> not only need to be “rebranded” but the number of locations should be increased; and finally, the bottle bill legislation should be reimagined and applied to a material that currently has no national market value (plastic bags, textiles, or compost) ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 76 - 78) Trading stamps {{are used}} as a promotional device by retailers {{as a method of}} non-price competition. In widespread use since the 1890 's, trading stamp sales reached the billion dollar mark in revenues in 1968 but have since declined in earnings. Prior studies concerning trading stamps have examined the reasons why people save stamps, the psychological benefits derived from saving them, the demographics of savers, and the attitudes of savers towards trading stamps. The purposes of this study are 1) to compare the personality profiles of trading stamp savers versus those of non- savers, and 2) to examine certain personality characteristics of husbands and wives in stamp saving households. An abbreviated form of the Thurstone Temperament Schedule was used to measure five personality traits (Active, Vigorous, Impulsive, Dominant, and Social) of stamp savers and non-stamp savers. The act of saving trading stamps was divided into stamp "collecting" and stamp "redeeming. " Five classifications were designed to describe stamp "collectors" and three classifications were designed to describe stamp "redeemers. " A sample of 320 married individuals was selected from among shoppers at two supermarkets which gave trading stamps and at two which did not give stamps. All four supermarkets were located in the Northridge-Granada Hills area of the San Fernando Valley. Willing respondents were interviewed at the supermarkets and then given a questionnaire to take home. The results of this study may be used by retailers in their advertising and promotional campaigns in appealing to both stamp savers and non-savers.

40|$|Purpose - In 2009, US coupons set a {{new record}} of 367 billion coupons distributed. Yet, while coupon {{distribution}} is on the rise, redemption rates remain below 1 percent. This paper aims to show how recognizing context variables, such as proximity, weather, part of town and financial incentives interplay to determine a coupon campaign's success. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports an empirical study conducted in co-operation with a restaurant chain: 9. 880 Subway coupons were distributed under different experimental context conditions. Redemption behavior was analyzed {{with the help of}} logistic regressions. Findings - It was found that even though proximity drives coupon <b>redemption,</b> city <b>center</b> campaigns seem to be much more sensitive to distance than suburban areas. The further away the distribution place from the restaurant, the less does the amount of monetary incentive determine the motivation to redeem. Practical implications - When designing a coupon campaign for a company, coupon distribution should not follow a "one-is-good-for-all-strategy" even for one marketer within one product category. Instead each coupon strategy should carefully consider contextual influence. Originality/value - This paper is the first to the authors' knowledge that systematically investigates the impact of context variables on coupon redemption. It focuses on context variables that electronic marketing channels will be able to easily incorporate into personalized mobile marketing campaigns...|$|R
