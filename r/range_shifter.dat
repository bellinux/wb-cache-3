40|$|Purpose: The work aims to 1) {{prove the}} {{feasibility}} of dose painting by numbers (DPBN) in proton therapy with usual contour-driven plan optimization and 2) compare the achieved plan quality to that of rotational IMRT. Methods: For two patients with head and neck cancers voxel-by-voxel prescription to the target volume (PTV-PET) was calculated from 1 8 FDG-PET images and converted to contour-based prescription by defining several sub-contours. Treatments were planned with RayStation (RaySearch Laboratories Sweden) and proton pencil beam scanning modality. In {{order to determine the}} optimal plan parameters to approach the DPBN prescription the effect of the number of fields number of sub-contours and use of <b>range</b> <b>shifter</b> were tested separately on each patient. The number of sub-contours were increased from 3 to 11 while the number of fields were set to 3 5 7 and 9. Treatment plans were also optimized on two rotational IMRT systems (TomoTherapy and Varian RapidArc) using previously published guidelines. Results: For both patients more than 99 % of the PTV-PET received at least 95 % of the prescribed dose while less than 1 % of the PTV-PET received more than 105 % which demonstrates {{the feasibility of}} the treatment. Neither the use of a <b>range</b> <b>shifter</b> nor the increase of the number of fields had a significant influence on PTV coverage. Plan quality increased when increasing number of fields up to 7 or 9 and slightly decreased for a bigger number of sub-contours. Good OAR sparing is achieved while keeping high plan quality. Finally proton therapy achieved significantly better plan quality than rotational IMRT. Conclusion: Voxel-by-voxel prescriptions can be approximated accurately in proton therapy using a contour-driven optimization. Target coverage is nearly insensitive to the number of fields and the use of a <b>range</b> <b>shifter.</b> Finally plan quality assessment confirmed the superiority of proton therapy compared to rotational IMRT...|$|E
40|$|In future, Monte Carlo MC {{algorithms}} can be {{used for}} dose calculation in proton beam treatment planning if they are fast enough. The recently developed MC code VMCpro simulates proton transport in human tissue using the condensed history technique with continuous energy loss, multiple scattering, energy straggling, ionization, nuclear interactions as well as secondary electron and proton transport. The cross sections and stopping powers are based on ICRU tabulations. For the treatment of ocular tumors at the Hahn Meitner Institute in Berlin, a proton beam of about 68 MeV is modulated using different <b>range</b> <b>shifters,</b> modulator wheels and collimators. To take these devices into account, MC geometry modules are developed for VMCpro. <b>Range</b> <b>shifters</b> are modeled as material slabs and modulator wheels are simulated as slabs with variable thickness. The particle transport algorithm through these slabs is similar to the transport algorithm within the patient. Collimators are modeled as block cut outs. The code is parallelized using the Message Passing Interface and installed on a computer cluster to allow dose calculations with 0. 1 mm spatial resolution in a few minutes. Calculations of dose distributions in water are performed for different combinations of <b>range</b> <b>shifters,</b> modulator wheels and collimators.

40|$|PURPOSE A {{detailed}} analysis of 2728 intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) fields that were clinically delivered to patients between 2007 and 2013 at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) was performed. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the results of patient specific dosimetric verifications and to assess possible correlation between the quality assurance (QA) results and specific field metrics. METHODS Dosimetric verifications were performed for every IMPT field prior to patient treatment. For every field, a steering file was generated containing all the treatment unit information necessary for treatment delivery: beam energy, beam angle, dose, size of air gap, nuclear interaction (NI) correction factor, number of <b>range</b> <b>shifter</b> plates, number of Bragg peaks (BPs) with their position and weight.

40|$|Scanned proton beams {{offer the}} {{possibility}} {{to take full advantage}} of the dose deposition properties of proton beams, i. e. the limited range and sharp peak at the end of the range, the Bragg peak. By actively scanning the proton beam, laterally by scanning magnets and longitudinally by shifting the energy, the position of the Bragg peak can be controlled in all three dimensions, thereby enabling high dose delivery to the target volume only. A typical scanned proton beam line consists of a pair of scanning magnets to perform the lateral beam scanning and possibly a <b>range</b> <b>shifter</b> and a multi-leaf collimator (MLC). Part of this thesis deals with the development of control, supervision and verification methods for the scanned proton beam line at the The Svedberg laboratory in Uppsala, Sweden. Radiotherapy is preceded by treatment planning, where one of the main objectives is predicting the dose to the patient. The dose is calculated by a dose calculation engine and the accuracy of the results is of course dependent on the accuracy and sophistication of the transport and interaction models of the dose engine itself. But, for the dose distribution calculation to have any bearing on the reality, it needs to be started with relevant input in accordance with the beam that is emitted from the treatment machine. This input is provided by the beam model. As such, the beam model is the link between the reality (the treatment machine) and the treatment planning system. The beam model contains methods to characterise the treatment machine and provides the dose calculation with the reconstructed beam phase space, in some convenient representation. In order for a beam model to be applicable in a treatment planning system, its methods have to be general. In this thesis, a beam model for a scanned proton beam is developed. The beam model contains models and descriptions of the beam modifying elements of a scanned proton beam line. Based on a well-defined set of generally applicable characterisation measurements, ten beam model parameters are extracted, describing the basic properties of the beam, i. e. the energy spectrum, the radial and the angular distributions and the nominal direction. Optional beam modifying elements such as a <b>range</b> <b>shifter</b> and an MLC are modelled by dedicated Monte Carlo calculation algorithms. The algorithm that describes the MLC contains a parameterisation of collimator scatter, in which the rather complex phase space of collimator scattered protons has been parameterised by a set of analytical functions. Dose calculations based on the phase space reconstructed by the beam model are in good agreement with experimental data. This holds both for the dose distribution of the elementary pencil beam, reflecting the modelling of the basic properties of the scanned beam, as well as for complete calculations of collimated scanned fields...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel strategy for generating accurate black-box models of datapath power consumption at the architecture level. This {{is achieved by}} recognizing that power consumption in digital circuits is affected by activity, {{as well as physical}} capacitance. Since existing strategies characterize modules for purely random inputs, they fail to account for the effect of signal statistics on switching activity. The Dual Bit Type (DBT) model, however, accounts not only for the random activity of the least significant bits (LSB’s), but also for the correlated activity of the most significant bits (MSB’s), which contain two’s-complement sign information. The resulting model is parameterizable in terms of complexity factors such as word length and can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} modules <b>ranging</b> from adders, <b>shifters,</b> and multipliers to register files and memories. Since the model operates at the register transfer level (RTL), it is orders of magnitude faster than gate- or circuit-level tools, but while other architecture-level techniques often err by 50 - 100 % or more, the DBT method offers error rates on the order of 10 - 15 %...|$|R

40|$|The space {{radiation}} environment imposes increased {{dangers of}} exposure to ionizing radiation, particularly during a solar particle event. These events consist primarily of low-energy protons that produce a highly in-homogeneous depth–dose distribution. Here we describe a novel technique that uses pencil beam scanning at extended source-to-surface distances and <b>range</b> <b>shifter</b> (RS) to provide robust but easily modifiable delivery of simulated solar particle event radiation to large animals. Thorough characterization of spot profiles as a func-tion of energy, distance and RS position is critical to accurate treatment planning. At 105 MeV, the spot sigma is 234 mm at 4800 mm from the isocentre when the RS is installed at the nozzle. With the energy increased to 220 MeV, the spot sigma is 66 mm. At a distance of 1200 mm from the isocentre, the Gaussian sigma is 68 mm and 23 mm at 105 MeV and 220 MeV, respectively, when the RS {{is located on the}} nozzle. At lower energies, the spot sigma exhibits large differences as a function of distance and RS position. Scan areas of 1400 mm (superior–inferior) by 940 mm (anterior–posterior) and 580 mm by 320 mm are achieved at the extended distances of 4800 mm and 1200 mm, respectively, with dose inhomogeneity < 2 %. To treat large animals with a more sophisticated dose distribution, spot size can be reduced by placing the RS closer than 70 mm {{to the surface of the}} animals, producing spot sigmas below 6 mm...|$|E

Moreover, we examined OH radical-mediated indirect actions from either SOBP carbon beams or photon beams on cellular lethality. Materials and methods: Cell culture: The HSG cells were grown in E-MEM (SIGMA) supplemented with 10 % FBS and antibiotics under a humidified air with 5 % CO 2 at 37 ˚C. The cells were seeded into T 25 cm 2 flask (CORNING) at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells per flask for 48 h prior to irradiation.

40|$|Proton therapy can {{overcome}} {{the limitations of}} conventional radiotherapy due to the more selective energy deposition in depth and to the increased biological effectiveness. Verification of the delivered dose is desirable, but the complete stopping of the protons in patient prevents the application of electronic portal imaging methods {{that are used in}} conventional radiotherapy During proton therapy beta(+) emitters like C- 11, O- 15, C- 10 are generated in irradiated tissues by nuclear reactions. The measurement of the spatial distribution of this activity, immediately after patient irradiation, can lead to information on the effective delivered dose. First, results of a feasibility study 2 of an in-beam PET for proton therapy are reported. The prototype is based on two planar heads with an active area of about 5 x 5 cm Each head is made up of a position sensitive photomultiplier coupled to a square matrix of same size of LYSO scintillating crystals (2 x 2 x 18 mm(3) pixel dimensions). Four signals from each head are acquired through a dedicated electronic board that performs signal amplification and digitization. A 3 D reconstruction of the activity distribution is calculated using an expectation maximization algorithm. To characterize the PET prototype, the detection efficiency and the spatial resolution were measured using a point-like radioactive source. The validation of the prototype was performed using 62 MeV protons at the CATANA beam line of INFN LNS and PMMA phantoms.

40|$|Proton beam {{radiotherapy}} {{is highly}} effective in treating cancer {{thanks to its}} conformal dose deposition. This superior capability in dose deposition {{has led to a}} massive growth of the treated patients around the world, raising the need of treatment monitoring systems. An in-treatment PET system, DoPET, was constructed and tested at CATANA beam-line, LNS-INFN in Catania, where 62 MeV protons are used to treat ocular melanoma. The PET technique profits from the beta+ emitters generated by the proton beam in the irradiated body, mainly 15 -O and 11 -C. The current DoPET prototype consists of two planar 15 cm × 15 cm LYSO-based detector heads. With respect to the previous versions, the system was enlarged and the DAQ up-graded during the years so now also anthropomorphic phantoms, can be fitted within the field of view of the system. To demonstrate the capability of DoPET to detect changes in the delivered treatment plan with respect to the planned one, various treatment plans were used delivering a standard 15 Gy fraction to an anthropomorphic phantom. Data were acquired during and after the treatment delivery up to 10 minutes. When the in-treatment phase was long enough (more than 1 minute), the corresponding activated volume was visible just after the treatment delivery, even if in presence of a noisy background. The after-treatment data, acquired for about 9 minutes, were segmented finding that few minutes are {{enough to be able to}} detect changes. These experiments will be presented together with the studies performed with PMMA phantoms where the DoPET response was characterized in terms of different dose rates and in presence of range shifters: the system response is linear up to 16. 9 Gy/min and has the ability to see a 1 millimeter <b>range</b> <b>shifter...</b>|$|E
40|$|Particle {{radiotherapy}} is {{a rapidly}} growing technique becoming an important treatment modality {{within the field of}} radiation therapy. Protons and charged ions show an increasing energy deposition with the penetration depth, leading to a maximum, the Bragg-peak, {{near the end of the}} particle range. This makes possible the creation of a highly conformal dose region, the spread-out Bragg-peak, with the possibility of covering even small tumor volumes with high accuracy delivering lower doses to healthy tissues. Like other highly conformal therapy techniques, proton therapy is of particular interest for those tumors located close to serially organized tissues, where a small local overdose may cause fatal complications, such as most of the eye tumors, which are close to the optic nerve. The international standard radiation therapy for eye treatment is based on dedicated passive beam line with protons produced by cyclotron. The National Center for Oncological Hadrontherapy (CNAO) of Pavia is provided with a synchrotron, a circular accelerator of about 25 meters in diameter, designed for a fully active 3 D dose distribution system. The facility is not equipped with a dedicated eyeline developed to treat ocular disease and, for these reason, the treatment room 3 has been adapted to this purpose. This work presents the dosimetric measurements needed to characterize the proton beam in the new treatment setup, which involves the use of a <b>range</b> <b>shifter,</b> a patient-specific collimator and a dedicated synchrotron protocol to reduce the treatment time. First of all, the new setup requires an ad-hoc re-calibration of the beam monitors in terms of delivered dose per Monitor Units. To check the distal fall-off of the Bragg curve the integrated depth-dose-distributions were measured with the Peakfinder (a variable depth water column equipped with two plane-parallel ionization chambers), while the lateral penumbra measurements were performed using EBT 3 films irradiated with square monoenergetic uniform fields. At last, different Spread Out Bragg Peaks were also measured to check that the superposition of the Bragg peaks and the resulting dose distribution were both correct. With the new setup, specifically commissioned for protontherapy of the eye, a study was performed to evaluate the main dosimetric properties of the configuration adopted. In the energy range of clinical interest, the depth dose distribution and the lateral penumbra are comparable with specifications of other eye-dedicated facilities, making possible the treatment of ocular disease...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{prove the}} ability of protons to {{reproduce}} a dose gradient that matches a dose painting by numbers (DPBN) prescription {{in the presence of}} setup and range errors, by using contours and structure-based optimization in a commercial treatment planning system. Methods: For two patients with head and neck cancer, voxel-by-voxel prescription to the target volume (GTVPET) was calculated from 18 FDG-PET images and approximated with several discrete prescription subcontours. Treatments were planned with proton pencil beam scanning. In order to determine the optimal plan parameters to approach the DPBN prescription, the e↵ects of the scanning pattern, number of fields, number of subcontours, and use of <b>range</b> <b>shifter</b> were separately tested on each patient. Di↵erent constant scanning grids (i. e., spot spacing = x = y = 3. 5, 4, and 5 mm) and uniform energy layer separation [4 and 5 mm WED (water equivalent distance) ] were analyzed versus a dynamic and automatic selection of the spots grid. The number of subcontours was increased from 3 to 11 while the number of beams was set to 3, 5, or 7. Conventional PTV-based and robust clinical target volumes (CTV) -based optimization strategies were considered and their robustness against range and setup errors assessed. Because of the nonuniform prescription, ensuring robustness for coverage of GTVPET inevitably leads to overdosing, which was compared for both optimization schemes. Results: The optimal number of subcontours ranged from 5 to 7 for both patients. All considered scanning grids achieved accurate dose painting (1 % average di↵erence between the prescribed and planned doses). PTV-based plans led to nonrobust target coverage while robust-optimized plans improved it considerably (di↵erences between worst-case CTV dose and the clinical constraint was up to 3 Gy for PTV-based plans and did not exceed 1 Gy for robust CTV-based plans). Also, only 15 % of the points in the GTVPET (worst case) were above 5 % of DPBN prescription for robust-optimized plans, while they were more than 50 % for PTV plans. Low dose to organs at risk (OARs) could be achieved for both PTV and robust-optimized plans. Conclusions: DPBN in proton therapy is feasible {{with the use of a}} sucient number subcontours, automatically generated scanning patterns, and no more than three beams are needed. Robust optimization ensured the required target coverage and minimal overdosing, while PTV-approach led to nonrobust plans with excessive overdose. Low dose to OARs can be achieved even in the presence of a high-dose escalation as in DPBN...|$|E
40|$|Particle therapy (PT) cancer {{treatment}} {{is an alternative}} to conventional radiotherapy with the possibility for more conformal and tissue sparing treatments. PT is realized using either passive or active beam delivery methods. With the latter, also coined the scanned beam technique, magnets are used to cover the target laterally and for in-depth variation energy modulation is deployed, making the dose delivery even more conformal. However some of the current limitations of scanned beams are the longer irradiation times and a sensitivity to intra-fractionally moving targets. In PT centers with synchrotrons the irradiation time {{is directly related to}} the spot scan size and the width of the Bragg peak (BP), with the time needed from the accelerator to change energy as the bottleneck. The number of energy shifts required to cover a typical tumour in a homogeneous manner can in particular for heavy ions be as large as many hundreds. By broadening the BPs through the use of passive energy modulators, the number of energy shifts can be lowered, which would not only reduce the irradiation time but also results in a higher particle fluence per energy step, leading to higher precision in the beam monitoring systems. This work addresses the implementation of such passive energy modulators, in particular the ripple filter (RiFi). A “first generation” RiFi is currently used in carbon ion treatments in Germany, Italy, China and Japan. This first generation RiFi has 1 D groove shapes, which requires a non-modulating base layer of material leading to unnecessary scattering. It is furthermore restricted to a maximum thickness of 3 mm. A new second generation RiFi with two-dimensional cone structures has been designed. Compared to the old design the resolution and the mass distribution are significantly improved, reducing the overall lateral beam width. Using 3 D printing for manufacturing, the obtainable RiFi thickness is higher, with further BP widening and shorter irradiation times as a results. The new 2 D design is thought to be usable in treatments with protons as well, where RiFis as of now are commonly not used in proton treatments. In this thesis, we show a methodological presentation of planning with the second generation RiFi design. It was found that treatment plans with 2 D RiFis with 4 and 6 mm thicknesses yielded for the studied cases comparable dosimetric results to the standard 3 mm thick RiFi in terms of plan homogeneity and conformity but with significantly reduced irradiation times: Compared to the 3 mm RiFi, the 4 and 6 mm RiFis lower the irradiation time by 25 - 30 % and 45 - 49 % respectively. Plan homogeneity and conformity were slightly improved for thinner RiFis but satisfactory results are obtained for all cases with RiFi performances in general increasing with penetration depth due to straggling and scattering effects. Certain plans for 6 mm RiFis indicate that there might be an upper limit on the RiFi thickness in treatments of small and very superficial tumours. The work of this thesis also continues the investigations of the RiFi-induced fluence inhomogeneities and dose range inhomogeneities begun in the author's master thesis and covers new findings in this topic related to the beam spot sizes and the ion optical focusing of the beam. Lastly, during the thesis, plates of porous materials such as foams or lung substitutes will be shown to be usable as passive energy modulators in a manner similar to RiFis and to furthermore function as a <b>range</b> <b>shifter,</b> which placed close to the patients leads to reduced beam penumbras for low penetration depths. This work furthermore contains a short outlook with a perspective on other methods reducing the energy shifts as well as comments on new future designs of energy modulators...|$|E
