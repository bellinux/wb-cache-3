40|$|The {{availability}} of resources allows for the rapid and cost-effective delivery of a construction project. For rebuilding programmes after a disaster, the need for better understanding of factors affecting resource availability and their potential impacts on resourcing outcomes can be of crucial importance to effective reconstruction performance. Drawing on an empirical survey in China following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the critical factors affecting resource availability for post-quake reconstruction of housing are identified. Resource availability in a post-disaster situation is not only associated with (1) project-related factors such as quantity of resources required, project schedule, project <b>resourcing</b> <b>plan,</b> and resource procurement lead time; and (2) factors related to the reconstruction practitioners, including competency of resourcing manager and qualification of contractor; but is also related to (3) factors external to reconstruction projects including legislation and policy, general economic environment, and resource transportation cost and method. To address these factors, a multi-sector approach is needed for reconstruction decision makers and practitioners. A planned procurement strategy in the implementing contractors, a range of training initiatives for small and medium businesses, along with augmented regulatory, economic and transport infrastructure systems are likely to improve resource availability for post-disaster rebuilding projects.
