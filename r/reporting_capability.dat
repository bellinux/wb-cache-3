2500|$|On-board {{diagnostics}} (OBD) is an automotive term {{referring to}} a vehicle's self-diagnostic and <b>reporting</b> <b>capability.</b> OBD systems give the vehicle owner or repair technician access {{to the status of}} the various vehicle subsystems. The amount of diagnostic information available via OBD has varied widely since its introduction in the early 1980s versions of on-board vehicle computers. Early versions of OBD would simply illuminate a malfunction indicator light or [...] "idiot light" [...] if a problem was detected but would not provide any information as {{to the nature of the}} problem. Modern OBD implementations use a standardized digital communications port to provide real-time data in addition to a standardized series of diagnostic trouble codes, or DTCs, which allow one to rapidly identify and remedy malfunctions within the vehicle.|$|E

5000|$|A lot of {{dark data}} is unstructured, {{which means that}} the {{information}} is in formats that may be difficult to categorise, be read by the computer and thus analysed. Often the reason that business do not analyse their dark data is because of the amount of resources it would take and the difficulty of having that data analysed. According to Computer Weekly, 60% of organisations believe that their own business intelligence <b>reporting</b> <b>capability</b> is [...] "inadequate" [...] and 65% say that they have [...] "somewhat disorganised content management approaches".|$|E
50|$|In 2007, the Council (MiHR) http://www.mihr.ca began {{developing}} the Mining Industry Workforce Information Network (MIWIN) http://www.mihr.ca/en/priorities/miwin.asp, a pan-Canadian labour market information (LMI) and analysis system. The key objective of MIWIN is to project annual hiring requirements in the mining industry over the short, medium and long term, based on key assumptions about future economic and demographic developments. More specifically, the network reveals {{the number and}} types of mining jobs available on a provincial and occupation-specific basis. Ultimately, MIWIN will evolve into a web-based system that covers all provinces in Canada where mining is carried out. It will feature an on-line query and <b>reporting</b> <b>capability</b> that can generate forecasts of future labour requirements.|$|E

5000|$|Hanyok {{emphasizes}} that the US, in the early 1960s, considered Laos, not South Vietnam, the critical area. The Department of Defense prepared alternative operational plans for US combat troops in Laos and Thailand. To support this, [...] "a Laotian Watch Office was set up with twenty-four-hours-a-day operations, seven days a week. A special TDY duty team was readied to fly to the ASA site at Clark Air Base {{to set up a}} second-echelon SIGINT reporting mission. (SIGINT reporting can be performed at various levels, or echelons. Field site reporting is considered first-echelon.
