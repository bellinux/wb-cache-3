50|$|The first {{solution}} {{to these problems}} is to keep cable lengths in buildings short, since pick up and transmission are essentially proportional {{to the length of}} the cable. The second solution is to <b>route</b> <b>cables</b> away from trouble. Beyond this, there are particular cable designs that minimize electromagnetic pickup and transmission. Three of the principal design techniques are shielding, coaxial geometry, and twisted-pair geometry.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the {{issues related to}} fire risk assessment in end-users substations. Fires in substations {{may be caused by}} electrical faults, overvoltages, lack of maintenance, etc. It is crucial that fires be confined within the substation, and not propagate into the adjacent environment, where their effects may put at risk personnel, as well as other properties. To reduce this risk of propagation, the choice of cables and the related wiring methods are crucial; in addition, the characteristics of cable chases that <b>route</b> <b>cables</b> from the substation to adjacent rooms is very important. IEEE and IEC fire protection standards for end-user substations are herein discussed, with emphasis on the criteria used to properly select cables for their specific conditions of use and to limit the risk of fires...|$|E

50|$|The most {{commonly}} recognized variety of RG-6 is cable television (CATV) distribution coax, used to <b>route</b> <b>cable</b> television signals to and within homes, and RG-6 type cables {{have become the}} standard for CATV, mostly replacing the smaller RG-59, in recent years. CATV distribution coax typically has a copper-clad steel (CCS) center conductor and a combination aluminum foil/aluminum braid shield, typically with low coverage (about 60%). RG-6 type cables are also used in professional video applications, carrying either base band analog video signals or serial digital interface (SDI) signals; in these applications, the center conductor is ordinarily solid copper, the shielding is much heavier (typically aluminum foil/95% copper braid), and tolerances are more tightly controlled, to improve impedance stability.|$|R

40|$|Engineering tlie <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> {{into the}} safest route is a {{subjective}} job {{although there are}} certain standard industry rules {{that need to be}} applied. The <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> is planned using charts produced on the survey vessel. Geophysical and geotechnical datasets are studied in detail, to ensure that the route is optimised with regard to steep slopes, unfavourable seabed, seabed debris, and sediment depth. A survey was carried out {{in the southern part of}} the Red Sea, in order to produce a chart upon which the submarine <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> can be engineered. The Red Sea contains very rough topography, which sometimes hamper the data acquisition, interpretation and ultimately the <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> engineering. The charts produced did allow the <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> to be engineered with confidence that once laid it will survive its operational life. However, the multibeam data was processed using the gridding method, which reduced the quality of the data. Also there is a slight lack of confidence in the interpretation of the lithology as no predictions can be made on the mobility of sediments are the chances of a buried cable becoming exposed. With more accurate data, the route may be refined (even by just a small amount) along a shorter route thereby saving on costs from the shorter length of cable and possible avoidance of expensive armour types. Survey methods, which could be carried out in order to reduce dangers to towed equipment, are also discussed. Faculty of Scienc...|$|R

Double-armor cable was selected for additional rodent and lightning protection. A major concern of this type of installation is the susceptibility of the cable to lightning damage. An estimation of the frequency and extent of damage to the cable is derived from the trouble history of similar installations, and essential grounding methods are described.
