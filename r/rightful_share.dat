5|$|To {{improve the}} quality of the music, Disney hired the {{professional}} composer and arranger Carl Stalling, on whose suggestion the Silly Symphony series was developed, providing stories through the use of music; the first in the series, The Skeleton Dance (1929), was drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were several local artists, some of whom stayed with the company as core animators; the group later became known as the Nine Old Men. Both the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt they were not receiving their <b>rightful</b> <b>share</b> of profits from Powers. In 1930, Disney tried to trim costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the practice of animating every separate cel in favor of the more efficient technique of drawing key poses and letting lower-paid assistants sketch the in-between poses. Disney asked Powers for an increase in payments for the cartoons. Powers refused and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly afterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close. Disney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931which he blamed on the machinations of Powers and his own overworkso he and Lillian took an extended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.|$|E

50|$|In 1925, a Massachusetts {{court ruled}} in favor of Montgomery against her {{publisher}} Louis Coues Page, as the judge found that he had systemically cheated her out of the profits from the Anne books since 1908. Page used every conceivable excuse to avoid paying Montgomery what he owned her, and after his brother George {{died of a heart attack}} in 1927, accused Montgomery of causing his brothers death by suing him for her <b>rightful</b> <b>shares</b> of the royalties. In fact, Lewis Page was not close to George, who had just left the firm of L.C. Page & Company to get away from his abrasive and arrogant brother before he died of a heart-attack, aged 52. In October 1928, Montgomery finally won while Page, a sore loser to the end, continued to insist in public that she had caused the death of his brother, which he used as a reason why he should not have to pay Montgomery anything. Page, who was a notorious bully, waged a campaign of harassment against Montgomery, sending her telegrams accusing her of causing his brothers death and the subsequent mental breakdown of his widow by defeating him in court, asking her if she was pleased with what she had allegedly done. Pages behavior badly damaged his business as no author chose to publish with a publisher who had revealed himself to be both dishonest and vindictive, and after the 1920s Pages publishing house largely depended upon reissuing older books rather than issuing new books as authors took their business elsewhere. On 7 November 1928, Montgomery received a cheque for the $15, 000 US dollars that auditors had established Page had cheated her out of.|$|R

If institutions are fragile and property rights insecure, potential adopters of frontier technologies may be dissuaded if adoption leads to increased expost conflict over <b>rightful</b> <b>shares</b> to the higher returns. In such a setting, publicly-funded protection of private property rights may successfully support the adoption of best-available technologies as a Nash equilibrium. The movement to more-secure property rights {{may or may not}} be welfare-enhancing. Abstract: Chapter 2 In this chapter, valuation of a financial derivative, known as Stock Loan, is addressed when the underlying asset is subject to risk of bankruptcy. A stock loan is a financial derivative where the owner of an asset (a share of a stock) can obtain a loan from a lender (usually, a bank) using that asset as a collateral. The movements of the asset price is modeled to follow a geometric Brownian motion, with constant drift and volatility. Following the credit risk literature, risk of bankruptcy is introduced according to both structural and reduced form approaches. In the structural form modeling, default is introduced following the Black and Cox (1976) formulation, where the asset is declared as bankrupt as soon as the asset price falls below a pre-determined lower boundary. Modeling the lower boundary as a deterministic function of time, a closed form expression for the valuation of the financial derivative is obtained in terms of the probability distribution of the first passage time of Brownian motion and the valuation of the Down-and-out barrier option. The pricing formula in the structural form modeling is based on the celebrated Black and Scholes (1973) framework and therefore, is easy to implement. As a salient feature of structural form modeling, default time turns out to be a predictable stopping time. In the reduced form approach, bankruptcy is modeled to occur through a default intensity which is assumed to be a decreasing function of discounted stock price. The event of bankruptcy is modeled as a non-predictable phenomenon. In this formulation, the existence of an optimal exercise boundary is proved, which is of threshold type. This optimal decision threshold is crucially contingent on the policy variables that are treated as parameters of the system. We proceed further to use numerical methods to address the sensitivity analysis of the optimal exercise boundary. The results of our numerical simulation provide further insights into the linkage between optimal exercise boundary and the policy variables. We find that optimal exercise boundary is crucially contingent on the effective rate of return (defined as the difference between interest and lending rate) and exhibits a non-monotone relationship. We also find an interval where optimal exercise boundary shows a monotone increasing relationship with an increase in volatility. The sensitivity analysis in the reduced form modeling can be useful in recommending policy prescriptions in the valuation of mortgage backed securities...|$|R

2500|$|The dating of Hesiod's {{life is a}} {{contested issue}} in {{scholarly}} circles (see § Dating below). Epic narrative allowed poets like Homer no opportunity for personal revelations.

The former poem says that his father came from Cyme in Aeolis (on the coast of Asia Minor, a little south of the island Lesbos) and crossed the sea to settle at a hamlet, near Thespiae in Boeotia, named Ascra, [...] "a cursed place, cruel in winter, hard in summer, never pleasant" [...] (Works 640).

For instance: the public are under a vague impression that, because they have paid for the contents of the British Museum, every one has an equal right to see and to handle them. But the public have similarly paid for the contents of Woolwich arsenal; yet do not expect free access to it, or handling of its contents. The British Museum is neither a free circulating library, nor a free school: it is a place for the safe preservation, and exhibition on due occasion, of unique books, unique objects of natural history, and unique works of art; its books can no more be used by everybody than its coins can be handled, or its statues cast. There ought to be free libraries in every quarter of London, with large and complete reading-rooms attached; so also free educational museums should be open in every quarter of London, all day long, until late at night, well lighted, well catalogued, and rich in contents both of art and natural history. But neither the British Museum nor National Gallery is a school; they are treasuries; and both should be severely restricted in access and in use. Unless some order of this kind is made, and that soon, for the MSS. department of the Museum, (its superintendents have sorrowfully told me this, and repeatedly), the best MSS. in the collection will be destroyed, irretrievably, by the careless and continual handling to which they are now subjected.|$|E
6000|$|Certainly the {{religious}} and moral ideas of the Dodsons and Tullivers were of too specific a kind to be arrived at deductively, from the statement that {{they were part of}} the Protestant population of Great Britain. Their theory of life had its core of soundness, as all theories must have on which decent and prosperous families have been reared and have flourished; but it had the very slightest tincture of theology. If, in the maiden days of the Dodson sisters, their Bibles opened more easily at some parts than others, it was because of dried tulip-petals, which had been distributed quite impartially, without preference for the historical, devotional, or doctrinal. Their religion was of a simple, semi-pagan kind, but there was no heresy in it,--if heresy properly means choice,--for they didn't know there was any other religion, except that of chapel-goers, which appeared to run in families, like asthma. How should they know? The vicar of their pleasant rural parish was not a controversialist, but a good hand at whist, and one who had a joke always ready for a blooming female parishioner. The religion of the Dodsons consisted in revering whatever was customary and respectable; it was necessary to be baptized, else one could not be buried in the church-yard, and to take the sacrament before death, as a security against more dimly understood perils; but it was of equal necessity to have the proper pall-bearers and well-cured hams at one's funeral, and to leave an unimpeachable will. A Dodson would not be taxed with the omission of anything that was becoming, or that belonged to that eternal fitness of things which was plainly indicated in the practice of the most substantial parishioners, and in the family traditions,--such as obedience to parents, faithfulness to kindred, industry, rigid honesty, thrift, the thorough scouring of wooden and copper utensils, the hoarding of coins likely to disappear from the currency, the production of first-rate commodities for the market, and the general preference of whatever was home-made. The Dodsons were a very proud race, and their pride lay in the utter frustration of all desire to tax them with a breach of traditional duty or propriety. A wholesome pride in many respects, since it identified honor with perfect integrity, thoroughness of work, and faithfulness to admitted rules; and society owes some worthy qualities in many of her members to mothers of the Dodson class, who made their butter and their fromenty well, and would have felt disgraced to make it otherwise. To be honest and poor was never a Dodson motto, still less to seem rich though being poor; rather, the family badge was to be honest and rich, and not only rich, but richer than was supposed. To live respected, and have the proper bearers at your funeral, was an achievement of the ends of existence that would be entirely nullified if, on the reading of your will, you sank in the opinion of your fellow-men, either by turning out to be poorer than they expected, or by leaving your money in a capricious manner, without strict regard to degrees of kin. The right thing must always be done toward kindred. The right thing was to correct them severely, if they were other than a credit to the family, but still not to alienate from them the smallest <b>rightful</b> <b>share</b> in the family shoebuckles and other property. A conspicuous quality in the Dodson character was its genuineness; its vices and virtues alike were phases of a proud honest egoism, which had a hearty dislike to whatever made against its own credit and interest, and would be frankly hard of speech to inconvenient [...] "kin," [...] but would never forsake or ignore them,--would not let them want bread, but only require them to eat it with bitter herbs.|$|E
