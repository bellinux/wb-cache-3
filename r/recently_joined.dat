Initially the British mistook the frigate squadron for French warships and Swiftsure chased them away. They returned the following day once the error had been realised.

On 16 August the British burned and destroyed the grounded prize Heureux as no longer fit for service and on 18 August also burned Guerrier and Mercure.
