5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning <b>rod</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body {{out the window and}} stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the <b>rod</b> <b>in,</b> the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the mid-1800s}} rods were {{generally}} made in England. This changed in 1846 when American Samuel Phillippe introduced an imported fishing rod {{the first six}} strips of Calcutta cane made in Bavaria where Phillippe was importing Violins that he passed off as his own hand work. Split-cane rods were later independently produced after Phillippe started to sell the imported rods to a New York retailer and then copied by Americans Charles Orvis, Hiram Leonard and Englishman William Hardy in the 1870s and mass production methods made these rods accessible to the public. Horton Manufacturing Company first introduced an all steel <b>rod</b> <b>in</b> 1913. These rods were heavy and flexible and did not satisfy many customers. The next big occurrence in fishing rods was {{the introduction of the}} fiberglass <b>rod</b> <b>in</b> the 1940s and was developed by Robert Gayle and a Mr. Mcguire.|$|E
25|$|A {{curtain rod}} or {{traverse}} rod is a device used to suspend curtains, usually above windows or {{along the edges}} of showers, though also wherever curtains might be used.

25|$|In physics, {{there are}} several systems whose {{dynamical}} equations resemble the equations of motion of a gyrostat. Examples include a solid body with a cavity filled with an inviscid, incompressible, homogeneous liquid, the static equilibrium configuration of a stressed elastic <b>rod</b> <b>in</b> elastica theory, the polarization dynamics of a light pulse propagating through a nonlinear medium, the Lorenz system in chaos theory, and the motion of an ion in a Penning trap mass spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{the fact}} that in midgear the valve opening should be the same for the piston in both front and rear dead centre {{positions}} is used to find the mid gear position of the pivot between the combination rod and reach <b>rod.</b> <b>In</b> practice the valve spindle length is adjusted to ensure this as part of setting the timing. Also the dimensions of the lead and lap lever are set so that the valve moves twice the lead + lap of the valve.|$|E

The investigation opened on 25 June at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, with Sir Arthur Colefax in charge. The cause of the engine failure was the fracture of No. 4 connecting <b>rod</b> <b>in</b> the starboard engine. The engine had run for 126 hours since its last overhaul, with the permitted time between overhauls being 300 hours. The connecting rod had failed due to the failure of the big end bearing studs.|$|E

25|$|To {{lay out the}} Walschaerts gear, the {{proportions}} of the combination lever must be chosen. The total movement of the valve <b>rod</b> <b>in</b> mid gear should be symmetric between front and back dead centre. A displacement of the union link end by half the piston travel must cause a valve rod displacement of the valve lead plus the valve lap. The ratio of distance from union link end to pivot with radius rod to {{the distance between the}} valve rod end to the pivot with the radius rod should be in the same proportion as half piston travel to valve lap plus lead.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{of using}} a grid for control was {{patented}} by Lee de Forest, resulting in considerable research into alternate tube designs that would avoid his patents. One concept used a magnetic field instead of an electrical charge to control current flow, leading {{to the development of}} the magnetron tube. In this design, the tube was made with two electrodes, typically with the cathode in the form of a metal <b>rod</b> <b>in</b> the center, and the anode as a cylinder around it. The tube was placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet arranged such that the magnetic field was aligned parallel to the axis of the electrodes.|$|E
25|$|Care for {{telescopic}} {{fishing rods}} {{is much the}} same as other rods. The only difference being that one should not open the telescopic <b>rod</b> <b>in</b> manner that whips a closed rod into the open position rapidly. Whipping or flinging a telescopic fishing rod open may and likely will cause it to be difficult to close. When closing the rods make a slight twisting motion while pushing the sections together. Often the rods come with tip covers to protect the tip and guides. Additionally, extra care must be taken not to get dirt or sand in the joints; due to their design this can easily damage this style of rod.|$|E

25|$|On 11 January 1554/5 Cleutin wrote a {{long letter}} to the Duke of Guise {{detailing}} the problems he perceived in Scotland that reduced revenue. The people needed to be ruled with a <b>rod</b> <b>in</b> the hand, desiring neither peace or justice. In frontier regions the heads of many families {{were no more than}} bandits, preying on Scots and English alike, of no value in peace or war. The many good islands were in poor estate, and French troops lightly armed in Scottish jacks would help the revenue of the Queen and Dowager. None of the Scottish fortresses would hold out for an hour against invasion, and he lacked men, a military engineer, wood, and lime for repairs.|$|E
25|$|A rod can bend in {{different}} curves. Traditionally the bending curve is mainly determined by its tapering. In simplified terms, a fast taper will bend {{a lot more}} in the tip area and not much in the butt part, and a slow taper will tend to bend too much at the butt and delivers a weak rod. A progressive tapering which loads smooth from top to butt, adding in power the deeper the rod is bent. In practice, the tapers of quality rods often are curved or in steps to achieve the right action and bending curve for the type of fishing a rod is built. In today's practice, different fibres with different properties {{can be used in a}} single <b>rod.</b> <b>In</b> this practice, there is no straight relationship anymore between the actual tapering and the bending curve.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} whistles {{occur at}} low flow speeds, this whistle occurs {{at very high}} speeds. When a subsonic jet impinges on a cavity, jet instability {{becomes part of the}} feedback loop as with the hole tone. When a supersonic jet impinges on a cavity, shock wave instability becomes part of the feedback loop. The figure on the right is one example of this whistle. A cylindrical cavity with one end open and facing the supersonic circular jet will result in extremely intense sound. The shapes in the figure represent the shock/expansion cells within the jet. A related configuration, called the stem jet, has a central <b>rod</b> <b>in</b> the jet that extends to support and align the cavity. There {{are a number of other}} geometric variations, all of which operate in similar fashion, such as the steam whistle.|$|E
