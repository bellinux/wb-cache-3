5|$|Despite {{its lack}} of {{commercial}} success {{when it was first}} released, the C5 gained an unexpected degree of cult status in the later years. Collectors began purchasing them as investment items, reselling them for considerably more than their original <b>retail</b> <b>price.</b> One such investor, Adam Harper, bought 600 C5s from a film company as a speculative investment in 1987. He sold all but four within two years, selling them to customers who wanted a novel or more environmentally friendly form of transportation. He also found willing customers among drivers who had been banned from the road, as the C5 did not need a driving licence or vehicle tax. According to Harper, C5s could be resold for as much as £2,500 – more than six times the original <b>retail</b> <b>price.</b> By 1996, a Special Edition C5 in its original box was reported to be worth more than £5,000 to collectors.|$|E

Monthly average prices data of potatoes and banana collected from Musanze, Huye, Kibungo, Muhanga and Nyabugogo markets from January 2002 to July 2013 are used. Potatoes are mainly produced in Musanze District and Banana in Ngoma District where the Kibungo market is located.
