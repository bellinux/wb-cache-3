40|$|Farmland {{birds have}} {{suffered}} a severe decline in recent years throughout Europe including Ireland. Agricultural intensification {{is believed to be}} the main cause and this has led to the introduction of agri-environmental schemes, of which set-aside is a part. Bird abundance and diversity were compared between set-aside and adjacent tillage or grassland at 18 locations. The set-aside sites were also assigned to one of four management types: <b>rotational</b> <b>set-aside,</b> non-rotational set-aside, first year set-aside that was productive grassland in the previous year, and long-term set-aside that was grazed by animals in winter. Species diversity and the abundances of skylark, meadow pipit and woodpigeon were significantly greater in set-aside sites. Species diversity was not significantly different between set-aside management types and meadow pipit, skylark, pheasant, house sparrow, magpie, snipe and starling were closely associated with non-rotational set-aside, which also contained significantly larger numbers of these species compared to the other set-aside types. This study shows that set-aside does enhance bird diversity and abundance and that, in Ireland, the most effective form of set-aside is non-rotational. It also shows that the most appropriate form of set-aside will vary from situation to situation and that a one size fits all view should not be taken in the development of agri-environmental schemes...|$|E
40|$|With {{uncertainty}} {{concerning the}} future of set-aside, over-wintering stubble is an attractive management option within the agri-environment scheme. Over-wintering stubbles could be included as part of <b>rotational</b> <b>set-aside,</b> benefiting farmland biodiversity. However, there is little research on managing stubbles to maximise weed seed loss, so farmers {{may be reluctant to}} adopt this option for fear of increased weed infestation. The purpose of this investigation is to develop effective management of over-wintering stubbles to minimise pernicious grass weeds in sequential crops, whilst maintaining beneficial species diversity. Research has focused on four annual grass-weeds (Alopecurus myosuroides, Anisantha sterilis, Bromus commutatus and Lolium multiflorum) of increased occurrence and/or resistance to herbicides. Hitherto, work has concentrated on the effects of stubble manipulation on weed seed germination and mortality, in particular by straw spreading or removal after harvest. The dynamics of artificially inoculated weed populations were monitored from harvest until early spring. Results obtained indicate that where straw is retained on the soil surface, it provides a favourable microclimate for seed depletion of Anisantha sterilis and Bromus commutatus through germination. Conversely, greater depletion of Alopecurus myosuroides and Lolium multiflorum seed occurred from stubbles in which a straw layer was absent. Seed recovery work provided evidence that most seeds remaining ungerminated throughout the trial period were still viable, but {{a large proportion of the}} seeds sown were unaccounted for. As these species are not generally favoured as a food source, the as yet unknown fate of these seeds has implications for subsequent grass-weed infestations...|$|E
40|$|An organic {{long-term}} {{field experiment}} with two factors {{has been carried}} out since 1998 at the experimental station Gladbacherhof, University of Giessen. Effects of 3 different farm types (with lifestock raising, stockless farming with <b>rotational</b> <b>set-aside,</b> stockless farming only cash crops) combined with 4 tillage treatments (mouldboard plough, two-layer-plough, reduced tillage depth and tillage without plough) on plants, soil and environment have been investigated. This article presents results on the coverage rate of arable wild plants (weed coverage), the range of weed species, the abundance of C. arvense (L.) Scop. (Canada thistle) and the weed phytomass during harvest time of the main crops dependent on farm type and soil tillage. It can be concluded that, compared to conventional economic weed thresholds, the weed coverage was generally relatively low and only limited ranges of species were found. Wild arable plants probably did not have any impact on yields of the cultivated plants due to intensive mechanical regulatory measures. In stockless organic farming without alfalfa-grass in the crop rotation Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. (Canada thistle) might become a problem whereas this perennial root-weed does not seem to raise a long term problem in a soil tillage system without ploughing. In all treatments the abundance of weeds like Galium aparine L. (catchweed bedstraw) and Stellaria media L. (chickweed) was high. However, none of the farm types or soil tillage systems succeeded in providing evidence of promoting rare species or encouraging biodiversity. In order to achieve this special support measures should be implemented...|$|E
40|$|Short-term <b>rotational</b> fallows, new <b>set-asides</b> {{and seed}} {{mixtures}} containing specific seed-bearing crops are best alternative to provide seed food for farmland birds (Hyvönen & Huusela-Veistola 2011). The age of set-aside and vegetation structure {{are more important}} than seed mixture or plant species richness in supporting insect food for birds, and therefore set asides of various ages are needed (Hyvönen & Huusela-Veistola 2011). Even a short-term fallow sown with a simple seed mixture can encourage populations of generalist predators (Huusela-Veistola & Hyvönen 2006), but longterm set-asides may be even better for natural enemies (Huusela-Veistola 2008). Because of the various species requirements numerous habitats are needed if biodiversity is to be increased or maintained. At the landscape level, the proportion and location of non-crop temporal habitats may be important factors for key ecosystem services. Therefore, temporal habitats, e. g. set-asides, of various ages and different vegetation structures {{should be included in the}} agricultural landscape to encourage optimum functional biodiversity. ...|$|R
40|$|Changes in modem {{agriculture}} {{have been}} shown to have detrimental affects on those bird species whose populations mainly inhabit the wider countryside. Recently extensive changes to the farmed landscape have occurred through implementation of European agricultural policy much of which has been concerned with decreasing agricultural production. Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), with almost the entire British population breeding on farmland, is a species that is thought to have been particularly affected by agricultural change. A study attempting to assess the impact that modern, intensive arable farming had on a breeding population of lapwing was undertaken from 1995 to 1997 in south-west Lancashire. The study site had an open character and was predominantly winter farmed (cultivation occurring September-February) although {{more than a third of}} the area was spring cultivated. Permanent pasture and <b>rotational</b> <b>set-aside</b> (RSA) accounted for about 2 % and 5 % of the cropped area respectively. Lapwings preferred to nest in spring farmed fields and RSA. The overall nest survival was 55. 5 % and did not differ significantly between years. Hatching success was highest in RSA (88 %), lowest in spring farmed fields (48. 4 %) and intermediate in winter farmed fields (57. 2 %). Hatching success was significantly higher in spring farmed fields than in other habitats but did not differ significantly between winter and spring farmed fields. The hatching success of winter farmed fields was elevated by the success of nests of fields cultivated late in the winter. The main cause of nest losses was farming operations which caused 77. 4 % of all nests lost. Predation accounted for 14. 4 % of nest losses and desertion for 8. 2 %. There were annual differences in nest destruction in winter farmed crops caused by differences in the timing of agricultural operations. Nest destruction was highest in unsown fields but was compensated for by a high rate of replacement and high hatching success in replacement clutches. Two types of crop were spring farmed, combinable (mainly cereals) and vegetable (mainly potatoes) crops. Higher hatching 2 success in spring cereals than in vegetables was related to the differing intensities of management between the two crop categories. Lapwing preferred to nest in dense aggregations and far from ditches both of which reduced the risk of predation. Low densities of nest predators were maintained in the study area by predator control. Chicks from larger eggs survived better than chicks from smaller eggs. Chicks undertaking movements from natal to rearing fields suffered high levels of mortality. Chick mortality was caused by poor body condition, entrapment in field boundary ditches or predation or from the interaction of these factors. Brood movements were influenced by the distribution of crop types. Spring farmed fields and pasture were used for rearing broods. Predation was the main proximate cause of mortality for radio-marked chicks and accounted for 52 % of all losses. Predation was a significant mortality factor until chicks were at least 20 days old, whereas poor body condition (31 % of all radio-marked chick losses) and ditch entrapment (17 % of all losses) only killed very young chicks. Fledging success or hatching success is thought to be the main limit on productivity. Dietary studies revealed chicks ate mainly beetles but their diet varied depending upon rearing location. Surface living chick prey was abundant throughout the season in arable fields and late-hatched chicks suffered higher mortality than those hatched earlier mainly due to an increase in predation late in the season. Recommendations to maintain or improve the conditions for breeding lapwing within the study site are discussed. They include proposals which could operate under the agrienvironment regulations of the CAP, such as an increase in the area spring farmed with the cultivation of both cereal and vegetables and changes to the management of <b>rotational</b> <b>set-aside</b> to make such fields more suitable for brood rearing...|$|E
40|$|Amongst {{recent changes}} to the Common Agricultural Policy have been the {{introduction}} of set-aside schemes, tentatively in 1988 and more forcibly in 1992. Such schemes remove land from agricultural production for a fixed period of time whilst ensuring the land is maintained to a standard suitable for any future return to cropping. The main purpose of set-aside in the EC {{is to reduce the}} over-production of certain food crops including cereals. The subsidiary aim of using set-aside to improve the environmental quality of farmland has gained in importance since the early 1990 s as environmental issues have become increasingly highlighted. The primary aim of this research was to determine whether set-aside was promoting environmental improvements within the farmland. This was related to the possible advantages set-aside could give the wider countryside, {{in the light of the}} limited extent and impact of targeted environmental schemes. The study focused upon a sample of farm holdings in Northern Hampshire. Questionnaires and interviews were used to study farmers' opinions and the management of set-aside. Few farmers felt that set-aside had improved the environment. This was particularly true of those with <b>rotational</b> <b>set-aside.</b> However, some benefits were described, mainly relating to increases in bird species. The majority of these were unplanned and developed purely by chance. Other aspects, such as set-aside clearing crop-land of weeds, were generally a consequence of the growers adapting the scheme to meet their own farming requirements. Many farmers expressed an interest in conservation issues and were keen to see the incorporation of more environmental benefits, such as conservation headlands, within the set-aside regulations. Despite their interest, few had entered agri-environmental schemes or utilised conservation grants. This was largely because the compensation rates were not sufficiently attractive or the schemes were unsuitable for the farm. The farmers in this study appeared relatively knowledgeable about conservation, but were less clear as to how to adopt this within their overall farm management plans. Set-aside has the potential to contribute towards the improvement of the countryside's wildlife resource, but much more needs to be done to promote this. Furthermore, it is important that the attitudes of the farmers, and those framing policy, are altered so any positive environmental benefits, made as a consequence of set-aside or agri-environmental schemes, will be sustained once these schemes come to a close...|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} the evolution and future of the set-aside system of the European Union. The focus is on Finland s integration to the system. The future developments are evaluated from Finland s point of view. To {{be eligible for the}} compensatory payments introduced as part of the CAP reform for arable crops, producers must set aside a portion of their arable land with a view to achieving a better balance between production and domestic and international demand. The set-aside rate was fixed at 15 % for the <b>rotational</b> <b>set-aside</b> and 20 % (18 % in the UK and Denmark) for other forms of set-aside. The set-aside requirements do not appeal small producers producing less than 92 tons cereals a year. Because of bad harvests in certain areas of the world combined with effective production control measures, for the marketing year 1995 / 96, the set-aside rate was cut to 12 % (15 % and 17 %). During the year 1995, the intervention stocks of cereals continuously decreased and world market prices increased. Consequently, the EU decided to cut the set-aside rate to 10 % for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. As usual, the reduction only applies for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. For the year 1997 / 98, the portion will automatically revert to 15 % (and 18 % and 20 %). The cut of set-aside rate serve the interest of major cereals- producing countries. Finland is obliged to pay her share of the costs without getting any advantage. Finland s interest would probably be to increase the set-aside rate. This is because, within a certain range, (a) the change of the obligatory set-aside rate barely affects the set-aside area in Finland; (b) the change of the obligatory set-aside rate barely affects the cereals production in Finland; and (c) the change of the cereals-production area barely affects the farm income in Finland. The discussion concerning the future development of the EU set-aside system should include the following themes: (a) is the current cereals shortage a temporal or continuous phenomenon; (b) as a high set-aside rate helps to keep cereal prices up, farmers would gain in the form of high producer prices and the tax payers would gain in the form of low export subsidies (or high export taxes); (c) because the increase of set-aside rate is more difficult than the cut, the cuts should be postpo ned if possible; (b) an alternative way to increase production is to rise the farm-by-farm ceiling of 92 tons (that makes the set-aside obligatory), rather than to cut the set-aside rate; and (e) for environmental reasons, the set-aside area shou ld be covered with plants. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The temporal cut of the EU set-aside requirements for the 1996 / 97 marketing year: consequences for Finlan...|$|E
