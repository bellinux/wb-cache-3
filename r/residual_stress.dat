Milling <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> correlate closely with the cutting parameters. In this paper, the generation and distribution of surface <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> in milling of aluminum alloy 7050 -T 7451 was investigated. The cutting speed changes from 300 m/min to 3000 m/min. In the experiments, the <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> {{on the surface of}} specimen are detected by X-ray diffraction technique. The result shows that compressive <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> are generated when cutting speed is under 500 m/min.

40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>stresses</b> in {{a surface}} layer {{determine}} many exploitation characteristics of machined surface. Depending on their kind {{and the type}} of applied loading, the influence of <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> can be negative or positive. Tensile <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> usually exert highly detrimental impact on several functional aspects such as strength, fatigue life, corrosion, wear resistance, etc., whereas compressive <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> are considered to have a beneficial effect on these features. The <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> found in mechanical parts are mainly generated in the final steps of machining process and are highly dependent on the machining conditions used. The increasing trend in industrial practice to eliminate cutting fluids from machining processes substantially changes machining conditions and influences the relationship between factors causing <b>residual</b> <b>stresses.</b> The main purpose of the presented investigations was to identify the relationship between <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> in a surface layer and the method of cooling employed. Using the X-ray diffraction method, <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> generated in both the cutting (circumferential) and feed (axial) directions were analysed. On the basis of empirical results the influence of turning with and without the application of emulsion on <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> was identified for a broad range of cutting parameters. The results showed that the method of cooling and cutting parameters exert a substantial influence on <b>residual</b> <b>stresses.</b> In the used range of cutting conditions, tensile <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> were detected. The elimination of cutting fluid from a turning process of C 45 steel increased the magnitude of <b>residual</b> <b>stresses</b> in the surface layer. <b>Residual</b> <b>stresses</b> in the cutting direction turned out to be higher than in the feed direction in most cases of cutting conditions...|$|R
500|$|Further {{developments}} in welding steel with GMAW {{led to a}} variation known as short-circuit transfer (SCT) or short-arc GMAW, in which the current is lower than for the globular method. As {{a result of the}} lower current, the heat input for the short-arc variation is considerably reduced, making it possible to weld thinner materials while decreasing the amount of distortion and <b>residual</b> <b>stress</b> in the weld area. As in globular welding, molten droplets form on the tip of the electrode, but instead of dropping to the weld pool, they bridge the gap between the electrode and the weld pool {{as a result of the}} lower wire feed rate. [...] This causes a short circuit and extinguishes the arc, but it is quickly reignited after the surface tension of the weld pool pulls the molten metal bead off the electrode tip. This process is repeated about 100 times per second, making the arc appear constant to the human eye. This type of metal transfer provides better weld quality and less spatter than the globular variation, and allows for welding in all positions, albeit with slower deposition of weld material. Setting the weld process parameters (volts, amps and wire feed rate) within a relatively narrow band is critical to maintaining a stable arc: generally between 100 and 200 amperes at 17 to 22 volts for most applications. Also, using short-arc transfer can result in lack of fusion and insufficient penetration when welding thicker materials, due to the lower arc energy and rapidly freezing weld pool. Like the globular variation, it can only be used on ferrous metals.|$|E
