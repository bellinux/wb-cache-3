Overcome by the dazzling light, he is killed and duplicated by the Mysterons. Knowing that K14's aerial will have to be retuned to receive the images from Mini-Sat 5, his reconstruction fixes an explosive device to the <b>rotation</b> <b>gear</b> — set to detonate when caught in the machinery — and then hides among the rocks above K14. With the aid of a Spectrum helicopter piloted by Melody Angel and Captain Grey, Scarlet and Blue locate and confront the reconstruction minutes before 3 a.m. Firing on the officers, the duplicate is killed by Scarlet, but not before revealing its act of sabotage. Before Scarlet and Blue can warn Carter and Angelini, the astronomers rotate the aerial and the bomb detonates, causing the structure to crash down onto the K14 observatory. However, although Carter and Angelini are dead, and Earth has missed the reception of the images, Colonel White insists that the setback does not mark the end of Operation Sword.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{low speed}} gearboxes, shaft <b>rotation</b> and <b>Gear</b> Mesh Frequencies are lower and closer {{requiring}} higher spectral resolution {{in order to}} identify each one. Normally this problem is avoided increasing the acquisition time. Nevertheless, sometimes load and speed are variables, so the working period on stationary conditions is shorter. In these cases, it is useful to apply other kinds of tools such as the high resolution parametric methods. In this work a parametric method is applied in the misalignment detection of low-speed gears.

5000|$|Spur gears or straight-cut gears are the {{simplest}} type of gear. They {{consist of a}} cylinder or disk with teeth projecting radially. Though the teeth are not straight-sided (but usually of special form to achieve a constant drive ratio, mainly involute but less commonly cycloidal), the edge of each tooth is straight and aligned parallel to the axis of <b>rotation.</b> These <b>gears</b> mesh together correctly only if fitted to parallel shafts. [...] No axial thrust is created by the tooth loads. Spur gears are excellent at moderate speeds but tend to be noisy at high speeds.|$|R

40|$|Interaction {{of various}} {{components}} in rotating machinery like gearboxes may generate excitation forces at various frequencies. These frequencies may sometimes overlap with {{the frequencies of}} the forces generated by other components in the system. Conventional vibration spectrum analysis does not attenuate noise and spectral frequency band overlapping, which in many applications masks {{the changes in the}} structural response caused by the deterioration of certain components in the machine. This problem is overcome by the use of time domain averaging (dsynchronous averaging). In time domain averaging, the vibration signal is sampled at a frequency that is synchronized with the <b>rotation</b> of the <b>gear</b> of interest and the samples obtained for each singular position of the gear are ensemble-averaged. When sufficient averages are taken, all the vibration from the gearbox, which is asynchronous with the vibration of the gear, is attenuated. The resulting time synchronously averaged signal obtained through this process indicates the vibration produced during one rotation of the monitored gear. This direct time domain averaging process essentially acts as a broadband noise synchronous filter, which filters out the frequency content that is asynchronous with the vibration of the gear of interest provided that enough averages are taken. The time domain averaging procedure requires an enormous amount of vibration data to execute, making it very difficult to develop online gearbox condition monitoring systems that make use of time domain averaging to enhance their diagnostic capabilities since data acquisition and analysis cannot be done simultaneously. The objective of this research was to develop a more efficient way for calculating the time domain average of a gear vibration signal. A study of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) was conducted to assess their suitability for use in time domain averaging. Two time domain averaging models that use ANNs and SVMs were developed. Model 1 uses a single feedforward network configuration to map the input which are <b>rotation</b> synchronized <b>gear</b> vibration signals to the output which is the time domain average of the gear vibration signal, using only a section of the input space. Model 2 operates in two stages. In the first stage, it uses a feedforward network to predict the instantaneous time domain average of the gear vibration after 10 inputs (10 <b>rotation</b> synchronized <b>gear</b> vibration signals) to predict the instantaneous average of the <b>gear</b> <b>rotation.</b> The outputs from the first state are used as inputs to the second stage, where a second feedforward network is used to predict the time domain average of the entire vibration signal. When ANNs and SVMs were implemented, the results indicated that the amount of gear vibration date that is required to calculate the time domain average using Model 1 can be reduced by 75 percent and the amount of gear vibration data that needs to be stored in the data acquisition system when Model 2 is used can be reduced by 83 percent.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel pair of noncircular gear profiles for minimising shaft accelerations of the driven gear. The proposed profiles are developed {{based on an}} "exponential" function that is valid {{for a portion of}} <b>gear</b> <b>rotation,</b> and this function is extended to the remaining parts of the <b>rotation</b> of both <b>gears.</b> The exact shapes of the centrodes of the toothed bodies, which depend on a "smoothness" parameter, b, constitute a trade-off between the maximum shaft acceleration and the smoothness of the centrodes, so as to control the maximum tooth dynamic forces and stresses. A comparison between the derived noncircular gears and a gear pair that provides a sinusoidal variation of the angular velocity is presented. Results indicate that, for two-lobule gears, the maximum and minimum values of the polar radii, the velocity at the contact point, and the gear ratio are the same for both profiles. In contrast, there are significant differences in the angular acceleration of the driven gear, the tangential acceleration at the contact point, and the pressure angle, especially in the first one. It is concluded that the derived pair not only can provide low shaft accelerations, but also low tangential accelerations and small pressure angles...|$|R
50|$|Two early {{improvements}} were suspension {{wheels and}} rim gearing. Suspension wheels are {{constructed in the}} same manner as a bicycle wheel, the rim being supported under tension from the hub- this led to larger lighter wheels than the former design where the heavy spokes were under compression. Rim-gearing entailed adding a notched wheel to the rim or shroud of the wheel. A stub gear engaged the rim-gear and took the power into the mill using an independent line shaft. This removed the rotative stress from the axle which could thus be lighter, and also allowed more flexibility in the location of the power train. The shaft <b>rotation</b> was <b>geared</b> up from that of the wheel which led to less power loss. An example of this design pioneered by Thomas Hewes and refined by William Fairburn can be seen at the 1849 restored wheel at the Portland Basin Canal Warehouse.|$|R

50|$|Another {{difference}} between semi-trucks and cars {{is the way}} the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The clutch brake stops the <b>rotation</b> of the <b>gears,</b> and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes.|$|R
