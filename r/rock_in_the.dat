40|$|The {{industrial}} use of <b>the</b> phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ryukyu Islands were studied and following results were obtained: (1) It {{may be possible}} to use as powdered phosphate fertilizer because of the following reasons: (a) <b>The</b> phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ryukyu Islands contain, as compared with <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> others, less fluorine and much more zinc, manganese, and copper. (b) <b>The</b> phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in,</b> [...] <b>the</b> Ryukyu Islands have a high value of 2 % citric acid soluble phosphoric acid. (2) The high value of 2 % citric acid soluble phosphoric acid of the fused phosphate produced from Ryukyu's phosphorite and serpentine makes <b>the</b> phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ryukyu Islands an invaluably useful phosphorite as a raw material of fused phosphate fertilizer...|$|R
40|$|Surveying <b>the</b> {{phosphate}} <b>rock</b> deposits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ryukyu Islands，the writer found that, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ryukyu Islands the {{phosphate rock}} deposits might be grouped into two main types as follows; (1) Calcarious phosphate <b>rocks.</b> …… deposit <b>in</b> pocket form on hills near seashores．(2) Iron,aluminium　phosphate <b>rocks.</b> ……deposit　<b>in</b>　calcium　cave. Principal components were determined {{in order to}} clarify chemical characteristics of <b>the</b> phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ryukyu Islands. Besides <b>the</b> phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ryukyu Islands which were mainly investigated，the following rocks and minerals were also tested for a comparative study；（ａ）Phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South Sea Islands（ｂ）Continental phosphate rocks（ｃ）Apatites <b>in</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> <b>The</b> phosphate <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ryukyu Islands contain more iron，aluminium and silica than others, and a close correlation exists among these components. This fact suggests that the phosphate rocks contain iron and aluminium as silicate...|$|R
5|$|A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio {{are told}} by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they {{overcome}} the monsters, but as they reach {{the gates of the}} palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of a stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight.|$|E
5|$|An {{earthquake}} at 8:32:17a.m. PDT (UTC−7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, {{caused the}} entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and steam-rich <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake {{in a hot}} mix of lava and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rise}} of grunge and {{alternative}} <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, her record label relegated her productions only to the European region, where she continued to tour extensively. She remained a successful charting artist in Germany, despite living and producing her albums in the US. When classic heavy metal found again the favour of the public, she returned to tour {{all over the world}} and her popularity as a veteran singer grew considerably, inspiring many new female metal artists. Doro is also known for her duets performed both live and in studio with other singers and musicians of the metal scene, whom she has befriended in her long career.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> {{and around}} <b>the</b> Fielding Garr Ranch {{are some of}} <b>the</b> oldest <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. At 2.7 billion years old, they are older than <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the Grand Canyon. Tintic Quartzite is found on the {{northern}} third of the island. It is about 550 million years old. Tufa rocks on the island are some of <b>the</b> youngest <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. They were deposited as Lake Bonneville receded between 10,000 - 15,000 years ago. The tufa rocks resemble concrete and are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of Buffalo Point.|$|R

5|$|Genesis were an English {{rock band}} formed at Charterhouse School, Godalming, Surrey in 1967. The most commercially {{successful}} and longest-lasting line-up consisted of keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford and drummer/singer Phil Collins. Significant former members were original lead singer Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett. The band underwent many changes in musical style over its career, from folk music to progressive <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, before moving towards pop {{at the end}} of the decade. They have sold 21.5 million RIAA-certified albums in the United States and their worldwide sales are estimated to be between 100 million and 150 million.|$|E
5|$|Geologists have {{classified}} the volcano's {{lava flows}} into two units. The Hawi Volcanic layers were {{deposited in the}} shield stage of the volcano's life, and the younger Pololu Volcanics were deposited in the volcano's post-shield stage. The <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> younger Hawi section, which overlies the older Pololu flows, is mostly 260,000 to 140,000 years old, and composed mainly of hawaiite and trachyte. The separation between the two layers is not clear; the lowest layers may actually be in the Pololu section, based on their depositional patterns and low phosphorus content. The time intervals separating the two periods of volcanic evolution were extremely brief, something first noted in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Green Day was {{originally}} {{part of the}} punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands including Sublime, Bad Religion, the Offspring, and Rancid with popularizing mainstream interest in punk <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
50|$|Kuhbonan Mountain Range {{was formed}} mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Miocene during the Alpine orogeny as the Arabian Plate finally {{collided}} with the Iranian Plate and consequently this region was pressed against the resistant Lut Block. Kuhbonan Range is made chiefly of Triassic and Jurassic <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwestern part, Jurassic <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central section, and Upper Cretaceous <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeastern region. Paleozoic rocks are found mostly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwestern and eastern parts of the northern section, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southwestern and eastern parts of the cental section of the range.|$|R
50|$|The {{geologic}} {{history of}} the Australian continental mass is extremely prolonged and involved, continuing from the Archaean to <b>the</b> recent. <b>In</b> a gross pattern, continental Australia grew from west to east, with Archean <b>rocks</b> mostly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west, Proterozoic <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre, and Phanerozoic <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east. Recent geologic events are confined to intraplate earthquakes, as the continent of Australia sits distant from the plate boundary.|$|R

5|$|Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Table Rocks area {{for at least}} 15,000 years before European-American settlement. Starting in the mid-19th century during a gold rush, the settlers forced the Takelma tribe away from the Table Rocks and into reservations. The surrounding area was quickly developed. The Table Rock post office was established in 1872, an airstrip was built atop Lower Table Rock in 1948, and a very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) aviation tower was constructed on Upper Table <b>Rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s. The Table Rocks were not protected until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The bed of Fishing Creek {{contains}} red {{and brown}} shale in some places. Other {{parts of the}} watershed lie over gray sandstone or conglomerates. There are numerous deposits of iron ore, limestone and marble in the watershed of Fishing Creek. Most of the <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed, including the Trimmers Rock Formation and Catskill Formation, is from the Devonian Period, {{but some of the}} northernmost tributaries have watersheds on rock from the Mississippian Period, such as the Huntley Mountain Formation and Burgoon sandstone. The creek is a freestone stream although its water is colder than that of most eastern freestone streams.|$|E
5|$|The main {{settlement}} {{on the island}} today is Biggings, which overlooks Housa Voe and is surrounded by in-bye land {{to the east of}} the hill dyke (which runs south from West Voe). To the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about one and a half kilometres in length. Much {{of the rest of the}} area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till. There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile. The lack of peat led to 'turf scalping' for fuel and the bare areas of <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interior.|$|E
50|$|Geologically, the {{mountains}} were mainly uplifted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alpine orogeny during the Neogene and especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Miocene, although the orogenic phase continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pliocene. The range is made chiefly of Jurassic <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western, south-central, eastern and southeastern parts, {{with a smaller}} portion of Paleozoic <b>rocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north-cental section.|$|R

5|$|The {{quality of}} the <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Valley is inconsistent, ranging from finely-grained to coarse stone, the latter with the {{potential}} to be structurally unsound. The occasional layer of shale also caused construction and conservation difficulties, as this rock expands in the presence of water, forcing apart the stone surrounding it. It is thought that some tombs were altered in shape and size depending on the types of rock the builders encountered.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} part of the watershed of West Creek is of the Trimmers Rock Formation. This consists of siltstone and shale and comes from the Devonian period. The northern part of the watershed has rock belonging to the Catskill Formation, which consists of sandstone and siltstone and also comes from the Devonian. The Huntley Mountain Formation {{can be found at the}} headwaters of the creek. This formation consists of sandstone and siltstone and comes from the Mississippian and Devonian periods.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} of Euchambersia {{was found by}} Robert Broom on the South African farm of Vanwyksfontein, owned by a Mr. Greathead, {{near the town of}} Norvalspont. It consists of a single, distorted skull, catalogued as NHMUK R5696, which was described by Broom in 1931. A second, smaller skull, with the specimen number BP/1/4009, was found in 1966 and described by James Kitching in 1977. Both specimens are missing the lower jaw. They originated from the same general layer of <b>rock,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group within the Karoo Supergroup. The Cistecephalus AZ has been dated to the Wuchiapingian stage of the Late Permian, between 256.2 and 255.2 Mya.|$|E

5|$|There {{were few}} {{industrial}} buildings pre-1850; those of note include the 17th-century blast furnace at Pontygwaith {{which gave the}} village its name and the fulling mill established by Harri David in 1738, which in turn gave its name to Tonypandy. Corn mills existed sparsely throughout the valleys as did early coal pits, with two early pits recorded as being opened in 1612 at Rhigos and Cwmparc; though these would have mined from exposed <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hillside and not deep mined.|$|E
5|$|Early on 22 January, Mitchell's squadron, {{reinforced}} by the East Indiaman , stopped a merchant ship for inspection and as the ship was searched two new sails appeared to the southwest near Shown <b>Rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Zuften Islands. Suspicious of {{the identity of the}} new arrivals, Mitchell sent Britannia and Nonsuch in pursuit and the ships turned away. As the East Indiamen closed with the fleeing ships, they were identified as Vengeur and Résolu. The British vessels soon outran the French and the French opened fire to which the larger British vessels responded. Captain Thomas Cheap of Britannia engaged Vengeur while Captain John Canning of Nonsuch attacked Résolu at 10:45 and were soon supported by William Pitt and Houghton. The overwhelming numbers and size of the British squadron soon convinced Corosin and Jallineaux that further resistance was pointless and 45 minutes after the first shots were fired both surrendered. Corosin died {{in the aftermath of the}} battle after losing a leg and another 11 French sailors were killed and 25 wounded, while British losses were one killed and two wounded on Britannia. French records report that Résolu has sustained heavy casualties. The British then manned both raiders with crews from the East Indiaman squadron.|$|E
5|$|Possibly, it was {{accelerated}} by {{the creation of}} the Deccan Traps, however, some scientists maintain the extinction was caused or exacerbated by other factors, such as volcanic eruptions, climate change, or sea level change, separately or together. A 2016 drilling project into the Chicxulub peak ring confirmed that the peak ring comprised granite ejected within minutes from deep in the earth (rather than usual seafloor rock), and evidence of colossal seawater movement directly afterwards (from layered sand deposits). Crucially the cores also showed a near complete absence of gypsum, the usual sea floor <b>rock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, which is sulfate-containing; this would have been vaporized and dispersed as an aerosol into the atmosphere, providing evidence of a probable link between the impact and a global scale of longer-term effects on the climate and food chain.|$|E
