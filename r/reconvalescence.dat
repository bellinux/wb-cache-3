60|$|The Honourable Mr. Bidmore's {{letters to}} his father soon after {{announced}} that poor Mr. Cargill had been seized with a nervous fever, and again, that his <b>reconvalescence</b> was attended with so much debility, it seemed both of mind and body, as entirely to destroy his utility as a travelling companion. Shortly after this the travellers separated, and Cargill returned to his native country alone, indulging upon the road in a melancholy abstraction of mind, which he had suffered to grow upon him since the mental shock which he had sustained, and which in time became the most characteristical feature of his demeanour. His meditations were not even disturbed by any anxiety about his future subsistence, although the cessation of his employment seemed to render that precarious. For this, however, Lord Bidmore had made provision; for, though a coxcomb where the fine arts were concerned, he was in other particulars a just and honourable man, who felt a sincere pride in having drawn the talents of Cargill from obscurity, and entertained due gratitude for {{the manner in which}} he had achieved the important task intrusted to him in his family.|$|E

However, {{the relevance}} of the ceramide metabolism in the <b>reconvalescence</b> phase after stroke is unclear. Besides its well-known property as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine has been reported to inhibit the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), a key regulator of ceramide levels which derives ceramide from sphingomyelin. Furthermore, fluoxetine has shown therapeutic potential in a randomized controlled rehabilitation trial in stroke patients. Our aim was to investigate and modulate ceramide concentrations in the peri-infarct cortex, whose morphological and functional properties correlate with long-term functional outcome in stroke. We show that certain ceramide species are modulated after experimental stroke and that these changes do not result from alterations of ASM activity, but rather from nontranscriptional induction of the ceramide de novo pathway. Unexpectedly, although reducing lesion size, fluoxetine did not improve functional outcome in our model and had no significant influence on ASM activity or the concentration of ceramides. The ceramide metabolism could emerge as a potential therapeutic target in the <b>reconvalescence</b> phase after stroke, as its accumulation in the peri-infarct cortex potentially influences membrane functions as well as signaling events in the tissue essential for neurological recovery...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} a randomized controlled trial and the preliminary effectiveness of ice therapy in the acute phase of a gastrocnemius tear {{for the quality of}} functional recovery. Design: A pilot version of an intended prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted. Participants: A total of 19 patients with an acute tear in the gastrocnemius muscle were randomly allocated to either active or control treatment. Intervention: The intervention consisted of the repeated application of crushed ice. Main measures: Primary outcome measures were functional capacity and <b>reconvalescence</b> time. Secondary outcome measures were pain and work absenteeism. The number of patients we could include within the 6 -hour time window and dropping out from the pilot study were regarded as indicators of the feasibility of ice therapy. Results: A total of 16 patients were excluded from the study because diagnosis was not made within 6 hours after onset of the complaint. The 19 patients included completed the treatment. For functional capacity, <b>reconvalescence</b> time, work absenteeism and pain relief, {{no significant differences between the}} intervention and control group were found. Conclusions: The execution of a randomized controlled trial on ice therapy for acute gastrocnemius tear is feasible though quite an enterprise. First, it is recommended to improve the recruitment processes. Second, power analysis demands inclusion of 396 participants. Preliminary effectiveness in our limited-sized trial indicates that the use of ice is not beneficial for people who receive ice therapy. © The Author(s) 2010...|$|E

40|$|Connection of {{an immune}} system with {{infection}} agents defines the {{further development of}} infectious diseases especially rotavirus infection (RVI). The state of immune system {{before the beginning of}} disease and an adequacy of immune answer to causative agent defines the possibility of disease and its heaviness, duration of an acute period, cyclicity, time of pathogens elimination and period of <b>reconvalescence.</b> The humoral link is one of important components of immune system. Methods. 96 children 1 month- 5 years old with acute intestinal infections of rotavirus etiology were under observation. 51 children with mono-variant of rotavirus infection formed the 1 group. The 11 group included 45 patients with mixed-variant of rotavirus infection. The control group included 32 practically healthy children. The research was carried out at the high point of disease (1 – 3 day) and in period of <b>reconvalescence.</b> (5 – 6 day). The study of humoral link of immunity was carried out using the method of radial immunodiffusion in agar on Mancini G. Results. At comparison of indicators of the humoral link of immune system in children with mono- and mixed-variants of RVI at admission to hospital it was established that Ig М concentration in children of the 1 group was higher (р< 0, 05), and Ig G level in blood serum lower(р< 0, 05) than in the 11 group. So the study of the humoral immunity in blood serum in children with rotavirus infection revealed changes that were presented as an increase of Ig М and IgG indicators and also decrease of IgА. An assessment of an immune system after treatment within this research is characterized with an increase of IgА and IgG and decrease of IgМ. Conclusions. In blood serum of children with mono- and mixed-variants of rotavirus infection in an acute period of disease there was observed decrease of Ig А concentration and increase of Ig М і IgG. In the period of <b>reconvalescence</b> in children with mono- and mixed-variants of an acute intestinal infection of rotavirus etiology the humoral link of immune system is characterized with a tendency to increase of Ig М, there was no improvement on the other indicators.

40|$|A ‘new’ {{group of}} {{pathogenic}} agents, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) (particularly {{the strains of}} O 157 serogroup), emerged in the last 20 years causing an increased number of sporadic and epidemic diarrhoeal diseases with hemorrhagic enterocolitis as a most common clinical manifestation of the infection. As {{a consequence of the}} absorption and cytotoxic effect of the main virulence factor of these bacteria - verotoxin (shiga-toxin), in about 10 % of the affected persons extraintestinal complications, most frequently hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), occurred 7 - 14 days after an episode of diarrhoeal disease. The first case of hemorrhagic enterocolitis with the documented EHEC O 157 infection in Yugoslavia is presented in this paper.

40|$|AIM: To {{remove the}} {{migrated}} bands using a gastrointestinal endoscopic approach. Little is published on complications that can occur. METHODS: From June 2006 to June 2010, eight patients developed intragastric band migration. Two patients had received their AGB {{in a different}} hospital, the remaining six were operated by the same surgeon. In all patients gastrointestinal endoscopic removal of the band was attempted by two individual gastroenterologists. Clinical signs of band migration were: persisted nausea, abdominal pain, weight gain, recurrent infection of the port and tubing system and hematemesis. RESULTS: In four patients removal was performed without complications. In two patients extracting the cleaved gastric band into the stomach appeared impossible. The two remaining patients presented with acute hematemesis and melena. One of these patients was readmitted with hematemesis. The other patient started bleeding during the gastroscopy and was converted to a laparoscopy in {{which one of the}} branches of the left gastric artery was oversewn.

Both anti-Hib antibody concentration and immunoglobulin-G 2 anti-Hib antibody avidity were significantly lower in patients who experienced Hib failure, at onset of disease and after <b>reconvalescence,</b> when compared with controls. This finding suggests that the patients who developed invasive Hib disease—despite having received 3 – 4 Hib conjugate vaccinations—were inadequately primed by these vaccinations.

40|$|Postoperative infections, sepsis and multi organ failure are {{directly}} {{associated with a}} hyperinflammatory reaction and mean a problem in hemihepatectomies and other extended abdominal operations. This reaction {{is characterized by a}} disproportion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Purpose {{of this study was to}} examine the influence of preoperative high-dose methylprednisolone on postoperative immunofunction. Main criterion was the postoperative IL- 6 -plasma level. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 6, IL- 8 and TNF-a, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10, HLA-DR expression on monocytes and TNF-a-synthesis after stimulation with LPS were measured. The determination of ALT, AST, albumin and TPZ- INR as well as t-bilirubin, AP and ?-GT reflected postoperative liver function, synthesis disorders or cholestasis. Also measured were the inflammation parameters CRP and leucocytes as well as creatinine as a marker for postoperative kidney function. The postoperative clinical outcome was assessed by postoperative complications, <b>reconvalescence</b> and duration of postoperative hospital stay. In this study 20 patients were included and they were double-blind randomized distributed in a ratio of 10 : 10 into a steroid and a control group. The patients of the steroid group received a preoperative dose of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg body weight) and the patients of the control group got saline. All hemihepatectomies were done without pringle-maneuver. The results of this study showed significant lower levels of IL- 6 and IL- 8 in the steroid group as well as low suppressed TNF-a- and IL- 10 - concentrations compared to the control group. The TNF-a- concentration after LPS-stimulation was 4 h postoperative significant lower in the steroid group. The HLA-DR expression on monocytes showed no significant differences. CRP was significant lower from the 1 st to the 4 th postoperative day in the steroid group compared to the control group. ALT, AST, albumin and TPZ-INR were not influenced by preoperative high-dose methylprednisolone; t-bilirubin was significant lower in the steroid group on the 6 th postoperative day. The duration of hospital stay was significant shorter in the steroid group, but this result was influenced by a prolonged stay of one patient in the control group because of postoperative complications. There was no significant difference between both groups relating to postoperative complications and <b>reconvalescence.</b> The results of this study show that a hyperinflammatory reaction is effectively inhibited by preoperative high-dose methylprednisolone and that the cellular immunity is not impaired...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Due to the {{increasing}} spread and technical enhancement of endourological methods, open surgery for renal and ureteral calculi almost disappeared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on an actual review of literature, we describe indications, technique and clinical importance of the open and laparoscopic management of urolithiasis. RESULTS: In Europe and Northern America, the surgical therapy of urolithiasis only {{plays a role in}} cases of very large or hard stones, after failure of shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotripsy or ureteroscopic stone removal and in cases of abnormal renal anatomy. However, in emerging markets with different structures and funding {{of the health care system}} and with a limited access to endourological procedures, these techniques still have a higher importance. Particularly in Europe laparoscopic surgery is emerging because calculi can be removed from almost all locations within kidney and ureter using a transperitoneal or retroperitoneal access. Functional outcomes and complication rates are comparable to open surgery. The benefits of laparoscopy are: less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, faster <b>reconvalescence,</b> and better cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS: Although open and laparoscopic removal of renal and ureteral calculi is only performed in a limited number of cases in daily urological practice, they may be superior to the endourological techniques in some circumstances.

40|$|There were {{examined}} 74 children aged from 6 to 18 with complicated and lingering community-acquired pneumonia {{in order to}} increase the quality of medical and diagnostic services. Diagnosing and treatment of patients were conducted in according to «Child’s first aid proceedings within specialty "pediatric pulmonology"». Special study was conducted over the state of surfactant examination in indexes of lipids, their peroxidation and indexes of antioxidant defense in condensate of expired air in children with community-acquired pneumonia. It was reliably proved that serious and lingering forms of pneumonia in children resulted in severe surfactant damage which was associated with changes in indexes of lipids, their peroxidation and antioxidant defense in examined condensate of expired air. In the phase of acute pulmonary inflammation the indexes of total lipids, cholesterol, diene conjugate, malonic dialdehyde, catalase, superoxide dismutase statistically and significantly increased, the content of phospholipids were decreased. The level of mentioned changes corresponds to the degree of inflammation, availability of pulmonary complications (destructive and atelectatic), their extent and duration of illness.

40|$|The aim : is to {{investigate}} pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid {{of children with}} meningitis of different aetiology in {{the dynamics of the}} disease. Materials and methods: there were examined 93 children: 29 of them had bacterial purulent meningitis, 42 ones – serous meningitis, and 22 – an acute respiratory viral infection of meningeal symptomatology (control group). The design of the investigation is an open comparative research. The concentration of proinflammatory (IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8) and anti-inflammatory (IL- 4, IL- 10) cytokines was defined by the solid-phase immune-enzyme assay. The results were processed statistically by computer standard programs Excel and Statistica 7. Results and discussion: different levels of the cytokine concentration increase were detected in the acute period of the disease, the maximal one – in the case of bacterial purulent meningitis, IL- 6 and IL- 10 in particular. The concentration of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 4, IL- 10 was significantly increased to compare with serous meningitis. The decrease of cytokine level was detected in the period of <b>reconvalescence.</b> Conclusion: the cytokine concentration increase in the cerebrospinal fluid in the acute stage of bacterial purulent and serous meningitis indicates both the presence of common patterns of neuroinfectious process and the features caused by the agent, and their increase in the stage of reconvalescense demonstrates the remaining intrathecal inflammation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Features {{of local}} {{immunity}} were {{studied in the}} patients with Salmonella infection at <b>reconvalescence,</b> both without carriership, and in reconvalescent carriers of microbial flora (RCM). In RCMs, as compared to non-carriers, some alterations in gut microbiocenosis were revealed, along with local deficiency of antimicrobial defense factors, i. e., lactoferrin, lysozyme, secretory IgA, free secretory component, antibodies to Salmonella O-antigen, IgA, as opposed {{to high levels of}} IgM, IgG (due to IgG 1 and IgG 4), cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 8, IFNγ, IL- 4). It was shown that sIgA and IgA deficiency are connected with their mangling local production, whereas the revealed increase in IgМ and IgG concentrations proved to be a consequence of increased local synthesis. Application of polyoxidonium (PO) in RCMs lead to improvement in the gut microenvironment, thus reflected by decreased contamination with facultative flora, disappearance of Proteus, Candida spp. and recovery of indigenous anaerobic flora in 92 per cent of cases. Positive dynamics of local immunity associated with PO treatment was justified by restoration of total IgA and sIgA concentrations, due to enhanced local synthesis, increase in free secretory component, higher titers of antibodies to Salmonella O-antigen, and changes in cytokine contents, with restoration of Th 1 /Th 2 cytokine balance. Under in vitro conditions, a PO-associated suppression of anti-complement Salmonella activity was registered, thus rendering positive effects of the drug towards symbionts in the «host-parasite» system, and shortening the terms of microbial excretion in Salmonella carriers. </p...|$|E

But it can also be an incidental finding (Ferraro, 1990). A 14 year old Trakehner stallion was presented to the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Zurich with a history of an abnormal inspiratory noise increasing with exercise. The general physical examination showed no abnormalities. By endoscopy during exercise on a high-speed treadmill the diagnosis of intermittent epiglottic entrapment could be made. Therapy consisted of two transendoscopic surgeries two days apart. In the first session subepiglotteal tissue was resected via a transoral approach, in a second session the aryepiglottic folds were partly removed. Both manipulations were performed electrosurgically with a wire snare in the standing, sedated horse and local anaesthesia of the mucosal membranes. No medication was given after surgery. The horse was fed fresh gras and was walked daily for 15 minutes for one week. Six days after the second surgery no abnormalities on general physical examination and during an endoscopy at rest were present. By exercise endoscopy on the treadmill the Epiglottic entrapment could not be induced any more neither at the same or at higher exercise intensities than before surgery. The main advantages of the surgical technique used in this case are the easy to perform procedure, minimal trauma by the transoral approach and a short <b>reconvalescence</b> period...|$|E

Materials and methods: We {{have studied the}} content of cortisol, thyrotropic hormone (TTH), triiodothyro-nine (T 3), free thyroxin (FT 4), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, prolactin in blood serum of 62 women with moderate (33) and severe (29) HFRS forms age (17 - 62). They were divided into 2 groups: the first group (33 patients) women with the normal menstrual cycle, the second group (29 women) consisted of patients in climacteric period. Results: TTH secretion increase, T 3 and FT 4 — decrease with their normalization to the recovery period were registered in the thyroid system of the compared groups. Blood cortisol level was high during the illness. Gonadotropic hypophysis function study demonstrated that LH and blood prolactin concentrations were increased since oliguria period; FSH was authentic reduced.

Clinical diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia was defined as acute infection with increased temperature and roentgenological finding of pulmonary infiltrate. Etiological diagnosis of disease was confirmed with serological testing. A control group included 20 healthy male examinees of similar age as the patients. The average age of our patients was 19 years. The patients were most commonly hospitalized on the fifth day of illness. Clinical presentation of disease was mild up to moderately severe, in accordance with laboratory results on admission. Chest X-ray recorded interstitial inflammatory infiltrates in one (28 or 70 %), or multiple lobes (12 or 30 %), and pleural effusion was recorded in 6 or 15 % of patients. Favorable clinical response to administered antibiotic therapy was recorded in all patients. More severe disease complications were not recorded during hospitalization. MMP- 2 gene expression was not recorded in any sample obtained from patients, nor from the control group of examinees. In 31 patients with acute stage of disease, 30 reconvalescents, i. e. 19 control examinees we recorded gene expression of IL- 8, MCP- 1, MIP- 1 β and MMP- 9. MCP- 1 gene expression was decreased in the majority of patients and did not significantly differ between the patients and the control group. IL- 8 gene expression statistically significantly increased in patients in the acute phase of disease and during <b>reconvalescence</b> compared to the control group (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 013; p= 0, 001). Similarly, gene expression of MIP- 1 β was statistically significantly increased in patients in the acute phase of disease and in <b>reconvalescence</b> compared to control group (Mann-Whitney test; p< 0, 001; p= 0, 001). MMP- 9 gene expression was statistically significantly increased in the acute phase of illness compared to control group and reconvalescents (Mann-Whitney; p= 0, 001; p= 0, 016). Spearman`s correlation test in our patients showed correlation between gene expression of MIP- 1 β and neutrophils count in peripheral circulation. The concentration of IL- 8, MCP- 1, MIP- 1 β, MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 was measured in the serum of 30 patients in the acute phase of disease, 36 reconvalescents and 12 control examinees. By analyzing the level of examined chemokines and metalloproteinases, we recorded a statistically higher level of IL- 8 in patients in the acute phase of illness than among those in the control group (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 033). Similarly, the level of MMP- 9 was higher compared to control examinees, but without statistical significance (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 062). The levels of MCP- 1 and MMP- 2 in acute patients were statistically significantly lower than in the control group of patients (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 012; p= 0, 001) while the level of MIP- 1 β did not significantly differed between the patients and healthy examinees. Spearman`s correlation test showed statistical significance correlation between leukocytes count in peripheral circulation and IL- 8 levels in the patients`s sera. No statistically significant difference was found in IL- 8 and MMP- 9 concentration in patients with pleural effusion (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 613; p= 0, 726). Also, no statistically significant difference was detected in IL- 8 and MMP- 9 concentration between patients with two or more pulmonary lobes affected (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 228; p= 0, 403). These results could contribute to further research that should explain immunopathogenic mechanisms in pneumonia caused by mycoplasma pneumoniae...|$|E
40|$|Background: Treatment {{of large}} basaliomas may be problematic, because relapses after the use of various {{treatment}} modalities are frequent. Aim : To assess {{the efficacy of}} interferon therapy for primary solitary T 2 N 0 M 0 basalioma. Materials and methods : We retrospectively analyzed the results of treatment of 72 patients with primary solitary basalioma T 2 N 0 M 0. The patients from the main group (n = 35) were treated with injections of recombinant interferon alfa 2 b into the lesion at a dose of 2 to 3 Mio IU (total dose for the treatment course from 18 to 27 Mio IU). The reference group included 37 patients treated by cryodestruction.  The results were assessed at 8 weeks after the end of interferon therapy and at 3 months after cryotherapy. The cure was confirmed cytologically at 3 months after clinical <b>reconvalescence</b> (formation of the scarring atrophy area or re-epithelization). Results : The treatment was effective in  100 % (35 / 35) of the patients from the main group.  Twenty nine (82. 9 %) cases of basalioma required two courses of interferon therapy, 5 (14. 3 %) cases  3 courses, and one case (2. 8 %) 4 courses. In the reference group, 94. 6 % (35 / 37) of patients were cured. The difference between the proportions of the cured patients {{between the two groups}} was  5. 4 % (confidence interval (CI) - 5. 2 – 17. 7 %). Within the next 3 years of the follow-up there were no relapses in the main group, whereas the relapses were diagnosed in 9 (24. 3 %) of the patients from the reference group. The difference of the proportions between the two groups was 24. 3 % (CI  9. 6 – 40 %). Conclusion : Based on the short- and long-term results, the efficacy of intralesional interferon administration in basalioma T 2 N 0 M 0  was 100 %. For tumors of more than 2 cm², an increase of the single and the total cumulative dose of recombinant interferon alfa 2 b is necessary, as well as several courses of interferon treatment.  Interferon therapy is more effective than cryodestruction based on the 3 -year relapse-free survival. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{surgical}} reapir of {{inguinal hernia}} by the Shouldice technique is discussed to induce traction forces by doubling the fascia transversalis and by attaching the rectus sheath and the inguinal ligament {{with the result}} of a higher postoperative pain level, higher recurrence-rates and a longer <b>reconvalescence</b> in camparison to net-supported surgery of inguinal hernia. In the surgical literature there is only one study that quantified inatraoperatively the traction forces wich were employed during Shouldice repair of primary inguinal hernia. With the same equipement the tension force between the lateral edge of the rectus sheath and the base of the inguinal ligament was measured after simulation of the Shouldice repair in a porcine model. Standard stresses were imposed by (a) increasing the intraabdominal pressure actively by choughing and (b) passively by a small and a large pneumoperitoneum, (c) isolated maximal electrical stimulation of muscles of the abdominal wall and (d) straightening up into an uprigt position. Changes of intraabdominal pressure were recorded simultaneusly. The results in this animal model can be transmitted in human beings. During adaptation of the suture structures of 0. 67 ± 0. 08 centimeters a traction force of 3. 75 ± 0. 32 Newton was induced. In the human study 0. 9 centimeters and 3. 62 ± 0. 60 Newton have been measured. The highest (mean ± SEM) intra-abdominal pressure was found during coughing (33. 1 ± 5. 2 mmHg) with an increase in inguinal tension force of 4. 1 ± 0. 6 Newton. The upright position (20 ± 0. 07 mmHg) and the large pneumoperitoneum (25 ± 0. 6 mmHg) produced similar values (4. 7 ± 0. 8 Newton and 3. 7 ± 0. 4 Newton, respectively). The small pneumoperitoneum (10. 01 ± 0. 4 mmHg) and electrical stimulation of muscles of the abdominal wall (4. 4 ± 0. 1 mmHg) resulted in distinctley smaller changes (1. 1 ± 0. 3 and 0. 7 ± 0. 1 Newton, respectively). The load of the simulated Shoudice repair was similar whereas coughing (0. 18 ± 0. 05 Newton / mmHg), upright position (0. 24 ± 0. 05 Newton / mmHg) and muscular contraction (0. 25 ± 0. 05 Newton / mmHg). The load induced by passive increasement of the intra-abdominal pressure was statistically not significantly lower. The amount of tension on the inguinal area is largely dependent of the intra-abdominal pressure. Contrations of abdominal muscles functionally and anatomically do not mean additional strain on the Shouldice repair. The inguinal load of all measured conditions is negligibly low. Compared with the force to disrupt the normal the normal inguinal canal (68. 6 Newon) there is no risk of disruption of the inguinal hernia repair by immediate postoperative return to physical activity...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Assessment {{of health}} care {{services}} quality and accessibility for tick-borne encephalitis patients in Kaunas region Liucijus Ambraška Supervisor Janina Petkevičienė, Dr. Sc. Assoc. Prof., Department of Social Medicine. Faculty of Public Health, Kaunas University of Medicine. - Kaunas, 2005. -P. 68 Key words: tick-borne encephalitis, quality and accessibility {{of health care}} services Incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is increasing by data of Lithuanian health information center. Aim of the study – to assess accessibility and quality of health care services for TBE patients in Kaunas region. Objectives: to establish peculiarities of transmission TBE infection and opinion about TBE prophylaxis of reconvalescents; to evaluate duration of admission period of TBE patients to specialized hospital and peculiarities of monitoring after discharging and satisfaction with health care services; to determine standpoint of general practitioners (GP) on TBE prophylaxis and reconvalescents monitoring problems. Methods. Case histories of TBE patients treated in Kaunas Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases in years 2001 - 2002 (n= 187) analyzed. Questionnaires about state of health and assessment of quality of health care services during period of illness and <b>reconvalescence</b> were posted. 104 answers received. Questionnaires about standpoint on TBE control problems handed to 150 GP and returned by 101. Original questionnaires used. Differences between groups assessed using Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis tests, c 2 criterion, satisfaction dependences upon different factors analyzed by method of logistic regression. Results. Tick bites were noticed by 64. 7 percent of patient, 86. 1 percent of them visited forest. Patients have taken medical advice after 4. 2 (3. 6) days from symptoms onset, were admitted to hospital after 4. 5 (3. 6) days and to hospital of infectious diseases after 5. 1 (3. 8) days. Older patients and Kaunas and Kaunas district inhabitants were admitted to hospital after medical examination more quickly. TBE reconvalescents returned to work activities after 6 (5. 8) weeks, men more quickly than women. Disability established to 19. 2 percent of patients. After discharging 58. 7 percent of them observed in primary health care centers. Major part (91. 8 percent) observed by GP, 55. 7 percent by neurologist and only fifth part by infectologist. Almost half (46 percent) TBE reconvalescents don’t satisfied health care services in primary health care centers during period before admission and 12. 3 percent after discharging. Health care services in hospital and sanatorium assessed well by major part of patients. Respondents who described their state of health as poor assessed health care services worse more than those who described their state of health as good. GP suppose TBE as important problem of public health, but they are lacking knowledge of early diagnosing TBE and therapy principles. Ninety-two percent of GP think monitoring of reconvalescents with cooperation GP, neurologist and infectologist necessary. Conclusions and practical recommendations. It is necessary to decrease incidence of TBE by improving prophylaxis, explaining causes of TBE and increasing vaccination. In most cases patient were not satisfied primary health care services, so GP must have more knowledge in early differencial diagnostics of TBE and introduce universal system of monitoring and rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the recovery period and quality of life after application of laparoscopic techniques for neutering of the bitch compared to the traditional surgical approach. Comparative studies in humans have demonstrated that minimally invasive surgery often leeds to a shorter recovery time and less impairment of quality of life. It was the hypothesis that this is also true for dogs. First, an overview of the literature is given about the most frequent endoscopic procedures in humans and applications of endoscopy in different animals species. Then, indications, complications and side-effects in laparoscopic and traditional neutering are listed. The following chapter deals with problems and solutions concerning assessment of pain and well-being in animals. The surgical technique chosen for comparison was ovariectomy in healthy dogs. Ovariectomies were performed by experienced surgeons in two different private small animal hospitals. All dogs in this study belonged to normal clients asking for the routine procedure. Except for the surgical approach and the type of hemorrhage control the protocol for anaesthesia and preoperative analgesia as well as preparation of the surgical field and desinfection were standardized. In each group the data of twenty dogs were evaluated. The main interest focussed on the judgement of the dog owners of the postoperative <b>reconvalescence.</b> For that purpose a questionnaire was developed, which had to be answered by the owner before and several times after surgery. These questions referred to the normal behaviour of the dogs such as food intake, temper, play, social behaviour, activity and movement. For evaluation of the immediate postoperative period an extra questionnaire had to be answered. These questions were selected for evidence and degree of postoperative pain. Questions dealt with the occurence of vomiting, walking without assistance, food- and waterintake, defecation, stretching, ability to sleep, response to palpation and interest in the wound. The wounds were controlled three and ten days after surgery. Other criteria such as anaesthesia time, surgical time, complications and length of incisions were also evaluated. Mean anaesthesia time (75, 5 minutes, range 45 - 90 minutes) and mean surgical time (30 minutes, range 20 - 40 minutes) were longer in the laparoscopy group. In the laparotomy group mean anaesthesia time was 55, 75 minutes (range 30 - 90 minutes) and mean surgical time was 26 minutes (range 14 - 52 minutes). However in the laparoscopy group, less vomiting occured (p< 0, 001), more dogs took up food (p< 0, 031), slept more quietly (p< 0, 005) and had no problems during defaecation (p< 0, 037) compared to the laparotomy group. The dogs undergoing laparoscopic ovariectomy also showed less impairment of there normal behaviour in regard to food intake (p< 0, 01), playing (p< 0, 003), social behaviour (p< 0, 005), activity (p< 0, 038) and movement (p< 0, 022). These results suggest that laparoscopic ovariectomy performed by experienced surgeons decreases the interference with quality of life after surgery compared to the traditional technique. Further studies with a larger number of patients should be performed in order to confirm these results...|$|E
40|$|Background In {{view of the}} {{development}} of innovative and atraumatic surgical techniques, the postoperative pain management should be carried out depending on the invasiveness of the intervention. In the present study two analgesic strategies have been compared in patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy - the epidural analgesia (EDA) and the intravenous patient controlled analgesia (iv-PCA). Patient/ Material and Methods Sixty women with benign uterine diseases undergoing vaginal hysterectomy (VH) or laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) were included in this prospective case-controlled study. All operations were carried out by two experienced surgeons. Patients were divided for analysis into two groups (n = 30 each) according to the postoperative analgesic strategy (EDA-group versus iv-PCA-group). A matched-pair analysis was applied (matching criteria: risk assessment, surgeon, age of patient) to minimize the differences between both groups. Patients were evaluated with regard to extent of pain (determined by Numeric Rating Scale/NRS; 0 - 10 scale), analgesic consumption, rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), mobilization from bed, oral intake, complications, duration of stay in the recovery room as well as hospital stay and health-related quality of life (SF- 36 Health Survey; gathered before operation and 6 weeks after surgery). Results The uterus was removed laparoscopically-assisted in 22 women and by vaginal hysterectomy in 38 women. Demographic data of both groups as well as intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were comparable to a great extent. No significant differences between study groups were seen in the duration of surgery (iv-PCA: 58 ± 25 min vs. EDA: 60 ± 26 min). Compared to iv-PCA-group women of EDA-group showed lower NRS-values (p < 0, 01). In addition, less PONV (iv-PCA: 9 / 30 vs. EDA: 1 / 30; p < 0, 01), less shivering (iv-PCA: 8 / 30 vs. EDA: 2 / 30; p < 0, 05), reduced fatigue (iv-PCA: 26 / 30 vs. EDA: 9 / 30; p < 0, 05) and a lower analgesic consumption were found. Postoperative requirement for piritramide in the iv-PCA-group was 7 mg (0 – 24) on day of surgery and 5 mg (0 – 39) on first postoperative day. In the EDA-group none opiate medication was given postoperatively (p < 0, 001). Duration of stay in the recovery room was shorter in EDA-group (71 ± 32 vs. 50 ± 13 min; p < 0, 05). Hospital stay was 5 days on average in both groups. There were no surgical complications as well as epidural catheter-related complications. Because of urinary retention catheterization of the urinary bladder had to be made in 3 patients of the iv-PCA-group and 13 patients of the EDA-group (p < 0, 05). Furthermore, the possibility to take a shower postoperatively was restricted in the EDA-group because of the epidural catheter in place and thereby hygienic concerns (p < 0, 001). Regarding the early oral intake as well as the postoperative mobilization no significant differences between groups were found. In comparison with the pre-operative status, the results regarding health-related quality of life were significantly better for both groups after a follow-up of 6 weeks (p < 0, 01). However, this effect was especially pronounced in the EDA-group (p < 0, 05). Conclusions To reduce the number of patients suffering from pain postoperatively a procedure-specific pain management should be developed. We have shown in this study that even in minimally invasive surgery such as vaginal hysterectomy and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy there are some advantages of epidural analgesia compared to intravenous patient controlled analgesia. Particularly the reduced pain intensity, the lower need for analgesics and the reduced PONV-rate can cause an excellent patient comfort, a fast <b>reconvalescence</b> as well as positive effects on health-related quality of life. However, there are also some disadvantages such as an increased rate of urinary retention and restrictions of mobility...|$|E
