A microzone {{is defined as a}} group of Purkinje cells all having the same somatotopic <b>receptive</b> <b>field.</b> Microzones were found to contain on the order of 1000 Purkinje cells each, arranged in a long, narrow strip, oriented perpendicular to the cortical folds. Thus, as the adjoining diagram illustrates, Purkinje cell dendrites are flattened {{in the same direction as}} the microzones extend, while parallel fibers cross them at right angles.|$|E
25|$|A working body schema {{must be able}} to interactively {{track the}} {{movements}} and positions of body parts in space. Neurons in the premotor cortex may contribute to this function. A class of neuron in the premotor cortex is multisensory. Each of these multisensory neurons responds to tactile stimuli and also to visual stimuli. The neuron has a tactile <b>receptive</b> <b>field</b> (responsive region on the body surface) typically on the face, arms, or hands. The same neuron also responds to visual stimuli in the space near the tactile <b>receptive</b> <b>field.</b> For example, if a neuron's tactile <b>receptive</b> <b>field</b> covers the arm, the same neuron will respond to visual stimuli in the space near the arm. As shown by Graziano and colleagues, the visual <b>receptive</b> <b>field</b> will update with arm movement, translating through space as the arm moves. Similar body-part-centered neuronal receptive fields relate to the face. These neurons apparently monitor the location of body parts and the location of nearby objects with respect to body parts. Similar neuronal properties may also important for the ability to incorporate external objects into the body schema, such as in tool use.|$|E
25|$|Hyperexcitability hypothesizes that {{referred}} pain has no central mechanism. However, it does {{say that there}} is one central characteristic that predominates. Experiments involving noxious stimuli and recordings from the dorsal horn of animals revealed that {{referred pain}} sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a <b>receptive</b> <b>field</b> that was some distance away from the original <b>receptive</b> <b>field.</b> According to hyperexcitability, new receptive fields are created {{as a result of the}} opening of latent convergent afferent fibers in the dorsal horn.

40|$|In {{this section}} we review the basic {{operating}} {{principles of the}} CMAC neural network as proposed by Albus [2, 4 - 7]. We then present a mathematical description of the conventional CMAC in a form intended to facilitate software implementation. The notation used is somewhat different than in the original Albus papers, but the set of equations presented is numerically equivalent to the original Albus algorithm. General Operation of the Albus CMAC The operation of the Albus CMAC [2, 4 - 7, 11] can most easily be {{described in terms of}} a large set of overlapping, multi-dimensional <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> with finite boundaries. Any input vector falls within the range of some of the local <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> (the excited <b>receptive</b> <b>fields),</b> and falls outside of the range of most of the <b>receptive</b> <b>fields.</b> The response of the CMAC neural network to a given input is the average of the responses of the <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> excited by that input, and is not affected by the other <b>receptive</b> <b>fields.</b> Similarly, neural network training for a given input vector affects the adjustable parameters of the excited <b>receptive</b> <b>fields,</b> but does not affect the parameters of the remaining majority of <b>receptive</b> <b>fields.</b> The organization of the <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> of a typical Albus CMAC neural network with a twodimensiona...|$|R

25|$|After {{nerve damage}} or {{repeated}} stimulation, WDR (wide dynamic range) neurons experience a general increase in excitability. This hyper-excitability {{can be caused}} by an increased neuronal response to a noxious stimulus (hyperalgesia), a larger neuronal <b>receptive</b> <b>field,</b> or spread of the hyper-excitability to other segments. This condition is maintained by C fibers.|$|E
25|$|All {{the areas}} in the ventral stream are {{influenced}} by extraretinal factors {{in addition to the}} nature of the stimulus in their <b>receptive</b> <b>field.</b> These factors include attention, working memory, and stimulus salience. Thus the ventral stream does not merely provide a description of the elements in the visual world—it also plays a crucial role in judging the significance of these elements.|$|E
25|$|Each HTM region {{consists}} {{of a number of}} highly interconnected cortical columns. A region is similar to layer III of the neocortex. A cortical column is understood as a group of cells that have the same <b>receptive</b> <b>field.</b> Each column has a number of cells that are able to remember several previous states. A cell can be in one of three states: active, inactive and predictive state.|$|E
50|$|<b>Receptive</b> <b>fields</b> {{of cells}} in the visual cortex are larger and have more-complex {{stimulus}} requirements than retinal ganglion cells or lateral geniculate nucleus cells. Hubel and Wiesel (e.g., Hubel, 1963; Hubel-Wiesel 1959) classified <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> of {{cells in the}} visual cortex into simple cells, complex cells, and hypercomplex cells. Simple cell <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> are elongated, for example with an excitatory central oval, and an inhibitory surrounding region, or approximately rectangular, with one long side being excitatory and the other being inhibitory. Images for these <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> {{need to have a}} particular orientation in order to excite the cell. For complex-cell <b>receptive</b> <b>fields,</b> a correctly oriented bar of light might need to move in a particular direction in order to excite the cell. For hypercomplex <b>receptive</b> <b>fields,</b> the bar might also need to be of a particular length.|$|R

25|$|Nociceptors were {{discovered}} by Charles Scott Sherrington in 1906. In earlier centuries, scientists believed that animals were like mechanical devices that transformed {{the energy of}} sensory stimuli into motor responses. Sherrington used many different experiments to demonstrate that different types of stimulation to an afferent nerve fiber's <b>receptive</b> <b>field</b> led to different responses. Some intense stimuli trigger reflex withdrawal, certain autonomic responses, and pain. The specific receptors for these intense stimuli were called nociceptors.|$|E
25|$|In invertebrates, {{just as in}} Drosophila, {{the binding}} of Hedgehog to PTCH leads to {{internalisation}} and sequestration of the ligand. Consequently, in vivo the passage of hedgehog over a <b>receptive</b> <b>field</b> that expresses the receptor leads to attenuation of the signal, an effect called ligand-dependent antagonism (LDA). In contrast to Drosophila, vertebrates possess another level of hedgehog regulation through LDA mediated by Hh-interacting protein 1 (HHIP1). HHIP1 also sequesters hedgehog ligands, but unlike PTCH, it {{has no effect on}} the activity of SMO.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of the sensory neurons within the skin accounts for the large and overlapping receptive fields of the skin. The size of the receptive fields in turn explains why almost any given stimulus to the human skin can potentially activate {{a very large number}} of nerve terminals. Therefore, it is more likely that a stimulus caused by the prick of a needle be detected by more than a hundred nerve endings all sharing the same <b>receptive</b> <b>field,</b> than for that same needle prick to be detected by only one nerve ending.|$|E

40|$|Retinal {{ganglion}} {{cells in}} the turtle were extracellularly recorded to define the shapes of their <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> by small moving light spots. To better define the geometries, spectral-light adaptations and vitreal injections of 2 -amino- 4 phosphonobutyric acid (APB) were used to disrupt balances in field organization along dimensions of wavelength, ON and OFF responses, and center/surround areas. Three-dimensional data plots were fit by Gaussian, Gabor, and cardioid functions {{to show that the}} shapes of <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> are predicted by combinations of these multiplied functions. Results indicate that Gaussian functions describe simple symmetrical <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> that are center-only; Gabor functions describe center/surround color-opponent <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> that have a ring of spike activity in the periphery; and directionally selective <b>receptive</b> <b>fields,</b> in contrast, which are asymmetrical, are described by cardioid functions adjoined to Gaussian or Gabor functions.

Objects that are within a neutral temperature range do not change the rate of firing; the neutral range {{is determined by the}} average thermal radiation of all objects in the <b>receptive</b> <b>field</b> of the organ. The thermal radiation above a given threshold causes an increase in the temperature of the nerve fiber, resulting in stimulation of the nerve and subsequent firing, with increased temperature resulting in increased firing rate. The sensitivity of the nerve fibers is estimated to be >0.001°C.|$|E
25|$|Spatial pooling: The <b>receptive</b> <b>field</b> of each {{column is}} a fixed number of inputs that are {{randomly}} selected from a much larger number of node inputs.

Similar input patterns tend to activate a stable set of columns. The amount of memory used by each region can be increased to learn more complex spatial patterns or decreased to learn simpler patterns.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{procedure}} {{is presented to}} construct imagedomain filters (<b>receptive</b> <b>fields)</b> that directly recover local motion and shape parameters.

40|$|We {{show how}} the axiomatic {{structure}} of scale-space theory {{can be applied to}} the auditory domain and be used for deriving idealized models of auditory <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> via scale-space principles. For defining a time-frequency transformation of a purely temporal signal, it is shown that the scale-space framework allows for a new way of deriving the Gabor and Gammatone filters as well as a novel family of generalized Gammatone filters with additional degrees of freedom to obtain different trade-offs between the spectral selectivity and the temporal delay of time-causal window functions. Applied to the definition of a second layer of <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> from the spectrogram, it is shown that the scale-space framework leads to two canonical families of spectro-temporal <b>receptive</b> <b>fields,</b> using a combination of Gaussian filters over the logspectral domain with either Gaussian filters or a cascade of first-order integrators over the temporal domain. These spectro-temporal <b>receptive</b> <b>fields</b> can be either separable over the time-frequency domain or be adapted to local glissando transformations that represent variations in logarithmic frequencies over time.

2500|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} by Wallace (2004) that cats raised in a light {{deprived}} environment had severely underdeveloped visual receptive fields in deep layers of the SC. Although, <b>receptive</b> <b>field</b> size {{has been shown to}} decrease with maturity, the above finding suggests that integration in the SC is a function of experience. Nevertheless, the existence of visual multisensory neurons, despite a complete lack of visual experience, highlights the apparent relevance of nativist viewpoints. Multisensory development in the cortex has been studied to a lesser extent, however a similar study to that presented above was performed on cats whose optic nerves had been severed. These cats displayed a marked improvement in their ability to localize stimuli through audition; and consequently also showed increased neural connectivity between V1 and the auditory cortex. [...] Such plasticity in early childhood allows for greater adaptability, and thus more normal development in other areas for those with a sensory deficit.|$|E
50|$|Neurons in {{the visual}} cortex fire action {{potentials}} when visual stimuli appear within their <b>receptive</b> <b>field.</b> By definition, the <b>receptive</b> <b>field</b> is the region within the entire visual field that elicits an action potential. But, for any given neuron, it may respond best to a subset of stimuli within its <b>receptive</b> <b>field.</b> This property is called neuronal tuning. In the earlier visual areas, neurons have simpler tuning. For example, a neuron in V1 may fire to any vertical stimulus in its <b>receptive</b> <b>field.</b> In the higher visual areas, neurons have complex tuning. For example, in the inferior temporal cortex (IT), a neuron may fire only when a certain face appears in its <b>receptive</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{receptive}} fields {{can be extended}} further up the nervous system; if many sensory receptors all form synapses with a single cell further up, they collectively form the <b>receptive</b> <b>field</b> of that cell.
