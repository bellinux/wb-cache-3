40|$|Longwall {{top coal}} caving (LTCC) is a {{relatively}} new method of mining thick coal seams that is currently achieving high productivity and efficiency in application, particularly in China. The technique is similar to traditional longwall mining in that a cutting head slices coal from the lower section of the coal seam onto a conveyor belt installed in front of the hydraulic support near the cutting face. In modern LTCC an additional <b>rear</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt is located behind the support, to which the flow of the caved coal from {{the upper part of the}} seam can be controlled by a moveable flipper attached to the canopy of the support. The mining method relies on the fracturing of the top coal by the front abutment pressure to achieve satisfactory caving into the <b>rear</b> <b>conveyor.</b> This paper develops a yield and caveability criterion based on in situ conditions in the top coal in advance of the mining face (yield) and behind the supports (caveability). Yielding and caving effects are combined into one single number called caving number (CN), which is the multiplication result of caving factor (CF) and yield factor (YF). Analytical derivations are based on in situ stress conditions, Mohr-Coulomb and/or Hoek-Brown rock failure criteria and a non-associated elastoplastic strain softening material behaviour. The yield and caveability criteria are in agreement with results from both numerical studies and mine data. The caving number is normalised to mining conditions of a reference Chinese mine (LMX mine) and is used to assess LTCC performance at fourteen other Chinese working longwalls that have had varying success with the LTCC technology. The caving number is found to be in good agreement with observations from working LTCC mines. As a predictive model, results of this analytical/numerical study are useful to assess the potential success of caving in new LTCC operations and in different mining conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
30|$|A {{comprehensive}} monitoring integrated transmission {{system has been}} developed. It consists of central monitoring equipment (upper equipment) and site monitoring equipment (lower equipment), which achieves a state monitoring and control on the transmission device of the <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor,</b> and enhances the operation monitoring capacity of the large power <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of coal production of 1000 Mtpa at the No. 8105 face in Tashan coal mine, with the consideration of the effects of other uncertain factors, the calculation shows that the total transportation capacity of the front and <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyors</b> is 3500 t/h. Considering a cutting and caving ratio of 1 : 3, the individual transportation capacity of the front and <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyors</b> should be greater than 2625 t/h. Taking the uncertainty of caving quantity and some allowances in transportation capacity into consideration, the capacity of the <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor</b> was determined as 3000 t/h.|$|R
30|$|Key {{equipment}} for the LLTCC coal mining operation involves hydraulic support, shearer, front scraper <b>conveyor,</b> <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor,</b> headgate belt conveyor and support hauler, etc. Prior to this project, there was no {{equipment for}} LLTCC coal mining operations in China or elsewhere in the world. Therefore, the various key equipment for LLTCC mining operation have been developed in this project.|$|R
30|$|Through the {{research}} and development of the key technologies and components above, the overall reliability of the <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor</b> has been improved to warrant safe, efficient and stable operation.|$|R
30|$|The coal {{discharge}} {{device of}} the tail beam-sliding plate was easily jammed and hard to slide. Because the sliding plate was not slid back, the sliding plate occasionally cut the chain of the <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor</b> when the tail beam swung.|$|R
30|$|A large-capacity SGZ 1200 / 2  ×  1000 <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} with installed power of 2  ×  1000  kW, and transportation capacity of more than 3000 t/h. The transportation distance meets {{the requirements of the}} No. 8105 coalface in Tashan mine. In addition, some key accessories, including the heavy-load and high-strength chain transmission system of the scraper conveyor, controllable speed-adjustable soft start device, the integrated monitoring transmission system of transmission device, heavy-load 1000  kW planetary retarder, high-reliability and long-life coal pan, high strength and compact type end unloading headframe, and electrohydraulic control automatic telescopic conveyor tail, have been investigated to improve the performance of the LLTCC <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor.</b>|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{analysis}} discussed, SGZ 1200 / 2  ×  1000 large load <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor</b> {{was selected for}} the LLTCC face to extract the ultra-thick coal seam at Tashan coal mine. The installed power is 2  ×  1000  kW, and transportation capacity exceeds 3000 t/h. The transportation distance meets the length requirement at the No. 8105 face.|$|R
30|$|During {{the period}} of the ninth five-year {{national}} economic plan, with the cooperation of Zhangjiakou and Northwestern Coal Mining Equipment Manufactory, using CAD technology, the Taiyuan Branch of China Coal Research Institute developed the first scraper conveyors for LTCC face with retractable end chain adjusting device. They were the SGZ 960 / 750 front scraper conveyor and the SGZ 900 / 750 <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor,</b> and also stage loader and crusher. The equipment developed met the requirements from Yankuang Group for a coal production of 10, 000 – 13, 000 t/d. During {{the period of}} the tenth five-year national economic plan, Yankuang Group, the Taiyuan Branch of China Coal Research Institute and Northwestern Benniu Group jointly developed the SGZ 1000 / 1200 and the SGZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliability front scraper <b>conveyor</b> and <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor.</b> Currently, the SFZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliable <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor</b> is an ultra-heavy scraper conveyor for LTCC faces, which is characterized by its highest power level, widest chute and longest length. Furthermore, it integrated various advanced technologies, including automatic extension of the conveyor end, hydraulic motor chain tensioner, speed adjustment hydraulic coupler and compact chain. In the 1990 s, its main specifications reached an advanced level accepted worldwide. The SGZ 1000 / 1200 front scraper conveyor is currently the largest front scraper conveyor, and can be integrated with various powerful shearers and hydraulic supports. Its installed power is 2  ×  600  kW. The development of the SGZ 1000 / 1200 and the SGZ 1200 / 1400 scraper conveyors enables not only the technical advance in scraper conveyor technology, but also in LTCC technology.|$|R
30|$|In a LLTCC mining operation, the <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor</b> {{should have}} {{reasonable}} technical parameters and structure; also, the key components should have high reliability. These key elements include a heavy-duty high-strength chain drive system, speed-adjustable soft start device, integrated monitoring transmission system of transmission device, heavy-loaded 1000  kW planetary retarder, high reliability long life high-strength coal transportation trough, high strength compact end discharge frame and automatic retractable tail with electro-hydraulic control, etc.|$|R
30|$|At a LLTCC {{coal mining}} {{face in a}} coal seam with {{thickness}} greater than 10  m, the caving height is high after the top coals cave, {{and the size of}} coal block is relatively large. Therefore, the top coals might form an “arch” balance structure during top coal caving. To break the “arch” balance structure and enable the top coals to be easily discharged into the <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor</b> is a key technology. Therefore, the technical issues discussed above must be solved for LLTCC hydraulic support, which provides the top coal control technology for a LLTCC hydraulic support.|$|R
30|$|On the 9 th of November 2010, the No. 8105 coalface {{and roof}} {{drainage}} roadway were connected. After the connection, a 2 BEC 80 gas drainage pump {{was used to}} drain the gas, the gas concentrations were maintained between 1.5  % and 2.2  % in the high drainage roadway, between 0.2  % and 0.3  % at the upper corner of working face, between 0.2  % and 0.3  % at {{the tail of the}} <b>rear</b> scraper <b>conveyor,</b> and between 0.15  % and 0.25  % in the return air. Thus, the gas management at the coalface achieved very good results.|$|R
