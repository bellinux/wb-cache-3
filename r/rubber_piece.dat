Over {{the past two decades}} several approaches to modeling flexible and soft surfaces, such as cloth, <b>rubber,</b> <b>piece</b> of paper, and a metal plate, have been proposed in order to enhance the realism of the computer-synthesized scenes. The model for which the parameters have geometric semantics is the one proposed by Terzopoulos et al. [4]. Their model relates the Lagrangian motion equation to the metric and curvature tensors of the deforming surface. Once the metric tensors measure the variation of the area of the deforming surface and the curvature tensors give us the amount that a surface bends while it is deforming, we believe that this model may be of great importance for intuitive specification of desired deformations.

40|$|Issue: In the {{production}} of virgin rubber compounds and new products it is often necessary to adhere or bond the rubber to another <b>rubber</b> <b>piece,</b> fabric, or metal. This best practice describes the materials used in these applications. Best Practice: Bonding Agents – This type is commonly used to adhere rubber to metal, plastic, and other rubber compounds. These agents are specialty prepared solvent and water based adhesives that are commonly applied to the bonding substrate. A primer is usually applied. Little is disclosed about {{the composition of the}} bonding agents. Internal Adhesives, Bonding Agents, Binders – For metal and fiber reinforcement, such as steel belts and fabric in tires, hoses, and belts, a HRH (Hexa, Resourcinol, Hi-Sil) system is employed. This system involves adding Hexamethylene tetramine (HMT) or HMMM, resourcinol and precipitated silica into the rubber compound. This increases the stiffness of the unvulcanized rubber and the modulus of the cured rubber. The adhesion, or pull-out, force of steel or fabric from rubber is greatly enhanced with this method. Recently, polymers with maleic anhydride modification have been introduced. EPDM, Hypalon, and PBD are currently available with this treatment. The compounds containing these modified polymer...|$|E

The respiratory tract consists of nasal airways, oral airways, laryngeal airways and the first two generations of tracheobronchial airways. A rubber mold of the airway system was first cast from the impression of the human head airway teaching model. The rubber cast was sliced into 2 mm-apart parallel pieces. The cross-sectional geometry of the sliced <b>rubber</b> <b>pieces</b> were then scanned into the computer to be stored as the digital information. ^ A body-fitted three-dimensional curvilinear grid system and a multi-block method have been employed to mimic the complex head airway.

40|$|A {{suspension}} system {{was designed to}} make The Rickshaw Bank's bicycle-powered rickshaws more comfortable for the drivers. A four bar linkage with a rising rate spring {{was chosen as the}} design. An unconventional material-tire rubber-was used as the spring material because it is inexpensive, requires limited tooling, and is in vast supply near The Rickshaw Bank's factory in Assam, India. Different configurations of tire rubber were tested to see how the size, length, and placement of the spring affected the system's performance. Bode Plots of the system's response function were generated for each configuration. The functionality of the {{suspension system}} within the 10 - 20 Hz range was of premier importance because it is in this frequency range that the bicycle-powered rickshaws most often operate, based on their speed and the road conditions the rickshaw regularly encounters. Ultimately, it was demonstrated that the placement of the spring within the suspension system had the greatest effect on the system's response. The configuration that applied the greatest moment to the top link of the four bar linkage performed best. Surprisingly, any advantages arising from varying the geometry of the tire <b>rubber</b> <b>pieces</b> were lost to friction and the effect of the ply embedded in the tire rubber. In order to properly verify the optimal spring placement and tire rubber spring geometry, a suspension system that takes this paper's findings into account should be tested with a rickshaw in India. by Heather E.

2500|$|The {{saxophone}} mouthpiece {{is larger}} {{than that of the}} clarinet, has a wider inner chamber, and lacks the cork-covered tenon because the saxophone neck inserts into the mouthpiece whereas the clarinet mouthpiece is inserted into the barrel. Saxophone and clarinet embouchures differ from each other in firmness, position of the lower lip, and range of entry angles. [...] The [...] "long tones" [...] exercise is used to develop embouchure, along with airstream and breath control. Mouthpieces come {{in a wide variety of}} materials, including vulcanized rubber (sometimes called hard rubber or ebonite), plastic, and metals such as bronze or surgical steel. Less common materials that have been used include wood, glass, crystal, porcelain, and even bone. According to Larry Teal, the mouthpiece material has little, if any, effect on the sound, and the physical dimensions give a mouthpiece its tone colour. There are examples of [...] "dark" [...] sounding metal pieces and [...] "bright" [...] sounding hard <b>rubber</b> <b>pieces</b> – Marcel Mule, for example, used a metal mouthpiece to perform classical music. [...] Some contend that instability at the mouthpiece/neck connection moves harmonic frequencies off series with the fundamental frequency and each other, resulting in a [...] "spread" [...] sound, and that the weight of a metal mouthpiece counteracts that instability, increasing tonal [...] "focus." [...] Mouthpiece design has a profound impact on tone. Early mouthpieces were designed to produce a warm and round sound for classical playing. Among classical mouthpieces, those with a concave ("excavated") chamber are more true to Adolphe Sax's original design; these provide a softer or less piercing tone favored by some saxophonists, including students of Sigurd Raschèr, for classical playing. Saxophonists who follow the French school of classical saxophone playing, influenced by Marcel Mule, generally use mouthpieces with smaller chambers than Rascher style mouthpieces. The use of the saxophone in dance orchestras and jazz ensembles put a premium on dynamic range, projection, and tonal richness, leading to rapid innovation in chamber shape and tip design, and metal construction. [...] At the opposite extreme from the classical mouthpieces are those with a small chamber and a low clearance above the reed between the tip and the chamber, called high baffle. These produce a bright sound with maximum projection, suitable for having a sound stand out among amplified instruments and typical of modern pop and smooth jazz. Most saxophonists who play different styles have a mouthpiece suited for each style.|$|R
