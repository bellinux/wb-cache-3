5|$|After {{emerging}} from a manhole in the showers of the guard living quarters, Riddick uses a guard uniform to blend in {{as he makes his}} way to the space port and his chance at escape. Realizing he requires a guard to get through the <b>retinal</b> <b>scanner</b> that locks the doors to the space port, Riddick decides to go after Abbott and take his eyes. He gains access to Abbott's apartment by telling him there is a delivery for him. A fire fight ensues and after that, as Abbott bleeds out on the floor, Riddick moves in for the kill but is stopped by Johns.|$|E
5|$|Hansen soon finds Bakharev, {{who tells}} him that to disable the radio jammer around the rig so he can contact Bennett, he will need Anischenko to get him past a <b>retinal</b> <b>scanner.</b> Bakharev is then dragged into an air duct and killed. Hansen learns that Kamsky and Bakharev were under orders to make the exocels as {{dangerous}} as possible, which they had succeeded in doing, but without any way to control the resulting creatures. Hansen finds and kills Anischenko, removing his eye and using it to deactivate the radio jammer. Once {{back in touch with}} Bennett, Hansen is told he must find Kamsky's laptop and transmit the exocel research. Meanwhile, Anna is rescued from the sea by a large creature and left in a lab, where she is infected by an exocel. Seeing this take place on a security monitor, Hansen races to the lab to give Anna the antidote.|$|E

Similar to these is the fucial features authentication method {{which is a very}} new and unpopular method of authentication. The method is very unique with its operation as it doesn't require contact between the individual and the authentication device. The palm and <b>retinal</b> <b>scanners</b> have motivated the invention of the authentication system <b>Retinal</b> <b>scanners</b> are contactless authentication methods which scans the venation in the retinal of the individual which is of course unique to human beings. The technology employed in this work uses picture fuomes from videos, detects fucial features, and or matches the fuce to the respective individual's face features in the database. Authentication systems are used to identifY or verifY an individual as well as to distinguish the individual so far identified. This work develops an authentication system that operates with similar accuracy and speed of the bnman identification...|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea for}} retinal {{identification}} was first conceived by Dr Carleton Simon and Dr Isadore Goldstein and {{was published in}} the New York State Journal of Medicine in 1935. The idea was ahead of its time, but once technology caught up, the concept for a retinal scanning device emerged in 1975. In 1976, Robert [...] "Buzz" [...] Hill formed a corporation named EyeDentify, Inc., and made a full-time effort to research and develop such a device. In 1978, specific means for a <b>retinal</b> <b>scanner</b> was patented, followed by a commercial model in 1981.|$|E
50|$|While {{other types}} of {{biometric}} scanners are more popular for security systems, Vascular scanners are growing in popularity. Fingerprint scanners are more frequently used, but Naito says they generally do not provide enough data points for critical verification decisions. Since fingerprint scanners require direct contact of the finger with the scanner, dry or abraded skin can interfere with {{the reliability of the}} system. Skin diseases, such as psoriasis can also limit the accuracy of the scanner, not to mention direct contact with the scanner can result in need for more frequent cleaning and higher risk of equipment damage. Vascular scanners do not require contact with the scanner, and since the information they read is {{on the inside of the}} body, skin conditions do not affect the accuracy of the reading. Vascular scanners also work with extreme speed, scanning in less than a second. As they scan, they capture the unique pattern veins take as they branch through the hand. Compared to the <b>Retinal</b> <b>Scanner,</b> which is more accurate than the vascular scanner, the <b>retinal</b> <b>scanner</b> has much lower popularity, because of its intrusive nature. People generally are uncomfortable exposing their eyes to an unknown light, not to mention retinal scanners are more difficult to install, since variances in height and face angle must be accounted for.|$|E

50|$|<b>Retinal</b> <b>scanners</b> are {{typically}} used for authentication and identification purposes. Retinal scanning has been utilized by several government agencies including the FBI, CIA, and NASA. However, in recent years, retinal scanning {{has become more}} commercially popular. Retinal scanning {{has been used in}} prisons, for ATM identity verification and the prevention of welfare fraud. Retinal scanning also has medical application. Communicable illnesses such as AIDS, syphilis, malaria, chicken pox and Lyme disease as well as hereditary diseases like leukemia, lymphoma, and sickle cell anemia affect the eyes. Pregnancy also affects the eyes. Likewise, indications of chronic health conditions such as congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, and cholesterol issues first appear in the eyes.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe use of retinal biometric identifiers as security devices in shipboard applications was investigated {{with the use}} of the DOT 7. 5 (new version) and DAISY 7. 5 (old version) scanners of the Eye-Dentify Co. of Beaverton, Oregon. Motion testing was the primary purpose of the thesis. It was the first occurance of dynamic testing on any type of retinal pattern recognition device. A transverse motion(only) simulator that could roll up to fourteen degrees and sustain a cycle per minute(cpm) rate of 6. 0 was constructed and utilized. The nature of the experiment was to test the two scanners to determine if there would be significant differences in the characteristics of the two, and their possible uses at sea. Important conclusions were: 1) The best results occured on the DOT 7. 5, although five Type II 'RECOGNITION' errors were noted; 2) As period of roll and angle of roll were increased in cpm's and degrees respectfully, results were poorer; 3) Identification threshold settings were allowed to be set too low at + 0. 60 by the CRT lock manager, and should be raised to approximately + 0. 70. That way, the probability of the occurance of Type II errors (false RECOGNITIONS/VERIFICATIONS) would be greatly decreased; 4) <b>Retinal</b> <b>scanners</b> are generally, very reliable.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the substructure of the dorsal {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} of the thalamus of the pigmented rat (Rattus norvegicus) based on the eye-of-origin of its retinal ganglion cell inputs. We made monocular intra-ocular injections of the B-subunit of cholera toxin (CTB), a sensitive anterograde tracer, in three adult male Long-Evans rats. In four additional subjects, we injected fluorophor-conjugated CTB in both eyes, using a different fluorophor in each eye. Brains of these subjects were fixed and sectioned, and the labeled retinal ganglion cell termini were imaged with wide-field sub-micron resolution slide <b>scanners.</b> <b>Retinal</b> termination zones were traced to reconstruct a three dimensional model of the ipsilateral and contralateral retinal termination zones in the dLGN {{on both sides of}} the brain.

50|$|C.A.B. agents {{promptly}} override all {{the computers}} in the sisters' apartment and kill Eddie. The sisters then begin {{to set up an}} attack, where Thursday goes to get a weapon from a safe while the rest of them hide behind the mirror. The C.A.B. agents open the door with a <b>retinal</b> <b>scanner</b> using a dismembered eye and discover the hiding spot ordering all of them to come out. When they discover there is one sister short, Thursday attacks one of the agents causing the others to attack the others. Eventually, each agent is killed either with a knife or their own guns. Amongst the firefight, Sunday gets shot and bleeds out. She tells her sisters that she loves them and then dies in their arms. The sisters discover that the eye belongs to Tuesday, and begin to suspect that Jerry may have learned of their secret and sold them out.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} an adaptive optics (AO) <b>retinal</b> <b>scanner</b> {{by using a}} light source with a center wavelength of 1 -microm. In a recent study on optical coherence tomography (OCT), it was proved that 1 -microm light provided higher image contrast of deep region of the eye than 840 -nm light. Further, high lateral resolution retinal images were obtained with AO. In this study, we performed measurements on two normal subjects in the AO-SLO mode and analyzed its performance toward developing the AO-OCT. With AO correction, {{we found that the}} residual RMS wavefront error of ocular aberration was less than 0. 1 microm. We also found that the AO <b>retinal</b> <b>scanner</b> in the AO-SLO mode enabled enhanced observation of photoreceptor mosaic.
