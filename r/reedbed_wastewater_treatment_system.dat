To achieve this objective, <b>treatment</b> of <b>wastewater</b> is carried out with different technologies, some centralized and other decentralized. With further development in the wastewater management sector, sustainability of the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> with minimum environmental degradation became a global concern because all human individuals either living today or in future, have equal rights. Therefore, based on the sustainable development approach of <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems,</b> various methods have been practiced to analyse and compare the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> looking from the environmental, economic, technical and social point of view.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to find if Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) willow trees is a viable <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> in Ireland. The research will also evaluate the economic value of the willow within the system as a biofuel. The problems with current <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> in rural areas are that these systems get no maintenance and cannot perform. Current <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> cannot treat <b>wastewater</b> to the standard required. The environment is paying a serious price for the mass consumption of fossil fuels and our climate is warming at a rate that may cause irreversible damage. To prevent any more damage, alternative methods for renewable energy need to be explored. The use of Short Rotation Coppice Willow may be the answer to the poor performing <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> and a safe replacement for fossil fuels. The study will review relevant literature {{on the subject of the}} use of willow trees as a <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> and as a biofuel. This includes research of scientific papers and reports in relation to the willow trees. Understanding the process of bio-remediation and the benefit of willow as a bio-fuel and how the two relate to each other is vital to this study. Analysis of the economics of willow plantation as a bio-fuel and as a bio-remediation of wastewater is conducted to understand the feasibility of the system in comparison to conventional systems. Investigation of a case study which uses short rotation coppice willow trees as a <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> in a rural area is undertaken.

Results were compared with the effluent parameters of wastewater standards of Iranian Department of the Environment. 70 governmental hospitals from different provinces of Iran were selected by purposive (non-random) sampling method.

40|$|Nitrification is an {{integral}} part of biological nitrogen removal processes and usually the limiting step in <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> Since nitrification is often considered not feasible at temperatures higher than 40  °C, warm industrial effluents (with operating temperatures higher than 40  °C) need to be cooled down prior to biological treatment, which increases the energy and operating costs of the plants for cooling purposes. This study describes the occurrence of thermophilic biological nitrogen removal activity (nitritation, nitratation, and denitrification) at a temperature as high as 50  °C in an activated sludge <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant treating <b>wastewater</b> from an oil refinery. Using a modified two-step nitrification-two-step denitrification mathematical model extended with the incorporation of double Arrhenius equations, the nitrification (nitrititation and nitratation) and denitrification activities were described including the cease in biomass activity at 55  °C. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that Nitrosomonas halotolerant and obligatehalophilic and Nitrosomonas oligotropha (known ammonia-oxidizing organisms) and Nitrospira sublineage II (nitrite-oxidizing organism (NOB)) were observed using the FISH probes applied in this study. In particular, this is the first time that Nitrospira sublineage II, a moderatedly thermophilic NOB, is observed in an engineered full-scale (industrial) <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> at temperatures as high as 50  °C. These observations suggest that thermophilic biological nitrogen removal can be attained in <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems,</b> which may further contribute to the optimization of the biological nitrogen removal processes in <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> that treat warm wastewater streams...|$|R
