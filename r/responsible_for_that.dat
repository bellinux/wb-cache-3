His father died in September and, a few days later, he received a telegram from Mathilde, announcing that she was pregnant. This situation of responsibility worried Bourguiba who decided, on his return to Paris, to inform one of his friends about the news. This friend proposed that he break up with Mathilde and leave the responsibility of educating the child to her, which Bourguiba refused, stating he was as <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> as she was, having the sense of family responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|If {{it seemed}} that the patient would recover but still needed nursing, the injurer was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> This was known as sick maintenance, {{rendering}} variously crólige, folog n-othrusa, folog, or othrus in different texts. Bretha Crólige goes into great detail about this process, describing how the injurer had to find a suitable location and move the victim. Then the injurer had to pay for food for the victim and a retinue—which could be considerable depending on the victim's rank. The injurer also had to provide someone to fulfill the victim's duties while he was incapacitated. He also had to pay a fine for the missed opportunity for procreation if appropriate.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary group}} {{responsible}} for storm spotting in the U.S. {{is known as}} Skywarn. Many individuals hold Skywarn certification and/or amateur radio licenses. Other spotters are part of organized and highly trained local spotter groups, reporting their observations to the local emergency management office or National Weather Service office <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> area. A Skywarn group is {{either directly or indirectly}} affiliated or associated with the local weather office, and in many cases other agencies responsible for the well-being of individuals. Today, amateur radio still plays a key role, as most spotters opt to attain their radio licenses; however, cell phones are an ever increasingly popular means to directly relay information, along with other on-line spotter reporting protocols such as The Spotter Network.|$|E

B and D work as filling grades, for when a student hasn't reached all objectives for C or A but has reached most of them. If the student can't be graded, e.g. extensive truancy, the student will receive a dash instead of an F. If a student {{is on the verge}} of receiving an F in a certain subject/course, the teacher <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> subject will notify the student and the student's parents.

Bethesda Softworks decided to make Fallout 3 similar to the previous two games, focusing upon non-linear gameplay, story, and black comedy. Bethesda also chose to pursue an ESRB rating of M (for mature) by including the adult themes, violence, and depravity characteristic of the Fallout series.

500|$|All ponies grazing on the New Forest {{are owned}} by New Forest commoners– people who have [...] "rights of common of pasture" [...] over the Forest lands. An annual marking fee is paid for each animal turned out to graze. The {{population}} of ponies on the Forest has fluctuated in response to varying demand for young stock. Numbers fell to fewer than six hundred in 1945, but have since risen steadily, and thousands now run loose in semi-feral conditions. The welfare of ponies grazing on the Forest is monitored by five Agisters, employees of the Verderers of the New Forest. Each Agister takes responsibility for a different area of the Forest. The ponies are gathered annually {{in a series of}} drifts, to be checked for health, wormed, and they are tail-marked; each pony's tail is trimmed to the pattern of the Agister <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> pony. Purebred New Forest stallions approved by the Breed Society and by the New Forest Verderers run out on the Forest with the mares for a short period each year. Many of the foals bred on the Forest are sold through the Beaulieu Road pony sales, which are held several times each year.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Arnold and James Holliman {{have criticized}} {{the use of these}} {{descriptors}} for emergency medical systems as an oversimplification and a needless source of controversy. Instead, Arnold and Holliman have proposed that other groupings be used, such as classifying emergency medical systems as following a specialty or multidisciplinary model. Specialty systems would include those with physicians dedicated to emergency medicine, whereas multidisciplinary systems would encompass those that rely on physicians from other disciplines to provide emergency care. Such an approach would seek to categorize pre-hospital care separately from in-hospital systems. Within Arnold and Holliman's understanding of emergency care models, there is also an acknowledgement that current Western models may be inadequate in the context of developing nations. For instance, a cost-benefit analysis [...] found that creating an EMS system in Kuala Lumpur that met U.S. standards for cardiac arrest response (85 percent of patients receive defibrillation within 6 minutes) would cost US$2.5 million and only save four neurologically intact lives per year. The primary variable <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> result is the relatively young demography of Kuala Lumpur, meaning that comparatively few cardiac-related deaths occur.|$|E
500|$|Sam Dotson, {{chief of}} the St. Louis Police Department, coined the term [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] to {{describe}} what he believed was a change in enforcement behavior following the shooting of Michael Brown and subsequent unrest. According to Dotson, his officers were less active in enforcing the law {{because they were afraid}} they might be charged with breaking the law. FBI Director James Comey suggested that the Black Lives Matter movement is partly leading to a national rise in crime rates because police officers have pulled back from doing their jobs. A study published by the Justice Department, said there was an increase in homicides in 56 large cities over the course of 2015, and examined the [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] as one of three plausible explanations. Other researchers have looked for this [...] "Ferguson effect" [...] in the rise in crime rates and failed to find evidence for it on a national level. A report over the increased homicide rate in St. Louis concluded there was an [...] "absence of credible and comprehensive evidence" [...] for the Ferguson effect being <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> city's homicide increase.|$|E

500|$|An ongoing {{dispute between}} the U.S. and Britain was over the {{practice}} of pelagic sealing, that is, the capture of seals offshore of Alaska. The U.S. considered them American resources; the Canadians (Britain was still <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> dominion's foreign policy) contended that the mammals were being taken on the high seas, free to all. Soon after Hay's arrival, McKinley sent former Secretary of State John W. Foster to London to negotiate the issue. Foster quickly issued an accusatory note to the British that was printed in the newspapers. Although Hay was successful in getting Lord Salisbury, then both Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, {{to agree to a}} conference to decide the matter, the British withdrew when the U.S. also invited Russia and Japan, rendering the conference ineffective. Another issue on which no agreement was reached was that of bimetallism: McKinley had promised silver-leaning Republicans to seek an international agreement varying the price ratio between silver and gold to allow for free coinage of silver, and Hay was instructed to seek British participation. [...] The British would only join if the Indian colonial government (on a silver standard until 1893) was willing; this did not occur, and coupled with an improving economic situation that decreased support for bimetallism in the United States, no agreement was reached.|$|E

2500|$|Giovanni's {{poetry in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s {{addressed}} black womanhood and black manhood amongst other themes. In a book she co-wrote with James Baldwin entitled A Dialogue, the two authors speak blatantly {{about the status of}} the black male in the household. Baldwin challenges Giovanni's opinion on the representation of black women as the “breadwinners” in the household. Baldwin states, “A man is not a woman. And whether he’s wrong or right.... Look, if we’re living in the same house and you’re my wife or my woman, I have to be <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> house.". Conversely, Giovanni recognizes the black man’s strength, whether or not he is [...] "responsible" [...] for the home or economically advantaged. The interview makes it clear that regardless of who is [...] "responsible" [...] for the home, the black woman and black man should be dependent on one another.
