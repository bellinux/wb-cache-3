25|$|The Architectural {{gear ratio}} is {{explained}} through the segmented muscle model 3 proposed by Emanuel Azizi, where a muscle segment is shown {{as a single}} muscle fiber attached to the myosepta of a Siren lacertina an aquatic salamander at a certain acute, pennation angle. The model allows segments to bulge out differently in the horizontal, and vertical direction and was {{used to calculate the}} Architectural gear ratio of each segment. Preliminary models <b>results</b> <b>show</b> that with muscle bulging, the Architectural gear ratio will increase. Different bulging conditions were studied, and shown in Fig. 2 The model <b>results</b> <b>show</b> the more a muscle bulges in dorsoventral height, the further the muscle fibers shorten, therefore providing a higher Architectural gear ratio.|$|E
