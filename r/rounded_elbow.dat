60|$|While thus engaged {{an inner}} door {{behind the counter}} opened softly and cautiously, {{projecting}} a brighter light into the deserted apartment from some sacred domestic interior with the warm and wholesome incense of cooking. It served to introduce also the equally agreeable presence of a young girl, who, after assuring herself {{of the absence of}} every one but the proprietor, idly slipped into the store, and placing her <b>rounded</b> <b>elbows,</b> from which her sleeves were uprolled, upon the counter, leaned lazily upon them, with both hands supporting her dimpled chin, and gazed indolently at him; so indolently that, with her pretty face once fixed in this comfortable attitude, she was constrained to follow his movements with her eyes alone, and often at an uncomfortable angle. It was evident that she offered the final but charming illustration of the enfeebling listlessness of Sidon.|$|R
