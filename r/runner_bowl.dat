50|$|For his two {{remaining}} races {{of the season}} Son of Love was sent to compete in North America. On October 27 he started the 31/1 outsider for the Turf Classic at Aqueduct Racetrack and finished fifth of the seven <b>runners</b> behind <b>Bowl</b> Game. Two weeks later he finished fourth in the Washington, D.C. International behind Bowl Game, Trillion and Le Marmot. It was reported that Son of Love would continue his racing career in the United States, but he returned to France {{at the end of}} the year.|$|R
50|$|Lockwood Park is {{the home}} of Huddersfield RUFC and is a multi sports complex with a {{capacity}} of 1,500 (with seating for 500). It is also the home of Huddersfield Dragons Hockey Club, Huddersfield Road <b>Runners</b> AC, HRUFC <b>Bowling</b> Club, Malcolm Pickup Academy Squash and the Borough Club which offers snooker facilities in the town.|$|R
50|$|On {{his only}} {{subsequent}} appearance, Bolkonski ran very poorly when {{fourth of the}} five <b>runners</b> behind Rose <b>Bowl</b> in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Plans to move him up in distance for the ten furlong Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October were abandoned after a poor performance in a training gallop and the colt was retired from racing {{at the end of}} the season.|$|R
50|$|The Raiders move to 9-8 {{against the}} Steelers in regular season matchups. The Raiders are also now 4-2 (Since 2001) against opponents {{that were in}} the Super Bowl the {{previous}} season. Both losses came last year when they lost to the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles (both on the road). In 2004, the Raiders defeated the Super <b>Bowl</b> <b>runner</b> up Carolina Panthers in Carolina, defeated the Patriots at home in 2002 and beat the New York Giants at Giants Stadium in 2001.|$|R
50|$|Cry of Truth {{began her}} three-year-old {{season as the}} 4/1 ante-post {{favourite}} for the Classic 1000 Guineas. She prepped for the race with a run in the Nell Gwyn Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket in April, in which, as a Group One winner, she was required to concede weight to her rivals. After disputing the lead for half a mile she weakened badly in the closing stages and finished ninth of the ten <b>runners</b> behind Rose <b>Bowl.</b> She did not race again and her retirement from racing was reported in August.|$|R
500|$|Every April, each NFL {{franchise}} adds {{new players}} to its roster through a collegiate draft at the [...] "NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting", more {{commonly known as}} the NFL Draft. Teams are ranked in reverse order based on the previous season's record, with the team with the worst record having the first selection. The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous season's Super Bowl; the Super Bowl champion is the last team to select and the Super <b>Bowl</b> <b>runner</b> up selects right before them. This order is subject to teams trading away selections to other teams for different selections, players, cash or a combination thereof. Thus, it is common for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have multiple or no draft picks the first round due to trades.|$|R
50|$|Ad Valorem did not race in {{the spring}} of 2005 missing an {{intended}} run in the Irish 2000 Guineas. O'Brien explained that he wanted to give the colt more time after his three races in quick succession as a two-year-old. He did not appear until June, when he contested the St James's Palace Stakes, run that year at York Racecourse. Ridden by Mick Kinane he finished second, three lengths behind the winner Shamardal and one and three quarter lengths ahead of his stable companion Oratorio. In July he was made the 6/4 favourite for the Prix Jean Prat at Chantilly Racecourse, but finished fifth of the eight <b>runners</b> behind Turtle <b>Bowl.</b> In the Group One Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse, Ad Valorem was tested against older horses {{for the first time and}} led for most of the way before finishing third behind Proclamation and Soviet Song.|$|R
2500|$|Body {{contact between}} runner and fielder is {{frequent}} in baseball, particularly at home plate. This is driven {{to a large}} extent by the manner in which a runner is put out. In both sports, rules prohibit interfering with runners. However, in baseball, the runner himself (or the base he is advancing to, if forced) must be tagged by a fielder holding the ball, to be put out. The catcher awaiting a throw will often stand between the plate and the runner. Once he catches it, the runner might try to go around the catcher, or he might simply bowl the catcher over, if he thinks he can dislodge the ball by such contact; and if the catcher does not have the ball, the <b>runner</b> may still <b>bowl</b> the catcher over, which is considered fair because by rule a fielder without a ball cannot impede a runner. By contrast, in cricket, the stumps are the target for [...] "tagging" [...] rather than the runner. No contact with the runners is either necessary or allowed. Contact between opposing sides is rare, and is usually not deliberate. Violent contact between players was once even greater in baseball, as before the Knickerbocker Rules it was permitted in some versions of the game to literally [...] "throw out" [...] a runner by hitting him (or [...] "soaking" [...] him) with a thrown ball (in lieu of hitting a base or stake that would equate to cricket's wickets). This rule still exists in some versions of the baseball variant called kickball, which is played with a soccer ball and thus is much less injurious. Except when played batting in a hands-down position, kickball also calls for literal [...] "bowling" [...] of the ball, underhand, as with the old rules of both cricket and baseball. [...] "All 'round hands down" [...] kickball leagues exist, but in most of these, the ball is pitched with the face or shoulders.|$|R
