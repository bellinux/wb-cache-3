The integration of various technologies and sensors {{is the best}} solution to obtain results with these characteristics. According to the <b>reproduction</b> <b>scale,</b> you {{need to change the}} characteristics of the instruments used during acquisition. Reduced or real scale solid models are an effective support for projects involving communication and divulgation: they can be understood without the intermediation of data processing systems, therefore increasing the potential users. Additive Manufacturing (AM) is an expression indicative of technologies used to fabricate physical objects directly from CAD data sources; they are also called three-dimensional printing, solid freeform fabrication or layered manufacturing. The paper analyzes only factors related to the processing that involves the superficial aspect of the solid model; some important aspects useful in other applications, e. g. mechanical behaviour of the used material or the method to realize the internal structure or possible supports of the model, are neglected...|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} of dissipating properly the heat generated by underground power cables, {{due to the}} Joule effect, during the exertion phases is very important because the thermal stress in the insulating materials enveloping the cables must be avoided. This {{is why it is}} so important to investigate how the thermal resistivity of the soil surrounding the conductor affects the heat dissipation. Design engineers can make an estimation of this value through the IEC 287, a standard providing a simplified formula for this type of calculation (though it underestimates the problem since it does not take into consideration how complex the underground cable laying is). Thanks to the <b>reproduction</b> <b>scale</b> in the laboratory of an experimental apparatus, a 2 D FEM model was validated for the investigation of those heat exchange problems affecting underground cables. This paper is the sequel of a previous article (about the influence of the geometrical parameter of the excavated area), written by the very same authors of this article, and it examines the influence of the thermal conductivity characterizing the different materials surrounding the cable and how it provides a dimensionless coefficient to correct the IEC formula...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this project}} we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} varying the size of dots in the digital halftoning processes. The <b>reproduction</b> of grey <b>scale</b> images in bi-level graphic displays is achieved through a process called halftoning. Given a grey scale image it consists in generating a binary image which causes the impression of continuous variation. This process an be analog or digital. Analog halftoning is done using photographic means to generate high contrast halftone screens. Digital halftoning is done using a technique called dithering to determine the binary state {{of the elements of}} the output image. We show that the dot size is the main factor determining the tradeoff between tonal and spatial resolution in the <b>reproduction</b> of gray <b>scale</b> images.
