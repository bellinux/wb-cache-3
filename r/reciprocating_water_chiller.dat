40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate whether <b>water</b> <b>chilling</b> had effect on water retention, freshness or internal temperature of chicken carcasses during chilling or storage in two different chicken processing plants (designated as A and B). A total of 240 carcasses from chicken processing plants (n = 120 per chicken processing plant) was randomly sampled and evaluated the effect of <b>water</b> <b>chilling</b> on carcass characteristics (i. e., water retention, water loss or freshness during chilling or storage). Torrymeter value was used as an indicator of freshness in chicken carcasses. <b>Water</b> <b>chilling</b> did not affect carcass water retention between the processing plants. However, chicken carcasses processing in B plant exhibited significantly higher freshness (p< 0. 05) compared with those in A plant. This difference in freshness was mainly due to the longer transit time through the <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> in A versus B plants. Water loss of carcasses during storage was not different between plants. It was found that carcass freshness can be affected by <b>water</b> <b>chilling</b> time as manifested in this study. Further study is warranted to see whether freshness or microbiological status of chicken carcasses may be affected depending on the chilling methods, i. e., air or <b>water</b> <b>chilling...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{study we}} present here {{analyzes}} {{the status of}} the <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> energy efficiency standard in China. The national standard, GB 19577 - 2004, which sets the grade and scale of <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> energy efficiency, has been implemented for five years and has produced achievements in energy-saving and emission reduction, which is a basic state policy in China. This paper presents extensive investigations on <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> energy efficiency conducted in 2009 and compares these results with results from 2003. This analysis shows that the average energy efficiency level in 2009 was higher than in 2003. Moreover, large units with more than a 5000 Â kW cooling capacity have now appeared, and low efficiency units with EERs (energy efficiency ratios) below 3. 8 have been phased out. The standard should be upgraded every five years. Therefore, this paper proposes a draft of a new energy efficiency standard. In the draft, thermodynamic perfectibility [eta] is presented to be used as an indicator instead of the EER; for [eta], 0. 4 is the minimum allowable value and 0. 6 is the maximum value. There is one category of cooling capacities, from 100 to 2000 Â kW, in which the energy efficiency has a linear relationship with its cooling capacity. <b>Water</b> <b>chiller</b> Energy efficiency standard Thermodynamic perfectibility...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{substantial}} savings can {{be achieved}} by converting constant flow-rate <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> systems to variable flow-rate systems. This conversion is best suited for large, central plant <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> systems where two or more chillers are utilized. Many large commercial and industrial energy users produce <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> for space conditioning and various processes. These <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> systems generally circulate the same amount of <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> regardless of the load. Rising energy costs are causing energy managers {{to take a closer look}} at supplying only the <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> required to satisfy a particular load. In this way, pumping electrical costs can be reduced, resulting in an overall increase in the efficiency of <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> plants. This paper will briefly describe the characteristics of both constant flow-rate and variable flow-rate <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> systems.

40|$|A three ton {{lithium bromide}} {{absorption}} <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> was tested {{for a number}} of conditions involving hot <b>water</b> input, <b>chilled</b> <b>water,</b> and the cooling water. The primary influences on chiller capacity were the hot water inlet temperature and the cooling water inlet temperature. One combination of these two parameters extended the output to as much as 125 % of design capacity, but no combination could lower the capacity to below 60 % of design. A cooling system was conceptually designed so that it could provide several modes of operation. Such flexibility is needed for any solar cooling system to be able to accommodate the varying solar energy collection and the varying building demand.

50|$|The {{condenser}} water absorbs {{heat from}} the refrigerant in the condenser barrel of the <b>water</b> <b>chiller,</b> and is then sent via return lines to a cooling tower, which is a heat exchange device used to transfer waste heat to the atmosphere. The {{extent to which the}} cooling tower decreases the temperature depends upon the outside temperature, the relative humidity and the atmospheric pressure. The <b>water</b> in the <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> circuit will be lowered to the Wet-bulb temperature or dry-bulb temperature before proceeding to the <b>water</b> <b>chiller,</b> where it is cooled to between 4° and 7°C and pumped to the air handler, where the cycle is repeated. The equipment required includes chillers, cooling towers, pumps and electrical control equipment. The initial capital outlay for these is substantial and maintenance costs can fluctuate.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} six empirically-based models for predicting <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> energy performance using over 1000 chiller data sets from chiller manufacturers and field measurements. The data sets comprise three broad classifications, including (1) constant condenser and constant <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> flow, (2) constant condenser and variable <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> flow, and (3) variable condenser and variable <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> flow. The regression parameters for each performance model are obtained using least squares method.

Results show that among the six empirically-based performance models for water chillers in this study, the bi-quadratic regression model (CVÂ =Â  2. 2 %) and the multivariate polynomial regression model (CVÂ =Â  2. 25 %) have the best prediction accuracy for all kinds of data sets.

40|$|Typically a {{blending}} {{station is}} designed to ensure that its user is able to avoid low <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> return temperature in the district cooling system. When the <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> return temperature drops to a low limit, building return water is blended into building supply water to reduce primary <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> flow and finally increase building <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> return. However, the blending station will cause extra pump power and may cause humidity and temperature issues. Theoretical analysis has been conducted on the blending station performance. The {{results show that the}} blending station is not necessary in the building <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> systems with 2 -way modulation valves at end users. Actually the end user valve configuration and control mainly impacts building <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> temperature.

40|$|Improving <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> delta-T, {{which is}} the {{temperature}} difference of <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> supply and return temperature, in campus buildings that are connected to a central distribution loop will not only improve the power consumption of the building through reduced tertiary (building) pumping power but {{the impact on the}} central distribution system and chiller efficiencies will be even greater. A degraded delta-T is almost inevitable and it can be expected to fall to about one-half to two-thirds of design at low loads (Taylor, 2002) due to various causes, such as air entering and leaving temperatures, <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> supply temperature, type and effectiveness of flow control valves, tertiary connection configuration types and operation, coil cooling loads, air economizers, etc. However, in most variable-flow <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> with 2 -way control valve systems, the root cause of low delta-T is at coil side (Zhang, 2012), for example the geometric configuration of coil. This paper firstly discusses <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> coil heat exchanger model results to help define methods for detecting opportunities for improved delta-T when analyzing campus building systems for performance optimization measures.
