The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt <b>reminder</b> on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt <b>reminder</b> in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt <b>reminder</b> as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating.

40|$|Objectives: Immunization {{coverage}} in Nigeria remains low despite the protection it confers. <b>Reminders</b> via mobile phones may be deployed {{as a means}} of improving vaccination coverage but requires the participation and cooperation of the caregiver. Therefore, we evaluated the acceptability of <b>reminders</b> for immunization appointment by mothers in Ilorin, Nigeria. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study recruited 526 mothers from two public hospitals in Ilorin. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect information on ownership and access to phones, willingness to receive <b>reminders,</b> household, antenatal, and delivery characteristics. Results: The majority (92. 7 %) of mothers had a personal phone, and all willingly provided contact details. Over half (69. 0 %) of mothers were willing to receive <b>reminders.</b> Postsecondary education (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 958; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 232 – 3. 111) and antenatal care attendance by mothers (OR = 8. 381; 95 % CI: 2. 495 – 28. 170) were significant determinants of mothers willingness to receive <b>reminders.</b> Mothers with {{less than or equal to}} four children had a three-fold increased odds of wanting <b>reminders.</b> Artisan mothers were less likely to want <b>reminders</b> compared with unemployed mothers (OR = 0. 506; 95 % CI: 0. 291 – 0. 847). Conclusions: Most mothers are willing to receive <b>reminders</b> on immunization appointments via their mobile phone. Determinants of maternal willingness to receive <b>reminders</b> include mothers with less than four children, postsecondary education, and antenatal care attendance. Program planners should consider utilizing <b>reminders</b> as a strategy to increase the immunization uptake with access to contact details making this feasible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Limited {{attention}} models {{generate the}} distinct prediction that <b>reminders</b> can affect behavior, {{but there is}} relatively little evidence on whether and how <b>reminders</b> are effective in economic domains. We provide evidence, from three different field experiments, that <b>reminders</b> increase savings balances and goal attainment. <b>Reminders</b> that mention both financial incentives and specific goals are especially effective. Other content variation and timing variation does not matter as much. These results do not map neatly into existing models of limited attention. We provide a simple model of limited attention where relative differences in attention toward current and future expenses can explain how <b>reminders</b> could increase savings rates. Our results suggest that <b>reminders</b> which increase the salience {{of the benefits of}} saving are particularly effective. The simple model of limited attention proposed here identifies a role for lack of attention as a barrier to saving for the future, in addition to the rational inattention and inattention to prices or attributes that have been modeled in prior work...|$|R

40|$|Patient {{adherence}} to follow-up {{plays a key}} role in the medical surveillance of chronic diseases and affects the implementation of clinical research by influencing cost and validity. We previously reported a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on short message service (SMS) <b>reminders,</b> which significantly improved follow-up adherence in pediatric cataract treatment. RCTs published in English that reported the impact of SMS or telephone <b>reminders</b> on increasing or decreasing the follow-up rate (FUR) were selected from Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library through February 2014. The impacts of SMS and telephone <b>reminders</b> on the FUR of patients were systematically evaluated by meta-analysis and bias was assessed. We identified 13 RCTs reporting on 3276 patients with and 3402 patients without SMS <b>reminders</b> and 8 RCTs reporting on 2666 patients with and 3439 patients without telephone <b>reminders.</b> For the SMS <b>reminders,</b> the majority of the studies (> 50 %) were at low risk of bias, considering adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, evaluation of incomplete outcome data, and lack of selective reporting. For the studies on the telephone <b>reminders,</b> only the evaluation of incomplete outcome data accounted for more than 50 % of studies being at low risk of bias. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the improvement of follow-up adherence in the SMS group compared with the control group was 1. 76 (95 % CI [1. 37, 2. 26]; P< 0. 01), and the pooled OR for the improvement of follow-up adherence in the telephone group compared with the control group was 2. 09 (95 % CI [1. 85, 2. 36]; P< 0. 01); both sets showed no evidence of publication bias.
