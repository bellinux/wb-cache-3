25|$|St Philip's Church is {{considered}} {{a good example of}} Oldrid Scott's architectural techniques. Architecturally it is broadly Gothic Revival in the Decorated style, and is distinguished by its impressive use of building materials of various colours and types. Knapped flintwork, limestone, Bath Stone and <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> are combined in complex patterns all over the exterior; the extension of 1909–1910 was consistent with this, and is indistinguishable from the older section.|$|E
25|$|The 25 seats {{from the}} biblical {{reference}} are alluded {{to in the}} building's structure, {{with the addition of}} eight small onion domes around the central tent, four around the western side church and four elsewhere. This arrangement survived through most of the 17th century. The walls of the church mixed bare <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> or painted imitation of bricks with white ornaments, in roughly equal proportion. The domes, covered with tin, were uniformly gilded, creating an overall bright but fairly traditional combination of white, red and golden colors. Moderate use of green and blue ceramic inserts provided a touch of rainbow as prescribed by the Bible.|$|E
25|$|Church {{construction}} and economy in general rebounded in {{the reign of}} Alexander III (1881–1894). In thirteen and a half years, {{the properties of the}} Russian Orthodox church increased by more than 5,000 places of worship; by 1894 there were 47,419 temples including 695 major cathedrals. Most of the new temples, however, belonged to the late 19th century variant of Russian Revival that became the official style of Alexander III. The turn in state preferences was signalled in 1881–1882 by two architectural contests for the design of the Church of the Savior on Blood in Saint Petersburg. Both contests were dominated by Neo-Byzantine designs, yet Alexander dismissed them all and eventually awarded the project to Alfred Parland, setting the stylistic preference of the next decade. Highly publicized features of Savior on the Blood – a central tented roof, excessive ornaments in <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> and a clear reference to Moscow and Yaroslavl relics of the 17th century – were instantly copied in smaller church buildings.|$|E
50|$|Prominently {{situated}} on Auckland Hill {{with the main}} entrance addressing Yarroon Street, the Gladstone Court House is a two-storeyed brick building with a hipped corrugated iron roof. Designed in a stripped classical style, the <b>red</b> face <b>brickwork</b> contrasts with rendered string courses at floor and window levels. A rendered masonry fence {{appears to have been}} designed with the building.|$|R
50|$|The 13th-century church was, {{save the}} mostly 14th century tower, rebuilt in 1898 by Sir Arthur Blomfield in the Norman gothic {{perpendicular}} style. The top {{third of the}} tower is of 16th century <b>red</b> crenalated parapet <b>brickwork</b> pictured.|$|R
25|$|In 1995–96, the Gaddafi Stadium was renovated by {{architect}} Nayyar Ali Dada for the 1996 Cricket World Cup. Dada's redesign {{was done}} in the Mughal style, with <b>red,</b> hand-laid <b>brickwork</b> and arches. Dada also had plastic seating installed in place of the existing concrete benches. The lower portion under the stands was enclosed and converted to shops for boutiques and offices. Gaddafi Stadium was the first in Pakistan to be equipped with modern floodlights having their own standby power generators.|$|R
500|$|The {{growth of}} the {{financial}} and business services sector from the mid-1980s onwards resulted in a boom in office developments in the city centre. Many of the buildings constructed at this time are in the style known as the [...] "Leeds Look", which is typified {{by the use of}} dark <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> and steeply pitched grey slate roofs.|$|E
500|$|On {{the main}} buildings, the walls consist of bands of red, yellow and purplish-blue brick with moulded layers and coping. [...] The ground floor has <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> with a rusticated appearance. [...] The {{cast-iron}} windows {{are set in}} round-arched openings below a string course which runs around the whole building and consists of alternate patterns of red and black brick. [...] The slate roof has flat-topped gables set above pediments {{at the top of}} each engine room. [...] The two engine rooms are two-storey and have a three-bay, three-window range; they flank the single-storey boiler room which also has three bays. [...] The left- and right-hand bays are recessed; all have windows that {{are similar to those of}} the engine rooms.|$|E
500|$|Tall flint {{and brick}} walls, dating from 1866, {{surround}} the complex on all sides. [...] Small flints laid in courses form {{the main building}} material on three sides. [...] Other parts have <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> with inset flints, and the main entrance has red-brick piers with knapped flintwork. [...] There are also iron railings and gates with the fleur-de-lis emblem. [...] The walls have recesses {{on the inside and}} outside at irregular intervals; one {{on the outside of the}} south wall contains a drinking fountain with a panel imploring users to [...] [...] Flints are prevalent in this downland area; so many were found when the pumping station was built that the contractors fashioned them into a deliberately ancient-looking folly on the southwest corner of the engine rooms.|$|E
50|$|Hobbs & Sons {{fish and}} chip shop and H Morrall's gentlemen's outfitters have been {{returned}} to 1935 condition. The shops come from Hall Street, Dudley and date from the late-18th century and refaced with bright <b>red</b> pressed <b>brickwork</b> in 1889. The tiled interior of Hobbs features restored hand-painted tiled wall panels. The frying range is of a design patented in 1932 made by E.W. Proctor of Huddersfield. In the 1930s many of Joseph Hobbs's customers worked in factories or shops.|$|R

25|$|Two-tone, striped masonry. Russian architects {{borrowed}} the Byzantine tradition of adorning flat wall surfaces with horizontal striped patterns. Usually, wide bands of dark <b>red</b> base <b>brickwork</b> were interleaved with narrow stripes of yellow of grey brick, slightly set {{back into the}} wall. Reverse (dark red stripes over grey background) was rare, usually associated with Georgian variety of churches built in NicholasII period. The importance of colour pattern increased with building size: it was nearly universal in large cathedrals but unnecessary in small parish churches.|$|R
500|$|Place Mill is a Grade II* listed Anglo-Saxon {{watermill}} {{located a}} short distance {{to the south of}} the Priory on Christchurch Quay. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book and features a mediaeval stone base underneath <b>red</b> <b>brickwork.</b> The mill belonged to the Priory but stopped working in 1908 and stood derelict until purchased by the council and restored in 1981. It is unique in that it takes water from one river (the Avon) and spills it into a second river (the Stour). A millstream is supplied from the Royalty Fisheries near to the Electricity Museum behind Bargates, and flows for nearly [...] to the mill between the Avon and the Priory grounds before joining the River Stour. A mediaeval Grade II listed bridge known as the Place Mill Bridge crosses the millstream nearby.|$|E
2500|$|A wellhouse east of {{the manor}} house, also a Grade II-listed building, dates from the 1730s. [...] It is now in poor condition, and has lost its {{original}} iron pump (operated by a horse) and capstan. [...] The rectangular structure is principally of flint with some <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> on the quoins and elsewhere. [...] The east, west and north faces have respectively one, two and three brick-dressed arches (now blocked); the south side cannot be seen. [...] A brick wall surrounds the structure.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the outer}} bailey, a {{building}} named the [...] "King's Chambers" [...] or Mosdale Hall, after a 14th-century governor responsible for upgrading it, {{is an example}} of how the castle has been altered over the years. Originally built in the 13thcentury and upgraded by Mosdale after 1397, the two-storey building adjoining the curtain wall was converted to red-brick barracks in the 18thcentury. After being badly damaged by German shelling in 1914, the building was demolished. The <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> is clearly visible next to the much earlier outer stone wall, as viewed from Scarborough's South Bay. The 13th-century Queen's Tower, in the wall nearby, also had different uses: initially luxurious accommodation with private latrines, a porch and large windows with bay views were added in 1320. Two of these windows were later blocked up and one was changed to a cupboard with a rubbish chute. The Master Gunner's House, built in 1748, served as accommodation until the early 20thcentury.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} built of ragstone rubble with some flint and has {{limestone}} dressings; {{there is also}} some Roman and Tudor brickwork. The south wall of the south aisle shows the original rubble with <b>red</b> Tudor <b>brickwork</b> on the top, three to four feet in depth and above the windows. In the south-east corner, the stone has given way and been replaced by Tudor brick, reinforced by a Tudor brick buttress. At some time, the east wall of the north aisle had cracked badly and been repaired very roughly by Tudor brickwork above the window.|$|R
50|$|Arts and Crafts {{architecture}} {{can be seen}} as {{an extension}} of the Tudorbethan Style in Wales. It is seen as starting c. 1887 under the influence of William Morris and was introduced into Wales by architects such as William Eden Nesfield who was responsible for the rebuilding of Kinmel Hall and the designer W.A.S Benson who was the architect for Clochfaen at Llangurig in Montgomeryshire. These architects very much favoured the use of half-timbered decoration, <b>red</b> <b>brickworks,</b> roof tiles and tile hanging on walls. A notable architect in this tradition was Frank Shayler who had set up offices in Oswestry and Shrewsbury and developed an extensive practice particularly in Montgomeryshire. Shayler, together with other architects in his practice were patronised by Lord Davies of Llandinam and were responsible for a series of Institute buildings as well as restoring a number of half timbered buildings such as the Mermaid in Welshpool and Glyndŵr's Parliament House in Machynlleth. In Radnorshire the architect Stephen W. Williams also worked in this style and built the Offices in Rhayader for the supervision of the Elan Valley Reservoir project. A good example of this style providing domestic housing is the Lodge at Chepstow, built between 1902 and 1908 by an unknown architect. Newman describes this as a witty, if rather belated essay in Norman Shaw style with stone, tile hanging and half-timbered gables.|$|R
50|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone was}} laid in 1822. The oldest {{part of the}} church consists of the nave and tower which were constructed in a neo-classical style. The rooves of the nave and tower are in slate and lead respectively. The walls are of dark <b>red</b> handmade <b>brickwork,</b> with large diamond-pattern coloured windows. The nave has a flat plaster ceiling, and originally had a suspended oak floor. The original building had an apsidal chancel which {{was nothing more than}} a semi-circular recess. At its opening, the church had 520 free seats and 88 other seats. The total cost of building was £2000.|$|R
2500|$|Brick {{buildings}} are common throughout the area. [...] Pale gault brick {{is characteristic of}} some mid-19th-century residential developments, such as the area around Grand Avenue in Hove and the Valley Gardens area of Brighton (both conservation areas). [...] Later in that century, smooth <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> became more common. [...] Yellowish stock bricks were popular in the 19th century for non-residential buildings and walls which were not readily visible. [...] Different coloured bricks, such as brown and grey-blue, were often used in quoins and dressings on walls made of flint or red bricks. The layout of brickwork [...] "has {{a significant effect on}} a building's appearance"; the Flemish bond pattern is encountered most frequently in the city. On Victorian and Edwardian houses, brick chimney-stacks often served a decorative as well as a functional purpose, and were sometimes tall and ornate: examples include the Queen Anne-style houses at 8–11 Grand Avenue, Hove (1900–03, by Amos Faulkner).|$|E
2500|$|Billingshurst Unitarian Chapel is {{a simple}} Georgian Vernacular building, [...] "like a demure Georgian cottage". [...] It is a single storey high and has a two-window range with a gable-headed porch between the {{casement}} windows. [...] The wide façade of three bays {{has been described as}} similar to the former Southover General Baptist Chapel (now in residential use) in Lewes, East Sussex. [...] The walls are of glazed grey and <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> laid in a Flemish bond pattern, and the roof is laid with tiles. [...] Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner noted that [...] "the architecture is utterly self-effacing". [...] It {{is a good example of}} the contrast between the prominently sited, [...] "wealthy established parish church with its centuries of tradition" [...] and [...] "the small impoverished Dissenting chapel", which occurs frequently in Sussex towns and villages. [...] The east side of Billingshurst High Street is dominated by St Mary's Church, with its landmark steeple and elevated position, while [...] "quietly hidden" [...] behind iron fencing and hedges on the west side is the Unitarian Chapel. [...] The site measures [...] and sits [...] back from the High Street.|$|E
2500|$|Gilbert Murray Simpson {{originally}} {{worked with}} his father in the firm Thomas Simpson & Son. Thomas Simpson's former board schools of the post-1870 period (most were designed between 1880 and 1903) can be found throughout the city. Architecturally, his schools are [...] "the best [...] works" [...] in Sussex. His style evolved from the Queen Anne Revival typical of early board schools towards [...] "an Edwardian Free style" [...] in which the standard <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> is supplemented by pebbledashing, terracotta and stonework. [...] His rooflines became more elaborate over time as well. The Finsbury Road School (1881; now flats) combines red and brown brickwork. [...] Connaught Road School in Hove (1884) and Elm Grove School in Brighton (1893) are in the Queen Anne Revival style; the former, now an adult education centre, combines yellow and red brick and terracotta-coloured render to create an [...] "elegant" [...] and [...] "distinctive" [...] façade. [...] Clayton & Black extended the building in 1903. York Place School has been dated to [...] 1895 and has two frontages; it is now integrated into City College Brighton & Hove's buildings, which are scheduled for redevelopment. In Preston parish, Simpson built the Preston Road School (1880, with [...] "flamboyant pedimented gables" [...] and a large roof), the Downs School (a simpler building of 1890) and the dome-topped Stanford Road School (1893), which also has a tower. Simpson's last board school, St Luke's at Queen's Park, was also the most elaborate. [...] Dated 1900–03, it has a separate swimming pool and caretaker's house, {{all in the same}} [...] "characterful Edwardian Free style". [...] The extravagant -shaped design features two wings with entrances set below timber-turreted towers, four gables to the rear, and an ornately decorated arched window in the third wing (the base of the [...] ). [...] Much use was made of stone.|$|E
50|$|This {{is one of}} Edward Maxwell's most {{successful}} designs. It was constructed in 1894, and designed in Richardsonian Romanesque. However, even a cursory examination of its facade reveals a multitude of architectural influences making it an admirable example of Victorian eclecticism. With its towers, stepped windows and high chimneys Lady Meredith House befits the dramatic landscape of the slopes of Mount Royal. It is faced in brick, sandstone, granite and terra cotta, all <b>red.</b> The <b>brickwork</b> is excellent and in evidence on all four sides of the house. Such elaborate craftsmanship would be well-nigh impossible to replicate in our days.|$|R
25|$|Bristol's {{architecture}} {{includes many}} examples of mediaeval, gothic, modern industrial and post-war architecture. Notable buildings include the gothic revival Wills Memorial Building, and the tallest building in the city, St Mary Redcliffe. The city is noted for its Victorian industrial architecture of the Bristol Byzantine style, characterised by deep <b>red</b> and polychrome <b>brickwork</b> and Byzantine style arches.|$|R

2500|$|Brighton College is {{the only}} {{surviving}} building in the city by George Gilbert Scott: his Brill's Baths have been demolished. [...] Many additions {{have been made to}} his 14th-century Gothic-style flint and Caen stone complex, on which work started in 1848. [...] The design has been criticised by Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel and Nikolaus Pevsner, who called the ensemble [...] "joyless" [...] and preferred T.G. Jackson's [...] "lavishly Gothic" [...] additions of 1886–87, in which terracotta was used extensively. BHASVIC is a [...] "splendid" [...] former grammar school on Old Shoreham Road in Prestonville. [...] Designed by S.B. Russell in 1911–12, in a Neo-Georgian/Queen Anne style with extensive <b>red</b> <b>brickwork</b> and wings joined to a central section by a series of staircases lit by round windows), it occupies a prominent corner site and retains its original iron gates with the emblems of Hove and Brighton Boroughs and East and West Sussex. The Municipal Technical College on Richmond Terrace, north of Grand Parade (now flats) was designed in 1895–96 by the Brighton Borough Surveyor Francis May. [...] Extensions of 1909 and 1935 were in a complementary style with brick and dark terracotta, and the whole complex has been described as [...] "Free Jacobean" [...] in style. Roedean School (1898–99), a girls' boarding school high on the cliffs towards Ovingdean, is a Free Jacobean composition by John William Simpson. [...] From the centre of the symmetrical range rise two identical towers. [...] Several wings then project forwards from this central block, each with a large gable end. [...] Simpson also designed the chapel in 1906, a sanatorium in 1908 and a library in 1911. [...] Hubert Worthington worked on a dining room extension in the 1960s. St Mary's Hall, a private school affiliated to Roedean but closed since 2011, has a symmetrical façade with prominent gables and mullioned windows. [...] The design resembles simplified Tudor Revival, although it is early for that style (George Basevi designed it in 1836).|$|E
2500|$|Stone {{was rarely}} {{used as a}} {{building}} material, as it was not prevalent locally. [...] Some churches and banks of the 19th and early 20th centuries were built of Bath or Portland stone, and Kentish ragstone was used for St Joseph's Church on Elm Grove, but few ordinary residential or commercial buildings have any stonework. [...] Artificial stone was sometimes used for exterior features such as cornices and columns, though, especially during the Victorian era. [...] Flint was historically a common building material as it was [...] "always readily available in Hove, Portslade, West Blatchington and Hangleton". [...] Agricultural buildings and cottages used random (unknapped) flintwork extensively, as did all four parishes' ancient churches and others further east such as Ovingdean and Rottingdean. [...] Flints were collected from the beach and the South Downs or dug out of the fields, where they were often found near the surface. [...] A flint pit survived at Southern Cross near Portslade until the 20th century. [...] It became popular again as a building material in the early 19th century, by which time several styles of flintwork had developed: rounded pebbles in seafront buildings, whole flints in rural cottages and agricultural buildings, knapped (split) flints, and random flintwork with brick dressings. The use of stone or brick quoins and dressings on flint walls, necessary for structural reasons, enhances the appearance of such buildings, [...] "sometimes to great decorative effect". Knapped flint was used particularly in farmhouses in nearby villages which later {{became part of the}} urban area: Court House and Down House in Rottingdean, Home Farmhouse in Withdean, Southdown House in Patcham and several houses in Ovingdean and Stanmer have them. The Sussex dialect includes specialist words for types of flint: the irregular joints between randomly laid knapped flints are [...] "snail-creeps", and rounded pebbles are [...] "pitchers". [...] An old [...] "Brighton Vernacular" [...] style has been identified: small cottages with cobblestone walls laid in courses, whose windows and doors were edged with <b>red</b> <b>brickwork.</b> [...] Many examples of this style were demolished during the mid 20th-century slum clearance programmes.|$|E
