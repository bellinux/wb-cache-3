25|$|A {{square matrix}} {{that is not}} {{invertible}} is called singular or degenerate. A square matrix is singular {{if and only if}} its determinant is 0. Singular matrices are rare in the sense that a square matrix <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> a continuous uniform distribution on its entries will almost never be singular.|$|E
25|$|Spatial pooling: The {{receptive}} field of each column is a fixed number of inputs that are <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> {{a much larger}} number of node inputs. Based on the input pattern, some columns will receive more active input values. Spatial pooling selects a relatively constant number {{of the most active}} columns and inactivates (inhibits) other columns {{in the vicinity of the}} active ones. Similar input patterns tend to activate a stable set of columns. The amount of memory used by each region can be increased to learn more complex spatial patterns or decreased to learn simpler patterns.|$|E
25|$|The Judiciary Law {{states that}} all litigants (who {{have the right}} to a jury trial) {{have the right to}} juries {{selected}} from a fair cross section of the community and that all eligible citizens shall have both the opportunity and the obligation to serve. Potential jurors are <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> lists of registered voters, holders of a driver's licenses or ID issued by the Division of Motor Vehicles, New York state income tax filers, recipients of unemployment insurance or family assistance, and from volunteers. The grand jury is organized pursuant to article 190 of the Criminal Procedure Law.|$|E

50|$|In statistics, the Mann-Whitney U test (also {{called the}} Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW), Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test) is a nonparametric {{test of the}} null {{hypothesis}} that it is equally likely that a <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> value <b>from</b> one sample will be less than or greater than a <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> value <b>from</b> a second sample.|$|R
50|$|Another useful {{measure that}} {{describes}} {{the extent to which}} two individuals are related (say individuals A and B) is their coancestry coefficient f(A,B), which gives the probability that one <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> allele <b>from</b> A and another <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> allele <b>from</b> B are identical by descent. This is also denoted as the kinship coefficient between A and B.|$|R
25|$|Polya's urn {{contains}} {{a number of}} different coloured marbles; at each iteration a marble is <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> the urn and replaced with several more of that same colour. For any given colour, the fraction of marbles in the urn with that colour is a martingale. For example, if currently 95% of the marbles are red then, though the next iteration is more likely to add red marbles than another color, this bias is exactly balanced out by the fact that adding more red marbles alters the fraction much less significantly than adding the same number of non-red marbles would.|$|E
25|$|An {{orthogonal}} {{array of}} strength 2 {{can be used}} to design a factorial experiment. The columns represent the various factors and the entries are the levels that the factors can be applied at (assuming that all factors can be applied at the same number of levels). An experimental run is a row of the orthogonal array, that is, apply the corresponding factors at the levels which appear in the row. When using one of these designs, the treatment units and trial order should be randomized as much as the design allows. For example, one recommendation is that an appropriately sized orthogonal array be <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> those available, then randomize the run order.|$|E
25|$|Lotto designs model any lottery that is {{run in the}} {{following}} way: Individuals purchase tickets consisting of k numbers chosen from a set of n numbers. At a certain point the sale of tickets is stopped {{and a set of}} p numbers is <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> the n numbers. These are the winning numbers. If any sold ticket contains t or more of the winning numbers, a prize is given to the ticket holder. Larger prizes go to tickets with more matches. The value of L(n,k,p,t) is of interest to both gamblers and researchers, as this is the smallest number of tickets that are needed to be purchased in order to guarantee a prize.|$|E

25|$|Cluster {{sampling}} {{is commonly}} implemented as multistage sampling. This {{is a complex}} form of cluster sampling in which two or more levels of units are embedded one in the other. The first stage consists of constructing the clusters {{that will be used}} to sample from. In the second stage, a sample of primary units is <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> each cluster (rather than using all units contained in all selected clusters). In following stages, in each of those selected clusters, additional samples of units are selected, and so on. All ultimate units (individuals, for instance) selected at the last step of this procedure are then surveyed. This technique, thus, is essentially the process of taking random subsamples of preceding random samples.|$|E

[...] Moreover, a randomized study of AA is difficult: AA members are not <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> the population of chronic alcoholics; they are instead self-selected or mandated by courts to attend AA meetings.

Among other advantages, IRT provides a basis for obtaining {{an estimate of the}} location of a test-taker on a given latent trait as well as the standard error of measurement of that location. For example, a university student's knowledge of history can be deduced from his or her score on a university test and then be compared reliably with a high school student's knowledge deduced from a less difficult test. Scores derived by classical test theory do not have this characteristic, and assessment of actual ability (rather than ability relative to other test-takers) must be assessed by comparing scores to those of a [...] "norm group" [...] <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> the population.

2500|$|Detective-III John Metcalf, LAPD, first {{investigated}} Minsky in 1982 for {{the same}} M.O. involving 4 victims. [...] Metcalf again ran across Minsky in 1998, after his release from a 2-year sentence in Massachusetts. According to Metcalf's testimony, Minsky preyed on women <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> a phone book. He was able to imitate voices of various people {{to aid in the}} deception. Minsky would start cold calls by whispering at a barely audible level until the victim called out a name, giving him the information needed to continue the ruse. He would then pose as an attorney to convince them that the aforementioned loved one was in legal trouble. In variations of the scam, he would say that the loved one was involved in a hit and run accident that carried a mandatory two-year sentence. He would tell the victim that a witness would have to be bribed with sex or money in order to drop charges so that their loved one would be released from jail. Minsky met with the women as the so-called witness at various locations such as hotels, and sexually assaulted some of them. In some of the cases, he urged the victim to dress provocatively for the meeting. In the 1982 cases Minsky was difficult to prosecute because there was no weapon or threat of bodily injury.|$|E
