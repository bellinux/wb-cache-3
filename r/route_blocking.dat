25|$|In 1920 a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the state legislature to build three tunnels under Monarch Pass, Cumbres Pass, and Rollins Pass (the Moffat Route). The various regions of the state could not come to agreement, partly because southern and southwestern regions feared that Denver would gain a new advantage in commerce from the Moffat <b>Route.</b> <b>Blocking</b> this legislation would ultimately backfire, when Denver was finally able to secure financing for its tunnel.|$|E

50|$|The {{winter of}} 1806 being {{particularly}} long harsh, Leduc found his <b>route</b> <b>blocked</b> by ice; {{he decided to}} wait off the Azores, where on 20 April the division captured the British Ruth; she was given a prize crew under Midshipman Besse and sailed to Ponta Delgada, but ran aground {{on the coast of}} São Miguel Island on 5 June and was lost.|$|R
40|$|The link or <b>route</b> <b>blocking</b> {{probabilities of}} a loss network are {{typically}} {{used to assess}} its performance. Unfortunately, closed form expressions for these, whilst being easy to write down, are quite intractable to evaluate computationally. Consequently, a number of approximations to the blocking probabilities have been proposed. One of the most intensively studied {{of these is the}} Erlang fixed-point approximation. We study the dynamical behaviour of performing sequential iteration on the Erlang fixed-point equations and prove that, for an arbitrary fixed-routing topology with constant bandwidth on all routes, sequential iteration converges to the Erlang fixed point...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Kupffer cells (KCs) play a {{key role}} in {{maintaining}} liver homeostasis, hepatotoxicity and in liver pathology, but their functional status cannot be directly assessed in vivo (1 - 5). We report a PET tracer for noninvasive translational imaging of KCs. Methods A mannosylated human serum albumin (18 mHSA), that binds to CD 206 receptor [on KCs and M 2 -macrophages(6 - 7) ], was synthesized, labelled by conjugation with N-succinimidyl 4 -[18 F]fluorobenzoate ([18 F]FB). Pharmacological properties of [18 F]FB 18 mHSA were investigated by ex vivo biodistribution and blocking studies at 30, 60 min (n= 5). A 60 min dynamic PET imaging studies with arterial blood sampling were performed in rats after injection of ~ 15 MBq of [18 F]FB 18 mHSA (n= 5). Results [18 F]FB 18 mHSA was stable rat plasma in vitro, but showed significant metabolism in vivo (16 % parent at 60 min). Radioactivity in blood decreased from the first time-point (10 sec) onward. Ex vivo biodistribution showed hepatic uptake was high (SUV 11. 4 ± 2. 4 (mean±SD) at 30 min; SUV 8. 9 ± 3. 3 at 60 min), as was accumulation in the kidney (SUV 24 ± 7), due to metabolism in liver and rapid clearance of radioactivity from the blood pool via renal-urinary <b>route.</b> <b>Blocking</b> with a 20 fold excess of the unlabelled 18 -mHSA, significantly decreased the uptake in liver (SUV 0. 8 ± 1. 2 at 30 min, p< 0. 0005; SUV 4. 5 ± 0. 7 at 60 min; p< 0. 05) and organs with immune function like bone-marrow (84 %, p< 0. 0005) and spleen (90 %, p< 0. 0005). PET data was analysed by Logan and Patlak graphical analysis using the metabolite-corrected plasma curve. Data was well described by Logan model, but not by Patlak model, indicating reversible binding kinetics. Conclusions [18 F]FB 18 mHSA allows quantitative noninvasive PET imaging of the KCs and this novel method might be useful to investigate liver toxicity and fibrosis...|$|E

50|$|A cornerback (CB), also {{referred}} to as a corner, {{is a member of the}} defensive backfield or secondary in American and Canadian football. Cornerbacks cover receivers, to defend against pass offenses and make tackles. Other members of the defensive backfield include the safeties and occasionally linebackers. The cornerback position requires speed and agility. A cornerback's skillset typically requires proficiency in anticipating the quarterback, back-pedalling, executing single and zone coverage, disrupting pass <b>routes,</b> <b>block</b> shedding, and tackling. Cornerbacks are among the fastest players on the field.|$|R

25|$|Interlockings {{are places}} where tracks are {{connected}} by switches and where routes may conflict. They are arranged in a specific way, with switches and signals that prevent conflicting movements once one route is set up. Interlocking signals are fixed signals within an interlocking, containing two separate red-yellow-green signal heads and often other indications. A home signal is defined as an interlocking signal {{at the entrance to}} a <b>route</b> or <b>block</b> to control trains entering that <b>route</b> or <b>block.</b> These terms are used interchangeably, as most interlockings only have one controlled signal on each track.|$|R
