[...] Mariner took Wadena in tow, getting her through one congested area and then dropping the tow when clear. When Wadena again ran into difficulty, Mariner took the yacht in tow, until forced to stop (Yacona then took Wadena in tow for a time) when the ice in Long Island Sound smashed in some of her timbers, compelling Lt.(jg) Miller to order the tug beached at New London to facilitate repairs. Once again seaworthy, Mariner steamed up Narragansett Bay to the coaling station at Melville, Rhode Island, where she helped Yacona get underway for Newport during the afternoon watch on 23 February, then proceeded to assist the section patrol boat [...] that had suffered a fire at Melville later that same day. Mariner then shifted to Newport.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Charles Fairbairn had not {{expected}} this, and it embarrassed him. He had waited {{as a matter of}} <b>routine</b> <b>duty</b> until the wages were paid, but he was a taciturn, slow-witted man, and he had not foreseen this sudden call upon his oratorical powers. He stroked his thin cheek nervously with his long white fingers, and looked down with weak watery eyes at the mosaic of upturned serious faces.|$|E

60|$|The {{notice of}} this {{question}} {{was the first time}} Endymion opened his mouth in the House of Commons. It was an humble and not a very hazardous office, but when he got on his legs his head swam, his heart beat so violently, that it was like a convulsion preceding death, and though he was only on his legs for a few seconds, all the sorrows of his life seemed to pass before him. When he sate down, he was quite surprised that the business of the House proceeded as usual, and it was only after some time that he became convinced that no one but himself was conscious of his sufferings, or that he had performed a <b>routine</b> <b>duty</b> otherwise than in a routine manner.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} month, Tringa was {{reassigned to}} New London, and spent August and September {{engaged in the}} familiar role of standby rescue and target recovery ship for New London-based submarines. Following an overhaul which lasted from November 1973 until mid-February 1974, the ship returned to duty at New London. The next three years brought Tringa more <b>routine</b> <b>duty</b> supporting Atlantic Fleet submarines, testing diving equipment, training divers, and escorting newly built submarines on their trial cruises. The ship departed the western Atlantic only once during that period, in July 1975, {{to participate in a}} series of oceanographic surveys conducted from the submarine base at Holy Loch, Scotland. She returned to New London early the following November and operated along the eastern seaboard until 30 September 1977 when she was decommissioned at the Submarine Base, New London, Connecticut. Her name was struck from the Navy List concurrently with decommissioning.|$|E
50|$|As {{recently}} as 2004, Westville faced two legal battles, both pertaining to violations of freedoms. The first dealt with an officer {{assigned to the}} vehicle trap, Nancy Spiegla, who began to notice suspicious activity by two officers outside {{the gates of the}} prison. Spiegla witnessed two officers transferring large bags from cars. When the officers attempted to enter the facility, Speigla demanded that she be allowed to search their car, which was a <b>routine</b> <b>duty</b> of hers. However, the officers argued that law enforcement vehicles were exempt from this rule and rejected the car search. Later, Speigla decided to inform the assistant superintendent about the incident but was surprised when nothing was done about the matter and she was demoted to a lower-ranking position with a pay cut. Speigla pursued her complaint in court, which ultimately ruled in her favor. However, she was never given back her original position. This story brought attention to a major problem at Westville: drug trafficking by staff.|$|E

5000|$|Leading {{the armored}} pack when Montgomery chased Rommel, the Desert Fox, out of Africa was hard-riding Herbert Lumsden, {{commander}} of the X Corps. A Lieutenant-General {{at the age of}} 45, he was accounted one of Britain's most brilliant young commanders.But lean, gimlet-eyed Lumsden, who had risen from the ranks, became involved in a ruinous personal disagreement with his superior officers. Winston Churchill assigned Lumsden as his liaison officer with General MacArthur in the Southwest Pacific. There Lumsden faithfully did his <b>routine</b> <b>duty</b> with a heavy heart and longed for another combat command.On {{the first day of the}} Luzon bombardment General Lumsden was killed on the bridge of a U.S. warship in Lingayen Gulf. In London, the War Office announced his death [...] "with deep regret." [...] MacArthur did better by him: [...] "It is superfluous for me to speak of the complete courage which this officer so frequently displayed.... His general service and usefulness to the Allied cause was beyond praise." [...] The Chief of the Imperial General Staff described his death as [...] "a great loss".Standing only the width of the ship's bridge away from Lumsden, with whom he had been discussing the action, was Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, commander in chief of the British Pacific Fleet. He got nothing worse than [...] "a bit of a bang in the ears." [...] Sir Bruce will soon lead his own powerful fleet into battle under U.S. overall command.|$|E
50|$|In Bangladesh, {{there was}} a Caretaker Government (CTG) {{for the period of}} 1990-91 with {{understanding}} of political parties. Later, there were also CTG formed within constitutional framework in 1996, 2001 and 2006 followed by 13th amendment to the constitution passed in the parliament. Besides, an extra-constitutional military-backed CTG was installed in 2007 which governed Bangladesh without legitimacy that ultimately handed over to elected political party following 29 December 2008 parliamentary election when they were failed to continue as pressured by international world. According to the provision (before abolishment)of CTG in the Bangladesh Constitution, there were 6 options to appoint Chief Advisor (CA). Last option of CA is the President. CTG had to hold election within 90 days and in 120 days power could be handed over to elected political party. Day to day affair or <b>routine</b> <b>duty</b> and holding parliamentary election are mandated responsibility of CTG. The military backed CTG was formed without constitutional provision, CA was appointed violating provision of constitution, performed all responsibilities of regular elected government and lasted for 2 years. Army chief used to attend the advisory council meetings and pressured cabinet to take decision as he wanted. Advisor to the President M Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury (Mukhles Chowdhury) was ousted as he was against army move and President Iajuddin Ahmed had to run presidency at the gun point. Lt. Gen. Moeen upgraded army chief's rank to General and to maintain balance also other two forces chiefs accordingly. Moeen also made his one-year extension without lawful authority in absence of regular elected government. Senior Advisor and Minister of State Mukhles Chowdhury tried utmost, solved political problem and thereby brought rival political parties to the planned parliamentary elections of 22 January 2007. However, by cancelling H M Ershad's nomination Moeen staged a military coup on 11 January 2007. Former state minister for home affairs Lutfuzzaman Babar was used for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the impact of circadian patterns in the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on the practice of primary angioplasty. BackgroundA circadian variation {{in the time of}} onset of AMI with a peak in the morning hours has been described. MethodsWe studied 1, 702 consecutive patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary angioplasty. We observed circadian variation in frequency of symptom onset, hospital admission, and first balloon inflation. Circadian patterns of symptom onset, hospital admission, and balloon inflation are similar. ResultsA majority of patients have symptom onset (53 %), hospital admission (53 %), and first balloon inflation (52 %) during <b>routine</b> <b>duty</b> hours (0800 to 1800 h). There were no differences in baseline clinical characteristics or treatment delays between <b>routine</b> <b>duty</b> hours and off-hours patients. Hospital admission between 0800 and 1800 was associated with an angioplasty failure rate of 3. 8 %, compared with 6. 9 % between 1800 and 0800, p < 0. 01. Thirty-day mortality was 1. 9 % in patients with hospital admission between 0800 and 1800, compared with 4. 2 % in patients with hospital admission between 1800 and 0800, p < 0. 01. ConclusionsCircadian variations may {{have a profound effect on}} the practice of primary angioplasty. A majority of patients are treated during <b>routine</b> <b>duty</b> hours. Patients treated during off-hours have a higher incidence of failed angioplasty and consequently a worse clinical outcome than patients treated during <b>routine</b> <b>duty</b> hours...|$|E
