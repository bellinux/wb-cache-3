40|$|The mercantile {{company was}} the basic form of {{enterprise}} in pre-industrial Catalonia. The {{aim of this}} paper is to study the formation and development of the mercantile companies in Barcelona whose end was the wholesale and <b>retail</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>textiles</b> in the “botigues de teles” (textile retail shops) throughout the eighteenth century. These firms were officially registered before a notary and their deeds reveal how these establishments were administered and managed. The study covers a sample of 121 mercantile companies, and the articles and documentation that were put into effect by 32 notaries who were active in Barcelona in the 18 th century have been consulted in their entirety. From an initial selection of documentation, a total of 228 deeds registering companies have been found, 107 of which (47 %) relate to the creation of companies whose various activities were centred in taverns, textile manufacturing, braiding [...] While the 121 companies, which make up our sample and which account for 53 % of the deeds registered with the notaries mentioned above, focused exclusively on the management of textile retail shops located in the commercial heart of the city. Thus one point of interest that the documentation reveals is that the majority of the mercantile companies registered by Barcelona notaries throughout the 18 th century were establishments which traded in textiles. The first part of the article focuses on the structural characteristics of these enterprises, the number and socio-professional status of the partners and the extent of each partner’s involvement in the administration and management. The second part of the article examines the capital investment made by each partner, their rights and obligations agreed on, the sharing out of profits and possible losses and the duration of the companies. The final aim of the paper is to highlight the evolution of these companies through one specific case. Mercantile company, trade, textile retail shops, Catalonia...|$|E

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY One Line Pitch: A {{boutique}} {{paint and}} textile retailer selling an edited palette of paints and a unique line <b>of</b> <b>textiles</b> to customers having {{a penchant for}} locally produced, environmentally friendly products for the well lived and well loved home. Business Summary: We offer professional architectural color consulting services, specifying our own tested and edited palette of premium paint colors. Our line of paints coordinates directly to a line <b>of</b> modern <b>textiles,</b> screen-­‐printed locally in Portland, Oregon. The paints are sold by the quart or gallon and the textiles are sold by the yard in our Pearl District retail location. Look out for our tote bags, pillows and other textiles for the table as well. Product/Services: Bolt and Brush will offer professional, architectural color consulting services and a premium line of environmentally friendly paints for <b>retail</b> <b>sale.</b> A line <b>of</b> <b>textiles,</b> designed and screen-­‐printed locally, will also be sold by the yard. Other ancillary products made from the same yardage sold in the store like tote bags, pillows and textiles for the dining table will also be made locally and sold both online and in retail stores. Target Market: Bolt and Brush’s targeted customer, both male and female, is design savvy with a strong appreciation for locally produced goods that are also environmentally friendly. Typically these consumers have at least some level of higher education. They {{are in the middle}} to upper middle class income range and despite the economic downturn; these customers are still financially capable of make purchases for premium goods and services. Management: Sarah Miller, Founder and sole employee, having color and textile design experience in multiple industries, a BFA in Textile Design and the near completion of an MBA. Sarah’s natural inclination is towards the arts and design, but steadfast persistence in the practicalities of opening a business makes her a likely candidate for entrepreneurial success in the design field. Sales/Marketing Strategy: Bolt 2 ̆ 6 Brush’s marketing strategy focuses initially on local support, i. e. newspaper and magazine write-­‐ups, radio spots, and word of mouth from satisfied customers of the color consultation process. The company will gain needed brand awareness nationally with a strong on-­‐line presence and personality that taps into the design-­‐centric community. Financial Strategy: We have established a three-­‐year ramp up period of developing brand recognition in the online design community using guerilla-­‐marketing tactics. At the end of the three-­‐year period, once the strength of the brand has been established, we will invest in the overhead of a retail storefront, which will allow for additional avenues for growth. Risk Assessment: The risk involved lies mostly on Sarah Miller and her spouse. 50, 000 in seed money is from their personal funds and Sarah would be compromising other career opportunities by focusing her creative energies on growing the business. The risk of failure, otherwise, at this stage is minimal and will affect few. The worst-­‐case scenario would be that customers would not respond to the patterns and colors brought to market. If this occurred, Sarah would shift the focus of her business and reevaluate the company’s direction...|$|R
