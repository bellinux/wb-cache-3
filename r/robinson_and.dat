5|$|In 1942, Robinson {{was drafted}} and {{assigned}} to a segregated Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas. Having the requisite qualifications, <b>Robinson</b> <b>and</b> several other black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race neutral, few black applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership. As a result, the applications of <b>Robinson</b> <b>and</b> his colleagues were delayed for several months. After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of Truman Gibson (then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War), the men were accepted into OCS. The experience led to a personal friendship between <b>Robinson</b> <b>and</b> Louis. Upon finishing OCS, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943. Shortly afterward, <b>Robinson</b> <b>and</b> Isum were formally engaged.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{knocked out}} Bob Young {{in the second}} round in Boston in his only fight in 1959. A year later, he defended his title against Paul Pender. Robinson entered the fight as a 5–1 favorite, but lost a split {{decision}} in front of 10,608 at Boston Garden. The day before the fight Pender commented that he planned to start slowly, before coming on late. He did just that and outlasted the aging Robinson, who, despite opening a cut over Pender's eye in the eighth round, was largely ineffective in the later rounds. An attempt to regain the crown for an unheard of sixth time proved beyond Robinson. Despite Robinson's efforts, Pender won by decision in that rematch. On December 3 of that year, <b>Robinson</b> <b>and</b> Fullmer fought a 15-round draw for the WBA middleweight title, which Fullmer retained. In 1961, <b>Robinson</b> <b>and</b> Fullmer fought for a fourth time, with Fullmer retaining the WBA middleweight title by a unanimous decision. The fight would be Robinson's last title bout.|$|E

The pitcher appeared in only 12 games that season, mostly in relief.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of this Congressional {{schedule}} Bradley <b>and</b> <b>Robinson</b> had not been seated when the Vermont House of Representatives convened in early October, 1791. At this legislative session, some members suggested that the January election of Bradley <b>and</b> <b>Robinson</b> had been premature, since Vermont had not yet been admitted to the union. Bradley <b>and</b> <b>Robinson</b> volunteered to resign the credentials of their January elections; on October 17, the Governor and Council voted again, and selected Bradley <b>and</b> <b>Robinson.</b> The House of Representatives then voted a second time, and also selected Bradley <b>and</b> <b>Robinson.</b> No vote totals were recorded.|$|R
