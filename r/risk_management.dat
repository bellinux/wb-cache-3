By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E

However they intervene only rarely, despite the opportunities that arise within their routine clinical practice. Beliefs and attitudes {{have been shown to be}} associated with <b>risk</b> factor <b>management</b> practices, but little is known about this for PHC clinicians working outside general practice. The aim of this study was to explore the beliefs and attitudes of PHC clinicians about incorporating lifestyle <b>risk</b> factor <b>management</b> into their routine care and to examine whether these varied according to their self reported level of <b>risk</b> factor <b>management.</b> Methods A cross sectional survey was undertaken with PHC clinicians (n = 59) in three community health teams. Clinicians' beliefs and attitudes were also explored through qualitative interviews with a purposeful sample of 22 clinicians from the teams. Mixed methods analysis was used to compare beliefs and attitudes for those with high and low levels of self reported <b>risk</b> factor <b>management.</b> Results Role congruence, perceived client acceptability, beliefs about capabilities, perceived effectiveness and clinicians' own lifestyle were key themes related to <b>risk</b> factor <b>management</b> practices. Those reporting high levels of risk factor screening and intervention had different beliefs and attitudes to those PHC clinicians who reported lower levels.
