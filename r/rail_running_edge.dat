The current machinery within and under the pre-cut house workshop, and most of the machinery in the sawmill section, was introduced by Alan. An original log carriage and its metal rails is still in situ in the rear sawmill shed, and original timber <b>rails</b> survive <b>running</b> north-south along the floor of the pre-cut house workshop, along with some metal gantry <b>rails</b> <b>running</b> east-west across the ceiling.|$|R

40|$|The <b>rail</b> <b>running</b> table imposes to {{the vehicle}} a forced vibration. It is not smooth but instead it {{comprises}} a lot of faults that give to the <b>rail</b> <b>running</b> table a random surface. Furthermore under the primary suspension there are the Unsprung Masses which act without any dumping directly on the track panel. On the contrary the Sprung (Suspended) Masses that are cited above the primary suspension of the vehicle, act {{through a combination of}} springs and dumpers on the track. A part of the track mass is also added to the Unsprung Masses, which participates in their motion. The defects with long wavelength, which play a key role, on the dynamic component of the acting loads on the railway track, are analyzed using the second order differential equation of motion. A parametric investigation is performed for the case of an isolated defect. © 2014 SERSC...|$|R

50|$|In {{the event}} of a broken or cracked <b>rail,</b> the <b>rail</b> <b>running</b> surface may be {{disrupted}} if a piece has fallen out, or become lodged in an incorrect location, or if a large gap between the remaining rail sections arises. 170 broken (not cracked) rails were reported on Network Rail in the UK in 2008, down from a peak of 988 in 1998/1999.|$|R

30|$|When {{publishing}} data, it {{is important}} to use the data model that will be of most value to users of the data - which may not be the data model by which the data is collected. For instance, real-time <b>rail</b> <b>running</b> data might be better served train-by-train rather than sensor-by-sensor. On-the-fly format conversion tools such as DataTank convert formats, but do not re-model the data more generally.|$|R
