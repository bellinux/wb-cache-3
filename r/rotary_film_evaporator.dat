50|$|Evaporation {{of liquid}} <b>film</b> in <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> is very {{important}} in order to cool the flowing liquid and the surface on which the liquid flows. It can also increase the concentration of the components in the liquid. The climbing/falling <b>film</b> plate <b>evaporator</b> is specifically designed to produce a thin film during both the climbing and falling phases. For the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporators,</b> the feed is introduced {{at the bottom of the}} tubes. Evaporation causes the vapor to expand thus causing a thin film of liquid to rise along the tubes. The vapor shear will push the thin film to climb up the wall of the tubes. The feed for the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> on the other hand is introduced at the top of the tubes. The liquid flows down the tubes and it will get evaporated as it descends. The flow of the liquid down the tubes is driven by the vapor shear stress and the gravitational forces. The effect of the vapor shear and the gravity will lead to a higher flow rates and shorter residence time. The flow of the thin liquid film in the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is possible in two ways: cocurrent and countercurrent. It is cocurrent if the vapor is drawn from the top to the bottom of the tubes and vice versa for the countercurrent flow. The cocurrent flow will increase the flow rates resulting in a shorter residence time. The type of flow can be described in figure 2.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the working}} {{principles}} of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> used in dairy industries {{in relation to}} the evaporation of skim milk have been explored with a focus on the effect of milk solids content. The changes in rheological behaviour of skim milk and heat transfer within the evaporator during the concentration process have been investigated. With the better understanding of the rheological behaviour of skim milk and the operation of a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator,</b> the possibility of improving the performance of commercial falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> from its current configuration can be assessed. The use of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is a common and economical practice in the food and beverage industries to remove water from liquid products, e. g. juices, milk, etc., especially when the product is temperature sensitive. In dairy industries, falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> are used to evaporate water from dairy products such as milk, protein concentrate, etc. Falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is a well established technology but the understanding of rheological influence of milk on the performance and operation of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> remains relatively unexplored which formed the motivation of this project. In milk powder production, milk is normally concentrated from around 10 wt% to 50 wt% or 52 wt% (this depends on the type of milk) using multi-effect falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> prior to the spray drying process. The viscosity changes of milk during the concentration process are evident, especially the exponential rise in viscosity as solids level reaches 50 wt%. With the increase in viscosity, the flowing characteristics of the milks within the tubes in the evaporator change with the concentration of milk. Consequently, the performance of the evaporator, in terms of heat transfer, is considerably affected. The current research project has been divided into 3 main parts into context of viscosity and evaporation of milk using falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> Firstly, viscosity models of milk are established based on stringent viscosity measurement procedures that ensure the repeatability and reliability of the measurements. These models are used for process simulation, model based control and production planning. The second part is to evaluate the performance of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> under the influences of various operation conditions. In the last part, findings from the first two sections are merged into a pilot evaporator mathematical model that is able to predict the solid content, flow characteristics and residence time of milk concentrate in a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> The viscosity of milk is influenced by several factors such as solids content, temperature, ageing and shearing, etc. The focus in this thesis is on the instantaneous milk viscosity during the operation of the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> Therefore, viscosity measurements and modelling of the milk viscosity have been mainly focused on only on the effect of solids content, temperature and, to some extend, shear rate. A 2 m steam-heated pilot evaporator was designed and constructed to commercial grade based on a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> design. This pilot evaporator is able to operate under vacuum conditions (up to - 85 kPa gauge) in both shell and tube side so as to mimic the operation conditions in the dairy industries. The viscosity models in this thesis are predominately formulated based on the fresh and reconstituted medium heat-treated skim milk, unless otherwise stated. A comparison of viscosity models were made between the reconstituted and fresh skim milk. Significant differences were found and reported between the two types of milks. The heat transfer coefficient (HTC), a common method of quantifying the performance of an evaporator, was measured based on temperature difference between the heat transfer surface and the processed fluid (e. g. milk) and the energy transfer within the evaporator. Another 1 m electric-heated pilot evaporator was designed and built to facilitate the measurement at such temperatures and to have known power inputs which was not accessible in the steam-heated device. The influence of different operating conditions, such as varying heat flux, flow characteristics (e. g. Re number) and protein content, on the heat transfer coefficient is thoroughly investigated in this thesis. The study into the HTC on the product side found that the HTC measured from the evaporation of reconstituted skim milk is unresponsive to some of the operating conditions it was subjected to as compared to the fresh skim milk. Generally, HTC improves with greater Re number, heat flux and protein content (milk protein concentrate was added). Visual examination of the evaporation conditions within the evaporator also indicates that the amount of bubble formed during the evaporation process appears to increase with increasing flow rate, heat flux and protein content. During the formulation of the pilot evaporator model in this thesis, the viscosity models and heat transfer coefficients established in the current project were incorporated so as to model the steam-heated batch pilot evaporator. Several assumptions were introduced {{in order to create a}} working model. The pilot evaporator model has been verified against the actual experimental data and is proven to be accurate. This model is able to predict the solids content of the skim milk at any given time provided that the operating conditions are available. This model can also be applied onto a commercial falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> with minor modification to the calculation sequence. A scale-up version has been developed but due to commercial nature, it is not reported in this thesis. The research into the operation of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> has been seen to enhance the knowledge of the mechanisms and interactions between the process fluid and the evaporator.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is the characterisation of a model to describe the dynamics of a climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> over a wide operating range. The model should be sufficiently simple so that the calculation of control action is straight-forward. The hypothesis of this thesis is that such a model may be constructed to describe the dynamics of a climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> well. The first chapter introduces the topics of climbing film evaporation, two-phase flow and modelling and identification. The second chapter describes the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> used in this study. For this purpose, the evaporator was fully instrumented with temperature sensors, conductivity cells and flow-meters. The instrumentation was commissioned and calibrated. In the next chapter a distributed parameter model of the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> {{is derived from the}} one-dimensional homogeneous two-phase flow equations, the parameters of which were to be determined by identification. The next two chapters summarise the field of identification. The fourth chapter presents and develops identification techniques for lumped parameter models, and the fifth chapter describes and constructs identification methods for distributed parameter models. The methods described in the lumped parameter identification section were recursive, so that they could be used in real-time to track time-varying parameters – a feature that is useful in the design of self tuning regulators. These identification methods used a UD factorisation algorithm and were found to be robust for inappropriate choices of system dead-time. Accurate estimates of dead-time were obtained from either method. The distributed parameter identification methods investigated were optimisation schemes to minimise an output least square error criterion. Methods for solving the distributed parameter identification problem using the method of characteristics were investigated and developed. Identification using the method of characteristics is appropriate as the partial differential equations describing the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> are hyperbolic in nature. Chapter six presents the identification strategy adopted to model the evaporator using the techniques described and developed in chapters four and five. The experiments for the collection of data {{to be used in the}} various models are designed. A range of models of the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> were identified. The simplest models for the evaporator were global black-box linear models. Gain-scheduled linear models were identified to attempt compensation for system non-linearity. Finally the parameters of distributed parameter models for the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> were investigated. These models are presented and discussed in chapters seven, eight and nine respectively.

However. it is generally considered that the perfonnance of these evaporators has not been maximised, and that improvements could be achieved by properoptimisation of the operating parameters. Unfortunately, very little comprehensive design infonnation has been published in the literature. owing to the complexity of the heat transfer and hydrodynamic interactions in the evaporator tube. Attempts at performance improvement have been hampered by the lack of any theory to explain fully the effects of the operating parameters and physical properties of the feed liquor on the performance of the evaporator. In this study. a mathematical model of the climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> system was developed in order to assess the effects of changing operating conditions on evaporator performance, based on as solid a theoretical foundation as cunendy possible. The model was tested against experimental data from a pilot plant climbing <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> and this experimental data was used to enhance the accuracy of the model by means of process identification.
