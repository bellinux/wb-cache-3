40|$|We examine several executive, firm, and industry-level {{characteristics}} {{that affect the}} propensity of firms to engage in activities that are socially responsible. First, we construct several aggregated and disaggregated measures that represent firms ' engagement in socially responsible practices. We find that larger, older, cash rich, and solvent firms {{are more likely to}} employ actions considered socially responsible. Our results also suggest that firms in industries facing a <b>recessionary</b> <b>trend</b> are less likely to invest in social responsibility programs. Next, we examine the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on firms ' investment policies, organizational strategy, and performance. Our findings indicate that factors associated with CSR strengths positively relate to all three attributes whereas CSR concerns and firm attributes are negatively related, although the latter relation is statistically weaker. Finally, we perform several robustness checks that validate our findings...|$|E
40|$|Many {{questions}} in social research must be evaluated over time. For example, {{in studies of}} intragenerational mobility, measuring opportunity for economic advancement requires longitudinal data. The authors develop and use a class of hybrid functional models to demonstrate how different models can lead to extremely different substantive conclu-sions. They provide guidelines for longitudinal data analyses in which variance parti-tions {{are central to the}} inquiry. In their analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the authors conclude that in a period of rising wage dispersion, the bulk of inequality is persistent over the life course. Their models provide support for the scenario in which wage inequality rises steadily while instability slowly diminishes over time. They obtain mild evidence of increased wage instability for somewhat older workers in the early 1990 s, matching a <b>recessionary</b> <b>trend.</b> These findings contribute significantly to understanding wage inequality in United States over the past 25 years...|$|E
40|$|Este artigo analisa a tática política adotada pelo Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) na conjuntura de crise do governo Collor (1990 - 1992). Considera-se que o PT não tenha fugido à tendência dominante do movimento pró-impeachment, vindo a aderir à campanha pela ética na política e a atacar o presidente Collor a partir de um discurso de cunho moralista que menosprezou a crítica e a denúncia do caráter de classe da política {{neoliberal}}, satisfazendo-se apenas com a denúncia da política recessiva do governo. Essa tática se inscreve na luta contra os efeitos da política neoliberal e não propriamente contra essa política, e esse comportamento político pode ser considerado um indicador do processo de aceitação passiva, por parte do PT, das medidas neoliberais. This paper analyzes Collor's government {{crisis and}} the political tactics of the Workers' Party (PT) at the conjuncture of Collor's government crisis. We consider that the Workers' Party didn't escape of the dominant trend of the pro-impeachment movement, adhering to the campaign for the ethics in politics and attacking president Collor from a moralist point of view, which relegated the critics and denouncement of the class character of the neoliberal politics to the second plan. The Party was limited to join the accusations about the <b>recessionary</b> <b>trend</b> of Collor's government, which meant a tactic inscribed {{in the fight against}} the effects of the neoliberal politics but not against its nature. This political behavior can be considered as an indicator of the process of passive acceptation of the neoliberal proposals from the PT...|$|E

This paper will argue that globalization has many potential forms of which the neo-liberal recipe, applied up to now, is only one. Globalization need not be neo-liberal. A pro-development version of globalization {{has not yet been}} designed or defended as such. It will be argued that, without it, not only would it be very difficult to relaunch development in the South but also to overcome the present instabilities, imbalances and <b>recessionary</b> <b>trends</b> in the economies of the North. ...|$|R

The inflationary phase of the crisis (August 2007 -June 2008) fuelled certain expansionary trends in MERCOSUR countries. Once this phase had run its course, MERCOSUR¿s performance began to feel {{the negative effects of}} the world economy. As of the fourth quarter of 2008, the collapse of activity levels and global trade, falling commodity prices, and financing difficulties were reflected in <b>recessionary</b> <b>trends</b> within the bloc. However, as of March 2009, there were clear signs of stabilization in the world economy, if not of outright recovery.

50|$|The Forum {{was held}} on June 6-8, 2008. The {{emergence}} of new centers of economic growth resulted in changes in the structure and development trends of global commodity and financial markets. The global financial crisis and {{problems associated with the}} dollar’s decline, the emergence of sovereign investment funds, and a rise in energy and food prices are individual manifestations of such processes. The problem of climate change can be added to the list, the solution of which requires not just individual, but collective efforts {{on the part of the}} majority of the world's nations. The existing institutions of global economic management had been shaped in a different era, and now they do not fulfill their purpose of preventing <b>recessionary</b> <b>trends</b> and diminishing their negative effects, both for individual countries and the entire global economy. In such conditions, many nations act individually in order to protect their national interests. Such uncoordinated actions may cause the unjustified rise of protectionism. Fundamental reform of institutions and principles of global governance is essential for a more accurate reckoning of both national and global interests.|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the position of}} the Orthodox clergy in the territory of Belgorod in 1917 - 1920, when in the new socio-political and economic situation, the Soviet authorities monitor the activities of the clergy, has limited his rights when liquidated prerevolutionary privilege for the clergy, and church lands transferred to public use than undermined the economic foundation of the church and the deteriorating financial situation of the priests. Also the article highlights <b>recessionary</b> <b>trends</b> in the life of priesthood arose when the Soviet power implemented decrees «On Freedom of Worship, church and religious societies» (1918), "On {{the separation of church and}} state and school from church" (1918), «Enactment of establishment of communities» (1919) as well as in the period of expropriation of church valuables in 1922. The analysis of this issue showed that the Soviet government restricted rights of priesthood, its civil rights and weakened the economic base of the Russian orthodox church and its priesthood financial status. But despite of everything, the orthodox priesthood sought a compromise in creating a new model of relationships between and government and the church after 1917...|$|R
40|$|German {{unification}} hit the German {{economy in}} a prosperous period and {{appeared as a}} huge demand shock {{at least for the}} first few quarters. This combination resulted in a major increase of imports from the main traiding partners of West Germany, which may have helped to cushion <b>recessionary</b> <b>trends</b> within these countries. In this paper the modelling of international trade in a disequilibrium framework and the consequences of German unification on trade flows are in the center of interest. For this purpose, a macroeconometric disequilibrium model for the German economy is extended by submodels for a bilateral trade flows vis a vis major trading partners. These submodels treat the trade flows as well as foreign and domestic production and capacity utilization as endogenous in a vector error correction framework. Consequently, the model allows for spillovers, like those resulting from the demand shock of German unification, to effect not only Germany trade flows, but also real variables in other countries leading to a feedback on Germany. The paper provides a short overview over the basic model. The modelling approach and estimation results for the trade submodels are presented in some detail and simulation results for the feedback effects are also included...|$|R
40|$|The current {{recession}} has hit Boise hard. Attracting new economic businesses and firms is critical {{as a means}} for Boise city to rebound from this recession. Among the possible incentives a city can offer to potential new employers and firms and spur economic growth, planning and zoning can play a major role. Also, measuring and understanding if planning and zoning adjustments can spur economic growth is essential to knowing how our city can grow during a recession. Our research will examine what is the status quo in Boise, by defining the current economic incentives that Boise city’s planning and urban development has to offer and what are current zoning laws. We will review if there have been any recent changes or exceptions in Boise city zoning laws for businesses. Then we will use data from the Capital City Development Corporation; Boise City Planning and Zoning; Boise City statistics; Peer-reviewed journal articles and any other available information to show if these incentives are effective and by how much. We will also compare our data with other cities with different zoning laws and see if they were effective in reversing <b>recessionary</b> <b>trends.</b> We expect to find more relaxed planning and zoning during a recessionary period which has the effect of spurring economic growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{launch of}} the single European {{currency}} raises {{a number of issues}} with regard to co-ordination of economic policies at European and national level. The ongoing discussion on whether to place the independent European Central Bank within the frame of a more comprehensive economic policy concept is, in the ultimate analysis, rooted in ideological differences. The practicability of the tools that have been developed for co-ordination, primarily among them the stability and growth pact, will be put to the test in the event that <b>recessionary</b> <b>trends</b> should emerge in EMU. Lacking co-ordination between national tax systems will enhance the trend towards unilateral harmonisation at national level. In the member states, it appears that the greatest challenge is for wage policies to secure growth and employment. However, national wage policies are made more difficult by the effects of increasing integration, and there is a general trend towards reducing their level of centralisation. It {{should also be noted that}} measures to shape conditions for business locations may be a powerful parameter of national economic policy, even though they will hardly be effective in the short term.

40|$|M. B. A. Increased {{environmental}} {{pressure in}} a firms' local market are forcing many companies to consider markets {{outside of their}} own to do maximize their profitability. According to Henisz (2000) when expanding internationally, a firm's management often must contend with a new culture, a new language, a new social system, new market structures, and a new political system. Titan, a premier brand in the Indian sub-continent aspires to assess the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) market for watches. Despite global market <b>recessionary</b> <b>trends,</b> the luxury watch market in the GCC reflects a constant thirty percent increase in business over the previous year, as measured on a monthly comparative basis. The research will indicate that Titan cannot simply apply the local strategies used in India, as this global market possesses different characteristics to those experienced in the GCC, the importance if brand utility may provide a distinct differential over the major competitors in this market. Though the model that is derived {{will be based on}} the Titan experience, it will also be applicable to other items in the luxury goods market, and may be utilised to facilitate market entry for all luxury goods which will be categorised in the same band as watches, examples of these include fashion accessories, sunglasses, perfumes and jewellery. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop a model to guide the market entry process for new watch brands under the Titan umbrella into the GCC market...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of poverty was felt and observed more {{during the decade}} of 1990 s, as the overall growth slowed down. While the slowed economic growth and <b>recessionary</b> <b>trends</b> contributed to poverty, the trickle “down effect” once thought, to improve living conditions, did not reach the lowest level owing largely to lack of accessibility of institutions, unjust and non-poor policies. For these reasons, in Pakistan during the decades of 60 s and 80 s, when the country experienced high growth rates of 6 - 7 percent, 34 percent of people still lived below the poverty line. Socio-economic development, {{improving the quality of}} life in general and of rural poor in particular, welfare have been the prime stated goals of government. Therefore, rural development programmes, such as, Village-Aid, Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP), Peoples Works Programme, Tameer-e-watan Programme, Prime Minister’s Five Points Programme etc. were introduced to improve farm productivity, which would consequently improve incomes and quality of life of rural poor. This was done through the Department of Local Government and Rural Development. Little impact on the life of the rural poor, however, was observed partly because these were administered through closed, immutable and cloistered institutions of government which are not accessible and responsive to the needs of poor. Also, the lack of focus on community participation and need for it was evident. As these programmes were managed through government departments these lacked flexibility and out-reach. The approach of administering was fixed, rigid and lacked professionalism. ...|$|R
40|$|Observing {{development}} {{of the crisis in}} the Russian economy, it appears {{that one of the reasons}} for the decline in the economic development is an increasing degree of uncertainty. The situation affects investment processes and multiplies itself in a growing deficiency of national income. High uncertainty blocks investments in capital-intensive and specific assets and makes economic entities transfer their resources into financial sector and, most often, outside the economy. 49 % of fixed industrial assets depreciation is an indirect proof of this situation. Depreciation of the Russian fixed assets in mining operations is 53. 2 %, which includes 22. 9 % of fully depreciated assets. At present, when the coefficient of renewal in this branch of ndustry is a little more than 6 and the coefficient of retirement is 0. 9, the situation seems to be disastrous. There are a lot of reasons for such situation, especially in the economic sphere. One of them is that within the neoliberal ideology dominating in the economic science with its emphasis on the automatic spontaneous adaptation there is actually no place for {{development of}} recommendations for a willful increase in efficiency of adaptation to uncertainty. After all, if we consider that the market leads the entire system to the most optimum equilibrium state, a need for such development simply does not arise. The main objective of this work is to show how the uncertainty factor increases <b>recessionary</b> <b>trends</b> in the Russian economy. Applying Keynesian analysis technique and dividing all savings into investment and hoarding ones, the author proves that Russia has a very low level of adaptive efficiency which reflects long-term ability of the economy to adjust successfully to changing internal and external conditions without any detriment to the implementation of the intended targets and tasks. It is a low level of adaptive efficiency that makes the current crisis so severe. The application of different methods for government regulation when there is a high level of uncertainty has been studied in details. </p...|$|R
40|$|Since {{falling into}} {{recession}} in June 2008, the British {{economy has been}} in a state of sustained instability. During this period, Great Britain (GB) has experienced high rates of inflation, increasing unemployment and widespread consumer uncertainty. It has become clear that new shopper ground rules have emerged, as consumers have begun to break from their established routines, seeking both quality and value for money. This has been no more evident than in the British grocery market, the lead sector of the retail industry, as consumers have been forced to evaluate all aspects of the household budget, including essential items such as food. In addition to the macro-economic pressures, the grocery sector is also being shaped by long-term structural trends that continue to drive the retail industry as a whole. Those of noticeable importance are the changing nature of the British high street, online retailing, growth in convenience shopping, market saturation and increasing internationalisation. Consequently, to understand change in grocery retailing, geographers need to move away from a one-dimensional account of the recession and consider the conflicting perspectives of governments, regulators, retailers and consumers that are also at work. This thesis contributes to ongoing research aimed at quantifying the impact of the recent recession on the British grocery market. The research benefits from a collaboration with Acxiom Ltd, {{through the use of a}} large-scale household survey aimed at recording local patterns in consumer behaviour across GB. To provide a holistic approach, insights into supply-side trends (changing retail formats, market saturation, e-commerce and internationalisation) are explored in conjunction with issues of demand (changes in household expenditure and customer patronage) – making it possible to separate <b>recessionary</b> <b>trends</b> from those deemed more longstanding. The complexities underpinning grocery retailing are then integrated through the construction of a disaggregated Spatial Interaction Model (SIM) to facilitate opportunities for growth in the grocery market. The disaggregation of the SIM by consumer type affords tremendous potential for the model to incorporate flows between different households and retail brands – recognising that some households are more willing or able to travel further to shop at their retailer of choice. The thesis demonstrates how the SIM is utilised to investigate growth opportunities in the discount market, highlighting the potential for expansion in both already saturated (Yorkshire and the Humber) and previously untapped markets (London) respectively. ...|$|R
