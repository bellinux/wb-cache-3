50|$|With one {{out and a}} <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> second and/or third base, {{converting}} {{a powerful}} batter to a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> first base means that a subsequent ground ball may become a double play that ends the scoring threat. With a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> second, this move lets fielders put the lead runner out using a force play rather than the more difficult tag play.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{to study}} the {{dynamics}} of physical preparedness of <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> 1500 m who live in various climatic conditions. Material and Methods: 20 qualified <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> middle distances who {{were divided into two}} groups took part in the experiment. The first group included 10 <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> 1500 m which are mainly living on the plain, the second – 10 <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> 1500 m which are mainly living in the mountain district. During the research the following methods were used: analysis and synthesis of references, testing, and methods of mathematical statistics. Results: indicators are presented and the analysis of the level of physical preparedness of <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> 1500 m is carried out, living in various climatic conditions in the preparatory and competitive periods of a year macrocycle. Conclusions: it is established that the level of physical preparedness of runners living in various climatic conditions changes not equally during a year macrocycl...|$|R
50|$|Example 1: With a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> {{third and}} two outs, batter hits a ground {{ball to the}} second baseman. The <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> third races home. The second baseman fields the ball and throws on to the first baseman in {{time to get the}} batter on the force out at first for the third out of the inning. Even if the <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> third had touched home plate before that force out was made at first, his run would not count.|$|R
5000|$|Home runs {{are often}} {{characterized}} {{by the number of}} <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> base at the time. A home run hit with the bases empty is seldom called a [...] "one-run homer", but rather a solo home run, solo homer, or [...] "solo shot". With one <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> base, two runs are scored (the baserunner and the batter) and thus the home run is often called a two-run homer or two-run shot. Similarly, a home runs with two <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> base is a three-run homer or three-run shot.|$|R
50|$|In {{the bottom}} of the 9th or an extra inning, having a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> first base might not affect the outcome of the game at all. For example, if the game is tied and there is a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> third base, the game is over if that runner scores.|$|R
50|$|In general, batters {{try to get}} hits. However, {{their primary}} {{objective}} is to avoid making an out, and helping their team to score runs. There are several ways they can help their team score runs. They may draw a walk if they receive and do not swing the bat at four pitches located outside the strike zone. In cases {{when there is a}} <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> third and fewer than two outs, they can attempt to hit a sacrifice fly to drive the runner in by allowing the <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> third to tag up and score. When there are fewer than two outs and <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> base, they can try to sacrifice bunt to advance the runner(s) or, with a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> first or with <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> first and third, they can try a hit and run play, also designed to advance the runner(s). They might even be hit by a pitch, reach on an error or—if first is empty or there are two outs—on a dropped third strike.|$|R

50|$|Dellinger was {{the first}} base umpire in a September 2, 2006, game between the Seattle Mariners and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. This game was notable {{for one of the}} great rarities in baseball, a triple play without the batter {{touching}} the ball. With <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> first and third, Mariner Raúl Ibañez was called out <b>on</b> strikes. The <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> first tried to steal and was thrown out by catcher Dioner Navarro. Then the <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> third broke for home and was thrown out at the plate by shortstop Ben Zobrist. It {{was the first}} 2-6-2 triple play in baseball history.|$|R

5000|$|Suppose that <b>runners</b> are <b>on</b> {{first and}} third base, and the batter hits a fly ball. The <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> third tags up, leaving third base {{immediately}} after the outfielder touches the ball. The runner seems to score, beating the throw home, but failing to touch home plate. He proceeds into his dugout without again attempting to touch home base. The <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> first base stays at first base, and action becomes relaxed while the ball is in the infield.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the sport}} of baseball, a baserunner {{is said to be}} in scoring {{position}} when he is on second or third base. The distinction between being on first base and second or third base is that a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> first can usually only score if the batter hits an extra-base hit, while a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> second or third can score on a single. This is also known as [...] "ducks <b>on</b> the pond". <b>Runners</b> left in scoring position refers to the number of <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> second or third base {{at the end of an}} inning and is an inverse measure of a team's offensive efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{to develop}} and to confirm {{experimentally}} {{the efficiency of the}} program of one-cycle creation of the training process of the qualified <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> middle distances in annual cycle of preparation. Materials & Methods: 40 qualified <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> middle distances took part in the research, 20 of which mainly lived in mountain conditions and 20 – mainly on the plain. The following methods were used during the research: analysis and synthesis of references, analysis of documentary materials, pedagogical observation. Results: the structure of annual macrocycle of training of <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> middle distances with the use of trainings in mountain conditions is presented. Content of mesocycles of preparation, volumes and orientation of training loads at them are directed. Conclusions: the correct and rational connection of means of training of <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> middle distances in mountain conditions and on the plain influences positively the level of preparedness and promotes the professional development of sportsmen...|$|R

50|$|A forced runner's {{force base}} {{is the next}} base beyond his time-of-pitch base. Any attempt by fielders to put a forced runner out is called a force play. Think of forced runners as bumper cars. If with a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> first, the batter hits a ground ball, the batter must run to first, and since two runners {{are not allowed to}} stay on one base at one time, the <b>runner</b> who was <b>on</b> first to begin with is now bumper-carred by the {{advancing}} batter over to second. If there already was a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> second as well, that runner is now bumper-carred over to third, and so <b>on.</b> If a <b>runner</b> is bumper-carred over to the next base by the advancing batter or by another runner who was bumper-carred by the advancing batter, then that runner is considered to have been forced to advance to the next base. If, however, with a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> third, for example, the batter hits a ground ball, the batter must run to first, but the <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> third, not having been bumper-carred by the batter, is not forced to advance and can stay where he is if he elects to.|$|R

50|$|Example 2: With a <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> {{third and}} two outs, batter hits a fly ball over centerfielder's head. It bounces several times as it rolls to the wall. The <b>runner</b> <b>on</b> third runs safely home and easily scores a run. Meanwhile, the batter safely reaches first, then tries {{to advance to}} second. The centerfielder, having {{retrieved}} the ball, throws {{the ball to the}} second baseman and the runner is tagged out as he slides into second. Since the <b>runner</b> stepped <b>on</b> home plate before the batter was tagged out at second for the third out of the inning, his run will count.|$|R

50|$|Ideally, a {{team would}} have <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> base {{and fewer than}} two outs once three to four kickers have kicked {{following}} this bunting strategy. At that point in the line-up, it is advantageous to place one or two kickers who can kick {{the ball into the}} outfield. The time it takes to field a ball from the outfield will ideally allow <b>runners</b> <b>on</b> base to score, even if the ball is caught in the outfield.|$|R
