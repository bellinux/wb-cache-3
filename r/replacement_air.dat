500|$|McCain recuperated {{just enough}} to pass his flight {{physical}} and have his flight status reinstated. In August 1974, {{he was assigned to}} the <b>Replacement</b> <b>Air</b> Group VA-174 [...] "Hellrazors". This was an A-7 Corsair II training squadron located at Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Jacksonville and the largest aviation squadron in the Navy. He became its executive officer in 1975, and on July 1, 1976, he was made VA-174's commanding officer. [...] This last assignment was controversial, as {{he did not have the}} required experience of having commanded a smaller squadron first (something that he now had too high a rank to do). While some senior officers resented McCain's presence as favoritism due to his father, junior officers rallied to him and helped him qualify for A-7 carrier landings.|$|E
500|$|In November 1965, he had {{his third}} {{accident}} when apparent engine failure in his T-2 Buckeye trainer jet over the Eastern Shore of Virginia led to his ejecting safely before his plane crashed. [...] While at Meridian, McCain requested a combat assignment. [...] In October 1966, he was slated for upcoming Vietnam War duty, and so reported to the VA-44 <b>Replacement</b> <b>Air</b> Group squadron at Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Florida for training on the A-4 Skyhawk, a single-seat jet attack aircraft. [...] There McCain {{was seen as a}} good pilot, albeit one who tended to [...] "push the envelope" [...] in his flying. [...] Promoted to lieutenant commander in January 1967, McCain joined the aircraft carrier [...] by May 1967, flying Skyhawks with the VA-46 [...] "Clansmen" [...] squadron. Forrestal conducted training exercises in the Atlantic early in the year, then set sail for the Pacific in June. [...] By this time, Jack McCain had risen in the ranks, making rear admiral in 1958 and vice admiral in 1963; in May 1967, he was promoted to four-star admiral, and became Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe, stationed in London.|$|E
