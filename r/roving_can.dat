50|$|Arkwright {{applied for}} at least 5 patents {{relating}} to spinning. They related to a feeder, a filleted cylinder, a <b>roving</b> <b>can,</b> the crank and comb and roller spinning. These patents were taken out in 1775 but were challenged in the courts on four counts : That the patent was prejudicial to His Majesties subject, they were not a new invention, they were not invented by arkwright, {{and they were not}} sufficiently described. The July 1781 and February 1785 cases were based on intelligibility, not being sufficiently described but in June 1785 the argument of not being original was judged. Highs was a witness at the February 1785 trial, and in his evidence claimed he had made fluted rollers. No mention was made by him of the spinning jenny, but it was mentioned as a statement of fact in Arkwrights submission, that Hargreaves had invented it.|$|E

Early GPS observations required several hours of observations by a static receiver to reach survey accuracy requirements.

The model has also been extended to service beyond the library building (library outreach), for example in a dormitory or faculty building at an academic institution.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn typical perceptual {{learning}} experiments, one stimulus type (e. g., a bisection stimulus offset {{either to}} the left or right) is presented per trial. In roving, two different stimulus types (e. g., a 30 ′ and a 20 ′ wide bisection stimulus) are randomly interleaved from trial to trial. <b>Roving</b> <b>can</b> impair both perceptual learning and task sensitivity. Here, we investigate the relationship between the two. Using a bisection task, we found no effect of roving before training. We next trained subjects and they improved. A roving condition applied after training impaired sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{frequencies}} of a damaged {{simply supported beam}} with a stationary roving mass are studied theoretically. The transverse deflection of the cracked beam is constructed by adding a polynomial function, which represents {{the effects of a}} crack, to the polynomial function which represents the response of the intact beam [J. Fernández-Sáez, L. Rubio, C. Navarro, Approximate calculation of the fundamental frequencies for bending vibrations of cracked beams, Journal of Sound and Vibration 225 (1999) 345 – 352]. By means of the boundary and kinematics conditions, approximate closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the natural {{frequencies of}} an arbitrary mode of transverse vibration of a cracked simply supported beam with a roving mass using the Rayleigh's method. The natural frequencies change due to the roving of the mass along the cracked beam. Therefore the <b>roving</b> mass <b>can</b> provide additional spatial information for damage detection of the beam. That is, the <b>roving</b> mass <b>can</b> be used to probe the dynamic characteristics of the beam by roving the mass {{from one end of the}} beam to the other. The presence of a crack causes the local stiffness of the beam to decrease which, in turn, causes a marked decrease in natural frequency of the beam when the roving mass is located in the vicinity of the crack. The magnitude of the roving mass used varied between 0 % and 50 % of the mass of the beam. The predicted frequencies are shown to compare very well with those obtained using the finite element method and the experimental results. Finally, the effects of crack depth, crack location and roving mass on the natural frequency of the beam are investigated. It is shown that the natural frequencies of the cracked beam decrease as the crack depth increases and as the roving mass is traversed closer to the crack location...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmong insects, {{the largest}} group of the Animal Kingdom, rove beetles (Staphylinidae) have {{undergone}} an enormous adaptive radiation that resulted in over 62, 000 extant species (A. F. Newton, unpublished database) showing diverse body forms, structures and feeding specializations combining predaceous, mycophagous, saprophagous and phytophagous habits in one family. The morphology of extinct and extant species is well studied, but the evolutionary history of such a broad range of adaptations is scarcely documented in the fossil record, and therefore poorly understood. One of the most puzzling specializations is that of predaceous ant-like stone beetles (Scydmaeninae), a staphylinid subfamily whose members choose not a soft-bodied prey, but the most heavily sclerotized, well-protected armoured mites. Scydmaenines have evolved a unique prey capturing apparatus with adhesive suckers to capture their prey, and the feeding process is remarkably long, often exceeding 30 h. The mouthparts with paired suckers cannot be used to catch any other kind of prey, and therefore finding such a device in extinct taxa implies specialized acarophagy. For the first time, we demonstrate that this very narrow specialization has ancient origins, and the Mesozoic (Turonian) Hyperstenichnus vendeanus Jałoszyński & Perrichot, gen. et sp. nov. from Vendean (French) amber was already an advanced, specialized mite killer. Surprisingly, the mouthpart modifications of the new species are more advanced than those in its extant relatives, suggesting that its (possibly too) narrowly specialized lineage has gone extinct. A long stasis of morphological structures is well known among Staphylinidae, and now also antiquity of narrow feeding specializations in <b>rove</b> beetles <b>can</b> be postulated, with unique habits remaining unchanged for over 90 million years...|$|R

40|$|During {{a one-year}} period, the {{variability}} of throughfall and the standard errors of the means associated with different gauge arrangements were studied in a lower montane rain forest in Puerto Rico. The following gauge arrangements were used: (1) 60 fixed gauges, (2) 30 fixed gauges, and (3) 30 roving gauges. Stemflow was measured on 22 trees of four different species. An ANOVA indicated that mean relative throughfall measured by arrangements 1 (77 %), 2 (74 %), and 3 (73 %) {{were not significantly different}} at the 0. 05 level. However, {{the variability of}} the total throughfall estimate was about half as high for roving gauges (23 %) as for fixed gauges (48 - 49 %). The variability of stemflow ranged from 36 % to 67 % within tree species and was 144 % for all sampled trees. Total stemflow was estimated at 4. 1 % of rainfall, of which palms contributed about 66 %. Comparative analysis indicated that while fixed and <b>roving</b> gauge arrangements <b>can</b> give similar mean values, least 100 fixed gauges are required to have an error at the 95 % confidence level comparable to that obtained by 30 roving gauges. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} {{has raised}} the global food production but also caused major concerns about environmental and health effects, including contamination by pesticides. Pesticide applications may induce toxicity {{not only on the}} target pest species but especially on non-target species. Hence we need to replace pesticides with management that promote organisms that suppress pest population. Natural enemies as parasitoids, spiders and ground and <b>rove</b> beetle <b>can</b> reduce pest population and contribute to the ecosystem service biological control. In this thesis I therefore study how agricultural management and land-use intensity as well as landscape composition influence the distribution of natural enemies and their functional aspects in agricultural landscapes. The studies were done in an agricultural region of southern Sweden dominated by annual crop production. Two study systems were considered. One consisting of oilseed rape, pollen beetles and parasitoid wasps that are natural enemies of pollen beetles. The other of three common agricultural lands uses, ranging from intensively managed sugar beet fields, winter wheat fields to grasslands and predatory arthropods. The results highlight that management intensity is an important factor explaining the spatiotemporal distribution of natural enemies and their biological control potential. In a functional perspective, increasing management intensity with insecticide application reduces the biological control of pollen beetles. Moreover insecticide treatment also reduce emergence of pollen beetle parasitoids the following spring. The most important factor explaining the distribution of adult parasitoids was the density of pollen beetle larva. Increased land-use intensity influenced the composition of arthropod communities. Spiders that are sensitive to disturbance were more commonly emerging in grasslands while omnivorus rove beetles and predacious macropterous ground beetles were most common in winter wheat fields. The phenology of arthropod emergence differed between the land uses and the overall dispersal tendency was higher for those emerging in crop fields compared to those emerging in grasslands. The land-use intensity also influenced the trait composition. The average body length of emerging ground beetle communities was lower in crop fields than grasslands while the average body length of actively moving communities did not differ between land uses. Further the proportion of ground beetles with good flight ability or a carnivorous diet was higher in crop fields than grasslands. To conclude, this thesis contributes to important knowledge concerning the distribution of natural enemies in the agricultural landscape in relation to management intensity. This knowledge base will be needed to develop more sustainable agricultural systems, as approaches focusing on reducing pesticide inputs as organic farming and integrated pest management (IPM) are dependent on natural enemies and their functions to be successful...|$|R
40|$|The {{elaborated}} {{principles of}} nanoengineering of linen textile materials implement {{the techniques of}} spatially localized effects of protein catalysts on polymeric cellulose companions with selective splitting of impurity compounds without damaging technologically necessary nano-sized formations of binders in the fiber structure. The ranges of optimal values of the residual content in flax fiber prepared for spinning are identified {{on the basis of}} the analysis of the successive stages of enzymatic and peroxide treatments contribution to the breakdown of polymers and the differentiation of the influence of impurities on the yarn technological properties. The recommended level of residual pectin, lignin and hemicellulose (wt. %) is: after enzymatic treatment P 1 = 1, 0 ± 0, 1; L 1 = 3, 9 ± 0, 3; Hc 1 = 11, 0 ± 1, 0; after peroxide bleaching P 2 = 0, 4 ± 0, 05; L 2 = 2, 3 ± 0, 3; Hc 2 = 7, 5 ± 0, 5. The required level of fiber structural modification at the stage of preparing <b>roving</b> for spinning <b>can</b> be achieved through use of protein catalysts whose globule size is 50 [...] . 100 nm. The use of enzymes with these dimensional characteristics helps to ensure breaking of polymer adhesives on the surface of incrusts and in the areas of intercellular formations, which hinder fiber crushing, without damaging nano-sized binding fractions. The implementation of this method contributes to a significant improvement in the uniformity of structural and physical and mechanical properties of flax yarn. Increase in yarn fineness and strength properties of semi-finished products, as well as improvement of deformation properties and reduction of yarn breakages during the spinning processes are achieved...|$|R
