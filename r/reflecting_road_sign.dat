In this study, the issues associated with automatic <b>road</b> <b>sign</b> recognition are described, the existing methods developed to tackle the <b>road</b> <b>sign</b> recognition problem are reviewed, and a comparison of the features of these methods is given. Second, the developed <b>road</b> <b>sign</b> recognition system is described. The system is capable of analysing live colour road scene images, detecting multiple <b>road</b> <b>signs</b> within each image, and classifying the type of <b>road</b> <b>signs</b> detected. The system consists of two modules: detection and classification. The detection module segments the input image in the hue-saturation-intensity colour space, and then detects <b>road</b> <b>signs</b> using a Multi-layer Perceptron neural-network.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel <b>road</b> <b>sign</b> {{detection}} and recognition method. The {{position of a}} <b>road</b> <b>sign</b> in an image is detected using the projection technique. The hidden Markov model is then used to match the detected <b>road</b> <b>sign</b> {{with those in the}} database so that the goal of <b>road</b> <b>sign</b> recognition can be achieved. More specifically, the color images in terms of the RGB color system are first converted to the HSV color system and then quantized into specific colors. The horizontal and vertical projections of whole images in the specific colors existing in <b>road</b> <b>signs</b> are then used to detect the positions of <b>road</b> <b>signs.</b> In the recognition stage, only local features around the detected positions are used and a two-step strategy is adopted. The horizontal and vertical projections of background in the local area are used to prune irrelevant <b>road</b> <b>signs.</b> The candidate <b>road</b> <b>signs</b> are then sorted using the hidden Markov model.
