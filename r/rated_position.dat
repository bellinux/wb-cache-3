The elements of the matrix are calculated from the rated data of the transformer by <b>rated</b> <b>position</b> of the tap changer using BCTRAN-Routine.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of art in}} South Africa barely spans 100 years. Many artists from Holland, England, Germany and France, together with their colleagues in South Africa, helped to develop it to the present level. Only during the 'fifties did local artists shake off the nineteenth-century traditions which persisted and brought the local art scene {{more in line with}} developments in Europe and the United States of America. From this time, South African art became less dependent and more mature. Fine art has a very definite social function. It satisfies a basic human need, and in the more practical sense design forms {{an important part of the}} socioeconomic structure of society as a whole. Art is an essential component of the communications system of a society. Art, viewed in this light, should be re-examined and seen as an indispensable component of any educational system because of its ennobling and formative influence on man. Further, as a communications medium, art should have a more highly <b>rated</b> <b>position</b> - as a vital element without which society in its present form could not continue to function. It is a fact that art is not accorded its rightful place in South Africa. An example of this is its neglected position in the school situation and the general lack of insight and interest shown by both the State and society. It is part and parcel of the task of a Department of Fine Arts to endeavour to surmount these shortcomings by definite action and leadership. For this reason it is essential that this department and others sharing a common interest (e. g. Art History and Cultural History), should come together to discuss in depth the future and position of the arts. A subject that is no longer discussed is a dead subject. p. 15 - 18 : Publikasies van die Universiteit van Pretoria (Nuwe Reeks) [URL]...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{distributional}} characteristics of two presidential candidates’ proposed reforms to the US federal individual income tax. Using an anonymous sample of tax return data from the Brookings-Urban Institute Tax Policy Center and the Center’s simulations of 2009 tax law and the two proposals, we compare the vertical and horizontal equity of the three individual income tax regimes. Surprisingly, there is very little difference among the three proposed individual income tax regimes in terms of vertical and horizontal equity. However, when the initial effective tax <b>rate</b> <b>positions</b> and economic incomes of each pair of taxpayers are compared to the new effective tax <b>rate</b> <b>positions</b> under the two proposals, we find that the Obama proposal makes the tax system more progressive than 2009 law. This change is much more pronounced than under the McCain proposal. On the other hand, when these initial positions are compared to the two proposals viz. a viz. horizontal equity, the McCain proposed tax system is more horizontally equitable than 2009 tax law, and more horizontally equitable than the Obama proposal is when compared to 2009 tax law. ...|$|R

The objective of this work is to evaluate duel fuel operation of CI diesel engines with simplest possible change of hardware. Here the effort {{has been made to}} determine the performance and emission characteristics of CNG and neem blends in CI engine. The maximum achievable neem biodiesel replacement by natural gas was found to vary with engine loads. The experiments are carried out for five different flow rates starting from minimum to maximum flow <b>rate</b> <b>position.</b> The engine showed very similar performance compared to diesel operation near up to 90 % of rated load with up to 54 % replacement of diesel by CNG being possible. The maximum flow <b>rate</b> <b>position</b> is one at which the engine starts knocking. Exhaust gas analysis showed that with higher diesel replacement the level of CO 2 generation decreased and CO emission was found to increase. The late burning of the mixture with higher diesel replacement levels of CNG had caused more fuel to remain partially unburned increasing the formation of CO and decreasing the proportion of CO 2. This would contribute to the reduction of efficiency at light loads. From the Comparison of results obtained with all above flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Characterization of the count-rate {{performance}} of scintillation cameras should {{include not only}} the specification of count losses. At high count rates, {{there is also an}} image distortion due to the mispositioning of pile-up events. In this paper a simple and clinically relevant procedure to quantify this distortion is presented. The images of a square uniform technetium- 99 m phantom at high and low count rates are used. The fraction of the total counts being correctly positioned is determined as the peripheral count density divided by the total average count density. This ratio, corrected for the camera non-uniformity at low count rates, is called the 'positioning ability'. According to the National Electrical Manufacturers' Association (NEMA), the 'system count rate performance with scatter' should be reported as the measured count rate giving 20 % count losses. In this paper it is suggested that this measure be complemented by a measure of the fraction correct positioned events at this count rate. This fraction, the 'high count <b>rate</b> <b>positioning</b> ability', can be easily and accurately measured using our method. The method has been tested on two different scintillation cameras. For one of them the high count <b>rate</b> <b>positioning</b> ability was determined as 91 % at a measured count rate of 30, 000 s- 1 with 20 % count losses. For the other camera, the corresponding figures were 88 % at 59, 000 s- 1 and close to 100 % at 38, 000 s- 1, before and after the installation of a new pile-up rejection circuit, respectively...|$|R
