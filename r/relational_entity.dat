In conclusion, de Silva proposes the compound notion anattā-pneuma as a solution for the problem of the self in Buddhism and Christianity; this new notion, he states, conforms with the anattā Buddhist-Christian belief in the non-existence of an immortal soul inhabiting the body, but also lays more emphasis on social relationships by means of pneuma.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} {{the task of}} <b>relational</b> <b>entity</b> search which aims at {{automatically}} learning an entity ranking function for a desired relation. To rank entities, we exploit the redundancy abound in their snippets; however, such redundancy is noisy as not all the snippets represent information relevant to the desired relation. To explore useful information from such noisy redundancy, we abstract the task as a distantly supervised ranking problem – based on coarse entity-level annotations, deriving a relation-specific ranking function {{for the purpose of}} online searching. As the key challenge, without detailed snippet-level annotations, we have to learn an entity ranking function that can effectively filter noise; furthermore, the ranking function should also be online executable. We develop Pattern-based Filter Network (PFNet), a novel probabilistic graphical model, as our solution. To balance the accuracy and efficiency requirements, PFNet selects a limited size of indicative patterns to filter noisy snippets, and inverted indexes are utilized to retrieve required features. Experiments on the large scale CuleWeb 09 data set for six different relations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PFNet model, which outperforms five state-of-the-art <b>relational</b> <b>entity</b> ranking methods.

40|$|Entity resolution, {{the problem}} of {{identifying}} the underlying entity of references found in data, has been researched for many decades in many communities. A common theme in this research has been the importance of incorporating relational features into the resolution process. <b>Relational</b> <b>entity</b> resolution is particularly important in knowledge graphs (KGs), which have a regular structure capturing entities and their interrelationships. We identify three major problems in KG entity resolution: (1) intra-KG reference ambiguity; (2) inter-KG reference ambiguity; and (3) ambiguity when extending KGs with new facts. We implement a framework that generalizes across these three settings and exploits this regular structure of KGs. Our framework has many advantages over custom solutions widely deployed in industry, including collective inference, scalability, and interpretability. We apply our framework to two real-world KG entity resolution problems, ambiguity in NELL and merging data from Freebase and MusicBrainz, demonstrating the importance of relational features...|$|E

Our approach differs from other recently proposed entity resolution approaches in that it is a) generative, b) does not make pair-wise decisions and c) captures relations between entities through a hidden group variable. We propose a novel sampling algorithm for collective entity resolution which is unsupervised and also takes entity relations into account. Additionally, we do not assume the domain of entities to be known and show how to infer the number of entities from the data.

Users define user defined relations with tuples of subexpression matches and can associate code actions with subexpressions. MERF computes feature matches, regular expression matches, and constructs entities and relational entities from user defined relations. We evaluated our work with several case studies and compared with existing application-specific techniques.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of subjectivity and the self permeate {{the foundations of}} the philosophy of distributed cognition (DCog). Proponents of DCog argue that cognition extends beyond the confines of the brain and moves into the immediate bio-social environment. Here, {{as well as in the}} special issue in general, we extend this argument by looking at multi-scalar temporalities that influence the emergence and potential of the self. In particular, we argue that the self is best understood as a <b>relational</b> <b>entity</b> that immerses contextually in a distributed, non-stable, and temporally multi-scalar manner. This conceptualization of the self points to interesting conclusions concerning the operationalization of reasoning, the foundations of communication, and cognition in general. Together, this bring home at least two major philosophical implications of viewing language and thinking as temporally multi-scalar. First, contextually immersed subjectivity is compatible with tracing language and cognition to how cultural resources extend human embodiment (this frames the potential for cognition, subjectivity, and the self). Second, while distributed and fragmented, the construction of temporal experience can become an organizing principle for the construction of the self. Through this lens, cognition binds what is learned from introspection with contextual immersion that uses skills in temporal integration. This challenges views of self and cognition as stable internal phenomena and, conversely, shows that philosophy and psychology have much to gain from examining how living human beings achieve temporal unity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Databases often contain {{uncertain}} and imprecise references to real-world entities. Entity resolution, {{which is the}} process of reconciling multiple references to underlying real-world entities, is an important data cleaning process required before accurate visualization or analysis of the data is possible. In many cases, in addition to noisy data describing entities, there is data describing the relationships among the entities. This relational data is important during the entity resolution process; it is useful both for the algorithms that determine likely database references to be resolved and for visual analytic tools that support the entity resolution process. In this paper, we introduce a novel user interface, D-Dupe, for interactive entity resolution in relational data. D-Dupe effectively combines <b>relational</b> <b>entity</b> resolution algorithms with a novel network visualization that enables users to make use of an entity’s relational context for making resolution decisions. We describe resolution strategies based on pairs or sets of references and show appropriate visualizations for each. Since resolution decisions often are interdependent, D-Dupe facilitates understanding this complex process through animations that highlight combined inferences and a history mechanism that allows users to inspect chains of resolution decisions. An empirical study with 12 users confirmed the benefits of the relational context visualization on the performance of entity resolution tasks in relational data in terms of time as well as users ’ confidence and satisfaction.

40|$|The essay {{discusses}} {{the motif of}} the butterfly and other Lepidoptera that Georges Didi-Huberman occasionally addressed in the two volumes of Essais sur l’apparition, Phasmes (1998) and Phalènes (2013). The hypothesis is that this motif {{can be viewed as}} a figural model of conceiving two essential elements of all art history, namely the nature of the image and its temporality. The fluttering butterfly becomes an occasion to explain Didi-Huberman’s art history by relating its fundamental dimensions to other key figures with which he is implicitly or explicitly in dialogue: Aloïs Riegl, Franz Wickhoff or Aby Warburg. Whereas the content of their specific art histories differs, they all resist the canonical conception of the image as an entity whose place and ‘immanent sense’ is fixed in a diachronic narrative. Alternatively, they develop an art historical prototype where the image is thought of as an essentially <b>relational</b> <b>entity</b> whose latency of sense emerges when it is dialectically superposed to other images. Art history does not function as the stable chronological juxtaposition of artefacts but as the extraction of a virtual sense through the anachronistic superposition of images kept in movement. When the diachronic arrangement of primary sources whose sense depends on the world where they emerged fails, art history interiorizes a speculative epistemology where sense is equivalent to an associative force of images. Reading Didi-Huberman nowadays confronts the art historiographer with a fundamental epistemological question: what is the structure of the interpretative process presupposed in all story of art?

40|$|This {{study in}} the {{doctrine}} of God, with special reference to the thought of John Macquarrie and Charles Hartshorne, addresses {{the issue of the}} relational problematic and suggests a potential resolution. The 'Relational Problematic' focusses on the notion of aseity and the doctrine of the Trinity. It concerns the ontological conundrum posed by, on the one hand, the insistence that the external relations God has are of no ontological consequence to him, together with, on the other hand, the witness of the Christian tradition that suggests such relations are not, in fact, inconsequential for the being of God. The task of constructing a resolution begins with the ontology of the early Heidegger which is implicitly relational. Thus 'relational ontology' furnishes a hermeneutical key whereby a 'Relational Theology' may be developed. This development involves, first, the analysis of John Macquarrie's existential- ontological theism, which concludes that to speak of God in the language of 'Being' is to speak of the relational being of God. Second, and alongside this, is placed the analysis and discussion of the neoclassical theism of Charles Hartshorne: the pluriform language of Becoming by which God is conceived in process thought has at its base the perception of the essential relatedness of God. But both Macquarrie and Hartshorne have as a common problem the question of the "entitative status" of God. The solution is suggested by way of conceiving God as "Relational Entity". The 'Being' and the 'Becoming' of God are manifest in ad extra relatedness: such relationality forms the fundamental ontological motif in the conception of God. This relational perspective frames the resolution to the relational problematic. Aseity is reinterpreted {{in the light of the}} relational context of God: God is existentially prior, but not relationally self-sufficient. Trinity is interpreted in terms of relational identity: the necessary ad extra relatedness of God is manifest in three particular patterns of relating. 'God' is thus ontologically conceived as singular <b>relational</b> <b>entity</b> manifesting threefold relational identity...|$|E
