50|$|A Certificate of Airworthiness (CofA), or an {{airworthiness}} certificate, {{is issued}} for an aircraft {{by the national}} aviation authority {{in the state in}} which the aircraft is registered. The airworthiness certificate attests that the aircraft is airworthy insofar as the aircraft conforms to its type design. Each airworthiness certificate is issued in {{one of a number of}} different categories. A certificate of airworthiness is issued when the aircraft is registered in the name of the owner. Thereafter, a yearly currency fee is payable to <b>renew</b> the <b>Certificate</b> of Airworthiness. If this fee is not paid when due, the certificate expires and the owner must apply again for this certificate to be issued. The Certificate of Airworthiness can only be issued when a certificate of release to service from the maintenance facility declares that the maintenance due has been carried out and the aircraft is then certified as being airworthy.|$|R

Approximately 3 minutes later, at 11:58 am, Hurn Airport lost contact with the aircraft as it struck the ground, crossing a road into a ploughed field, bringing down telephone lines and trees and alerting residents in the nearby villages. Upon realising they had lost contact with the aircraft, the controller at Hurn contacted the emergency services giving the last known position before contact was lost.

5000|$|The 27-year-old Rupert Max Stuart, an Arrernte man, and {{teenager}} Alan Moir {{had been}} in Ceduna on 20 December, running the darts stall for the funfair operated by Mr and Mrs Norman Gieseman. Both had gone out drinking {{during the day and}} Moir returned late that night, losing consciousness several times due to intoxication. Stuart had been arrested for drinking alcohol at 9:30 pm and was in police custody. This was because, at the time, 'full-blooded' Aboriginal people were forbidden by law to drink alcohol. In 1953 a Federal ordinance had been passed that permitted 'half-castes' to drink, but they were required to apply for a [...] "certificate of exemption". These were commonly referred to as [...] "Dog Licences" [...] by Aboriginal people. Stuart had been jailed {{on more than one occasion}} for supplying alcohol to 'full-bloods'. The ban was rarely enforced in rural towns. However, since 1958, Ceduna had been combating a perceived alcohol-related [...] "native problem" [...] and was enforcing the alcohol ban. Although he was not drunk, Stuart had not <b>renewed</b> his <b>certificate,</b> and when arrested for drinking, was facing a sentence of 6 to 18 months in jail.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{literature}} {{states that}} many necessary skills of CPR and first aid are forgotten shortly after certification. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the skill and knowledge decay in first aid in those who are paid to respond to emergency situations within a workplace. Methods Using a choking victim scenario, the sequence and accuracy of events were observed and recorded in 257 participants paid to act as first responders in large industrial or service industry settings. A multiple choice exam was also written to determine knowledge retention. Results First aid knowledge was higher in those who were trained at a higher level, and did not significantly decline over time. Those who had <b>renewed</b> their <b>certificate</b> one or more times performed better than those who had learned the information only once. During the choking scenario many skills were performed poorly, regardless of days since last training, such as hand placement and abdominal thrusts. Compressions following the victim becoming unconscious also showed classic signs of skill deterioration after 30 days. Conclusions As many skills deteriorate rapidly over the course of the first 90 days, changing frequency of certification is not necessarily the most obvious choice to increase retention of skill and knowledge. Alternatively, methods of regularly "refreshing" a skill should be explored that could be delivered at a high frequency - such as every 90 days. </p...|$|R
40|$|Android’s trust-on-first-use {{application}} signing model asso-ciates developers with a fixed signing key, but lacks a mecha-nism to transparently {{update the}} key or <b>renew</b> their signing <b>certificate.</b> As an advantage, this feature allows applica-tion updates {{to be recognized}} as authorized by a party with access to the original signing key. Changing keys or cer-tificates requires that end-users manually uninstall/reinstall apps, losing all non-backed up user data. In this paper, we show that with appropriate OS support, developers can securely and without user intervention transfer signing au-thority to a new signing key. Our proposal, Baton, modifies Android’s app installation framework enabling key agility while preserving backwards compatibility with current apps and current Android releases. Baton is designed to work consistently with current UID sharing and signature permis-sion requirements. We discuss the technical changes made to Android, and remaining open issues such as key loss and signing authority revocation on Android...|$|R
