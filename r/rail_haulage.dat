50|$|The Panhandle Coalfield is a {{coalfield}} {{located in}} the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia counties of Hancock, Brooke, Ohio, Marshall, and Wetzel. Mining is primarily in the Pittsburgh coal seam, sometimes called the No. 8 seam, which is of a steam rather than metallurgical nature in this region. Currently CONSOL Energy maintains two large mines in this field - Shoemaker (one of the last large mines in America to use <b>rail</b> <b>haulage</b> in the mine) and McElroy. Also, the first new mine in Ohio County in forty years was being developed on Short Creek by Alliance Coal Co. in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Prior to August 1999, ore was hauled on a 42-inch gauge (1,067 mm gauge) railroad, double-tracked and {{electrified}} at 1,400VDC, {{except in}} the ore loading area, where 600VDC was used. 4-wheel locomotives weighing 55-62 tons hauled trains of 4-wheel 20-ton ore cars. A typical train of 20 to 25 cars required 3 locomotives, two pulling and one pushing up the long 3-percent grade in the tunnel. After 1996, train operation was fully automated. <b>Rail</b> <b>haulage</b> was abandoned when the ore above the rail level in the mine was exhausted. The new working level of the mine, 400 feet (120 m) below the rail level, required a conveyor to lift the ore to the haulage tunnel, and it was eventually decided to extend this conveyor the full distance to the mill.

50|$|The Rail-Veyor system {{incorporates}} a remotely operated electrically powered series of two wheeled railcars driven by power stations located {{along on a}} light-rail track. Because the cars are remotely operated and compact in size, {{they can be used}} as an enabling technology for rapid development and high speed production at the working face. The Rail-Veyor system can reduce capital costs and infrastructure, travelling below shafts and in spaces as small as 10 by 12 feet or 3.05 m by 3.66 m. Using multiple train systems in tandem optimizes continuous material haulage. The railcars can travel at variable speeds up to 18 mph, or 8 metres/second, and climb grades of 20%. The company claims that the system combines the best features of conveyors, <b>rail,</b> and truck <b>haulage,</b> including travelling on 20% inclines, increased capacity and availability, reduced installation time, a small profile, and a short turning radius of 95 feet or 30 m. The system is used for underground and surface applications in the mining and aggregate industries.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{formally}} closed throughout to passengers on 30 April 1962, (the last actual passenger trains had run on Saturday, 28 April) but goods and parcels traffic to Mold from Chester carried on. The track from Rhydymwyn to the junction with the Vale of Clwyd line, {{just north of}} Denbigh was lifted in 1963. However, limestone powder traffic continued to originate at Rhydymwyn and goods trains also served the Synthite chemical works just west of Mold. On 1 January 1968 the line was further reduced in operational length, terminating at the Synthite works. Access to Mold was now from Wrexham using an existing south to west junction with the national network at Penyffordd, on the former Great Central Wrexham to Bidston line; before it had continued under the GC line onwards to Broughton & Bretton and on to Mold Junction, west of Chester, where the line had joined the Chester & Holyhead main line. The Synthite to Rhydymwyn section, mothballed since 1968, was revived in 1974 for the transportation inwards of oil pipe sections for the Angelsey to Ellesmere Port pipe line, which uses {{part of the old}} M & D Jct trackbed near Afon Wen. Mold station survived until 1988 (though occupied by a builders merchant), and when the Synthite works transferred from <b>rail</b> to road <b>haulage</b> in March 1983 the line was subsequently lifted, having now lost its last remaining usage. Mold station was redeveloped as a Tesco supermarket but the original M & D Jct Rly station buildings at Rhydymwyn, Caerwys and Bodfari survive as private dwellings.|$|R
50|$|Constant {{lowering}} of tolls {{meant that the}} carriage of some bulky, non-perishable, and non-vital goods by water was still feasible on some inland waterways - but the death knell for commercial carrying on the narrow canals was sounded {{in the winter of}} 1962-63, when a long hard frost kept goods icebound on the canals for three months. A few of the remaining customers turned to road and <b>rail</b> <b>haulage</b> to ensure reliability of supply and never returned, though both rail and road had been severely disrupted by the frost and snow too. Other narrowboat traffic gradually ceased with the change from coal to oil, the closure of canalside factories, and run-down of British heavy industry. The last long-distance narrowboat traffics, coal from the Midlands to Dickinson's paper mills at Croxley and the Kearley & Tonge Jam Factory at Southall both ceased in 1970 - the Croxley mills had changed to oil and the Jam Factory closed for re-location. Regular narrowboat traffics continued, such as lime juice from Brentford to Boxmoor (until 1981) while aggregates were carried on the River Soar until 1988. Some individual waterways (especially the Manchester Ship Canal, the Aire & Calder Navigation and the other large waterways) remain viable, carrying many millions of tonnes per year and there are still hopes for development, but containerisation of ports and lorries has mostly passed the waterways by. The last major investment development of the inland waterways was the enlargement of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation in the early 1980s to cope with barges of standard European dimensions that (in the depression of the 80s) never came. The scale of the futile hopes of those days can be appreciated by the occupants of a holiday narrowboat nearly lost in a lock built for the barges that were going to sail down the Rhine, across the North Sea aboard a ship, and up to Doncaster. Today {{there have been a number}} of successful initiatives to get more traffic on to the larger inland waterways, though even the Manchester Ship Canal does not convey cargo ships to the docks in Salford, which have become little more than a 'water feature' for the apartments, offices and cultural institutions of 'Salford Quays' that have replaced the wharves and warehouses.|$|E

40|$|A {{synopsis}} forecasting the ‘repercussions {{of active}} railway services from the Tema seaport of Ghana- on the indigenous road haulage industry ’ {{was created in}} 2009. This was with full knowledge that <b>rail</b> <b>haulage</b> services though non-existent, were inevitable if the port was to realize appreciable levels of efficiency in support of supply chains through the Sub-region. The study, which is still relevant today, assessed the views of stakeholders’ in road haulage with regards to ‘the level of awareness of the potential competition from an operational railway sector, the potential impacts on their businesses and ways of reducing negative impacts if any’. It was evident that a fully operational railway services would yield significant negative direct, indirect and induced impacts on the indigenous road haulage industry in the short to medium term. The level of awareness of these was quite low amongst the indigenous Ghanaian stakeholders. Few indigenous operators vouched to resort to crime if they lost their livelihoods. It was noted with interest, {{that members of the}} road haulage industry could somehow contribute funding in support of a future <b>rail</b> <b>haulage</b> industry, which could result in win- win situations for all relevant stakeholders. This was on the backdrop that national policies offering opportunities for indigenous road haulers are instituted and the necessary education on global trends with ‘multimodal transport ’ given them.

40|$|Muck {{conveyors}} are {{a potential}} source of airborne dust. Muck from the excavated face, which is usually fairly wet when placed on the conveyor, dries out as it travels on the conveyor through the airstream. Water sprays placed at intervals along the conveyor will minimize dust from the conveyor contaminating the airstream. Conveyor transfer and drop points should be enclosed and provided with water sprays. Scraper and spray wash will wash return belts and idlers. 7. 5. 11 Airways, Haulage Ways, Mine Cars and Dumping Stations a) Airways and <b>rail</b> <b>haulage</b> ways Cleaning the walls and floors of airways and <b>rail</b> <b>haulage</b> ways, by periodically washing down or vacuuming, will remove many potential dust sources. Concrete lined openings facilitate cleaning. Residual dust and dirt {{should not be allowed}} to accumulate in the airways and haulage ways as these represent potential dust sources. b) Mine cars Keeping the muck in the mine cars wet reduces the potential for creating dust. Overloading cars must be avoided as it can lead to spillage which then becomes another potential dust source. Washing mine cars regularly will keep them free of dirt and dust, and parking a loaded mine car for a long periods should be avoided as this allows the muck to dry out. If feasible, major route of mine cars should not be along primary intake airways. c) Dumping Stations Subsurface muck car dumping stations represent major potential dust sources. Enclosure and bypass airways can be installed to avoid high velocity air/dust contact. Water spray at dump activated during dumping will wet the muck and suppress dust. Local dust scrubbers located at the dumps will clean dusty air that escapes from the dump station enclosures. Choice of location and equipment for dump stations must prioritize dust control. 7. 5. 12 Leakage and Recirculation of Contaminated Air from Exhaust Ducts Leakage from exhaust ducts containing contaminated air and subsequent recirculation of the leakage contributes to dust problems.

40|$|A {{transport}} using {{at least}} two means of transport is called a combined transport (CT). A traditional road/rail combined transport contains a pick up service with a short road haulage at the place of dispatch, transhipment to a rail wagon, long dis¬tance <b>rail</b> <b>haulage,</b> another transhipment and a delivery road haulage. On July 1, 1992, the business unit for CT of Swedish State Railways (SJ), SJ Kombi, was changed into a limited company. The new company, Rail Combi AB, is principal of all Swedish CT terminals and has also a monopoly of selling domestic CT services to hauliers and forwarders. Approximately 1 000 wagons for combined transport are handled daily at the Swedish terminals. About 20 % refer to international transport. Rail Combi takes a central point in this paper. The purpose of the paper is to describe the Swedish production system for domestic combined transport. The current situation as well as development plans are de¬scribed.

40|$|Markets for {{rainforest}} cabinet timbers {{in north}} Queensland are currently limited. The {{vast majority of}} the logs come from private land due to the reduction of the resource with the World Heritage listing of the rainforest in 1988. For a variety of reasons, no market is available for logs for woodchip. Thus for landholders harvesting trees the main market for these species is the sawn-timber market. In north Queensland the single large-scale processor of logs, Ravenshoe Timbers Pty Ltd, only processes plantation grown softwoods. The potential buyers of hardwood logs are limited to a few small 2 ̆ 7 family 2 ̆ 7 fixed-site mills and portable sawmillers. The markets these sawmillers service in turn are often long distances from north Queensland, which leads to high road or <b>rail</b> <b>haulage</b> costs. Additionally, these sawmillers face stiff competition from rainforest timbers of similar characteristics imported from developing countries where legislative requirements and cost of labour are not as onerous as those in Australia. It is important to ascertain what role the cabinet timber industry can play in the north Queensland economy and what role, if any portable sawmilling can play in a future timber industry. Potential exists for greater use of portable sawmills, to handle the relatively small volume of hardwood timber available, and reduce log transport and milling costs...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{growth of}} <b>rail</b> <b>haulage</b> prices has brought {{new life to}} {{the debate on the}} ideal price level for this kind of transport. On the one hand, a higher price could be {{considered}} necessary to allow higher proportion of the costs to be covered, therefore reducing the burden on the taxpayers, on the other hand the rise in price could entail a loss of competitiveness to road haulage, thus endangering the social objectives connected to the protection of the environment. There is a fundamental ambiguity in the situation describe above, that could not be solved even by an economic approach, to attempt to asses the different impacts on society of the two approaches. In this uncertainty it would therefore seem appropriate to suggest politicians (representative chosen by the public) as the most appropriate judges of welfare as far as rail prices are concerned. The point of view put forward by this article is that the rigid approach expressed in recent UE papers (July 1998) - aiming at keeping rail prices low according to the concept of marginal-cost pricing - does not allow the scope of a political decision to single member state on the value of rail transport, thus allowing for different prices in all members state. The approach put forwards by the UE, furthermore, for sees heavy subsidies for the infrastructure rather then for the rail service and does not allow the clear and democratic assessment of the cost sustained by society for each service; public subsidy of services would be more transparent and democratic...|$|E
40|$|Freight {{carried by}} rail has {{traditionally}} been mainly low value bulk commodities. As Western economies advance the market for such freight services is at best static, and forms a smaller proportion of the total demand for freight transport. There is thus an urgent need for British Rail and other rail systems to develop practical and cost effective inter-modal systems, which offer high quality services to consignors of consumer goods whose premises are not usually connected to the rail network. The new developments are of two types. Either they involve transferring {{the body of a}} road vehicle from road to rail, or moving the complete semi-trailer of an articulated outfit by rail. Each system has disadvantages in terms of volume or tare weight when compared to road, but each system may attract different commodities. Though the costs of inter-modal systems vary, their cost structures have similarities, consisting of collection and delivery costs, terminal, and rail movement elements. The break- even distance of each system depends {{on the extent to which}} low <b>rail</b> <b>haulage</b> charges offset the other costs incurred. However, traffic will only be attracted to inter-modal in sufficient quantities to enable viable services to be provided over a limited number of long distance routes. These services must also approach, if not equal the competition in terms of quality of service attributes, particularly reliability, if they are to overcome customer resistance. To assess the distances over which these new inter-modal systems will be cost competitive a cost model has been developed. The paper decribes how the model works, and the sources from which data was obtained. A separate paper (Working Paper 276) reports on a study to find the value placed by shippers on quality of service attributes, and a third paper (Working Paper 286) brings the two together to reach conclusions on the future role of inter-modal systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is twofold: {{developing}} a method for analysis of the European combined transport industry as well as utilising the developed method to describe and analyse the industry. The second part of the purpose could also be stated as verifying the method, but the description and analysis is carried out somewhat more carefully than just for the purpose of verifying the method. After defining the phenomenon, the production and marketing sub-systems are described theoretically, while including certain disseminated empirical facts. Then, when the basics of European combined transport are familiar to the reader, the search for a conceptual framework is presented. Four literature sources are surveyed and evaluated for suitable approaches for the study and a synthesised method is presented. The method starts out from the basic conceptions of the network approach: actors, activities and resources. Influences from the systems approach are used for adapting the approach to cover the entire combined transport system and not just a link between two companies that is the primary subject of the network approach. The industry analysis begins with the actors and presents empirical findings about organisation, activities and resources as structured running text. Tables are used for organising the empirical findings for each actor category. The summed up tables are used as the basis for a brief analysis of the competitive situation within the industry. The most important finding is that the railway administrations possess powerful positions through extensive ownership of other actors and through control of the critical activity of <b>rail</b> <b>haulage.</b> However, new EU legislation is already affecting the industry and will imply changes which enhance competition within the industry. Up until now competition has only applied to certain activities. The worked out method is regarded as suitable for the performed analysis, but more important is that a potential for further development is identified. More advanced coding in the tables allows for a deeper analysis covering such subjects as case studies along certain connections, dynamics in the division of activities and resources, market analysis as well as analyses focused on supplier relations within the industry...|$|E
40|$|The European {{transport}} policy {{has focused on}} sustainable transport solutions. One of its objectives for freight transport is to restore the balance between modes and to develop intermodality. Among {{the various types of}} intermodal transports, this research is concerned with rail-road container terminals embedded in a hub-and–spoke network. These terminals will further be referred to as hubs. Hub-and-spoke networks have been implemented in a number of transportation systems when it is favourable to consolidate and disseminate flows at certain locations called hubs. The efficiency of such a network depends on the location of the hubs. The problem is to find the optimal hub locations and to allocate the remaining nodes to these hubs. This problem is known as the p-hub median problem (p-HMP) where p is the number of hubs to locate. This location-allocation problem is proved to be NP-hard. The time needed to solve it increases as the number of nodes exponent three. Thus, in order to model rail-road transport on the trans-European networks, a subset of nodes that can be considered as good potential locations is needed. We applied the p-HMP to a set of potential locations obtained by both spatial aggregation of demand nodes using hierarchical clustering methods and by a flow-based approach which takes the flows of commodities and their geographic spread into account. They showed that the latest method gives better results and that is why it is retained to determine a set of potential locations. The set of potential locations is used as input for an iterative procedure. One of the main contributions of this research is to propose this iterative procedure based on both the p-HMP and the multi-modal assignment problem. Moreover, the objective function of our p-hub median formulation includes the costs for pre- and post-haulages by road, trans-shipment (according to the number of handled containers into account) and <b>rail</b> <b>haulage.</b> Furthermore, in the p-hub median problem, the total demand is assigned to the hubs. In this research however, the demand can be assigned over all the transportation modes, with the possibility (but not the obligation) of using the trans-shipment facilities. Finally, we presents a methodology able to compare road and rail-road intermodal market areas that takes the network structures, the operation costs and the location of the rail-road terminals into account. This methodology is applied to the optimal configurations obtained by the resolution of the p-HMP and the p-hub centre problem (p-HCP) for the whole trans-European network. Indeed, p-HMP has an efficiency goal by minimizing the total transportation cost. The hub network design obtained by this method can sometimes lead to unsatisfactory results when worst-case origin-destination pairs are separated by a very large distance. Therefore, the p-HCM meets the equity objective by minimizing the maximum cost of a combined transport...|$|E
40|$|The Hunter Valley coal {{supply chain}} (HVCC) {{is the system}} of {{logistics}} facilities - principally a network of rail track and three coal handling terminals - enabling coal mined by producers in the Hunter Valley to be transported, assembled, and loaded onto ships for export. The HVCC serves around 11 producers operating through more than 30 coal load points in the Hunter Valley, transporting coal over rail track extending around 450 km inland, managed by two track owner/operators, via rolling stock from four <b>rail</b> <b>haulage</b> providers that make around 22, 000 train trips for approximately 1, 400 vessels per year. The HVCC now delivers around 140 million tonnes of coal per annum (Mtpa), with the port of Newcastle exporting more coal by volume than any other facility in the world. The Hunter Valley Coal Chain Coordinator P/L (HVCCC) is the organization {{at the heart of}} this logistics operation. In a landmark for collaborative logistics, the HVCCC was established by HVCC stakeholders to plan and manage the valuable shared infrastructure of the system. The HVCCC provides a range of services vital to the planning and delivery of coal through the logistics system, with its core task to improve the capacity of the coal chain through a centralised planning process. One of the key ways in which this task is achieved is through the alignment of maintenance activities. All key assets in the HVCC (e. g. rail track sections, coal stacking machinery, terminal conveyor systems) undergo regular preventive maintenance, planned well in advance. While undergoing maintenance, an asset cannot function to deliver coal (or can function only with reduced capacity), thus reducing the capacity of the system. However astute scheduling of these planned maintenance activities releases latent capacity. Such astute scheduling is referred to as capacity or maintenance alignment, and is a core function of the HVCCC. The maintenance alignment process at the HVCCC is supported by a model of the system capacity, which quantifies the impact of maintenance activities on the system. This was originally achieved with the assistance of a manual model created in Microsoft Excel, which used as input the impact of each maintenance activity on key assets in the HVCC in terms of the reduction in tonnes per hour that the asset could handle. This was further developed by HVCCC in-house to the current production application known as the Annual Capacity Model (ACM), written in Microsoft C#. net stored in a Microsoft SQL database with business rules stored in Common Knowledge. This application, whilst fit for purpose, has limited scenario testing capability and no optimisation functionality. These issues were a catalyst for collaboration of the HVCCC with the University of Newcastle, leading to the development of two separate but symbiotic prototype optimisation applications: the Capacity Evaluator and the Maintenance Optimiser. The former builds on the model concepts and logic of the current HVCCC ACM to estimate system capacity for a given maintenance schedule. The latter reschedules maintenance activities so as to maximize system capacity. This paper focusses on the Capacity Evaluator (CE) application, and the recent enhancements to it that have facilitated its adoption. Based on a Linear Programming (LP) model, the CE constructs flows of coal over time so as to maximize total throughput, and offers new features, such as the ability to integrate in-bound and out-bound flows of coal at the terminal stockyards and account for greater complexity in the rail network. However the LP technology also presents new challenges: multiple optimal LP solutions mean that minor changes in input data can result in major variations in patterns of flow observed in the solutions. This paper reports on how this challenge was converted to an opportunity: flexibility in optimal solutions is exploited in a multiobjective approach to achieve flows consistent with contractual targets, while sacrificing little or nothing in terms of throughput. Both the mathematical modelling and decision support processes needed to achieve this, and to ensure the tool is fit for purpose, are described...|$|E
