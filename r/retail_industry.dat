40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} detailed analysis of the impact of foreign direct investments on the Indian economy, specifically the <b>retailing</b> <b>industry.</b> The Indian <b>retailing</b> <b>Industry</b> has of late been {{recognized as one of the}} sunrise sectors in the economy, attracting a lot of foreign investments. With this research, I analyze the prospects of these foreign investors and the impact their investments would have on the Indian economy, the consumers and the <b>retailing</b> <b>industry.</b> An overview of the Indian <b>retailing</b> <b>industry</b> and FDI explains the current scenario of retailing in India. Interviews of retailers, focus group interviews with customers and a case study on Wal-Mart provides empirical evidence to explain the impact of FDI. The Indian <b>retailing</b> <b>industry</b> has seen many changes in its structure, development and growth over the past few years. Also, India as a country has undergone remarkable international integration and was ranked second as the global business destination in 2005. Thus, it becomes important to study the impact of foreign inflows as it has important policy implications...|$|R
