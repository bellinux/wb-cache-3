40|$|Un-nipped <b>roll</b> <b>covers</b> {{have often}} been {{considered}} “non technical ” <b>roll</b> <b>covers</b> in the paper machine and for {{more than thirty years}} little has been done to improve the performance or attributes of these <b>roll</b> <b>covers.</b> This lack of advancement is due largely in part to the misconception that un-nipped <b>roll</b> <b>covers</b> do not have a direct affect on the art of papermaking or the quality of paper, yet they typically represent 80 % or more of the <b>covered</b> <b>rolls</b> in a paper machine. They seemingly perform a modest task, to carry the web, wire, pulp, felt and sheet from the head box to the reel. While the task may appear modest, it is also fundamentally important.

50|$|Two basic corona treater {{stations}} {{are used in}} extrusion coating applications. Bare <b>Roll</b> and <b>Covered</b> <b>Roll.</b> On a Bare Roll treater station the dielectric encapsulates the electrode. On a <b>Covered</b> <b>Roll</b> station it encapsulates the treater base roll. The treater consists of an electrode and a base roll in both stations. In theory a <b>Covered</b> <b>Roll</b> treater is generally used to treat non-conductive webs, and a Bare Roll treater is used to treat conductive webs. However, manufacturers who treat a variety of substrates on the same production line may choose to use a Bare Roll treater.|$|R

5000|$|Jeff, Greg and Jerry were by {{this time}} already {{performing}} as a rock and <b>roll</b> <b>cover</b> band called The Vaguest Notion. On September 6, 1968 they traveled to Seattle to attend a Jimi Hendrix concert. [...] One of the opening acts for the concert was a British band called The Soft Machine. [...] The Soft Machine was a trio (consisting {{at the time of}} Kevin Ayers, Robert Wyatt and Mike Ratledge) but with an entirely new sound. The boys left the concert determined to pursue a new direction.|$|E

5000|$|Musically, A Hard Day's Night eschews {{the rock}} and <b>roll</b> <b>cover</b> songs of the band's {{previous}} albums for a predominantly pop sound. Sputnikmusic's Dave Donnelly observes [...] "short, peppy" [...] pop songs characterised by layered vocals, immediate choruses, and understated instrumentation. According to Pitchfork Media's Tom Ewing, the lack {{of rock and roll}} covers allows listeners to [...] "take the group's new sound purely on its own modernist terms", with audacious [...] "chord choices", powerful harmonies, [...] "gleaming" [...] guitar, and [...] "Northern" [...] harmonica. Music journalist Robert Christgau writes that Lennon-McCartney's songs were [...] "more sophisticated musically" [...] than before.|$|E

The single release of [...] "Sweet Emotion" [...] became a minor hit on the Billboard Hot 100 reaching #36 in 1975 and [...] "Walk This Way" [...] reached #10 on the Hot 100 in 1977. The album also introduced to contemporary audiences a rock n' <b>roll</b> <b>cover</b> of [...] "Big Ten Inch Record," [...] which was originally an old R&B song recorded by Bull Moose Jackson in 1952. Rather than produce a rock reimagining, Aerosmith's cover largely stays true to the original song, down to its jazz-style instrumentation.|$|E
50|$|Extended Nip Presses (or ENP) are a {{relatively}} modern alternative to conventional roll presses. The top roll {{is usually a}} standard roll, while the bottom roll is actually a large CC roll with an extended shoe curved {{to the shape of}} the top roll, surrounded by a rotating rubber belt rather than a standard <b>roll</b> <b>cover.</b> The goal of the ENP is to extend the dwell time of the sheet between the two rolls thereby maximising the de-watering. Compared to a standard roll press that achieves up to 35% solids after pressing, an ENP brings this up to 45% and higher—delivering significant steam savings or speed increases. ENPs densify the sheet, thus increasing tensile strength and some other physical properties.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1979, Caravello {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} a four-piece rock 'n' <b>roll</b> <b>cover</b> band called Flasher.

[...] "...we were making real (lousy) money - something like $10, $7 a night, whatever it was it was. Really, really terrible.
