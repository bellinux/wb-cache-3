5000|$|At the outset, the {{governance}} of the College was {{in the hands of}} the Ladies Committee (comprising some influential women) and the General Committee made up of the Ladies, the professors of the college and three trustees. The General Committee (later the Council) soon took over the running of the College, while the Ladies Committee directed the work of the Lady Visitors, who were responsible for the welfare and discipline of the students, and also acted as their chaperones. Initially the professors were shocked by the generally low educational standards of the women entering the college, who for the most part came in having had home-based governess education. In response to this, Reid founded a school close to the college in 1853 in an attempt to provide a better standard of entry. In 1860, the college expanded into 48 Bedford Square which enabled it to become a <b>residential</b> <b>establishment.</b> [...] "The Residence" [...] was under the charge of a matron, who introduced the practice of students helping towards the running of the house and keeping their own accounts.|$|E

40|$|In 2007 / 8 a PRI {{subgroup}} developed protocols on how community, {{voluntary and}} statutory services could {{work together with}} GPs to provide methadone and benzodiazepine community detoxes with wrap-around medical and psycho-social supports. These protocols have been established {{with the intention of}} ensuring that individuals who wish to detox without attending a <b>residential</b> <b>establishment,</b> or in preparation for attending one (as methadone prescriptions need to be reduced to 30 – 50 mls before admittance), will have appropriate supports. Best practice in the U. K states that for community detox to be effective ‘clear referral criteria and entry points’ need to be established in policy. In the Irish / local context the advantages of clear and consistent systems for clients to request and engage in outpatient detox may be beneficial in further establishing community detox as a formalised progression pathway. The Scottish experience also highlights the need for integrated care management and the need for the involvement of multiple agencies in a co-ordinated manner. U. K guidelines also recommend that clients ‘should play {{an active role in the}} monitoring of their own health and healthcare' (Guide 5 – Community Detox. Effective Interventions Unit, Substance Misuse Division, Scottish Executive). The protocols provide guidance on stakeholder roles and responsibilities, including those of the Service User, GP and Key Worker or Case Manager. It’s important to note that detox brings serious risks of intolerance and overdose, and requires careful clinical assessment as well as cohesive social supports and a clear care plan...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the development}} of social work {{during the twentieth century}} by examining the life history of one <b>residential</b> <b>establishment,</b> Turners Court, founded in 1911. The objective is to explain how ideals and policies are translated into action, by conducting an historical analysis of an organisation that attained some prominence in its field. The thesis sets out evidence to demonstrate that once created, institutions attain an identity and set of values and beliefs of their own, verified through their contribution and response to policy developments. The research draws on insights from current thinking about the macro-micro relationship, relating these to social policy by deploying and evaluating Layder's (1993) multi-perspectival approach that urges greater attention to power, history and general social theory. Turners Court has distinctive features that commend it as a case study. It began as a 'colony' providing men with agricultural training. Its foundations reflected a mix of motives, ranging from the evangelistic to the eugenic. By the 1960 s it claimed to be a pioneering institution, yet by the 1980 s a substantial contraction in the residential care sector had been set in motion, for reasons analysed in the thesis. In 1991, Turners Court, a 'therapeutic' training establishment for boys aged 14 - 16, closed. Based on a systematic analysis of archive material, a model of congruence is devised, indicating areas that need to fit for organisations to be created and to survive. Discongruity in these areas is offered to explain their demise. The history of Turners Court, as a microcosm of the history of residential social work, indicates a need to review social policy theory in a way that recognises the importance Of the interplay of macro and micro factors. In particular, more attention needs to be paid to the role of values and belief systems...|$|E

There were some incidents of sexual abuse of girl residents in these establishments but they were comparatively rare." [...] As well as physical abuse and the unacceptable use of force, there was [...] "widespread sexual abuse, including buggery." [...] The public version of the report named and criticised almost 200 people, for either abusing children or failing to offer them sufficient protection. Although it identified 28 alleged perpetrators, many names were redacted due to either pending prosecutions or lack of evidence. The report stated:The report found no evidence [...] "to establish {{that there was a}} wide-ranging conspiracy involving prominent persons and others with the objective of sexual activity with children in care", but did recognise the existence of a paedophile ring in the Wrexham and Chester area.|$|R

50|$|Although {{this policy}} has been {{attributed}} to the Margaret Thatcher government in the 1980s, community care was not a new idea. As a policy it had been around since the early 1950s. Its general aim was a more cost-effective way of helping people with mental health problems and physical disabilities, by removing them from impersonal, often Victorian, institutions, and caring for them in their own homes. Since the 1950s various governments had been attracted to the policy of community care. Despite support for the policy, the number of in-patients in large hospitals and <b>residential</b> <b>establishments</b> continued to increase. At the same time, public opinion was gradually turned against long-stay institutions by allegations from the media. Some might argue that such allegations were politically driven and that the deliberate underfunding, mismanagement and thus undermining of some institutions by the government was used as an excuse by the government to shut them down. It could also be argued that although there might have been incidents of where care should have been improved, the care in many such institutions may have been satisfactory or good.|$|R
