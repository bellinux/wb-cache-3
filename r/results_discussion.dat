50|$|A thesis (or dissertation) may be {{arranged}} as a thesis by publication or a monograph, {{with or without}} appended papers, respectively, though many graduate programs allow candidates to submit a curated collection of published papers. An ordinary monograph has a title page, an abstract, a table of contents, comprising the various chapters (e.g., introduction, literature review, methodology, <b>results,</b> <b>discussion),</b> and a bibliography or (more usually) a references section. They differ in their structure {{in accordance with the}} many different areas of study (arts, humanities, social sciences, technology, sciences, etc.) and the differences between them. In a thesis by publication, the chapters constitute an introductory and comprehensive review of the appended published and unpublished article documents.Dissertations normally report on a research project or study, or an extended analysis of a topic. The structure of a thesis or dissertation explains the purpose, the previous research literature which impinges on the topic of the study, the methods used and the findings of the project. Most world universities use a multiple chapter format : a) an introduction, which introduces the research topic, the methodology, as well as its scope and significance; b) a literature review, reviewing relevant literature and showing how this has informed the research issue; c) a methodology chapter, explaining how the research has been designed and why the research methods/population/data collection and analysis being used have been chosen; d) a findings chapter, outlining the findings of the research itself; e) an analysis and discussion chapter, analysing the findings and discussing them {{in the context of the}} literature review (this chapter is often divided into two—analysis and discussion); f) a conclusion.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the use and {{discourse}} functions of context frame markers in the <b>result</b> and <b>discussion</b> section of research articles across four disciplines. Sixteen <b>result</b> and <b>discussion</b> sections from four disciplines, namely, English Language Teaching, Economics, Biology, and Civil Engineering (four from each discipline) were analysed by adapting Gosden’s (1992) taxonomy. Findings showed disciplinary differences {{in relation to the}} realisation of the context frame types, frequencies, and associated discourse functions. These differences in terms of types, frequencies, and discourse functions of context frames are imposed {{by the nature of the}} rhetorical section of <b>result</b> and <b>discussion,</b> the nature of the discipline, and both the nature of rhetorical section of <b>result</b> and <b>discussion</b> and the discipline, respectively. Findings suggest that context frames are an important means which the writer uses to deliver claims and arguments in <b>results</b> and <b>discussion.</b> As a <b>result</b> of the dictums imposed by the generic RA section and the nature of the discipline, marked disciplinary differences are found in the writing endeavour...|$|R
