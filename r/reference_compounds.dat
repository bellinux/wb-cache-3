50|$|The amidicity {{scale is}} a {{computational}} method for calculating {{the strength of}} an amide bond in an organic compound on a linear scale. It is analogous to aromaticity. It {{is based on the}} computed enthalpy of hydrogenation when compared to the <b>reference</b> <b>compounds</b> dimethylacetamide and azaadamantane-2-one. If an amidicity value is close to 100%, then the compound has very good amidic character (and is perfect at 100%); if the value is close to, or below, 0%, then the compound has a lack of amidic character. The scale is not restricted to these values; compounds with weaker amide bonds than azaadamantane-2-one will have amidicities below 0%, whilst compounds with stronger amide bonds than dimethylacetamide will have amidicities of above 100%. If the amidicity value is altered during an acylation, then this will act as a key thermodynamic component of the reaction.|$|E
50|$|Modeling {{has become}} a common used tool to predict modes of toxic action in the last decade. The models are based in Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs), which are {{mathematical}} models that relate the biological activity of molecules to their chemical structures and corresponding chemical and physicochemical properties. QSARs can then predict modes of toxic action of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to <b>reference</b> <b>compounds</b> with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures. Russom and colleagues {{were one of the}} first group of researchers being able to classify modes of toxic action with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of toxic action, chemicals having multiple modes of toxic action can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.|$|E
50|$|Gas {{chromatography}} (GC) {{coupled to}} mass spectrometry (MS) {{is one of}} the most widespread routine technologies applied to the large scale screening and discovery of novel biomarkers in metabolomics. However, the majority of MSTs currently measured in plant metabolomic profiling experiments remains unidentified due to the lack of authenticated pure reference substances and the expensive and time-consuming effort to maintain mass spectral RI libraries required for compound identification by GC-MS.As the communication of analytical results and other approach-related details such as mass spectral and RI reference information within the scientific community is becoming increasingly popular, open access platforms for information exchange, such as the GMD, are obligatory.Due to the lack of mandatory standards it remains difficult to compare individual mass spectrums. While the different mass detector technologies, namely quadrupole, ion trap and time of flight, can be deemed irrelevant, the chromatography settings such as temperature programming, type of capillary column and choice of column manufacturer heavily affect the empirically determined RI properties. Procedures for the transfer of RI properties between chromatography variants are, therefore, highly relevant for a shared library use. The GMD assesses the accuracy of RI transfer between chromatography variants and implements means to transfer empirically determined RI properties.Aiming at the classification and identification of un-identified MSTs, the GMD accesses the information on available <b>reference</b> <b>compounds.</b> These compounds serve as training set of data to apply decision trees (DT) as a supervised machine learning approach. Structural feature extraction was applied to classify the metabolite space of the GMD prior to DT training. DT-based predictions of the most frequent substructures classify low resolution GC-MS mass spectra of the linked (potentially unknown) metabolite with respect to the presence or absence of the chemical moieties.The web-based frontend supports conventional mass spectral and RI comparison by ranked hit lists as well as advanced DT supported substructure prediction. Batch processing is enabled via Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)-based web services while web-based data access services expose particular data base entities adapting Representational State Transfer (ReST) principles and mass spectral standards such as NIST-MSP and JCAMP-DX.The GMD visualise quantitative metabolite pool size changes data.|$|E

The present study details a novel 3 -tier approach to develop a list of <b>reference</b> <b>compounds</b> to aid this process. The approach was based on 1) the inclusion of relevant chemical classes supported by high-quality in vivo data for the bioconcentration factor (BCF), whole-body biotransformation rates (Kmet), and metabolism characterization for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (tiers I and II); and 2) the refinement to ensure a broad coverage of hydrophobicity, bioconcentration potential, molecular weight, maximum molecular diameter, whole-body biotransformation half-lives, and metabolic pathways (tier III). In silico techniques were employed to predict maximal log BCF and molecular and metabolic properties. Of the 157 compounds considered as <b>reference</b> <b>compounds,</b> 144 were supported by high-quality BCF data, 8 were supported by Kmet data, and 5 were supported by in vivo metabolism data. Additional criteria for refinement of the list of <b>reference</b> <b>compounds</b> were suggested to aid practical implementation in experimental efforts.

However, searching these enormous knowledge reservoirs and integrating findings across heterogeneous sources is costly and difficult. Here we demonstrate how semantically integrated knowledge, extracted from biomedical {{literature and}} structured databases, {{can be used to}} automatically identify potential migraine biomarkers. Method: We used a knowledge graph containing more than 3. 5 million biomedical concepts and 68. 4 million relationships. Biochemical compound concepts were filtered and ranked by their potential as biomarkers based on their connections to a subgraph of migraine-related concepts. The ranked results were evaluated against the results of a systematic literature review that was performed manually by migraine researchers. Weight points were assigned to these <b>reference</b> <b>compounds</b> to indicate their relative importance. Results: Ranked results automatically generated by the knowledge graph were highly consistent with results from the manual literature review. Out of 222 <b>reference</b> <b>compounds,</b> 163 (73 %) ranked in the top 2000, with 547 out of the 644 (85 %) weight points assigned to the <b>reference</b> <b>compounds.</b> For <b>reference</b> <b>compounds</b> that were not {{in the top of the}} list, an extensive error analysis has been performed.
