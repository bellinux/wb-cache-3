5000|$|A {{number of}} other public {{transport}} modes are available in Dublin. The CIÉ-owned Dublin Bus is virtually ubiquitous, running all over the city. As such, it has many routes that run parallel to DART for stretches. However, {{it does not have}} any scheduled routes that traverse {{the entire length of the}} DART line. As in the rest of Ireland, integration of bus and rail services is very limited though there are some [...] "feeder bus" [...] routes for which it is possible to buy a through ticket valid for both the <b>rail</b> and bus <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the <b>journey.</b> Travel passes and integrated ticketing (Leap Cards) for DART, Luas and Dublin Bus services were introduced in 2011.|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} the train-track interaction forces is important for track performance evaluation. In the field calibration test as a wheel load measurement process, the calibration system creates a different boundary condi-tion in comparison with that in the train wheel passage. This study aims to evaluate a reliability of the field calibra-tion test {{in the process of}} wheel load measurement. Finite element models were developed to compare the deformed shapes, bending moment and shear force profiles on the <b>rail</b> <b>section.</b> The analysis results revealed that the deformed shapes and their associated bending moment profiles on the rail are significantly different in two numerical simula-tions of the calibration test and the train wheel load passage. However, the shear stress profile on the <b>rail</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the strain gauge installation in the field was almost identical, which may imply that the current calibration test is suf-ficiently reliable...|$|R
50|$|The Brahmaputra Mail {{is a daily}} train which connects Delhi with Dibrugarh (an {{important}} town {{in upper}} Assam). Introduced in 1972 after the construction <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the Farakka Barrage, the train originally ran as the Tinsukia Mail between Delhi Junction railway station and New Jalpaiguri railway stations, with onward meter gauge connections to Guwahati and Tinsukia in the Indian state of Assam. The train was renamed the Brahmaputra Mail after the successful conversion of the Guwahati - Dibrugarh meter gauge lines to broad gauge. This train belongs to Northern Railway (NR) zone of Indian Railways and operated and maintained by Delhi Division (DLI Division) of NR. The train is numbered as 14055/14056.|$|R

50|$|The {{track laying}} began on 2 September 2009 along a wide, grassy forest track. The track {{consisted}} of circular steel pipe of about 6mm wall thickness, welded to steel cross members {{which were in}} turn bolted to wooden sleepers. One side was fitted with a steel spike to engage with the next section. Thus, it fitted together {{very much like a}} toy railway, using preassembled track sections which are either straight or of fixed curvature. The track laying operation looked a bit like a child’s train set on a large scale. The rails, with sleepers ready attached, came in sections - straight or curved to suit their position. The tube and pin joints fitted together exactly as do the <b>rail</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the toy set.|$|R
50|$|Before the merge of fare {{systems on}} 28 September 2008, Octopus card users {{transferring}} between the West Rail Line and Tung Chung Line {{had to use}} the transfer gates separating fare areas the MTR and KCR systems. Once the card was placed on a reader, the first <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>journey</b> fare would be deducted and passengers could walk over to the other fare area. Passengers who accidentally walked to the wrong area by mistake had to exit the station through the exit gates (not the transfer gates) within 15 minutes, or an extra fare was charged.|$|R

50|$|The {{high-speed}} <b>rail</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the Shenzhen North Railway Station {{had repeatedly}} delayed the opening time. It changed {{from before the}} November 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games to December 28 and then changed to August 8, 2011 and again postponed to December 26, 2011. Influenced by the 2011 Wenzhou high-speed train rear-end accident, coupled with the Chinese government beginning {{to reflect on the}} construction of all high-speed rail, this caused a slow down in high-speed rail construction and other issues. On December 26, 2011 morning, the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express <b>Rail</b> Link's Guangzhou-Shenzhen <b>section,</b> opening ceremony was held in Shenzhen North Station, with the Minister of Railways Sheng Guangzu, the Guangdong Provincial Party Secretary Wang Yang, the former governor of Guangdong Province Huang Hua Hua and acting governor of Guangdong Zhu Xiaodan, who attended the ceremony.
