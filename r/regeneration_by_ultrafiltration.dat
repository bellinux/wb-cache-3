40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{endeavours}} towards a sustainable society {{have brought the}} interest of wood-based biorefineries to the fore. Lignin is the main energy carrier in chemical pulp mills. Today, the heat value of lignin is commonly recovered in the recovery boiler of the mill. However, interest in the extraction of lignin for use as an external biofuel and in speciality chemicals is growing. Lignosulphonates have been isolated <b>by</b> <b>ultrafiltration</b> from spent liquor in sulphite pulp mills for decades, whereas kraft lignin is mainly extracted by precipitation. The isolation of kraft lignin <b>by</b> <b>ultrafiltration</b> is currently attracting increasingly greater interest because lignin can be extracted from pulping liquors at almost all positions in a pulp mill using ceramic membranes, without altering the pH or temperature of the liquor. In this work hardwood lignin was recovered from two process streams in a kraft pulp mill <b>by</b> <b>Ultrafiltration</b> with a ceramic membrane with a cut-off of 15, 000 Da.

40|$|International audienceA {{modification}} of the original microdistillation assay for lysyl oxidase is described in which Amicon C- 10 microconcentrators are used to separate, <b>by</b> <b>ultrafiltration,</b> the 3 H-labeled products released from a [4, 5 - 3 H]-lysine-labeled elastin substrate. Enzyme activity is determined by scintillation counting of the ultrafiltrate, after subtraction of radioactivity released {{in the presence of}} beta-aminopropionitrile, a specific inhibitor of the enzyme. Conditions are described which optimize both the sensitivity and the efficient use of substrate. The assay shows linear inhibition of activity in up to 1 M urea; hence, as the enzyme is normally diluted in the assay, samples in 6 M urea can be assayed directly, without prior dialysis, and corrected for partial inhibition. Comparable results are obtained when enzyme activity is assayed <b>by</b> <b>ultrafiltration</b> or microdistillation. The assay is simple and convenient and, by using disposable containers throughout, it eliminates the need for time-consuming decontamination of radioactive glassware.
