40|$|Continuous short waves {{transmitted}} from Vostok Station (78 ° 28 ′S, 106 ° 48 ′E) were received at Syowa Station (69 ° 00 ′S, 39 ° 35 ′E) on monthly <b>Regular</b> <b>World</b> <b>Days</b> (RWDs). The transmitted frequencies were 14. 985 MHz from 0700 to 0900 UT and 9. 18 MHz from 1600 to 1800 UT. The cusp approached {{the midpoint of}} the circuit {{at the end of the}} UT morning transmission. Two kinds of Doppler structures were clearly recognized. Narrow band Doppler lines were consistently found during both morning and evening transmissions, whereas wide band Doppler structures dominated only in the morning. The wide band structures appeared and disappeared abruptly and sometimes had two spectrum peaks corresponding to velocities of separated irregularities around the midpoint. The narrow band structures still remained while the wide band structures changed spectrum shapes. Sawtooth-like Doppler structures were found in the narrow band lines in the morning transmissions...|$|E
40|$|An {{estimate}} of the topside proton concentration {{can be obtained by}} analyzing the incoherent scatter radar autocorrelation function from that region. Our observations at Arecibo, Puerto Rico indicate that the H+ to O+ composition transition height often occurs as low as 450 km during winter nights, near solar minimum. In the summer, the nighttime transition height is only slightly higher, near 600 km. This height is also affected by the level of magnetic activity. Maximum concentrations of H+ occur near 04 : 00 LT, with a minimum about twelve hours later. The observations of topside H+ were acquired during the past six years as part of the <b>Regular</b> <b>World</b> <b>Day</b> experiments, and from studies of the low latitude hydrogen geocorona. In particular, we will emphasize the results obtained during the solstice and equinox periods of the Thermospheric Mapping Study...|$|R
