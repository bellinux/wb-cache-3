5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger <b>region</b> <b>was</b> in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

This ensured almost complete control of Norwich trade by the merchants who now dominated the council.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Bengal was {{the site}} of several major janapadas. In the 2ndcentury BCE, the <b>region</b> <b>was</b> conquered by the emperor Ashoka. In the 4thcentury CE, it was absorbed into the Gupta Empire. From the 13thcentury onward, the <b>region</b> <b>was</b> ruled by several sultans, {{powerful}} Hindu states, and Baro-Bhuyan landlords, until the beginning of British rule in the 18thcentury. The British East India Company cemented their hold on the region following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, and Calcutta served for many years as the capital of British India. The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in an expansion of Western education, culminating in developments in science, institutional education, and social reforms in the region, including {{what became known as the}} Bengal Renaissance. A hotbed of the Indian independence movement through the early 20thcentury, Bengal was divided during India's independence in 1947 along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengala state of Indiaand East Bengalthe part of the newly created nation of Pakistan that later became Bangladesh. Between 1977 and 2011 the state was administered by the world's longest elected Communist government.|$|E
