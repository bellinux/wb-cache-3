5|$|The {{chemical}} changes {{associated with}} infection of a tumor or its surrounding tissue can cause rapidly escalating pain, but infection is sometimes overlooked {{as a possible}} cause. One study found that infection {{was the cause of}} pain in four percent of nearly 300 people with cancer who were <b>referred</b> <b>for</b> pain relief. Another report described seven people with cancer, whose previously well-controlled pain escalated significantly over several days. Antibiotic treatment produced pain relief in all of them within three days.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most of his}} contemporaries, Mani Ratnam did not assist {{anybody in}} film-making prior to {{entering}} the industry. He is credited with revolutionizing the Tamil film industry and is <b>referred</b> <b>for</b> bringing new dimension to the South Asian cinema. A majority of his films are characterized by a string of socio-political themes. Because of his idea of combining art and commercial elements, most of his films garnered both critical acclaim and commercial success. Nayagan, Bombay and Iruvar were inspired from real-life incidents, while Thalapathi and Raavan were based on Indian epics.|$|E

25|$|SMA {{syndrome}} {{was first}} described in 1861 by Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky in victims at autopsy, but remained pathologically undefined until 1927 when Wilkie published {{the first comprehensive}} series of 75 patients. According to a 1956 study, only 0.3% of patients <b>referred</b> <b>for</b> an upper-gastrointestinal-tract barium studies fit this diagnosis, {{making it one of}} the rarest gastrointestinal disorders known to medical science. Recognition of SMA syndrome as a distinct clinical entity is controversial, due in part to its possible confusion with a number of other conditions, though it is now widely acknowledged.|$|E

25|$|David Reimer {{was born}} in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He was {{originally}} named Bruce, and his identical twin was named Brian. At {{the age of six}} months, after concern was raised about how both of them urinated, the boys were diagnosed with phimosis. They were <b>referred</b> <b>for</b> circumcision at the age of seven months. On April 27, 1966, a urologist performed the operation using the unconventional method of cauterization, but the procedure did not go as doctors had planned, and Bruce's penis was burned beyond surgical repair. The doctors chose not to operate on Brian, whose phimosis soon cleared without surgical intervention.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 10% of all birth defects are caused by prenatal exposure to a teratogenic agent. These exposures include, {{but are not limited}} to, medication or drug exposures, maternal infections and diseases, and environmental and occupational exposures. Paternal smoking use has also been linked to an increased risk of birth defects and childhood cancer for the offspring, where the paternal germline undergoes oxidative damage due to cigarette use. Teratogen-caused birth defects are potentially preventable. Studies have shown that nearly 50% of pregnant women have been exposed to at least one medication during gestation. During pregnancy, a female can also be exposed to teratogens from the contaminated clothing or toxins within the seminal fluid of a partner. An additional study found that of 200 individuals <b>referred</b> <b>for</b> genetic counseling for a teratogenic exposure, 52% were exposed to more than one potential teratogen.|$|E

500|$|Because comorbid {{conditions}} such as OCD and ADHD can be more impairing than tics, these conditions are included in an evaluation of patients presenting with tics. [...] "It is critical {{to note that the}} comorbid conditions may determine functional status more strongly than the tic disorder," [...] according to Samuel Zinner, MD. The initial assessment of a patient <b>referred</b> <b>for</b> a tic disorder should include a thorough evaluation, including a family history of tics, ADHD, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and other chronic medical, psychiatric and neurological conditions. Children and adolescents with TS who have learning difficulties are candidates for psychoeducational testing, particularly if the child also has ADHD. Undiagnosed comorbid conditions may result in functional impairment, and it is necessary to identify and treat these conditions to improve functioning. Complications may include depression, sleep problems, social discomfort, self-injury, anxiety, personality disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorders.|$|E
500|$|Helmsley {{was being}} {{highlighted}} again in 1997, winning the 1997 King of the Ring tournament by defeating Mankind in the finals. Later that year, Shawn Michaels, Helmsley, Chyna and Rick Rude formed D-Generation X (DX). This stable became known for pushing the envelope, as Michaels and Helmsley made risqué promos – using the catchphrase [...] "Suck It" [...] and a [...] "crotch chop" [...] hand motion, – and sarcastically derided Bret Hart and Canada. By that point, Helmsley had fully dropped the [...] "blueblood snob" [...] gimmick, appearing in T-shirts and leather jackets. During this period, his ring name was shortened to simply Triple H, {{even though he}} would still be <b>referred</b> <b>for</b> a while as Helmsley {{from time to time}} and Hunter for the rest of his career. Even after the DX versus Hart Foundation storyline ended, he continued to feud with the sole remaining Hart family member Owen over the European Championship. This ended in a match between the two at WrestleMania XIV, with the stipulation that Chyna had to be handcuffed to then-Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter. Triple H won after Chyna threw powder into Slaughter's eyes, momentarily [...] "blinding" [...] him and allowing her to interfere in the match.|$|E

500|$|Francis Galton (1822–1911) was {{a pioneer}} in {{investigating}} both eminent human achievement and mental testing. In his book Hereditary Genius, writing before the development of IQ testing, he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong, and that eminence is rare in the general population. Lewis Terman chose near' genius or genius" [...] as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford–Binet test. By 1926, Terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of California schoolchildren who were <b>referred</b> <b>for</b> IQ testing by their schoolteachers, called Genetic Studies of Genius, which he conducted {{for the rest of}} his life. Catherine M. Cox, a colleague of Terman's, wrote a whole book, The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses, published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series, in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses. Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds, Cox's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius. By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford–Binet test, Terman no longer used the term [...] "genius" [...] as an IQ classification, nor has any subsequent IQ test. In 1939, Wechsler specifically commented that [...] "we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score." ...|$|E
