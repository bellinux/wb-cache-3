5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{interviews}} {{for a job}} in Philadelphia, where she finds her potential manager, Mark (Bob Odenkirk), is remarkably like her former Dunder Mifflin regional manager Michael Scott. While this initially amuses her, Pam gradually realizes that the prospect of working under another Michael Scott is abhorrent, and her horror increases when Mark reveals that she is interviewing for a glorified receptionist's job. During a romantic dinner, Pam finally admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that even had the prospective job and boss been perfect she would not have wanted to take it, since she does not <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> move to Philadelphia, despite Jim having started his own business there.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing {{using a combination of}} personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E

5|$|Sardou's five-act play La Tosca {{contains}} {{a large amount}} of dialogue and exposition. While the broad details of the play are present in the opera's plot, the original work contains many more characters and much detail not present in the opera. In the play the lovers are portrayed as though they were French: the character Floria Tosca is closely modelled on Bernhardt's personality, while her lover Cavaradossi, of Roman descent, is born in Paris. Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, the playwright who joined the project to polish the verses, needed not only to cut back the play drastically, but to make the characters' motivations and actions suitable for Italian opera. Giacosa and Puccini repeatedly clashed over the condensation, with Giacosa feeling that Puccini did not <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> complete the project.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Portuguese {{authorities}} {{were in a}} state of panic. At first, the Prince Regent had been convinced that Napoleon did not <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> depose him. As the emperor's hostile intentions became more clear, John declared war on the United Kingdom on 20 October and seized the few remaining British subjects on 8 November. Nevertheless, disturbing reports began to arrive in Lisbon of Junot's march across Spain. Despite these events, John's government failed to mobilize the Portuguese regular army or call out the militia to defend the realm. Soon after, Admiral Sidney Smith appeared off Lisbon with a British squadron and declared that the port was under blockade. The British were worried about the presence in Lisbon of a Russian squadron under Admiral Dmitry Senyavin and alarmed that the Portuguese fleet in Lisbon might fall into Napoleon's hands, which would mean that 14 Ships of the line, 11 Frigates, and 7 smaller vessels would have joined the French Navy.|$|E
25|$|The obituaries {{shortly after}} Lawrence's death were, with the {{exception}} of the one by E. M. Forster, unsympathetic or hostile. However, there were those who articulated a more favourable recognition of the significance of this author's life and works. For example, his long-time friend Catherine Carswell summed up his life in a letter to the periodical Time and Tide published on 16 March 1930. In response to his critics, she claimed:"In the face of formidable initial disadvantages and lifelong delicacy, poverty that lasted for three quarters of his life and hostility that survives his death, he did nothing that he did not <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, and all that he most wanted to do he did. He went all over the world, he owned a ranch, he lived in the most beautiful corners of Europe, and met whom he wanted to meet and told them that they were wrong and he was right. He painted and made things, and sang, and rode. He wrote something like three dozen books, of which even the worst page dances with life that could be mistaken for no other man's, while the best are admitted, even by those who hate him, to be unsurpassed. Without vices, with most human virtues, the husband of one wife, scrupulously honest, this estimable citizen yet managed to keep free from the shackles of civilization and the cant of literary cliques. He would have laughed lightly and cursed venomously in passing at the solemn owls—each one secretly chained by the leg—who now conduct his inquest. To do his work and lead his life in spite of them took some doing, but he did it, and long after they are forgotten, sensitive and innocent people—if any are left—will turn Lawrence's pages and will know from them what sort of a rare man Lawrence was."Aldous Huxley also defended Lawrence in his introduction to a collection of letters published in 1932. However, the most influential advocate of Lawrence's literary reputation was Cambridge literary critic F. R. Leavis, who asserted that the author had made an important contribution to the tradition of English fiction. Leavis stressed that The Rainbow, Women in Love, and the short stories and tales were major works of art. Later, the obscenity trials over the unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover in America in 1959, and in Britain in 1960, and subsequent publication of the full text, ensured Lawrence's popularity (and notoriety) with a wider public.|$|E

500|$|Cher {{signed with}} Liberty Records' Imperial imprint {{in the end}} of 1964, and Sonny became her producer. The single [...] "Dream Baby", {{released}} under the name [...] "Cherilyn", received airplay in Los Angeles. Encouraged by Imperial, Cher worked with Sonny on her second solo single on the label, a cover version of Bob Dylan's [...] "All I <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do", which peaked at number 15 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1965. Meanwhile, the Byrds had released their own version of the same song. When competition on the singles charts started between Cher and the Byrds, the group's record label began to promote the B-side of the Byrds' single. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds commented, [...] "We loved the Cher version... We didn't want the hassle. So we just turned our record over." [...] Cher's debut album, All I <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do (1965), reached number 16 on the Billboard 200; it was later described by AllMusic's Tim Sendra as [...] "one of the stronger folk-pop records of the era".|$|E

500|$|In May, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) was released.

At Durst's insistence, the album was released as an underground album, without any advertising or promotion.

500|$|The Byrds' next single was [...] "All I <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do", another {{interpretation}} of a Dylan song. [...] Despite the success of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the Byrds were reluctant to release another Dylan-penned single, feeling {{that it was too}} formulaic, but Columbia Records were insistent, believing that another Dylan cover would result in an instant hit for the group. [...] The Byrds' rendition of [...] "All I <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do" [...] is noticeably different in structure to Dylan's original: it features an ascending melody progression in the chorus and utilizes a completely new melody for one of the song's verses, in order {{to turn it into a}} Beatlesque, minor-key bridge. [...] Issued on June 14, 1965, while [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] was still climbing the U.S. charts, the single was rush-released by Columbia in an attempt to bury a rival cover version that Cher had released simultaneously on Imperial Records. [...] A chart battle ensued, but the Byrds' rendition stalled at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, while Cher's version reached number 15. [...] The reverse was true in the UK, however, where the Byrds' version reached number 4, while Cher's peaked at number 9.|$|E
