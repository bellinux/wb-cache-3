The PC-R-SC considered it necessary for member States to align their <b>respective</b> <b>legislations</b> and to adopt efficient measures to investigate offences, to take provisional measures and to confiscate the instruments and fruits of illegal activity. Although this did not entail a complete harmonisation of States’ legislation, it did require States to find ways and means to enable them to co-operate more effectively.|$|R
40|$|Two {{difficulties}} {{arise when}} different jurisdictions have value added taxes at different rates. First, "magnification effect" {{which consists of}} an automatic enlargement of the rate differential {{over and above the}} one established by the <b>respective</b> <b>legislations.</b> Second, a fraud known as "invoice sightseeing" which takes place when sales in one jurisdiction are declared as sales to a fictitious customer in a lower rate jurisdiction. This paper shows that either both or one of these difficulties will unavoidably appear if the jurisdictions adopt different VAT rates. Under certain arrangements, like the zero rate treatment for interjurisdictional transactions, the magnification effect disappears, but the incentives to perform "invoice sightseeing" are still present. Other arrangements are suggested under which such incentives disappear, but the magnification effect does not. Thus, the policy choice is to select a VAT procedure such that its effects upon economic efficiency and revenue are least damaging.

40|$|The UDRIVE project {{intends to}} carry out a Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) which is not meant to {{evaluate}} certain technical functions or in-vehicle prototype systems but it focuses on naturalistic driving in public traffic. It is intended to collect and process video data by means of cameras installed in the study vehicles. So the UDRIVE project will include the collection and processing of data referring to the driver, possibly referring to passengers in the vehicle and possibly referring to other road users outside the study vehicle. The issues legally relevant for study execution (data privacy, criminal law, liabilities, ethical approval – if applicable) are not only subject to EU legislation but still are subject to national legislation and, accordingly, will differ to some degree between the EU Member States. Work Package (WP) 1. 3 called “Recommendations on Legal Issues” and has elaborated recommendations specifically focussed on those legal areas that should be addressed by an agreement with the study participants, thereby leaving it open how this should be done in detail. Therefore, WP 1. 3 has included the identification of subject matters to be regulated in the respective agreements as well as recommendations concerning the contents of those agreements. The latter had {{to take into account the}} aspect that the details of the <b>respective</b> national <b>legislations</b> of the Operation Sites (OS) may vary and differ considerably. Consequently, the recommendations cannot cover the different national legal specifics in detail. Hence, before data collection starts, it is recommended to consider and adapt the issues identified at the level of OS, taking into account the specific features of the <b>respective</b> national <b>legislation.</b> It is thereby recommended to involve legal experts at national level. The document at hand prepares the legal issues of relevance for participant agreements by combining knowledge on the technical and legal context. This will allow for speedy adaptation to national specifics. It is pointed out that not all legal issues that might occur in the UDRIVE project can be addressed by means of participants´ agreements. Other legal issues need be taken care of independently during project execution...|$|R
