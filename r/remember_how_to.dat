25|$|A {{parallel}} {{phenomenon has}} appeared involving {{the increased use}} of input methods to write Chinese characters and the difficulty of remembering such a large set of characters. The use of word processors allows the user to write using characters that the user does not <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> write by hand. This resulted in the reappearance in the 1980s in Japan of complex older characters which had been removed from the official lists. The number of characters available for use on a word processor far exceeds the number of characters a person can readily <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> write by hand. While many have blamed the use of input methods for difficulty remembering how to write the characters by hand, widespread use of input methods may be responsible for a reversal in the decline of kanji use in Japan.|$|E

Reduce {{the race to}} the size of a small town and how many residents will <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make plastic? The last Americans plunder canned goods (with little respect for sell-by dates), and literacy atrophies; electrical and water systems break down.

25|$|An {{important}} {{finding in}} amnesic patients with MTL damage is the impairment of memory in all sensory modalities – sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight. This {{reflects the fact}} that the MTL is a processor for all of the sensory modalities, and helps store these kind of thoughts into memory. In addition, subjects can often <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> perform relatively simple tasks immediately (on the order of 10 seconds), but when the task becomes more difficult, even on the same time scale, subjects tend to forget. This demonstrates the difficulty of separating procedural memory tasks from declarative memory; some elements of declarative memory may be used in learning procedural tasks.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{characters}} are a logographic form of writing, where {{the form of}} the character is not always directly related to its pronunciation. The {{characters are}} composed of a combination of 8–11 standard strokes, over a hundred common radicals, and hundreds of phonetic components. The characters can be very complex and learning them is a highly neuro-muscular task, meaning {{that it is difficult to}} <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> write the characters without repetitive practice in writing them by hand. Scientific studies have also shown that while reading utilizes diverse areas of the brain, reading Chinese makes unique usage of distinct parts of the frontal and temporal areas of the brain associated with motor memory, areas associated with handwriting.|$|E
25|$|Walter Raleigh's 1595 {{journey with}} Antonio de Berrio had aimed to reach Lake Parime in the {{highlands}} of Guyana (the supposed location of El Dorado at the time). He was encouraged by the account of Juan Martinez, believed to be Juan Martin de Albujar, who had taken part in Pedro de Silva's expedition of the area in 1570, only {{to fall into the}} hands of the Caribs of the Lower Orinoco. Martinez claimed that he was taken to the golden city in blindfold, was entertained by the natives, and then left the city and couldn't <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> return. Raleigh had set many goals for his expedition, and believed he had a genuine chance at finding the so-called city of gold. First, he wanted to find the mythical city of El Dorado, which he suspected to be an actual Indian city named Manõa. Second, he hoped to establish an English presence in the Southern Hemisphere that could compete with that of the Spanish. His third goal was to create an English settlement in the land called Guyana, and to try to reduce commerce between the natives and Spaniards.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, {{procedural}} memory (or implicit memory) {{is not based}} on the conscious recall of information, but on implicit learning. It can best be summarized as <b>remembering</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do something. Procedural memory is primarily employed in learning motor skills and should be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition - no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in motor learning depends on the cerebellum and basal ganglia.|$|R
500|$|Like breaking, the {{different}} moves within the funk styles occurred {{due to the}} formation of crews. Don [...] "Campbellock" [...] Campbell created locking, and in 1973 founded The Lockers (originally called The Cambellock Dancers) in Los Angeles. Locking is characterized by consistently freezing or [...] "locking" [...] in place while dancing. Campbell developed locking accidentally while pausing in between dance moves when trying to <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do the Funky Chicken.

500|$|Vig started doubting {{it could}} be done fully analog once the tapes for the first song recorded, [...] "Miss the Misery", started falling apart, but Grohl {{reassured}} him [...] "no, Butch, I don't want any computer in this house at all." [...] The producer said that during recording he [...] "had to force my brain to fire different synapses" [...] to <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with the analog equipment and the lack of a digital display. One of the habits Vig had to call back was editing using a razor blade—"I {{used to be able to}} do 20 edits in half an hour if need be. It took me about 20 minutes to do the first edit!"—a technique he employed for the first songs recorded. Eventually he gave up and decided to punch in and punch out tapes instead, as the process was time-consuming and a more editable tape sent to Vig from Smart Studios was mostly ruined by one of Grohl's daughters. While many recordings had inserts and some parts rerecorded, the only song that had to be redone from scratch was [...] "I Should Have Known", as Grohl felt Vig was [...] "trying to make this into a radio single" [...] when the singer wanted it [...] "to sound really raw and primal".|$|E

2500|$|While {{some claim}} that phone text {{messaging}} {{is the primary}} cause of character amnesia, the phenomenon, at least in Japan, appears to originate with widespread use of word processors. An article in the Asahi Shimbun from 23 September 1985, reports that students were finding it increasingly difficult to <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> write even quite simple kanji by hand since the full-scale introduction of word processors at a university campus in Isehara. A 1993 survey of members of the Information Processing Society of Japan found that habitual word processor users reported declining ability to write characters by hand.

He arrived to Earth via his spaceship {{run by an}} artificial intelligence named Jan Pu, but crash lands on the surface where Hazumu is, killing him instantly. Hitoshi rectifies this by regenerating Hazumu, but unexpectedly changes his physical sex in the process. This is a mystery to Hitoshi for some time until he is finally able to confirm that Hazumu's [...] "life grain" [...] count is slowly dissipating, {{and by the time}} Hitoshi confirms this, Hazumu only has one month left to live. Hitoshi originally came to Earth as a cultural anthropologist and to study the emotions of the human race since his species has long-since given up any emotion at all. Hitoshi recounts that {{at the peak of his}} people's civilization, they had discovered the means to destroy all life in the entire universe instantly, so in order to prevent this from ever happening, his people chose to discard their emotions. However, even after becoming a calm, logical race where emotional clashes such as violence and war disappeared completely, his people also started to lose their sexual urges in order to propagate his species further. In their current situation, if something is not done soon, his entire species will soon become extinct, which is why he is on Earth to find a way to save his species. He arrives at the conclusion that his species needs to <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> love each other in order to survive, so love becomes a focus of his research. In order to observe humans more closely, along with Hazumu and her ongoing relationship with Yasuna and Tomari, Hitoshi starts working at Hazumu's school as a biology teacher, and inadvertently becomes the target of Namiko's extreme affections.|$|E
