Ideally the riding school bus will include at least 1 adult ‘driver’, who leads the group, and an adult ‘conductor' who supervises {{from the end of the}} group.|$|E
50|$|This unique {{concept of}} {{going around the}} world by human power first came as a wild idea to Stevie Smith as he worked {{in his office in}} Paris. He soon set about making the idea a reality and got the help of his friend Jason Lewis who agreed to come with him. The pair set about {{spreading}} the idea, and began to raise money for a pedal boat built by Chris Tipper and Hugo Burnham. The specially-built boat was named Moksha, Sanskrit for freedom. To raise cash Stevie cycled to Marrakesh, Morocco. The pair had no formal training in either cycling or <b>riding</b> <b>pedal</b> boats.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 08 th. Feb 2018. Objective: Increased {{numbers of people}} <b>riding</b> <b>pedal</b> cycles {{has led to a}} greater focus on pedal cycle safety. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore factors that are {{associated}} with fatal and a small number of serious injury pedal cyclist crashes involving trucks that occurred in London between 2007 and 2011. Methods: Data were collected from police collision files for 53 crashes, 27 of which involved a truck (≥ 3. 5 tonnes) and a pedal cycle. A systematic case review approach was used to identify the infrastructure, vehicle road user and management factors that contributed to these crashes and injuries and how these factors interacted. Results: Trucks turning left conflicting with pedal cyclists traveling straight ahead was a common crash scenario. Key contributory factors identified included the pedal cyclists not being visible to the truck drivers, road narrowing and inappropriate positioning of pedal cyclists. Conclusions: Crashes involving trucks and pedal cyclists are complex events that are caused by multiple interacting factors therefore multiple measures are required to prevent them from occurring...|$|E

50|$|The park {{subsequently}} {{came into}} the hands of J.P. Boylin, whose family continues to operate the park and its attractions. Many of the attractions are vintage amusement park rides, such as the carousel, The Whip, Tilt-A-Whirl, Paratrooper, Dodgem Cars, and Scrambler. The park also features a miniature railway with a covered bridge, a vintage Pretzel Haunted House <b>ride,</b> swan-shaped <b>pedal</b> boats, a miniature golf course, arcade games, shooting galleries, and a restaurant. The park once featured a roller rink, and a paddleboat attraction known as the Camden Queen, which took riders on a short excursion up the Ohio River.|$|R
25|$|Most bicycle hubs {{incorporate}} a freewheel {{to allow the}} pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., <b>ride</b> without <b>pedalling</b> using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to {{the hub of the}} back wheel, so that the pedals are directly coupled to the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards.|$|R
50|$|Felix {{starts to}} feel guilty about his actions {{and goes on to}} save Bob and his brother. <b>Riding</b> a <b>pedal</b> boat, Felix, Linda, and the kids go where Bob and Mr. Fischoeder are tied up. The tides have gone high and Felix is about to release them when Fanny, Felix's girlfriend whom he promised her own club where she can perform, arrives and says that she will kill Bob and Calvin herself so that she could get her own nightclub. Bob {{momentarily}} distracts her by asking her to sing so that Linda can crash her pedal boat on a weak post of the pier. Linda succeeds and the weight of the carousel from above gives in, destroying part of the wharf. Everyone is safe, and only Fanny is sent to jail as Mr. Fischoeder covered for Felix. The Belchers go home.|$|R
50|$|A {{left side}} drive crank arm. Although you could simply reverse a normal set of crank arms, {{the left side}} and right side {{specific}} pedal bosses would be reversed, causing them to tend to come loose and spin out with normal <b>riding.</b> Also, directional <b>pedals</b> would look backwards unless the pedal spindles were also reversed. Many companies now provide cranksets in which both arms {{are designed to be}} drive arms with the appropriate sprocket drive bosses. While this application to BMX is new, {{this is not a new}} idea. For decades, tandem bicycles have used left side drive cranks to drive the timing chain.|$|R

50|$|In fact, Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation came up {{with new}} ideas and {{policies}} to make it even more attractive. Recently, they have launched a special boat riding facility at its Raindrop Boat House in Mudaliarkuppam. It is called kayak, the one-seater boat. At present there are fifty-four varieties of boats. The Boat <b>rides</b> include two/Four-seater <b>pedalling</b> boats,Two/Four seater Rowing Boats, Speedboats, Motorboats and one-seater Kayaks(Self Rowing). Special boat races are organised every year within this vast spread of backwater. College and university students participate here with great enthusiasm and unison. There is an island approximately 4 km from the Raindrop Boat House, in the expanse of the waters in Mudaliarkuppam.|$|R
50|$|In June 2014, Buhring raced {{the inaugural}} Trans Am Bike Race. Starting in Astoria, Oregon, and {{finishing}} in Yorktown, Virginia, {{the race is}} 4400 mi long, with 67,000 metres of climbing. As in the Transcontinental Race, cyclists must ride unsupported and completely self-sufficient. This race included some of the world's top endurance riders, including Mike Hall, winner of the Tour Divide and world record-holder as the fastest man to circumnavigate the globe. Buhring finished the race in 20 days and 23 hours, winning {{first place in the}} women's category and tying for 4th place overall. The most impressive part of her <b>ride</b> saw her <b>pedalling</b> 36 hours straight for 500 mi in her final sprint. Her performance attracted the attention of many national and international magazines, and she was defined by Women's Cycling Magazine as one of the strongest female endurance cyclists in the world.|$|R
40|$|Functional near {{infrared}} spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a versatile neuroimaging tool with an increasing acceptance in the neuroimaging community. While often lauded for its portability, {{most of the}} fNIRS setups employed in neuroscientific research still impose usage in a laboratory environment. We present a wearable, multi-channel fNIRS imaging system for functional brain imaging in unrestrained settings. The system operates without optical fiber bundles, using eight dual wavelength light emitting diodes and eight electro-optical sensors, which can be placed freely on the subject's head for direct illumination and detection. Its performance is tested on N = 8 subjects in a motor execution paradigm performed under three different exercising conditions: (i) during outdoor bicycle <b>riding,</b> (ii) while <b>pedaling</b> on a stationary training bicycle, and (iii) sitting still on the training bicycle. Following left hand gripping, we observe {{a significant decrease in}} the deoxyhemoglobin concentration over the contralateral motor cortex in all three conditions. A significant task-related ΔHbO 2 increase was seen for the non-pedaling condition. Although the gross movements involved in pedaling and steering a bike induced more motion artifacts than carrying out the same task while sitting still, we found no significant differences in the shape or amplitude of the HbR time courses for outdoor or indoor cycling and sitting still. We demonstrate the general feasibility of using wearable multi-channel NIRS during strenuous exercise in natural, unrestrained settings and discuss the origins and effects of data artifacts. We provide quantitative guidelines for taking condition-dependent signal quality into account to allow the comparison of data across various levels of physical exercise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of functional NIRS brain imaging during an outdoor activity in a real life situation in humans...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} motor {{learning}} {{have shown the}} effectiveness of the practice that incorporates some form of self-learning and performance of a motor task (JANELLE, 1997; CHIVIACOWSKY & WULF, 2002). In the present study aims to investigate whether the benefits generated by the typical practice self-control subjects are also found in individuals with motor impairment after stroke. The subjects, 26 adults of both sexes, with injury after stroke for at least 6 months, will be divided into two groups. A group of often self-controlled feedback (self) and a yoked group, which will receive feedback in a controlled externally, similar to a group subject to a self-controlled. The task of balance with demand, is to <b>ride</b> a <b>pedal</b> for some distance in the shortest possible time. All attempts to start with the foot contralateral to hemiparesis. A timer will be used to measure the movement time (MT), ie, the time needed to walk with the pedal to the starting line finish line. The research will consist of an acquisition phase, where participants will conduct 20 trials of practice, and a retention phase, 24 hours after the acquisition phase, in which four attempts to hold practice. The subjects of the group self, will be told they can use to support the upper limb support in attempts in which they find necessary. Yoked to subjects in the group, will be informed that in some trials should use the support and not others. The retention phase is performed without support in both groups. Before testing, subjects should be informed that the task at top speedEstudos recentes sobre aprendizagem motora têm indicado a efetividade da prática que incorpora alguma forma de autocontrole na aprendizagem e na performance de uma tarefa motora (JANELLE, 1997; CHIVIACOWSKY & WULF, 2002). No presente estudo objetiva-se investigar se os benefícios gerados pela prática autocontrolada em sujeitos típicos também serão encontrados em sujeitos com comprometimento motor após acidente vascular encefálico (AVE). Os sujeitos, 26 adultos de ambos os sexos, com lesão pós AVE há pelo menos 6 meses, serão distribuídos em dois grupos. Um grupo com frequência de feedback autocontrolado (self) e um grupo que receberá feedback de forma externamente controlada (yoked), equiparados um a um aos sujeitos do grupo autocontrolado. A tarefa, com demanda de equilíbrio, consistirá em andar de pedalo por certa distância no menor espaço de tempo possível. Todas as tentativas iniciarão com o pé contralateral à hemiparesia. Um cronômetro será utilizado para medir o tempo de movimento (TM), ou seja, o tempo necessário para andar com o pedalo da linha de partida até a linha de chegada. A pesquisa constará de uma fase de aquisição, onde os participantes realizarão 20 tentativas de prática, e uma fase de retenção, 24 horas após a fase de aquisição, em que realizarão quatro tentativas de prática. Aos sujeitos do grupo self, será informado que poderão utilizar o suporte para apoio dos membros superiores nas tentativas em que acharem necessário. Aos sujeitos do grupo yoked, será informado que em algumas tentativas deverão utilizar o suporte e em outras não. A fase de retenção será realizada sem auxílio do suporte em ambos os grupos. Antes da realização do teste, os sujeitos serão informados que deverão realizar a tarefa na maior velocidade possíve...|$|R
40|$|Over the 9 -year {{period from}} 2000 - 01 to 2008 - 09, age-standardised rates for persons seriously injured {{due to a}} road traffic crash saw an average annual {{increase}} of 1. 6 %. This report presents estimates of trends in the number and rate of persons injured in Australia due to road vehicle traffic crashes. Serious injury is defined as when the person was admitted to hospital for their injury. Trends in high threat to life, or life threatening, injury are also reported. Injury deaths {{are not included in}} this report. This is a companion report to the more detailed reports on serious injury due to land transport accidents in Australia for the 2007 – 08 and 2008 – 09 financial years. Trends in serious injury Over the 9 -year period from 2000 – 01 to 2008 – 09, age-standardised rates for persons seriously injured due to a road traffic crash increased from 138. 3 to 156. 7 per 100, 000 population, an average annual increase of 1. 6 %. All jurisdictions except for Victoria and the Northern Territory showed statistically significant increases in age-standardised rates of serious injury due to road vehicle traffic crashes over the 9 -year period. Trends in life-threatening injury Over one-quarter (26 %) of those seriously injured due to road traffic crashes sustained life-threatening injuries over the 9 -year period from 2000 – 01 to 2008 – 09. The highest rates were for persons aged 15 – 24 years for both males and females. Rates of life-threatening cases involving drivers of motor vehicles, motor cyclists and pedal cyclists all rose significantly over this period. The rate of cases involving motorcyclists shows an average annual rate of increase of 6. 9 %. Age-specific rates for males in all age groups, except those aged 0 – 4 years, increased significantly over the 9 -year period. The largest average annual increases in rates were recorded in the 45 – 64 years and 65 years and over age groups with increases of 14. 7 % and 13. 9 % respectively. For females injured as motorcyclists there were significant increases for those aged 25 – 44 years and 45 – 64 years. The rate of cases involving pedal cyclists shows an average annual rate of increase of 6. 8 %. For both males and females in age groups 25 – 44 years, 45 – 64 years as well as for males aged 65 years and over, there were significant increases in age-specific rates over the 9 -year period. The largest average annual increase in rates for males and females was recorded for those aged 45 – 64 years with increases of 14. 0 % for males and 14. 4 % for females. Those injured as pedestrians recorded a significant annual rate of decrease of 1. 8 % over the period. In 2000 – 01, 31 % of all high threat to life road injuries sustained by males aged 45 – 64 years occurred while they were <b>riding</b> motorcycles or <b>pedal</b> cycles. This had risen to over 51 % in 2008 – 09. Persons living in remote areas recorded the highest average annual rate of increase of 5. 8 %, while persons living in major cities, inner and outer regional areas recorded smaller, but significant average annual rates of increase...|$|R
