5|$|The great Renaissance {{projects}} of Brescia were {{interrupted by the}} war. Even the Loggia palazzo, where Cairano had already established scaffolds to mount the figures on the second level, including two angular trophies, was not to see a <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> till fifty years later, {{under the direction of}} Ludovico Beretta. The town's priorities had changed from artistic pomp and cultural recovery to basic necessities and vital functions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{construction}} finally recommenced on the coastal line south of Wharanui, but this soon stopped {{again when the}} Great Depression's effects began to be severely felt. Public pressure for a <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> was strong, and as the economy was starting to improve in 1936 the government issued orders for completion in four years. In 1939, the line beyond Parnassus was opened to Hundalee, but the outbreak of World War II created more delays and the goal of completion in four years was not achieved. Construction continued through the war, and {{not long after the}} resumption of peace the northern and southern railheads met in Kaikoura. The Main North Line from Christchurch to Picton was completed and officially opened on 15 December 1945.|$|E
500|$|HMS Nairana (...) was a {{passenger}} ferry that was requisitioned by the Royal Navy (RN) as a seaplane carrier in 1917. She was {{laid down in}} Scotland in 1914 as TSS Nairana for the Australian shipping line Huddart Parker, but construction was suspended after {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Following <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> the ship was launched in 1915, and converted to operate wheeled aircraft from her forward flying-off deck, as well as floatplanes that were lowered into the water. She saw service during the war with the Grand Fleet, and in 1918–19 supported the British intervention in the Russian Civil War.|$|E

500|$|That year, the {{department}} {{set out to}} improve the new highway. Concrete slabs were laid between Petrolia and Highway7, as well as along a [...] section between Thamesville and Dresden. The following year, the route was paved between Dresden and Edys Mills before {{the effects of the}} Great Depression forced {{the department}} to concentrate on paving Highway22. The election of a new government in mid-1934 led to the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in June as a depression relief project. New equipment (namely a Caterpillar Excavator), as well as the expertise of Andy Newman, an engineer who was hired when he demonstrated his abilities with the machinery upon passing a construction site on his drive home. Newman, who helped design the machine that nobody else could operate, allowed work to proceed at a much faster rate than before. The machinery could dig quicker than 50 men, and this effort showed when the gap between Petrolia and Edys Mills and the remaining gaps between Dresden and Thamesville were graded and paved {{by the end of the}} summer. On October19, 1934, Highway21 was officially opened by Robert Mellville Smith, deputy minister of the Department of Highways.|$|E

A first edition was published in 7 BC followed by a gap, <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and a final edition no later than 23 AD {{in the last year}} of Strabo's life. Strabo probably worked on his Geography and now missing History concurrently, as the Geography contains a considerable amount of historical data.

[...] On 1 May 1914, this section opened. [...] A small amount of further construction took place over the next two years, but World War I meant that no work took place between 1916 and 1919.

2500|$|On 19 June 1915, after Churchill {{had been}} {{replaced}} as First Lord by Arthur Balfour, a conference [...] was held [...] at the Admiralty to consider all airship development. [...] At that time the non-rigid airship programme was proving to be successful, and at this meeting it was agreed to expand the non-rigid programme and also to resume construction of HMA No.9. However, <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> was delayed by the necessity to retrieve Pratt and Wallis who had enlisted in the Army when construction was cancelled. [...] Final erection of the ship began {{in the autumn of}} that year, but there were delays in obtaining flax from Ireland to make nets for the gasbags following the Easter Rising, and the ship was not completed until 28 June 1916.|$|E
2500|$|The {{work was}} {{launched}} in two phases each called an [...] "enterprise". The first enterprise of connecting Toulouse to Trèbes was estimated at 3.6 million livres. The finances of the State, however, [...] were not very sound and the Estates of Languedoc were not willing to fund such a project for fear that their funds {{would be used for}} unexpected expenses. So, in exchange for the ownership and operation of the canal, Pierre-Paul Riquet proposed to finance part of the works from his own funds. The rest was to be paid by the State in exchange for profits that Riquet earned from the salt tax. The second enterprise of works between Trèbes and the étang de Thau in December 1668 cost 5.832 million livres plus a million more livres for the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on the port of Sète.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} permits {{were given}} to another British company, and another ceremony was held announcing the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> in March 1895. The new British contractor, Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, restored the Jezreel dike and construction resumed. However, in 1900, the Ottomans began building the Hejaz railway, and saw the opportunity to convert the future Haifa–Damascus line to an extension thereof. In addition, because of financial disputes between the Ottoman authorities and DHP, and DHP's delaying of transporting construction materials for the Haifa line through their own railways, the Ottomans wanted {{to have their own}} railway line to the Mediterranean. In 1902, the Ottoman authorities revoked S.O.R.'s permit for a compensation of 155,000 Turkish lira.|$|R

50|$|In January 1969, the {{new road}} segment was {{completed}} to Moung Sai.

True to her words, on 4 August 2015, she co-sponsored a motion on the Senate floor along with Sen. Dino Melaye on the deplorable condition of some Nigerian roads, of which Oyo-Ogbomosho was specifically mentioned. She is reported to have met with the contractor and top government officials in an effort to ensure completion of the road. The road was included in the 2016 National Budget with 6 Billion Naira budgeted towards <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Sunmonu flagged off the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on 22 August 2016, about 1 year after moving the motion {{on the floor of the}} Senate with Sen. Kabiru Gaya (Chairman, Senate Committee on Works) being quoted as saying that [...] "Senator Sunmonu was on the neck of the Senate and the committee to ensure that the road is accommodated in the budget". The pressure from Sunmonu caused the Executive to publicly commit to complete the road before the end of the Administration.|$|E
25|$|In mid-March 2002, {{the federal}} {{government}} raised the embargo on construction and announced that it wanted to quickly settle the financing with DB. On10March 2002, the then Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schröder announced the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>work.</b> He said that the project had not been financed by the previous government and therefore had to be withdrawn.
