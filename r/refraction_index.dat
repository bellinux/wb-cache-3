Additionally it is shown that negative <b>refraction</b> <b>indices</b> allow perfect transmission of the wave passing the ensemble of scatterers.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{description}} of the propagation properties of quantum gravity modified electrodynamics characterized by constitutive relations up to second order in the correction parameter. The effective description corresponds to an electrodynamics in a dispersive and absorptive non-local medium, where the Green functions and the <b>refraction</b> <b>indices</b> can be explicitly calculated. The reality of the electromagnetic field together with the requirement of causal propagation in a given referrence frame leads to restrictions {{in the form of}} such <b>refraction</b> <b>indices.</b> In particular, absorption must be present in all cases and, contrary to the usual assumption, it is the dominant aspect in those effective models which exhibit linear effects in the correction parameter not related to birefringence.
