Al Koch, a partner with AlixPartners, was named one of the chief restructuring officers of the various company sections during the bankruptcy process. Jay Alix (having had previous experience turning around automotive companies) returned from an eight year hiatus from leading the company to lead the overall <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations,</b> and according Forbes Magazine, “hatched a radical plan that ultimately set the foundation for the salvation of the company.” ...|$|E
50|$|AlixPartners {{was founded}} in 1981 in Southfield, Michigan by Jay Alix, a Detroit-area Certified Public Accountant (CPA). The company was founded as Jay Alix & Associates PC. According to BusinessWeek, the “firm pioneered {{consulting}} to companies in or near bankruptcy … While most management consultants focus on long-term strategy, AlixPartners' mission is more immediate. It jumps into crisis-ridden companies and looks for ways to maximize value for investors and creditors. Often, that means shedding assets or <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations.</b> But sometimes, it means preparing the company for sale.” It first found public notoriety in 1984, when working with the bankrupt automotive company DeLorean Motor Co, finding an additional $100 million for the company’s creditors.|$|E

40|$|In {{electronic}} commerce over the Internet, business transactions are frequently long-duration activities, exhibit complex interaction dependencies, and {{are prone to}} failures or unpredictable situations. As an adaptive engineering approach todeveloping exible and reliable {{electronic commerce}} systems, we present the distributed transactional activity model (TAM) in this paper and report our experience in designing and implementing TAM. A distinct feature {{of this approach is}} the utilization of a family of dynamic activity <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations</b> that allow ongoing transactional activities to bypass some unexpected execution bottlenecks, and the notion of validity thatprovides correctness guarantees for the activity <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations.</b> Another advantage of TAM is its facilities that help business process designers to deal with business structure changes adaptively and incrementally. Our implementation method is based on component technology and using plug-in adaptors on top of commercial OLTP systems. We argue that TAM, its dynamic activity <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations,</b> and our implementation method together provide a viable and practical foundation towards e ectively building and e ciently managing electronic commerce applications. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a practical method {{to implement the}} dynamic restructuring of distributed transactional activities with several main advantages. First, it guarantees the correctness of dynamic <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations</b> {{as well as that}} of ongoing transactional activities. Second, it is general enough to accommodate a wide range of workflow activities' dynamic restructuring requirements. Third, it facilitates the deployment of dynamic <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations</b> on production systems. Our method combines adaptors, microprotocols, and incremental specialization, building modularly on the system components (e. g., RTF [1], OCP [28], MARS [4]) that we previously developed to support distributed extended transaction processing [19]. A prototype implementation based on this method is built on top of Transarc Encina, a commercial online transaction processing (OLTP) monitor. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of dynamic restructuring on top of commercial OLTP systems. 1 Introduction Ma [...] ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{link between}} <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations</b> and the {{increase}} of accidents for blue-collar workers in plants is well proved by academic literature. However, several large industrial companies publish accidents decrease indicators {{in spite of the}} continuous <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations.</b> A monograph on a multinational steel corporation shows that this paradox is explained by two factors : risk prevention measures introduced by the management for various reasons (moral, financial, competitive, media-related); development of diverse forms of “quantitative disappearance” of injuries in the workplace. In the Belgian plants studied, blue-collar workers face a continual dilemma between preserving their physical well-being and protecting their position (and future) fragilized by various uncertainties. In this regard, continuous restructuring have multi-dimensional effects on the management of workers’ health and safety, the reporting of injuries, but also on blue-collars ambivalent attitudes to danger and accidents...|$|E

The scheme is asymptotically optimal. We also describe a hybrid reorganization scheme in which the absorbing rule and an ergodic rule are {{used in conjunction with}} each other to enhance the transient data retrieval process...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we pursue {{the study of}} Alignment Calculus, a {{declarative}} string database query language that supports both string querying and restructuring. This language is aimed for applications such as molecular biology databases, where the basic data type is a string, and the queries are combinatorial in nature. The declarative nature of our language does, however, require some additional effort in its implementation. Here we solve this problem by first defining a domain independent syntactic subset of the full language and then developing a query evaluation mechanism for this sublanguage. This mechanism then handles the required <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations</b> in a finite manner. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{algorithm}} to selectively restructure bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) for ray tracing dynamic scenes. We derive two new metrics {{to evaluate the}} culling efficiency and restructuring benefit of any BVH. Based on these metrics, we perform selective <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations</b> that efficiently reconstruct small portions of a BVH instead of the entire BVH. Our approach is general and applicable to complex and dynamic scenes, including topological changes. We use the selective restructuring algorithm to improve the performance of ray tracing dynamic scenes that consist {{of hundreds of thousands}} of triangles. In our benchmarks, we observe up to an order of magnitude improvement over prior BVH-based ray tracing algorithms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The ambient {{calculus}} is a calculus of computa-tion {{that allows}} active processes to move between sites. We present an analysis inspired by state-of-the-art pointer anal-yses that safely and accurately predicts which processes may turn up at what sites during {{the execution of}} a compos-ite system. The analysis models sets of processes by sets of regular tree grammars enhanced with context-dependent counts, and it obtains its precision by combining a pow-erful redex materialisation with a strong redex reduction (in {{the manner of the}} strong updates performed in pointer analyses). The underlying ideas are flexible and scale up to general tree structures admitting powerful <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations.</b> ...|$|E
