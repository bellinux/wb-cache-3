40|$|We collect evidences on {{existence}} of microscopic solitons, and their determining role in electronic processes of quasi- 1 D conductors. The ferroelectric charge ordering gives access to {{several types of}} solitons in conductivity and permittivity, and to solitons' bound pairs in optics - both in insulating and conducting cases of TMTTF and TMTSF subfamilies. The excursion to physics of conjugated polymers allows to suggest further experiments. Internal tunnelling in Charge Density Waves goes through the channel of "amplitude solitons", which correspond to the long sought quasi-particle - the spinon. The same experiment gives an access to the reversible reconstruction of the junction via spontaneous creation of a lattice of 2 Pi solitons - a grid of dislocations. The individual 2 Pi solitons have been visually captured in recent STM experiments. Junctions of organic and oxide conductors are anticipated to show similar effects of <b>reconstruction.</b> Comment: <b>Proceedings</b> of ISCOM 2007, {{to be published in}} Solid State Sciences (2008...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of tools and methods for {{the reconstruction of}} high-boost top quark decays at the LHC is given in this report. The focus is on hadronic decays, in particular an {{overview of}} the current status of top quark taggers in physics analyses is presented. The most widely used jet substructure techniques, normally used in combination with top quark taggers, are reviewed. Special techniques to treat pileup in large cone jets are described, along with a comparison of the performance of several boosted top quark <b>reconstruction</b> techniques.

40|$|The MicroBooNE {{detector}} {{has recently}} completed {{its first year}} of neutrino beam data-taking in the Booster Neutrino Beam at Fermilab, having collected approximately half of its intended data (3. 4 × 10 ^ 20 of 6. 6 × 10 ^ 20 protons on target). We present kinematic distributions of neutrino interactions observed from a small subset of this data (equivalent to 5 × 10 ^ 19 protons on target), both {{as a first step}} towards a charged-current muon neutrino cross-section on argon, and as an exploration of the capabilities and operational challenges of large liquid argon time projection chambers as neutrino detectors. These distributions have been assessed using fully automated event selection and <b>reconstruction.</b> Comment: Conference <b>proceedings</b> from NuFact 201...|$|R
40|$|Compressive imaging is an {{emerging}} application of compressed sensing, devoted to acquisition, encoding and reconstruction of images using random projections as measurements. In this {{paper we propose}} a novel method to provide a scalable encoding of an image acquired by means of compressed sensing techniques. Two bit-streams are generated to provide two distinct quality levels: a low-resolution base layer and full-resolution enhancement layer. In the proposed method we exploit a fast preview of the image at the encoder in order to perform inter-layer prediction and encode the prediction residuals only. The proposed method successfully provides resolution and quality scalability with modest complexity and it provides gains in the quality of the reconstructed images with respect to separate encoding of the quality layers. Remarkably, we also show that the scheme can also provide significant gains with respect to a direct, non-scalable system, thus accomplishing two features at once: scalability and improved <b>reconstruction</b> performance.

5000|$|The play {{takes place}} in a {{courtroom}} during the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials (1963-1965) but Weiss did not intend an actual <b>reconstruction</b> where the <b>proceedings</b> took place nor representation of the camp itself. [...] Auschwitz is present only {{in the words of the}} perpetrators, the victims and the personnel of the court. The Investigation is divided into eleven Dantean [...] "cantos," [...] each of which is subdivided into three parts - a 33-part structure which mimics Dante's Divine Comedy. Weiss's cantos depict the 'progress' of the victims from the ramp upon arrival at Auschwitz to the gas chambers and the ovens, revealing ever more horrendous moments in the perpetration of the Nazi genocide. Weiss refrains from all dramatic embellishments. The focus is entirely on the spoken word, often taken verbatim from the trial. Weiss's seemingly minimalist intervention in the protocols shows the dramatist (and former painter and filmmaker) who only a year earlier had created the sensational and wildly theatrical play Marat/Sade at the height of his art. The Investigation succeeds in transforming the actual protocols into a work of literature and art - to the extent that art may be best suited to convey a sense of the experience and preserve the memory of the Holocaust.|$|R
