The {{case study of}} iron ore deliveries to the metallurgical enterprises of Mariupol from Kryvyi Rih is presented. Based on the analysis of Ukrainian railroads and sea ports infrastructures six possible routes of multi-modal iron ore transportation are built.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 47). Traffic Information System will assist travelers with planning, perception, analysis and decision making to improve the convenience, safety and efficiency of travel. It will provide the traveler three facilities: route planning, alerting for traffic jams and alternative routes [...] The goal of route planning is to locate a connected sequence of road segments from a current location to a destination. Route computation may be based on criteria such as the shortest travel distance or travel time. Route computation is also useful for travel during rush hour, travel in unfamiliar areas, and/or travel to an unfamiliar destination. The goal of <b>route</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{is to find the}} attributes of a given route between two points. These attributes may include travel time and traffic congestion information, and thus <b>route</b> <b>evaluation</b> is also useful for selecting travel time by a familiar path. The goal of route display is to effectively communicate the optimal route to the traveler for navigation. In this project, the focus is put on algorithms for real-time route computation on maps stored in a database and to compute the data to be delivered to the traveler. Tanjima AliB.

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} problem of {{supporting}} VoIP calls in a wireless mesh network. Specifically, we propose solutions for call admission control (CAC) and route selection for VoIP calls. Call admission decisions must evaluate how {{the capacity of the}} mesh network is utilized by the existing calls. We address this issue via a measurement-based modeling effort to model mutual interference between wireless links. The modeling approach evaluates whether capacity constraints (or, required QoS metrics) will be satisfied if a new call is admitted with a given <b>route.</b> <b>Evaluations</b> with a 6 -node 802. 11 a testbed demonstrate excellent accuracy of the model and thus also the CAC performance. We address the issue of route selection by also using a modeling approach that considers models of transmission and interference ranges to develop a polynomial-time algorithm to search for feasible routes. This problem takes exponential time for wireless networks without such modeling. In addition to studying feasibility, we study several routing metrics such as shortest feasible path and maximum residual feasible path. Finally, we develop a new method for routing using call statistics that uses prior calling patterns to avoid potentially critical links. We evaluate the performance of these route selection techniques via extensive simulations and demonstrate the superiority of using max residual feasible path over simply shortest feasible path, and routing using call statistics over max residual feasible path.

40|$|The {{development}} of tumor-targeting drug delivery systems, able to selectively transport cytotoxic agents into the tumor site by exploiting subtle morphological and physiological differences between healthy and malignant cells, currently stands {{as one of}} the most attractive anticancer strategies used to overcome the selectivity problems of conventional chemotherapy. Owing to frequent overexpression of folate receptors (FRs) on the surface of malignant cells, conjugation of cytotoxic agents to folic acid (FA) via suitable linkers have demonstrated to enhance selective drug delivery to the tumor site. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of two novel folate-conjugates bearing the anticancer agent chlorambucil (CLB) tethered to either an aminoether (4, 7, 10 -trioxa- 1, 13 -tridecanediamine) or a pseudo-β-dipeptide (β-Ala-ED-β-Ala) linker is reported.

These data confirm the reliability of folate-based drug delivery systems for targeted antitumor therapy; likewise, they lay the foundations for the {{development of}} other folate-conjugates with antitumor potential...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an electric}} {{vehicle routing problem}} combining conventional, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are constrained in their service range by their battery capacity, and may require time-consuming recharging operations at some specific locations. Plug-in hybrid vehicles have two engines, an internal combustion engine and an electric engine using a built-in rechargeable battery. These vehicles can avoid visits to recharging stations by switching to fossil fuel. However, this flexibility comes {{at the price of}} a generally higher consumption rate and utility cost. To solve this complex problem variant, we design a sophisticated metaheuristic which combines a genetic algorithm with local and large neighborhood search. All <b>route</b> <b>evaluations,</b> within the approach, are based on a layered optimization algorithm which combines labeling techniques and greedy evaluation policies to optimally insert recharging stations visits in a fixed trip and to select the fuel types. The metaheuristic is finally hybridized with an integer programming solver, over a set partitioning formulation, so as to recombine high-quality routes from the past search into better solutions. Extensive experimental analyses are conducted, highlighting the good performance of the algorithm and the contribution of each of its main components. Finally, we investigate the impact of fuel and energy cost on fleet composition decisions. Our experiments show that a careful use of a mixed fleet can significantly reduce operational costs in a large variety of price scenarios, in comparison {{with the use of a}} fleet composed of a single vehicle class...|$|R

30|$|This module {{processes}} the user’s {{request by}} generating {{a set of}} candidate routes from external sources and by {{evaluating the quality of}} those routes automatically without involving human effort. First, the control logic component receives the user’s request and controls the workflow of the entire system. Once a user’s request is received, the truth reusing component is invoked to match the request to the verified routes (truth) between two places at departure time. If the new coming request is a hit of the truth, the system will return result immediately. Otherwise, the component will invoke the <b>route</b> <b>evaluation</b> component to automatically generate some candidate routes and evaluate the qualities of these candidate routes using the verified truth. The <b>route</b> <b>evaluation</b> component evaluates the routes using computer power, and it provides an efficient way to reduce the cost, since it can largely reduce the amount of tasks generated. The component first builds up a candidate route set by invoking route generation component. If some of these routes agree with each other to a high degree, one of them will be selected as the best recommended route and added into a truth database with the corresponding time tag. If a best recommended route can not be determined, the system will assign each candidate route a confidence score, which is generated by the verified truths and illustrates the possibility of the route to be the best recommended route. A route with the highest confidence score that is greater than a threshold η will be regarded to be the best recommended and returned to the user; otherwise, the logic control will hand over the request to the CR module.|$|E

Planned disruptions for works essentially are different mainly because of their longer duration, which allows passengers to build alternative route choice strategies. The literature on this topic remains scarce. In this study, a novel methodology was proposed to enable operators to evaluate different disruption management schemes and to obtain explicit estimations of travel times, passenger comfort flows, and levels of service. Statistical tools were {{used to evaluate the}} different strategies. The methodology is illustrated here through a large-scale application to a real line disruption in Paris. The disruption took place in July 2015 as the result of network maintenance work and affected Line A of Réseau Express Régional, a major suburban railway line that provides more than 1 million trips on a typical working day.
