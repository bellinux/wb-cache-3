50|$|Since SKF {{introduced}} the <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> in 1919, <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> manufacturers have purposefully been refined through the decades to improve carrying capacity {{and to reduce}} operational friction. This has been possible by playing with a palette of parameters such as materials, internal geometry, tolerance and lubricant. Nowadays, <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> manufacturers are striving to refine the bearing knowledge towards more environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient solution.|$|R
50|$|CARB <b>bearings</b> are {{toroidal}} <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> {{and similar}} to <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> but can accommodate both angular misalignment and also axial displacement. Compared to a <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing,</b> their {{radius of curvature}} is longer than a spherical radius would be, making them an intermediate form between <b>spherical</b> and cylindrical <b>rollers.</b> Their limitation is that, like a cylindrical roller, they do not locate axially. CARB bearings are typically used in pairs with a locating bearing, such as a <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> This non-locating bearing can be an advantage, {{as it can be}} used to allow a shaft and a housing to undergo thermal expansion independently.|$|R
50|$|A <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> is a {{rolling-element bearing}} that permits {{rotation}} with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore {{of the inner}} ring that may be misaligned in respect to the outer ring. The misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape {{of the outer ring}} and spherical rollers.Despite what their name may imply, <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are not truly spherical in shape. The rolling elements of <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are mainly cylindrical in shape, but have a profile that makes them appear like cylinders that have been slightly over-inflated.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> have {{an outer}} ring with an {{internal}} <b>spherical</b> shape. The <b>rollers</b> are thicker {{in the middle}} and thinner at the ends. <b>Spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> can thus accommodate both static and dynamic misalignment. However, <b>spherical</b> <b>rollers</b> are difficult to produce and thus expensive, and the bearings have higher friction than an ideal cylindrical or tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> since there will be a certain amount of sliding between rolling elements and rings.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to investigate the environmental properties of SKF's <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> (SRB) 24024 and to identify parameters and processes that cause major environmental impact.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{condition}} monitoring and failure diagnostics of <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> on adapter sleeve running in high technology Chemical industry machines. Two {{methods have been}} used: low frequency mechanical vibration (up to 1000 Hz) and high frequency mechanical vibration (up to 16000 Hz) monitoring method and a shock pulse method (SPM, frequency 32000 Hz). Machines have been tested in at free run and fully loaded. Results have been applied to in-crease reliability of diagnostic methods in a case when radial clearances inside a bearing are too small {{and there is no}} enough lubricant oil supply to bearings. Radial clearances and relative vibra-tion displacements of rotor shafts have been measured using proximity probes. The low frequency vibration excitation method is not efficient enough in failure diagnostics of bearings in comparison to high frequency and shock pulse methods.

40|$|The CARB bearing is {{a single}} row bearing with long, {{slightly}} crowned symmetrical rollers. It combines the self-aligning capability of the <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> with the unconstrained axial displacement ability of the cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> The optimal combination of both raceway profiles provides a favorable load distribution in the bearing, as well as low frictional running. This paper emphasizes the functioning characteristics of the SKF CARB toroidal <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> {{by means of a}} multibody dynamics simulation. Different conditions like load direction, races relative position or angular misalignment, are taken into consideration...|$|R
50|$|Self-aligning ball bearings, {{such as the}} Wingquist bearing {{shown in}} the picture, are {{constructed}} with the inner ring and ball assembly contained within an outer ring that has a spherical raceway. This construction allows the bearing to tolerate a small angular misalignment resulting from shaft or housing deflections or improper mounting. The bearing was used mainly in bearing arrangements with very long shafts, such as transmission shafts in textile factories.One drawback of the self-aligning ball bearings is a limited load rating, as the outer raceway has very low osculation (radius is much larger than ball radius). This led to {{the invention of the}} <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing,</b> which has a similar design, but use rollers instead of balls. Also the <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearing</b> is an invention that derives from the findings by Wingquist.|$|R

Instrumentation permits the measurement of inner and outer ring temperature, bearing drag torque, degree of misalignment, outer ring speed, cage speed, and applied load...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Combat" [...] {{engine was}} {{released}} in January 1972, with a twin <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> crank, 10:1 compression and developing [...] at 6,500 rpm. Reliability immediately suffered, with frequent and early crank-shaft main-bearing failures, sometimes leading to broken crankshafts. Older engines had used one ball-bearing main <b>bearing</b> and one <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> main bearing but the Combat engine featured two <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> in a mistaken belief this would strengthen the bottom-end {{to cope with the}} higher power-output. Instead the resultant crank-bending caused the rollers to [...] "dig-in" [...] to the races, causing rapid failure. This fragility was particularly obvious when measured against the reliability of contemporary Japanese machines. This problem was solved by specifying a heavier duty type of <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing,</b> of 'superblend' fame, later in the 1972 production year.|$|R
40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} {{are essential}} components of rotating machinery. The <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> (SRB) is one variant seeing increasing use, {{because it is}} self-aligning and can support high loads. It is becoming increasingly important {{to understand how the}} SRB responds dynamically under a variety of conditions. This doctoral dissertation introduces a computationally efficient, three-degree-of-freedom, SRB model that was developed to predict the transient dynamic behaviors of a rotor-SRB system. In the model, bearing forces and deflections were calculated as a function of contact deformation and bearing geometry parameters according to nonlinear Hertzian contact theory. The results reveal how some of the more important parameters; such as diametral clearance, the number of rollers, and osculation number; influence ultimate bearing performance. Distributed defects, such as the waviness of the inner and outer ring, and localized defects, such as inner and outer ring defects, are taken into consideration in the proposed model. Simulation results were verified with results obtained by applying the formula for the <b>spherical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>radial</b> deflection and the commercial bearing analysis software. Following model verification, a numerical simulation was carried out successfully for a full rotor-bearing system to demonstrate the application of this newly developed SRB model in a typical real world analysis. Accuracy of the model was verified by comparing measured to predicted behaviors for equivalent systems...|$|R
