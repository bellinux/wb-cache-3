5|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy.

In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every <b>resident</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E
