25|$|On simple, usually {{temporary}} layouts, {{power is}} supplied by a power pack consisting of a transformer and rectifier (DC), a rheostat for regulating power to the track (and thus train speed), and reversing to control model direction. On permanent layouts, multiple power supplies are traditionally used, with the trackage divided into electrically isolated sections called blocks; toggle or <b>rotary</b> <b>switches</b> (sometimes relays) are used to select which power supply controls the train in a particular block. With the advent of digital command control, block divisions are largely eliminated, as the computerized controllers can control any train anywhere on the track at any time.|$|E
2500|$|... 1985 models {{received}} minor updates while styling remained unchanged. The {{interior was}} updated for 1985, marking its most significant update since 1977. The simulated woodgrain appliqué {{used on the}} dash was replaced with a simulated silver metallic appliqué. The shaft-style radio was replaced with a more modern DIN-and-a-half style radio, while the pull-out headlight switch {{was replaced by a}} push button style switch. The climate controls were updated with <b>rotary</b> <b>switches</b> for the fan and rear window defroster replacing the toggle style switches. The instruments were updated to have a more modern appearance, with a horizontal speedometer while a round speedometer was included with the optional gauge package.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>switches</b> {{were used}} as channel {{selectors}} on television receivers until the early 1970s, as range selectors on electrical metering equipment, as band selectors on multi-band radios and other similar purposes. In industry, <b>rotary</b> <b>switches</b> are used for control of measuring instruments, switchgear, or in control circuits. For example, a radio controlled overhead crane may have a large multi-circuit rotary switch to transfer hard-wired control signals from the local manual controls in the cab to the outputs of the remote control receiver.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>switch</b> {{operates}} with a twisting {{motion of}} the operating handle {{with at least two}} positions. One or more positions of the switch may be momentary (biased with a spring), requiring the operator to hold the switch in the position. Other positions may have a detent to hold the position when released. A <b>rotary</b> <b>switch</b> may have multiple levels or [...] "decks" [...] in order to allow it to control multiple circuits.|$|R
5000|$|Modern <b>rotary</b> <b>switches</b> utilise a [...] "star wheel" [...] {{mechanism}} {{to provide the}} switching positions, such as at every 30, 45, 60, or 90 degrees. Nylon cams are then mounted behind this mechanism and spring-loaded electrical contacts slide around these cams. The cams are notched or cut where the contact should close to complete an electrical circuit.|$|E

50|$|A basic {{stepping}} switch is an electrically operated rotary switch {{with a single}} (typically input) terminal, and multiple (typically output) terminals. Like other typical <b>rotary</b> <b>switches,</b> the single terminal connects {{to one of the}} multiple terminals by rotating a contact arm, sometimes called a wiper, to the desired position. Moving from one position to the next is called stepping, hence the name of the mechanism. Using traditional terminology, this is a single-pole, multi-position switch.|$|E
