40|$|Moral {{norms and}} {{anticipated}} regret {{are widely used}} extensions {{to the theory of}} planned behaviour, yet there is some evidence to suggest that these constructs may conceptually overlap as predictors of intention. Two health-related behaviours with distinct moral implications (Study 1 : organ donation <b>registration,</b> <b>N</b> =  352 and Study 2 : condom usage, N =  1815) were therefore examined to ascertain whether moral norms and anticipated regret are indeed conceptually distinct. While evidence consistent with conceptual overlap was identified in Study 1, the evidence for such overlap in Study 2 was more ambiguous. In Study 3, a meta-analysis of existing literature revealed that the relationship between moral norms and anticipated regret was moderated by the extent of the moral implications arising from the behaviour under examination. Taken together, these findings suggest that conceptual overlap between moral norms and anticipated regret is more likely to occur among behaviours with obvious moral implications. Researchers wishing to examine the predictive utility of moral norms and anticipated regret among such behaviours would therefore be advised to aggregate these measures to form a composite variable (personal norms) ...|$|E

The purpose of this systematic literature review (PROSPERO <b>registration</b> <b>n.</b> CRD 42017069136) was to identify and summarise all available scientific literature relative to health issues connected to participating in these races. Using a literature search strategy in line with PRISMA guidelines, 117 scientific studies, sought through databases (Google Scholar and PubMed, between 2 nd and 9 th May 2017) and scrutiny of reference lists, were screened. Studies published in English treating any health issues assessed during or after a long-distance dog sled race were included, with no restriction in relation to their study design or the characteristics of participants studied. The quality of the studies was assessed using a standardised checklist. Ten studies met the criteria for being included in a qualitative analysis. The data synthesis showed that participants underwent strenuous psychophysical load, with insufficient sleep/rest and inadequate energy intake. Findings on hydrations are mixed. The risk of incurring in life-threatening injuries or infections was low, although injuries and infections of minor severity were common. No alterations of blood markers were observed from before to after the races. These findings will help planning prevention and treatment strategies in long-distance dog sled races.

Data over 1993 - 1998 were collected from (A) mandatory notifications (n = 2926); (B) hospital <b>registration</b> (<b>n</b> = 3968); (C) laboratory surveillance (n = 3484). As the standard capture-recapture method {{does not take into account}} false positive diagnoses, we developed a model to adjust for the lack of specificity of our sources. We estimated that 1363 cases were not registered in any of the three sources in the period of study. The completeness of the three sources was therefore estimated at 49 % for source A, 67 % for source B and 58 % for source C. After adjustment for false positive diagnoses, the completeness of source A, B, and C was estimated as 52 %, 70 % and 62 %, respectively. The capture-recapture methods offer an attractive approach to estimate the completeness of surveillance sources and hence contribute to a more accurate estimate of the disease burden under study. However, the method does not account for higher-order interactions or presence of false positive diagnoses. Being aware of these limitations, the capture-recapture method still elucidates the (in) completeness of sources and gives a rough estimate of this (in) completeness. This makes a more accurate monitoring of disease incidence possible and hence attributes to a more reliable foundation for the design and evaluation of health interventions such as vaccination program...|$|E

40|$|Background: Studies have {{investigated}} work engagement in dentistry, however dental nurse engagement is still inadequately understood. Also concerns about low retention and shortages of dental nurses in the UK have been highlighted. The {{purpose of this}} dissertation was two-fold. First is {{to build on the}} existing understanding of the mediating role of work engagement and personal accomplishment between occupational-related attitudes and leaving intentions. Secondly, to explore which of the specific occupational-related attitudes of dental nurses support and encourage a dental nursing career. Aims: The research had 3 aims. (1) To address the lack of information on work engagement among dental nurses, (2) To understand which job resources are important in the work-place and (3) to investigate how these job resources relate to work engagement and personal accomplishment and in turn their relationship with future intentions to leave the profession. Method: A sequential exploratory design of mixed methods was employed to collect data by first exploring the work experiences using focus groups of 24 dental nurses, either undergoing registration training or further post-registration qualification courses in 2 locations. Secondly, a newly designed cross-sectional questionnaire investigated demographics, job demands and resources, work engagement and personal accomplishment (using Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and the Maslach Burnout Inventory respectively) and an adapted measure of intention-to-leave of a sample of 269 dental nurses in Scotland (pre-registration n = 241; post <b>registration</b> <b>n</b> = 28). Results: A major theme was opinion surrounding the introduction of registration in August 2009. Registration for pre-registration dental nurses had a personal impact whereas post-registration dental nurses expressed a benefit for the whole profession. A common theme emerging from both groups of dental nurses was the provision of a clearer career pathway. Influences on leaving for pre-registration dental nurses were not being part of an integrated dental team and no sense of feeling valued. An uncovered underlying theme was the concept of professionalism. Pre-registration dental nurses sought support and security. This opinion contrasted with that of the post-registration group who appreciated a greater sense of independency. In the questionnaire the overall response rate was 82...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study set up to investigate factors associated with the high proportions of 'death certificate only' registrations (DCOs) for all cancers registered in south-east England between 1987 and 1989 and to identify those which might be subject to registry intervention. DCOs as a proportion of all <b>registrations</b> (<b>n</b> = 162, 131) were analysed by age, sex, district of residence, place of death and survival. DCO registration ratios (standardised for age and sex) were then derived for each of the 56 districts in the Thames Regions. A multiple logistic regression model was generated to estimate the effect of age at diagnosis, tumour survival and patient sex on final source of registration. To minimise the number of dummy variables needed, each of the 56 districts was ranked into quartiles: quartile 1 contained the 14 districts with the lowest age- and sex-standardised ratios for DCO registrations and quartile 4 comprised the 14 districts with the highest DCO ratios. Final source of registration was treated as a binomial trial (case notes or death certificates). The significance of associations was measured using the deviance difference as an approximate chi-square statistic. The effect of each variable on source of registration was estimated as an odds ratio. Interaction terms were also fitted. To estimate the effect of place of death on DCO registrations, a second model was generated for deceased patients only (n = 98, 455, adding 'place of death' to the list of explanatory variables already used. A further interaction term was fitted to account for interaction between place of death and district quartile of residence. Around 24 % of all patient deaths were registered as DCOs by the Thames Cancer Registry between 1987 and 1989. Of these, 40. 9 % died in an acute NHS hospital setting, 37. 1 % died at home, 10. 4 % died in hospices and 3. 4 % died in non-NHS hospitals. Increasing age, decreasing survival, district of residence and place of death were positively associated with death certificate registrations. The district effect was sustained in the regression model with significant positive associations shown for DHA quartile of residence. In the deceased group of patients, both district of residence and place of death were independent predictors of DCOs. Death occurring outside the acute NHS hospital setting increased the odds of being a DCO within and across district quartiles. DCOs could be reduced by better case ascertainment in some districts.

40|$|A 3 D {{geometric}} model {{representing the}} surface of a 3 D object is most often used for synthesizing highly realistic 3 D images. The advent of 3 D scanners has made the acquisition of 3 D surface geometry of existing objects relatively simple. In most 3 D scanners, it is difficult, to acquire the complete surface geometry in one operation. For example, with a single fixed scan head, the object has to be rotated many times to present different views of the object's surface to the scan-head, so that the entire surface geometry is covered. Then, all the scan data sets from different views have to be combined from their own independent coordinate systems into a single consistent geometric coordinate space. This operation is called scan data registration. Most existing techniques mainly focus on registering two point data sets at a time. For scan data in multiple views, say n views, one has to resort to pair-wise <b>registration,</b> requiring <b>n</b> - 1 <b>registration</b> operations. In this research, we study the problem of multiple scan data registration. In particular, we are interested in efficiency, robustness and accuracy of registration techniques. Our main contribution is a new registration technique that can simultaneously register any number of scan data sets {{as long as there is}} some overlap amongst them, thus requiring considerably less than <b>n</b> - 1 <b>registration</b> operations.

40|$|Registration of {{histopathology}} {{images of}} consecutive tissue sections stained with different histochemical or immunohistochemical stains {{is an important}} step in a number of application areas, such as the investigation of the pathology of a disease, validation of MRI sequences against tissue images, multiscale physical modeling, etc. In each case, information from each stain needs to be spatially aligned and combined to ascertain physical or functional properties of the tissue. However, in addition to the gigabyte-size images and nonrigid distortions present in the tissue, a major challenge for registering differently stained histology image pairs is the dissimilar structural appearance due to different stains highlighting different substances in tissues. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing an unsupervised content classification method that generates multichannel probability images from a roughly aligned image pair. Each channel corresponds to one automatically identified content class. The probability images enhance the structural similarity between image pairs. By integrating the classification method into a multiresolution-block-matching-based nonrigid <b>registration</b> scheme (<b>N.</b> Roberts, D. Magee, Y. Song, K. Brabazon, M. Shires, D. Crellin, N.

Methods In 2005, all Dutch residents registered through the Medical <b>Registration</b> Committee (<b>n</b> = 5245) were sent a self-report questionnaire to assess socio-demographic and work-related characteristics, burnout and engagement. Results Of the 5140 eligible residents, 2115 completed the questionnaire (41 %). Of those, 21 % fulfilled the criteria for moderate to severe burnout and 27 % were highly engaged with their work. Women reported more emotional exhaustion and less depersonalisation than men; age was weakly but significantly related to depersonalisation, and married residents and parents reported less depersonalisation than their single or childless counterparts. More men than women {{were found to be}} highly engaged and men specifically reported more vigour. Number of years in training was weakly but significantly related to absorption. With regard to occupational risk factors, significant between-group differences were found for the effects of clinical setting on emotional exhaustion, engagement, vigour and absorption. Residents in training in a mental health clinic were most emotionally exhausted and those in a rehabilitation centre were least engaged. General surgery represented the specialty with the lowest number of residents suffering from burnout, followed by obstetrics and gynaecology and any supportive specialty. General surgery residents were also found to be more highly engaged, vigorous, dedicated and absorbed than others. Conclusions As more than a fifth of the medical residents who responded could be diagnosed as suffering from burnout, we conclude that this problem needs addressing in the Dutch health care system, especially given that a relationship was proven between burnout and suboptimal patient care. We must look for solutions and interventions which will improve the work situation of medical residents. Striving for healthy workers in health care has to become daily practice...|$|R

This study evaluated the effect of combined decongestive therapy (CDT) and pneumatic compression pump on lymphede-ma indicators in patients with breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL). Methods: Twenty one women with BCRL were enrolled. The volume difference of upper limbs, the circumfer-ence at 9 areas and shoulder joint range of motion were measured in all patients. CDT was done by an educated nurse in two phases. In first phase, CDT was accompanied by use of a compression pump for 4 weeks, 3 days per week. In second phase, CDT was performed daily without compression pump for 4 weeks by patients at home. At the end of each phase, the same primary measurements were done for patients. Results: The mean volume difference of the upper limbs and mean difference in circumference in all areas at different phases decreased significantly. Mean flexion, extension, abduction and external rotation (in degrees) at different phases increased significantly.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{preliminary}} {{exploration of the}} trends and spatial variation in gender differentials in adult mortality in India, as also of the related rural-urban differentials. We {{pay particular attention to}} female mortality in the two prime reproductive age groups 15 - 29 and 30 - 44. The data for the study are taken from the Sample <b>Registration</b> System, available <b>n</b> an annual basis since 1970. Gender differentials, as well as rural urban differentials, have narrowed down considerably over the period from 1970, but both types of differences persist still. On the whole, the rural-urban differences over this period seem to be much larger than the gender differentials so that rural females still suffer from the double disadvantage of being female and belonging to rural areas. Of the correlates we considered, all the three, viz., total fertility rate, safe motherhood indices and health care supply are strongly correlated with female mortality especially in the 15 - 29 age group. What is significant is that these variables are highly correlated within themselves. For instance, in states like Kerala and Punjab where health care provision is good, the variables relating to safe motherhood are also satisfactorily high and fertility levels correspondingly low. In contrast, in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh all these indicators are poor. Surprisingly, a poor correlation is observed between male mortality and health suppy indices.

40|$|OBJECTIVES Several {{studies have}} shown that perseverative, worrisome {{thoughts}} are prospectively related to subjective health complaints (SHC) and that a short worry postponement intervention can decrease these complaints. As SHC and worry are prevalent and costly, we tested whether the intervention can be offered online to reduce these complaints in the general population. DESIGN A randomized parallel-group trial was conducted with self-selected participants from the general population. METHODS Via the research website, 996 participants were instructed to register their worrying for 6 consecutive days. The intervention group was instructed to postpone worry to a special 30 -min period in the early evening. The Subjective Health Complaints inventory, as administered before and after the intervention, and daily worry frequency and duration were considered the primary outcomes. RESULTS Three hundred and sixty-one participants completed the study. Contrary to our expectation, the <b>registration</b> group (<b>n</b> = 188) did not differ from the intervention group (n = 163) in SHC (ηp 2 =. 000, CI [0. 000 - 0. 003]), or in worry frequency or duration. Nevertheless, the different worry parameters were moderately related to SHC (r between. 238 and. 340, p ≤. 001). CONCLUSIONS In contrast to previous studies using pen-and-pencil versions of the worry postponement intervention, this study suggests that a direct online implementation was not effective in reducing SHC and worry. Overall, participants had high trait worry levels and reported difficulty with postponing worrying. Reducing SHC and worries via the Internet might require more elaborate interventions that better incorporate the advantages of delivering interventions online. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The perseverative cognition hypothesis argues that perseverative cognition, such as worry and rumination, acts as a mediator by which psychosocial stress may produce negative health effects. Prior research has indeed shown that worry and subjective health complaints (SHC) are prospectively related, but causality studies - that is, showing that changes in worry induce changes in health outcomes - are scarce and have mainly been conducted in young samples. These studies showed that reducing worry, using a worry postponement intervention, can reduce daily worrying and SHC. What does this study add? Trait and daily worrying are associated with SHC. An online worry postponement intervention is ineffective in reducing worry and SHC. Paper-and-pencil interventions cannot directly be used as online interventions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Given the {{potential}} {{role of the}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine- 3 receptor in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, this study was performed to determine whether ondansetron plus risperidone could reduce the negative and depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Methods: In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial (IRCT <b>registration</b> # 201112125280 <b>N</b> 7), in 2012 – 2013 in Mashhad, Iran, 38 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia received risperidone either combined with a fixed dose (4 – 8 mg/d) of ondansetron (n= 18) or with a placebo (n= 20) for 12 weeks. The patients were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Wechsler’s Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), and Hamilton’s Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) at baseline and 12 weeks later. Changes in the inventories were {{used to evaluate the}} efficacy of the treatment. The t test, Chi-square test, and SPSS (version 16) were used to analyze the data. The statistical significance was set at P< 0. 05. Results: Ondansetron plus risperidone was associated with a significantly larger improvement in the PANSS overall scale and subscales for negative symptoms and cognition than was risperidone plus placebo (P< 0. 001). The WAIS-R scale results indicated significant differences between the 2 groups before and after administrating the medicine and the placebo. The administration of ondansetron significantly improved visual memory based on the subtests of the WAIS (P< 0. 05). Ondansetron had no positive effects on depressive symptoms (effect size= 0. 13). Conclusion: This study confirmed that ondansetron, as an adjunct treatment, reduces negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and {{can be used as a}} potential adjunctive strategy particularly for negative symptoms and cognitive impairments.

40|$|Abstract Background Z ingiber officinale R. rhizome (ginger) is {{a popular}} spice that has {{traditionally}} been used to combat the effects of various inflammatory diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of ginger on pain relief in primary dysmenorrhea. Method This was a randomized, controlled trial. The study was based on a sample of one hundred and twenty students with moderate or severe primary dysmenorrhea. The students were all residents of the dormitories of Shahed University. They were randomly assigned into two equal groups, one for ginger and the other for placebo in two different treatment protocols with monthly intervals. The ginger and placebo groups in both protocols received 500 [*]mg capsules of ginger root powder or placebo three times a day. In the first protocol ginger and placebo were given two days before the onset of the menstrual period and continued through the first three days of the menstrual period. In the second protocol ginger and placebo were given only for the first three days of the menstrual period. Severity of pain was determined by a verbal multidimensional scoring system and a visual analogue scale. Results There was no difference in the baseline characteristics of the two groups (placebo n[*]=[*] 46, ginger n[*]=[*] 56). The results of this study showed that there were significant differences in the severity of pain between ginger and placebo groups for protocol one (P[*]=[*] 0. 015) and protocol two (P[*]=[*] 0. 029). There was also significant difference in duration of pain between the two groups for protocol one (P[*]=[*] 0. 017) but not for protocol two (P[*]=[*] 0. 210).

40|$|Background: Erythropoietin (EPO) {{is known}} as a {{regulating}} hormone for the production of red blood cells, called erythropoiesis. Some studies have shown that EPO exerts some non-hematopoietic protective effects on ischemia-reperfusion injuries in myocytes. Using echocardiography, we evaluated the effect of EPO infusion on reducing ischemia-reperfusion injuries and improvement of the cardiac function shortly after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Methods: Forty-three patients were recruited in this study and randomly divided into two groups: the EPO group, receiving standard medication and CABG surgery plus EPO (700 IU/kg), and the control group, receiving standard medication and CABG surgery plus normal saline (10 cc) as placebo. The cardiac function was assessed through echocardiography before as well as at 4 and 30 days after CABG. Results: Echocardiography indicated that the ejection fraction had no differences between the EPO and control groups at 4 days (47. 05 ± 6. 29 vs. 45. 90 ± 4. 97; P= 0. 334) and 30 days after surgery (47. 27 ± 28 vs. 46. 62 ± 5. 7; P= 0. 69). There were no differences between the EPO and control groups in the wall motion score index at 4 (P= 0. 83) and 30 days after surgery (P= 0. 902). In the EPO group, there was a reduction in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters (LVESD and LVEDD, respectively), as compared to the control group. Conclusion: Our results indicated that perioperative exogenous EPO infusion could not improve the ventricular function and wall motion index in the immediate post-CABG weeks. Nevertheless, a reduction in LVEDD and LVESD at 4 days and 30 days after CABG in the EPO group, by comparison with the control group, suggested that EPO correlated with a reduction in the remodeling of myocytes and reperfusion injuries early after CABG.

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the impacts of an Emotional Focused Intervention on emotional abuse behaviors and marital satisfaction among the elderly married couples. Methods: This randomized controlled trial study {{was carried out in}} Shiraz-Iran, during September 2013 - 2014. The elderly couples were invited to join an emotional focused intervention, following the advertisement and announcement on bulletin boards in the elderly day clinic centers and all governmental primary health care centers. Then, 57 couples (114 participants) who were eligible for study were assigned in two groups by block randomization (29 in the experimental and 28 in the control group(. The couples in the experimental group received intervention twice a week for four weeks. Each session lasted 90 minutes. The control group didn’t receive any intervention and the subjects were put in the waiting list. The outcome measures were evaluated by Multidimensional Measure of Emotional Abuse Questionnaire (MMEAQ) and Marital Satisfaction Questionnaire for Older People (MSQFOP). Repeated measurement ANOVA was used to detect any significant changes between groups in their mean scores of emotional abuse behaviors and marital satisfaction from pre- to post-test, and 3 months after the intervention. Analysis of data was performed using SPSS, version 19, and P≤ 0. 05 was measured as significant. Results: The mean duration of marriage was 39. 56 ± 9. 64 years. In the experimental group, the abusive behaviors decreased significantly (P< 0. 001) at times 2 and 3 compared with time 1, and marital satisfaction improved significantly only at time 3 (P< 0. 001). These differences were not significant in the control group. Conclusion: Emotion-focused couple-based interventions are helpful in reducing the spousal emotional abuse and improving marital satisfaction in among the elderly couples.

40|$|Abstract Background Early {{childhood}} caries (ECC) is {{the most}} common dental disease among children, which can affect children’s primary teeth during their teething. This study evaluates an intervention for preventing early childhood caries in a pediatric population in Ahvaz, Iran. Method The population of this study (IRCT 2017070210804 N 10) consists of 104 women with 12 to 36  months of age without dental caries referred to a health care center in Ahvaz, Iran. The children were randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group in equal numbers. First, the demographic information of participants was collected through a questionnaire containing components of perceived threat, health literacy, and oral health behaviors using a valid and reliable questionnaire. The ECC status of the children was established by a dentist. Control group received “standard well baby care”. The experimental group received standard well baby care in addition to educational interventions, including lecture and group discussion. After 6  months, the participant completed the questionnaire for the second time, and the children’s teeth were reexamined. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 15 at a significance level of p    0. 05. However, after the intervention, a significant difference was observed between the perceived threats (41. 15  ±  4. 46 in the experimental group and 38. 26  ±  4. 21 in the control group, p =  0. 001), health literacy (20. 98  ±  2. 15 in the experimental group and 19. 76  ±  2. 70 in the control group, p =  0. 01), oral health behaviors (7. 75  ±  2. 30 in the experimental group and 6. 15  ±  2. 65 in the control group, p =  0. 01), and the incidence of ECC (13 % in the experimental group and 35 % in the control group, p =  0. 001). Conclusion This intervention had positive effects on the perceived threat, health literacy, and health behaviors; and the intervention could reduce the incidence of ECC. The finding of this study provided a suggestion for evidence-based decision-making processes regarding ECCs prevention programs.

40|$|Background: Infertility {{has been}} {{described}} as creating a form of stress leading to a varietyof psychological problems. Both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are effectivetreatments for infertility stress. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness ofcognitive behavioral therapy along with fluoxetine for improvement infertility stress ininfertile women. Materials and Methods: In a randomized controlled clinical trial, 89 infertile womenwith mild to moderate depression (Beck scores 10 - 47) were recruited into the followingthree groups: i. cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), ii. antidepressant therapy,and iii. control group. Twenty-nine participants in the CBT method received gradualrelaxation training, restructuring, and eliminating of negative automatic thoughtsand dysfunctional attitudes to infertility for 10 sessions. Thirty participants in thepharmacotherapy group took 20 mg fluoxetine daily for 90 days. Thirty individualsin control group did not receive any intervention. All participants completed fertilityproblem inventory (FPI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at the beginningand end of the study. We applied Chi-square paired t test, ANOVA and Turkey’s testto analyze the data. Results: The mean of the infertility stress scores in CBT, fluoxetine, and controlgroups at the beginning and end of the study were as follows, respectively: 3. 5 ± 0. 62 vs. 2. 7 ± 0. 62 (p< 0. 05), 3. 5 ± 0. 53 vs. 3. 2 ± 4. 4 (p< 0. 05), and 3. 4 ± 0. 55 vs. 3. 5 ± 0. 48. In CBT group, the mean scores of social concern, sexual concern, maritalconcern, rejection of child-free lifestyle, and need for parenthood decreased meaningfullycompared to those before starting the therapy. But in fluoxetine group,mean score of women sexual concern out of those five main problems of infertilityreduced significantly. Also, fluoxetine and CBT reduced depression compared to thecontrol group. Conclusion: CBT improved the social concerns, sexual concerns, marital concerns,rejection of child-free lifestyle, and need for parenthood more than floxitine group. Thus, CBT was not only a reliable alternative to pharmacotherapy, but also superiorto fluoxetine in resolving and reducing of infertility stress (<b>Registration</b> Number:IRCT 2012061710048 <b>N</b> 1) ...|$|R
