The load data acquisition process is generally based on long and costly measurement campaigns. Here an alternative load characterization methodology is proposed.

Random realizations are generated and used as inputs for multi-body simulations, describing the dynamics of any given vehicle. An arbitrarily large set of fatigue loads can therefore be obtained inexpensively, for any given elementary life situation, and subsequently, for the total life of the vehicle, using customer usage information. A study of the influence of a change in market region is performed as an illustration of the stochastic simulation methodology.

In general, the S-transform (S-T) is a time-frequency spectral localization method which performs a multi-resolution analysis on signal. This method represents a better time-frequency resolution especially for non-stationary signal analysis. This technique was developed to produce shortened fatigue data for fatigue durability testing. The S-T method was applied to detect the damaging events contained in the fatigue signals due to high S-T spectrum location. The damaging events were extracted from an original fatigue signal to produce the shortened edited signal which has equivalent fatigue damage.

Recent research (Oppenhuis, 2003; Smith, 2006) has presented that fatigue is greatly under reported as a causal factor in crash statistics. Accurate crash data is essential for the analysis and understanding of causal and contributing factors into road crashes. Without this key data the analysis of locations, causal factors and trends is unable to be accurately determined. The crash report system that is currently utilised in New Zealand has served us well.

Design/methodology/approach: In order to achieve our objective, using ADAMS software, standard roads and proving ground events on which the vehicle model was to be driven were simulated. The load time history results were applied to an FEM model created in MSC/Nastran. Modal transient dynamic analysis was used to obtain the stress time history in the test component. Findings: The results showed that fast cornering has a greater damage effect than slow and moderate cornering. For primary evaluation of fatigue life (in our case) the cornering analysis is sufficient. The proving ground events had much more destruction effect than actual <b>roads</b> as the <b>fatigue</b> damage accumulated on our test component. Driving 1568 cycles (2462 km) on a proving ground was equal to driving 200000 km on actual roads. Research limitations/implications: The next stage in this research may be to study the effect of dimensions of proving ground events on accumulated fatigue damage. Practical implications: By using CAE and VPG the time and cost of developing the new models of vehicles decreases. Originality/value: The number of cycles which should be driven on the studied proving ground to achieve the accumulated fatigue damage in design life has been esimated...|$|R
40|$|Flexible road {{pavements}} {{are important}} transport infrastructure in Australia for providing an all weather road network for {{a population of}} 22 million people with land size of about 7 million square kilometres. Between the surfacing types, sprayed seal and thin asphalt are most commonly used by State and Local Governments for rural <b>road</b> construction. Asphalt <b>fatigue</b> and subgrade deformation from repeated loading over time {{are the most common}} failure mechanisms and these in turn are the major attributors to the pavement maintenance and rehabilitation cost. Thin surfacing pavements with a weak road base and foundation often exhibit plastic deformation in the base and subgrade layers. Linear Elastic Theory (LET) and Finite Element Method (FEM) based numerical analyses have been widely used in research to develop pavement models and replicate realistic vehicular loadings. The thin surfacing pavement is modelled using LET and FEM with three-dimensional (3 D) ideal elastic layered system and two-dimensional (2 D) axisymmetrical elements, respectively. The vertical displacements {{at the top of the}} asphalt layer are determined using both LET and FEM and the findings compared to the measured field data. Results show that the deflections generated by the FEM are in closer agreement with the field data. At a horizontal distance of 700 to 1500 mm from the loading significant displacement variances from the field data are found for both LET and FEM.

40|$|Dolomite {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{available}} sedimentary rocks in the territory of Latvia. Dolomite quarries contain about 1, 000 million tons of this material. However, according to Latvian Road Specifications, this dolomite cannot be used for average and high intensity roads because of its low quality, mainly, its LA index (The Los Angeles abrasion test). Therefore, mostly the imported magmatic rocks (granite, diabase, gabbro, basalt) or imported dolomite are used, which makes asphalt expensive. However, practical experience shows that even with these high quality materials <b>roads</b> exhibit rutting, <b>fatigue,</b> and thermal cracks. The aim of the research is to develop a high performance asphalt concrete for base and binder courses using only locally available aggregates. In order to achieve resistance against deformations at a high ambient temperature, a hard grade binder was used. Workability, fatigue and thermal cracking resistance, as well as sufficient water resistance is achieved by low porosity (3 - 5 %) and higher binder content compared to traditional asphalt mixtures. The design of the asphalt includes a combination of empirical and performance based tests, which in laboratory circumstances allow simulating traffic and environmental loads. High performance AC 16 base asphalt concrete was created using local dolomite aggregate with polymer modified (PMB 10 / 40 - 65) and hard grade (B 20 / 30) bitumen. The mixtures were specified based on fundamental properties in accordance with EN 13108 - 1 standard...|$|R
40|$|Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used material in the construction of asphalt pavements. Approximately 650 million tonnes of asphalts for road pavements were produced, worldwide, in 2014. However, the HMA industry is responsible for a substantial consumption of energy, the creation of health and safety issues and has a negative impact on the environment. These shortcomings initiated substantial discussion within the industry with the aim to develop more environmental friendly, sustainable and economic pavement materials. These have resulted in the development of cold bitumen emulsion mixtures (CBEMs). However, to date, low early life stiffness, a slower rate of curing, the length of time necessary to achieve full strength, high air void contents and the presence of moisture in these mixtures have prevented them from being fully embraced by pavement authorities. This led to them being considered inferior to HMA {{because of a lack of}} essential mechanical properties. Currently, the use of CBEMs in pavement construction is limited to low traffic road surface course, reinstatement works and footways. Because of this, the development of CBEMs with high early strength and minimal time delay requirements before structural loading, would be considered as a breakthrough in CBEM research. This research aims to develop a novel, fast-curing and environmentally friendly, cold binder course emulsion asphalt (CBCEA) for heavily trafficked roads. The new CBCEA mixture comprises the same gradation as conventional dense bitumen macadam (DBM) mixtures which are normally used as a binder course and base in road pavements in the UK. The new CBCEA incorporates a new cementitious material, alkali activated binary blended cement filler (ABBCF), made from Paper Making Sludge Ash (PMSA) and a Fluid Catalytic Cracking Catalysts Residue (FC 3 R) activated by a waste NaOH solution (W-NaOH). Incorporation of the PMSA and FC 3 R was achieved through the replacement of conventional limestone filler (LF), while W-NaOH replaced the pre-water necessary to wet the aggregate in the CBCEA. It was found that the glass phases of the new filler particles were broken and reacted with Ca(OH) 2 creating C-S-H gel through the hydration process. This results in a very high early strength and improved mechanical properties. Balanced oxide compositions, within the new filler, were identified as responsible for an enhanced hydration reaction. A laboratory programme of testing measured the stiffness modulus, conducted at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 90 and 180 days. Susceptibility to temperature, wheel track testing to establish rutting resistance, fatigue resistance measured by a four-point beam bending test, fracture resistance testing via semi-circular bending tests, moisture damage resistance and ageing tests were successfully performed. Advanced techniques for microstructure assessment, i. e. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), were used to provide scientific data to provide a deeper understanding of the microstructure and internal composition. An environmental investigation was performed using a Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test. The new ABBCF mixture offers a significant improvement in stiffness modulus compared to HMA and the reference cold binder course mixture containing conventional limestone filler (LF). Target stiffness, according to British and European standards, can be surpassed after less than one day of curing. The new ABBCF mixture offers a stiffness modulus which is 27 times better than the LF mixture after 3 days. This will overcome restrictions caused by the length of time required to achieve acceptable stiffness by traditional CBEMs. More remarkably, the new ABBCF mixture is 78 % better than mixtures treated with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) in terms of ITSM after 3 days. Furthermore, the impact of a rise in temperature on stiffness modulus from 5 to 45 °C, was much larger in LF and both HMA mixtures in comparison to ABBCF, revealing the potential to use these mixes in severe conditions, both hot and cold weathers. ABBCF mixtures displayed considerably reduced susceptibility to permanent deformation, demonstrating the potential advantage of using this material on heavily trafficked <b>roads.</b> <b>Fatigue</b> resistance was noticeably improved by the use of ABBCF in comparison to the reference LF and HMAs. Improved water sensitivity for progressive hydration with the new ABBCF was also established resulting in an enhanced long ageing performance meaning that these mixtures can be considered durable. SEM observation and XRD analysis confirmed the formation of hydration products at various curing times. The concentration of heavy metals in the samples incorporating ABBCF was observed to be less than the regulatory levels determined for hazardous materials. Microwave treatment has proven to be an effective technique to reduce the air void contents of the ABBCF mixture and achieve acceptable levels of porosity. Finally, achieving the aim of the current research will theoretically increase the application of such mixtures and allow them to be used as structural pavement materials. On a further positive note, the inclusion of waste and by-product materials in CBEMs results in more sustainable practice and eliminates disposal problems...|$|R
