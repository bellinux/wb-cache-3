40|$|Execution {{indexing}} uniquely identifies a {{point in}} an execution. Desirable execution indices reveal correlations between points in an execution and establish correspondence between points across multiple executions. Therefore, execution indexing is essential {{for a wide variety}} of dynamic program analyses, for example, it can be used to organize program profiles; it can precisely identify the point in a re-execution that corresponds to a given point in an original execution and thus facilitate debugging or dynamic instrumentation. In this paper, we formally define the concept of execution index and propose an indexing scheme based on execution structure and program state. We present a highly optimized online implementation of the technique. We also perform a client study, which targets producing a failure inducing schedule for a data race by verifying the two alternative happens-before orderings of a <b>racing</b> <b>pair.</b> Indexing is used to precisely locate corresponding points across multiple executions in the presence of non-determinism so that no heavyweight tracing/replay system is needed...|$|E

40|$|Hand-painted scrollDimension: 11 x 105 in. Date: ca. 1700 Important {{ceremonies and}} festivals often {{included}} horse races (kurabeuma). This scroll depicts one such horse race between two samurai dressed in Heian period clothes, one {{in black and}} the other in red, who race from right to left before a varied audience behind a post-and-lintel fence. The <b>racing</b> <b>pair</b> is depicted five times and ends in disaster – one falls off his horse and the other races into a frightened crowd. This representation follows common iconography of Kami (Upper) Kamo shrines horse races, the most important kurabeuma, which was held on the fifth day of the fifth month. The Kami Kamo shrine horse races became a very popular subject for painted scrolls and screens, particularly during the 18 th century. 1 Most surviving examples of Kamo shrine horse races in art include elaborate drawings and sumptuous materials. This scroll, however, consists of simple line drawings with very little color and lacks any kind of backing, suggesting it was a copy or a sketch. It is rare to find this scene depicted at such a late date. By the time of this scroll’s creation, the capital had moved away from Kyoto, and therefore away from the Kamo shrine. Simultaneously, traditional courtly scenes were of decreasing popularity with the rising affluent middle class. 2 And yet, the excitement and powerful symbolism of the mounted samurai performing kurabeuma at the Kamo shrine saved it from completely disappearing as a motif.
