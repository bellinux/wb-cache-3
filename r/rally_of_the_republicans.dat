25|$|Recently, liberal {{parties and}} {{institutions}} {{have made a}} major push for political power. On a continental level, liberals are organised in the Africa Liberal Network, which contains influential parties such as the Popular Movement in Morocco, the Democratic Party in Senegal, and the <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in Côte d'Ivoire. In Asia, several Asian nations have explicitly rejected important liberal principles. Continentally, liberals are organized through the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats, which includes powerful parties such the Liberal Party in the Philippines, the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan, and the Democrat Party in Thailand. A notable example of liberal influence {{can be found in}} India. In India, the most populous democracy in the world, the Indian National Congress has long dominated political affairs.|$|E
5000|$|In Côte d'Ivoire, the <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> (Rassemblement des Republicains, member LI, CDI) is the liberal, main {{government}} party.|$|E
50|$|The changes barred <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> leader Alassane Ouattara from {{standing}} in the presidential elections, {{and was one of}} the catalysts for the Ivorian Civil War.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1946 elections, <b>the</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts (Rassemblement des gauches républicaines), which {{encompassed}} the Radical-Socialist Party, the UDSR {{and other}} conservative parties, unsuccessfully attempted {{to oppose the}} MRP-SFIO-PCF alliance. The new Constituent Assembly included 166 MRP deputies, 153 PCF deputies and 128 SFIO deputies, giving the Tripartite alliance an absolute majority. Georges Bidault (MRP) replaced Félix Gouin as <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> government.|$|R
5000|$|The socialist Félix Gouin succeeded him. A first {{constitutional}} {{draft was}} approved by the National Assembly. It was supported by the Communists and the Socialists. It concentrated power in a unicameral Assembly and abolished <b>the</b> Senate <b>of</b> France. <b>The</b> Christian-Democrats campaigned for the [...] "No" [...] with de Gaulle and the opponents to a constitutional change (the classical Right and <b>the</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts dominated by the Radical Party).|$|R
2500|$|After the war Mitterrand quickly {{moved back}} into politics. At the June 1946 {{legislative}} election, he led <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts (Rassemblement des gauches républicaines or RGR) in <b>the</b> Western suburb <b>of</b> Paris, {{but he was}} not elected. The RGR was an electoral entity composed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Radical Party, the centrist Democratic and Socialist Union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Resistance (Union démocratique et socialiste de la Résistance or UDSR) and several conservative groupings. It opposed <b>the</b> policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Three-parties alliance" [...] (Communists, Socialists and Christian Democrats).|$|R
50|$|In the <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> RDR, {{the ruling}} {{political}} party in Côte d'Ivoire, Aya Virginie Toure is the elected President of the Rally of Republican Women. (Rassemblement des femmes républicaines)(RFR).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> (Rassemblement des Républicains; {{abbreviated}} RDR) is {{a liberal}} party in Ivory Coast (...) [...] The party is the country's governing party; the party's leader, Alassane Ouattara, is the current President of Ivory Coast.|$|E
50|$|After Houphouët-Boigny's {{death in}} 1993, Oble {{was one of}} the {{founding}} members of the <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> with her brother Vincent Lohoues Essoh, who later became Minister of Construction and Town Planning under the transitional government of Robert Guéï.|$|E
5000|$|Advocating {{a presidential}} government, General Charles de Gaulle campaigned for a [...] "No" [...] vote. He warned against <b>the</b> [...] "regime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties" [...] which was, {{according}} to him, {{responsible for the}} 1940 collapse. His followers founded the Gaullist Union. <b>The</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts (an electoral alliance dominated by the Radical Party) and the classical Right also campaigned for a [...] "No", because they were opposed to a constitutional change and to <b>the</b> economic policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three-parties alliance. Despite this, the second constitutional draft was approved by 13 October 1946 referendum.|$|R
50|$|After the war, the Radical Party was reconstituted, {{and formed}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{important}} parties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Republic (1946-58), but never recovered its dominant pre-war position. It failed to prevent <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> projects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three-parties coalition (nationalizations, Welfare State etc.). Along with Democratic and Socialist Union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Resistance, it formed an electoral entity, <b>the</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts (RGR). From 1947, after <b>the</b> split <b>of</b> <b>the</b> governmental coalition, it participated to the Third Force coalition with the SFIO, <b>the</b> Christian-democratic Popular <b>Republican</b> Movement and <b>the</b> liberal-conservative National Centre of Independents and Peasants.|$|R
50|$|The Socialists and the Christian-Democrats {{allied with}} <b>the</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts (composed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Radicals and the Democratic and Socialist Union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Resistance, UDSR) and right-wing groupings {{to form the}} Third Force. This {{coalition}} defended the regime against <b>the</b> opposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Communists on the one hand, and the Gaullists on the other. But this diverse alliance {{did not lead to}} a stable executive power. Indeed, its components advocated opposing policies on the economy, <b>the</b> finances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, secularism (laïcité) and denominational schools. This discontent was beneficial to the Communists and the Gaullists.|$|R
50|$|The presidential coalition, the Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace (composed of the <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> the Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire - African Democratic Rally {{and some}} minor parties) {{won more than}} the half {{the seats in the}} National Assembly.|$|E
5000|$|The Alliance for a New Côte d'Ivoire (Alliance pour une Nouvelle Côte d'Ivoire, ANCI) is an Ivorian {{political}} party {{established as a}} splinter from the <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> on 6 July 2007 {{under the leadership of}} former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.http://www.afriquenligne.fr/news/daily_news/cote_d%92ivoire_:_rdr_dissidents_form_new_political_party_200707071836/ ...|$|E
50|$|Alassane Ouattara, who was Prime Minister from 1990 to 1993, was {{designated}} as the presidential candidate of the <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> (RDR) at a congress of his party held on 1-3 February 2008. At the congress, he invited the New Forces, from whom he had previously distanced himself, to team up with the RDR for the election.|$|E
2500|$|Despite <b>the</b> postwar insignificance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party itself, {{elements}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PSF's and La Rocque's ideology {{strongly influenced}} <b>the</b> political formations <b>of</b> right and centre during the Fourth Republic. La Rocque had advised {{his followers to}} create [...] "a third party, sincerely republican and very bold from a social perspective" [...] — by which he meant Réconciliation Française within <b>the</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts: but for some former PSF loyalists and sympathizers the statement applied more accurately to the newly formed, Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement (Mouvement Républicain Populaire, MRP); and, for others (notably François Mitterrand [...] ), the left-liberal Democratic and Socialist Union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Resistance (UDSR).|$|R
50|$|It {{was founded}} in 1945 by <b>the</b> non-Communist {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resistance network, Movement <b>of</b> National Liberation. <b>The</b> project {{was to create a}} French labour party with all the former non-Communist Resistance. However, this plan failed because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rebirth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Workers' International (SFIO) and <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Christian-Democratic party Popular Republican Movement (MRP) and then <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gaullist party, <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French People (RPF). Henceforth, the UDSR associated itself with the Radical Party, who had been in government during most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Republic, in <b>the</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts (Rassemblement des gauches républicaines or RGR), which presented itself {{as an alternative to the}} tripartisme alliance between the SFIO, the MRP and the French Communist Party (PCF). Its name is a typical example of French sinistrisme, where politicians tended to reject right-wing terms, preferring to label themselves as left-wing.|$|R
25|$|In August 1945, {{following}} <b>the</b> liberation <b>of</b> France, La Rocque and {{his remaining}} followers, principally Pierre de Léotard, André Portier, and Jean de Mierry, established the Parti Républicain Social de la Réconciliation Française (Social Republican Party of French Reconciliation), known generally as Réconciliation Française and intended as <b>the</b> official successor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PSF. On <b>the</b> initiative <b>of</b> Léotard <b>the</b> PRSRF participated in <b>the</b> right-wing <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts (RGR, see sinistrisme) coalition in <b>the</b> elections <b>of</b> June 1946, November 1946, 1951, and 1956. <b>The</b> death <b>of</b> La Rocque in 1946 deprived <b>the</b> party <b>of</b> unifying leadership, however, and the pre-war popularity it {{had hoped to}} exploit never materialized. Though the PRSRF had effectively disappeared by 1956, with the schism that year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RGR into center-left and center-right groups, some of its members would later continue their political careers within the conservative National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP) party.|$|R
50|$|Henriette Diabaté (born March 13, 1935) is an Ivorian {{politician}} and writer. A {{member of the}} <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> (RDR), Diabaté was Minister of Culture in Côte d'Ivoire from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2000; later, she was Minister of Justice from 2003 to 2005. She has been the Secretary-General of the RDR since 1999.|$|E
5000|$|The {{alliance}} {{was established}} on 18 May 2005, seeking {{to reclaim the}} political ideology of the country's founding president, Félix Houphouët-Boigny.

5000|$|On 18 May 2005, the MFA {{was one of}} four parties (along {{with the}} Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire, the <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> and the Union for Democracy and Peace in Côte d'Ivoire) signing an {{agreement}} to form a coalition, the Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace, ahead of the presidential election then planned for October 2005.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Republic, {{the group}} was {{initially}} reincarnated as <b>the</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts group (groupe du Rassemblement des gauches républicaines), with 42 seats following senatorial elections on 8 December 1946, and 86 seats following senatorial elections on 7 November 1948. The group, which envisaged a new rise of radical thought, was however a victim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decline <b>of</b> radicalism, far from achieving its former heights, was subsequently renamed to <b>the</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts and <b>the</b> Democratic Left group (groupe du Rassemblement des gauches républicaines et de la gauche démocratique) in 1949 and later the Democratic Left and <b>the</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts group (groupe de la Gauche démocratique et du rassemblement des gauches républicaines) in 1952, and held 73 seats following senatorial elections on 18 May 1952, increasing to 77 seats following senatorial elections on 19 June 1955. The group returned to its original appellation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Left group (groupe de la Gauche démocratique) in 1956, controlling 62 seats following the final senatorial elections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Republic on 8 June 1958.|$|R
5000|$|The far-right, led by Pierre Poujade, re-appeared {{at about}} the same time. He was a critic of [...] "fiscalism", and leader of a shopkeepers and craftsmens movement. Many voters seemed tired <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{political}} systems numerous ministerial crises, and he had much support in the rural areas, which were in decline. The anticipated legislative elections took place when Faure was defeated by the National Assembly. Even though the French Communist Party re-emerged as the countrys most popular party (for the last time in its history), it did not join the government. A coalition was formed behind Mendès-France and advocated a peaceful resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Algerian conflict. This Republican Front was composed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Workers International (SFIO, socialist party) <b>of</b> Guy Mollet, <b>the</b> Radical Party <b>of</b> Pierre Mendès-France, <b>the</b> Democratic and Socialist Union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Resistance <b>of</b> François Mitterrand and <b>the</b> National Centre <b>of</b> Social Republicans of Jacques Chaban-Delmas. Faure was excluded from the Radical Party - in response he transformed <b>the</b> <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Lefts (which had been abandoned by those groups which had now joined <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Front) into a party that he led, and he campaigned with the center-right parties. The French Communist Party remained the largest party and <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Front obtained a relative majority in order to end the Algerian War.|$|R
50|$|Elections to the French National Assembly {{were held}} in Tunisia on 21 October 1945 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wider French elections.

50|$|A {{parliamentary}} election {{was held in}} Ivory Coast on 11 December 2011, after the presidential election which was held in late 2010. This followed a peace agreement {{between the government and}} the New Forces (former rebels) that was signed in March 2007. The <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> the party of President Alassane Ouattara, won just under half the seats in the National Assembly.|$|E
50|$|Following the 2010 presidential election, {{both the}} {{incumbent}} Laurent Gbagbo and opposition candidate Alassane Ouattara declared victory. Gbago refused {{to step down}} despite the United Nations proclaiming Ouattara the winner. Fighting soon broke out between Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) and Ouattara's <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> (RDR), causing some commentators {{to refer to the}} crisis as the Second Ivorian Civil War.|$|E
5000|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{were held in}} Ivory Coast on 26 November 1995. Ten parties {{and a number of}} independents contested the election, with the <b>Rally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> and the Ivorian Popular Front running under the Republican Front banner. The result was a victory for the ruling Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire - African Democratic Rally (PDCI-RDA), which won 148 of the 175 seats.|$|E
50|$|Elections to the French National Assembly {{were held}} in Tunisia on 2 June 1946 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wider French elections.

60|$|Mr. Burke {{abandoned}} the conversation, then, and confined {{his gaze to}} the landscape as it showed through the window.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Federation shifted {{more and}} more to the right-wing during the inter-war period, partly {{influenced}} by the anti-parliamentary and nationalist leagues as well as affected by a change in its leading elites. In the same time, <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rallied</b> Catholics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Action libérale populaire reinforced the social Catholic trend in its ranks, a change symbolized by Louis Marin's substitution to Auguste Isaac as President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Federation in 1924.|$|R
50|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{were held in}} Ivory Coast on 10 December 2000.
