40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the infrastructure}} provision in East Germany mainly by {{an examination of}} existing literature. At the time of German unification 1990, infrastructure in East Germany was in a very bad condition. After {{more than ten years}} of rebuilding, most of the <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> infrastructure investments is probably in the road sector. Therefore, the planned new motorway connections to Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania as well as to Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia will have to be completed and, furthermore, numerous defects of regional and local road networks will continuously have to be repaired. In the railway sector, the high-speed route Nuremberg-Erfurt as well as improvements in the existing network (as far as they are justified by the prospective transport demand) are on the agenda. The least need for investments is left in the telecommunications and – after realization of current investment plans – in the airport sectors.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present the ICSI speaker diarization system {{submitted}} for the NIST Rich Transcription evaluation (RT 06 s) [1] {{conducted on the}} meetings environment. The presented system {{is based on the}} RT 05 s system, which uses agglomerative clustering with a modified Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) measure to decide which pairs of clusters to merge and to determine when to stop merging clusters. In this year’s system we have eliminated any <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> training data, therefore increasing robustness. In our primary system we have introduced several improvements from last year. First, we use a new trainingfree speech/non-speech detection algorithm. Second, we introduce a new algorithm for system initialization. The third improvement is the use of a frame purification algorithm to increase cluster discriminability. Finally, we describe the use of inter-channel delays as features. We explain each of these improvements and show our system’s results on the official evaluation data using hand-aligned references and forced-alignments. We also analyze some of the results and propose improvements. ...|$|E

In addition to this came along data of initially 100, then 40 intensively measured systems. The results of the measuring data evaluation as well as the results of further accompanying research projects to the Federal-State 1000 Roofs Photovoltaic Programme (e. g. low energy yield analysis, on-site inspections and measuring of nominal powers) are summarised.

40|$|We {{detect a}} dip of 20 - 30 % {{in the surface}} {{brightness}} and number counts of NVSS sources smoothed to a few degrees {{at the location of}} the WMAP cold spot. The dip has structure on scales of ∼ 1 ◦ to 10 ◦. We suggest that the dip in extragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot are physically related, i. e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomaly nor a WMAP foreground correction problem. Since the cold spot originates from structures at modest redshifts, there is no <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen statistically for NVSS source counts, may thus be seen to operate on a single region for the first time.

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{generation}} {{patterns for}} {{wind and solar}} photovoltaic power in Europe are used to investigate the future rise in transmission needs with an increasing penetration of these variable renewable energy sources (VRES) on the pan-European electricity system. VRES growth predictions according to the official National Renewable Energy Action Plans of the EU countries are used and extrapolated logistically up to a fully VRES-supplied power system. We find that keeping today's international net transfer capacities (NTCs) fixed over the next forty years reduces the final need for backup energy by 13 % {{when compared to the}} situation with no NTCs. An overall doubling of today's NTCs will lead to a 26 % reduction, and an overall quadrupling to a 33 % reduction. The <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> backup energy is due to correlations in the generation patterns, and cannot be further reduced by transmission. The main investments in transmission lines are due during the ramp-up of VRES from 15 % (as planned for 2020) to 80 %. Additionally, our results show how the optimal mix between wind and solar energy shifts from about 70 % to 80 % wind share as the transmission grid is enhanced. Finally, we exemplify how reinforced transmission affects the import and export opportunities of single countries during the VRES ramp-up...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Investigating whether {{cognitive}} functioning {{is associated}} with the perception of one's sexuality in old age. Design Cross-sectional analysis, using observation cycle 2005 / 2006 of the population-based prospective cohort of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. Setting Municipal registries in three Dutch regions. Participants 1, 908 older adults (mean [standard deviation] age: 71 [8. 87] years; 54 % women). Measurements Sexuality and intimacy were assessed using four questions. Four cognitive domains were assessed: general cognitive functioning (Mini-Mental State Examination), memory performance (Auditory Verbal Learning Test), processing speed (Coding Task), and fluid intelligence (Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices). Multinomial regression analysis was used, with sexuality as outcome. The interaction effect between gender and sexuality was also tested. Results Lower fluid intelligence was associated with perceiving sexuality as unimportant; lower general cognitive functioning was associated with perceiving sexuality as unimportant; and lower immediate memory recall was associated with evaluating sexual life as unpleasant. Associations were also found between lower fluid intelligence, processing speed, and general cognitive functioning, and agreeing with sexuality no longer being important. Lower processing speed, general cognitive functioning, and delayed memory recall were associated with disagreeing with a <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> intimacy when getting older. Finally, the association between fluid intelligence and perceiving sexuality as important, and the association between immediate memory recall score and evaluating sexual life as pleasant, was only significant in women. The association between lower general cognitive functioning and perceiving sexuality as unimportant seemed stronger in women compared with men.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} no single method to collect, process, and analyze a water sample for all {{pathogenic}} microorganisms of interest. Some of the difficulties in developing a universal method include the physical differences between the major pathogen groups (viruses, bacteria, protozoa), efficiently concentrating large volume water samples to detect low target concentrations of certain pathogen groups, removing co-concentrated inhibitors from the sample, and standardizing a culture-independent endpoint detection method. Integrating the disparate technologies into a single, universal, simple method and detection system would represent a significant advance in public health and microbiological water quality analysis. Recent advances in sample collection, on-line sample processing and purification, and DNA microarray technologies may form the basis of a universal method to detect known and emerging waterborne pathogens.

40|$|After World War II {{public opinion}} in Sweden {{gradually}} recognised {{the need for a}} crusade against crime {{as a threat to the}} state and its inhabitants. The police and responsibility for public prosecution were nationalised, reorganised and placed within the Ministry of Justice. A new authority was established in the Ministry to investigate crime prevention activities (BRA). A new Code on Judicial Procedure, 1942 (in force 1948) had replaced previous legislation on civil and criminal court procedure. The legislation on crime and penal sanctions was gradually reformed and a new Criminal Code was adopted 1962 (in force 1964). Tort law, which had for long been unco-ordinated was finally collected in the Tort Liability Act, 1972 supplemented by the Criminal Injuries Compensa-tion Act, 1978. These codes and Acts have later been amended, sometimes to the benefit of victims of crime. During this period the need for state compensation to victims of crime slowly attracted special attention. From a cautious beginning in 1948 the state gradually took on responsibility for adjudged economic compensation to the victim, not obtained from the offender. The social welfare system covers costs for medical and social treatment and care and losses by industrial injury etc. Other economic losses are often compensated by the victim's insurance. The <b>remaining</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> compensation mainly refers to criminal violation of the victim's integrity and the effects of harm caused by the offence.

40|$|The power {{consumption}} due to air-conditioning of buildings becomes particularly significant {{in an urban}} environment because {{the temperature of the}} air of dense urban districts is higher than in the suburbs. This phenomenon, as well as the increase in the standards of living and other factors namely heatwaves, contribute to the growth of the traditionally low demand for artificial air-conditioning in Europe. Case studies make it possible to measure the heat island effect (the accumulation of heat in cities), to characterize the additional electricity consumption of the buildings in an urban environment, and to give an overall picture of the practices, techniques and materials, which can help to cool the cities. Priority is given to the practices which avoid the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> artificial air-conditioning by taking into account the environment, the use of vegetation and "cool" materials for the construction of pavements and buildings. <b>For</b> the <b>remaining</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> air-conditioning, the present systems of air-conditioning can also become more energy efficient. Case studies conducted in Seville made it possible to measure the dispersion of the <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> air-conditioning around their average value for the various zones of the city.
