50|$|Seed {{trees are}} trees left after <b>reproduction</b> <b>cutting</b> to provide seeds for natural {{regeneration}} in the seed-tree method. These trees serve {{as both the}} gene source for the new crop of regeneration and {{as a source of}} timber during future cuttings. Because of its importance, a seed tree should be carefully chosen based upon both economic and biological factors. Selected seed trees should be the desired species, phenotypically superior, prolific in seeding and flowering, sturdy and healthy, free of damage, and of good growth form.|$|E
40|$|To {{contribute}} {{to an understanding of}} forest management on secondary forest succession, we conducted vegetation surveys in a chronosequence of pine stands ranging in age from 1 to 59 years. Adjacent areas were compared at 1, 7, 12, and 17 years following two <b>reproduction</b> <b>cutting</b> methods (clearcuts or pine seed-tree cuts); a 59 -year-old pine stand that was periodically thinned was also included to represent conditions before <b>reproduction</b> <b>cutting.</b> Because average or better natural loblolly and shortleaf pine (Pinus tuedu L. and Z? echinatu Mill.) seed crops coincided with the planned site disturbances, pines dominated the seedling-size classes at 1 and 7 years after <b>reproduction</b> <b>cutting,</b> the sapling-size classes at 7, 12, and 17 years after <b>reproduction</b> <b>cutting,</b> and the small- and large-tree size classes at 12, 17, and 59 years after <b>reproduction</b> <b>cutting.</b> For seedlingsize classes, three measures of woody plant diversity (Shannon’s (H’), Simpson’s (D), and evenness (e) indices) tended to increase from 1 to 12 years after <b>reproduction</b> <b>cutting.</b> In the sapling-size classes, H ’ and D diversity indices were highest at 17 years and lowest at 59 years after <b>reproduction</b> <b>cutting.</b> For small-tree size classes, H’, and D were highest at 7 years and lowest at 12 years after <b>reproduction</b> <b>cutting.</b> Across all but the large-tree size classes, woody species richness peaked 7 years after <b>reproduction</b> <b>cutting.</b> Naturally regenerated pines achieved complete crown closure by 17 years after reproduction cutting; consequently, the presence of shade-tolerant woody plants increased in the understory, and shade-intolerant herbaceous plants disappeared from the forest floor.

This study investigated the effects of silvicultural treatment, season, and time-since-treatment on the perceived scenic beauty of 20 pine-oak plots on the Ouachita National Forest, Arkansas. Treatments consisted of reproduction cuts in which hardwoods were reduced to varying levels of stocking. An earlier study conducted on the same plots (Gramann & Rudis, 1994) served as a basis to study the effect of elapsed time since <b>reproduction</b> <b>cutting</b> on the publics perceptions of a plot's scenic beauty. Color slides were taken of the plots two years and six years after treatment. In 1992, Texas A&M University undergraduate students rated 320 slides of the plots for scenic beauty. The process was repeated for this study, using slides of the same scenes from year 6. Ratings were made using a ten-point scale. Raw ratings were then converted to scenic beauty estimates (SBEs). Using analysis of variance, time-since-treatment was found to be significant in the perception of scenic beauty. The mean SBE from year 2 was- 3. 01 while the mean from year 6 was 40. 3 1. This finding is consistent with research that has found larger d diminished evidence of human manipulation to trees, increased natural complexity, an promote higher scenic-beauty values. Treatment type had a significant effect on scenic beauty. Control (untreated) plots were higher in scenic beauty than plots that had been treated. The season of the year in which a slide was taken also {{played a significant role in}} the perception of scenic beauty. All seasons were significantly different from each other. Summer garnered the highest SBEs while winter had the lowest. This is consistent with previous research which has found that forest scenes with large amounts of green are rated as higher in scenic beauty than are scenes with large counts of brown. Recovery and growth of Woody species should increase visual complexity and perceived naturalness thus increasing scenic beauty. Treatment type and time-since-treatment significantly interacted to affect perceived scenic beauty. Four years after the initial scenic-beauty study, differences in scenic-beauty scores between treatments had diminished...|$|E

50|$|At least 7 {{variable}} {{factors may}} influence seed germination: (1) seed characteristics, (2) light, (3) oxygen, (4) soil reaction (ph), (5) temperature, (6) moisture, and (7) seed enemies. Moisture and temperature {{are the most}} influential, and both are affected by exposure. The difficulty of securing natural regeneration of Norway spruce and Scots pine in northern Europe led {{to the adoption of}} various forms of <b>reproduction</b> <b>cuttings</b> that provided partial shade or protection to seedlings from hot sun and wind. The main objective of echeloned strips or border-cuttings with northeast exposure was to protect regeneration from overheating, and was originated in Germany and deployed successfully by Alarik (1925) and others in Sweden. On south and west exposures, direct insolation and heat reflected from tree trunks often result in temperatures lethal to young seedlings, as well as desiccation of the surface soil, which inhibits germination. The sun is less injurious on eastern exposures because of the lower temperature in the early morning, related to higher humidity and presence of dew.|$|R

40|$|The acorn worm Balanoglossus simodensis reproduces asexually by {{fragmentation}} and subsequent regeneration {{from the body}} fragments. We examined the morphogenesis of its asexual reproduction. At first, we collected asexually reproducing specimens and observed their morphogenesis. Then, we succeeded in inducing the asexual <b>reproduction</b> artificially by <b>cutting</b> the worm {{at the end of}} the genital region. The process of morphogenesis is completely the same between naturally collected and artificially induced specimens. The stages during morphogenesis were established on the basis of the external features of the asexually reproducing fragments. The internal features of the fragments were also examined at each stage. In a separate phase of the study, the capacity for regeneration of some body parts was also examined by dividing intact worms into about 10 fragments. Although the capacity for regeneration varied among the different body parts, some fragments regenerated into complete individuals in 1 month. The process of regeneration was the same as that in the asexually produced fragments...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Apomixis means seed {{formation}} without fertilization. In cassava (Manihot esculenta) {{it is an}} alternative to <b>reproduction</b> by <b>cuttings,</b> which normally transmits pathogens and leads to an accumulation of viral and bacterial diseases. Apomixis also assures preservation of heterosis and avoids genetic segregation. It occurs in wild relatives of cassava and has been transferred successfully from Manihot glaziovii and M. neusana. It is facultative, and occurs at a low frequency, ranging from 1 - 2 %, and apparently is genetically different from apomixis in other crops. With selection, the frequency can reach 13 %. Apomixis in cassava is frequently associated with aneuploidy but it does occur in some diploid types. It {{is due to the}} formation of aposporic sacs, which can easily be detected by clearing tissue preparations. Apomixis appears to have {{played an important role in}} speciation during the evolution of Manihot, since it leads to the maintenance and perpetuation of sterile interspecific hybridization. The use of apomixis in cassava breeding could lead to a boom in line improvement and commercial production. In addition to preserving superior genotypes, avoiding contamination of new plants, it would enable international programs to export their germplasm to destination countries. This would allow the use of superior genotypes even if apomixis occurs at a low frequency. A scheme to maximize benefits is to use diploid apomictic clones as maternal parents, which can be crossed with pollinators of polyploid interspecific hybrids, followed by selection among the progeny of new apomictic types that combine the heteroses of both interspecifi...|$|R
25|$|Although some sugarcanes produce seeds, modern stem cutting {{has become}} the most common <b>reproduction</b> method. Each <b>cutting</b> must contain at least one bud, and the {{cuttings}} are sometimes hand-planted. In more technologically advanced countries like the United States and Australia, billet planting is common. Billets harvested from a mechanical harvester are planted by a machine that opens and recloses the ground. Once planted, a stand can be harvested several times; after each harvest, the cane sends up new stalks, called ratoons. Successive harvests give decreasing yields, eventually justifying replanting. Two to 10 harvests are usually made {{depending on the type of}} culture. In a country with a mechanical agriculture looking for a high production of large fields, like in North America, sugar canes are replanted after two or three harvests to avoid a lowering in yields. In countries with a more traditional type of agriculture with smaller fields and hand harvesting, like in the French island la Réunion, sugar canes are often harvested up to 10 years before replanting.|$|R
40|$|Boswellia papyrifera (Del) Hochst {{is a key}} {{dry land}} plant species in the Horn of Africa with high {{socio-economic}} significance in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan. In recent decades, populations of this species are declining {{due to lack of}} recruitment through natural regeneration. This study investigated the potential of vegetative propagation using leafless branch cuttings as an alternative means of reproduction for the species. The effect of time of collection and cutting sizes (length and thickness) on shooting and rooting of the cuttings was investigated. The effects of these three factors were analysed, two-by-two, in three separate factorial experiments each arranged in a randomized complete block design. Time of collection affected cutting performance: shooting percent, shoot number, cutting vigour, leaf number, leaf length, rooting percent and root length were best when cuttings were collected in February–March, and weakest in May. Medium to long cuttings (1. 0 m– 2. 0 m) and thicker cuttings (0. 19 – 0. 27 m) performed better than shorter or thinner cuttings. These results indicate that B. papyrifera is amenable to macro-propagation via leafless branch <b>cuttings.</b> <b>Reproduction</b> of B. papyrifera through macro-propagation may help overcome the population recruitment bottleneck of this important species and will help the long-term yield possibilities of its precious product frankincens...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) {{is a major}} parasite {{of cotton}} in the U. S., and management tactics for this nematode attempt to minimize population levels. We compared three post-harvest practices {{for their ability to}} reduce nematode population levels in the field, thereby reducing initial nematode population for the next year's crop. The three practices tested were: 1) chemical defoliation before harvest plus cutting cotton stalks after harvest, 2) chemical defoliation plus applying a herbicide to kill plants prior to cutting the stalks, and 3) chemical defoliation without cutting stalks. Experiments were conducted in both the greenhouse and in the field. The greenhouse experiments demonstrated that M. incognita reproduction (measured as egg counts and root gall rating indices) was significantly greater when stalks were not cut. Cutting stalks plus applying herbicide to kill cotton roots did not significantly reduce nematode <b>reproduction</b> compared to <b>cutting</b> stalks alone. In field experiments, cutting stalks reduced egg populations and root galling compared to defoliation without stalk cutting. In a greenhouse bioassay which used soil from the field plots, plants grown in soil from the defoliation only treatment had greater root gall ratings and egg counts than in the stalk cutting plus herbicide treatment. Therefore, we conclude that cutting cotton stalks immediately after harvest effectively reduces M. incognita reproduction, and may lead to a lower initial population density of this nematode in the following year...|$|R
40|$|In Indonesia, cocoa <b>reproduction</b> by <b>cuttings</b> is undeveloped {{yet because}} the {{available}} technology {{is more expensive}} than the other clonal reproduction methods. The success of cocoa cuttings is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The purpose of this research is to study effect of endogenous auxin content, effects of light intensity and exogenous auxin application, on the rooted cuttings. The 2 nd research purpose is to study effects of PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidon) and IBA (β-indole-butyric acid), clones, and microclimate. The experiment was conducted in Kaliwining Experimental Station of Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute in Jember (45 m a. s. l. and D rainfall type according to Schmidt Ferguson). The design for the 1 st experiment was splitsplit plot, replicated three times. The main plot was light intensity inside the roof, i. e. 15 %, 30 %, and 45 % to direct sun radiation. The sub plot was cocoa clones, i. e. DR 2 and ICS 13, and the sub-sub plot was IBA concentration, i. e. 0 ppm, 1500 ppm, 3000 ppm and 4500 ppm. The 2 nd experiment was designed factorial 3 x 3 of CRD, replicated 3 times. Clones of KW 163, KW 162 and KW 165, and IBA at 0, 3000, and 6000 ppm were the factors. In the same time, effect of IBA 6000 ppm, PVP 6000 ppm IBA+PVP 6000 ppm, and control were observed using KW 165 clone, and designed in complete randomized design (CRD), replicated 3 times. The result showed that auxin content of ICS 13 was higher than DR 2 (62. 67 ppm vs 40. 90 ppm) so that gave higher rooted cuttings and more root number. Exogenous application of IBA improved auxin content of the cutting materials and promoted root growth. The optimum IBA concentration for root number was 3500 ppm. Light intensity of 45 % improved number of rooted cuttings three times compared to 15 %, however compared to the 2 nd research, percentage of rooted cuttings was still very low. Cocoa cutting method to gain rooted cuttings 80 — 90 % has been obtained. The method was using IBA 3000 ppm or 6000 ppm mixtured with or without PVP 6000 ppm, conducted during rainy season, the nursery using permanent shade trees of leucena sp., temperature of 24 — 27 oC and relative humidity was 78 — 87 %. PVP was supposed inhibit oxidation of IBA so that the effect of IBA was more optimum. The response of KW 162, KW 163 and KW 165 clones to root were similar. Rooted cuttings during dry season was low due to the less fresh of cutting materials and high temperature inside the bed roof.
