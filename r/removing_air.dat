25|$|Before the 18th century, {{science courses}} were taught almost {{exclusively}} through formal lectures. The structure of courses {{began to change}} in {{the first decades of the}} 18th century, when physical demonstrations were added to lectures. Pierre Polinière and Jacques Rohault were among the first individuals to provide demonstrations of physical principles in the classroom. Experiments ranged from swinging a bucket of water at the end of a rope, demonstrating that centrifugal force would hold the water in the bucket, to more impressive experiments involving the use of an air-pump. One particularly dramatic air-pump demonstration involved placing an apple inside the glass receiver of the air-pump, and <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> until the resulting vacuum caused the apple to explode. Polinière’s demonstrations were so impressive that he was granted an invitation to present his course to Louis XV in 1722.|$|E
500|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is {{not typically}} dangerous {{in and of}} itself, however {{it can be a}} symptom of very dangerous underlying conditions, such as pneumothorax. [...] Although the underlying conditions require treatment, subcutaneous emphysema usually does not; small amounts of air are reabsorbed by the body. [...] However, subcutaneous emphysema can be uncomfortable and may interfere with breathing, and is often treated by <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> from the tissues, for example by using large bore needles, skin incisions or subcutaneous catheterization.|$|E
500|$|In {{severe cases}} of {{subcutaneous}} emphysema, catheters {{can be placed}} in the subcutaneous tissue to release the air. Small cuts, or [...] "blow holes", may be made in the skin to release the gas. [...] When subcutaneous emphysema occurs due to pneumothorax, a chest tube is frequently used to control the latter; this eliminates the source of the air entering the subcutaneous space. [...] If the volume of subcutaneous air is increasing, {{it may be that the}} chest tube is not <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> rapidly enough, so it may be replaced with a larger one. Suction may also be applied to the tube to remove air faster. The progression of the condition can be monitored by marking the boundaries with a special pencil for marking on skin.|$|E
30|$|Chitosan {{solution}} (5 %) and 1 % PEO solution {{were first}} prepared separately by dissolving chitosan in 0.5 M acetic acid, then vacuumed in an oven at 0.8 Torr to <b>remove</b> <b>air</b> bubbles[17]. Solutions containing 0.5 wt.% of Triton X- 100 ™ and 5 to 10 wt.% of DMSO were {{mixed with the}} chitosan/PEO solutions, and the mixtures were again stirred for 16 h and vacuumed to <b>remove</b> <b>air</b> bubbles before use.|$|R
30|$|The {{core sample}} was {{evacuated}} for 2  h to <b>remove</b> <b>air</b> and then fully saturated with brines. The core permeability to brine was evaluated.|$|R
50|$|Advantages: Rotary {{pumps are}} very {{efficient}} because they naturally <b>remove</b> <b>air</b> from the lines, {{eliminating the need}} to bleed the air from the lines manually.|$|R
50|$|A {{cloud chamber}} {{can also be}} used to {{simulate}} adiabatic ascent in the atmosphere through the decrease of pressure by <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> inside the chamber. A series of equations shown in the section below show how the LWC is obtained in this procedure. (Thompson, 2007).|$|E
50|$|CFB {{technology}} is {{an advanced method}} for burning coal and other fuels efficiently while <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> emissions inside the sophisticated combustor system. CFB technology provides flexibility in utility operations because {{a wide variety of}} solid fuels can be used, including high-sulfur, high-ash coal and petroleum coke.|$|E
50|$|An {{airtight}} chamber is maintained by <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> {{from the inside}} of the chamber using a vacuum pump. The products to be cooled are kept in that {{airtight chamber}}. As the pressure is reduced the boiling point of water reduces and water starts to evaporate, taking the heat from the product. As a consequence of this evaporation the product temperature begins to decrease. This cooling process of the products continues until it reaches the desired product temperature.|$|E
50|$|Aerated Mud. Air {{or another}} gas is {{injected}} into the flow of drilling mud. Degassing units are required to <b>remove</b> <b>air</b> {{before it can be}} recirculated.|$|R
50|$|Eco-block can <b>remove</b> <b>air</b> {{pollutant}} such as nitrogen oxide(NOx), {{which causes}} acid rain. Eco-block converts toxic air pollutants into harmless compounds by decomposition. Also, it help to reduce exhaust gases from roadside vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Later, some {{manufacturers}} started to use Nitrogen flush to <b>remove</b> <b>air</b> and bacteria from their cans to prolong shelf life to 30 years or longer, making the water suitable for long term storage.|$|R
5000|$|Vacuum packing is {{a method}} of {{packaging}} that removes air from the package prior to sealing. This method involves (manually or automatically) placing items in a plastic film package, <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> from inside, and sealing the package. [...] Shrink film is sometimes {{used to have a}} tight fit to the contents. The intent of vacuum packing is usually to remove oxygen from the container to extend the shelf life of foods and, with flexible package forms, to reduce the volume of the contents and package.|$|E
50|$|Sectors in {{the syringe}} and needle market include {{disposable}} and safety syringes, injection pens, needleless injectors, insulin pumps, and specialty needles. Hypodermic syringes are used with hypodermic needles to inject liquid or gases into body tissues, or to {{remove from the}} body. Injecting of air into a blood vessel is hazardous, as it may cause an air embolism; preventing embolisms by <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> from the syringe {{is one of the}} reasons for the familiar image of holding a hypodermic syringe pointing upward, tapping it, and expelling a small amount of liquid before an injection into the bloodstream.|$|E
50|$|A stripper, or tube stripper, is {{a medical}} tool used for <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> or liquid from rubber tubes, such as those used for {{infusion}} or connecting bags used when blood is collected and processed in a blood bank. Its design {{is similar to a}} pair of pliers, but the jaws do not quite close (providing space enough for a flattened, empty tube) and have cylinders that can be rolled along the tube similar to the mechanism of a peristaltic pump. A stripper may be used, for instance, to move blood that remains in the tube {{at the end of a}} blood collection into the bag, thus avoiding wastage.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Autoclaves such as {{this one}} are {{standard}} equipment in professional piercing studios, helping to prevent infection. This type uses a vacuum pump to <b>remove</b> <b>air</b> from the chamber before sterilizing sealed packages of items for later use.|$|R
50|$|The Internal Peacekeeping Law, {{which allowed}} {{for the use of}} {{military}} force against demonstrators, was abolished on 29 June, and on 1 August, he <b>removed</b> <b>Air</b> Chief Marshal Kaset, General Issarapong, and General Chainarong, the First Regional Army Commander, from their posts.|$|R
25|$|Some systems (notably the Swissmetro system) {{propose the}} use of vactrains—maglev train {{technology}} used in evacuated (airless) tubes, which <b>removes</b> <b>air</b> drag. This {{has the potential to}} increase speed and efficiency greatly, as most of the energy for conventional maglev trains is lost to aerodynamic drag.|$|R
50|$|In February 2009, O2 {{became the}} first mobile {{telecommunications}} provider to be certified with the Carbon Trust Standard in recognition of its commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. O2 attained the standard after saving 47,000 tonnes of carbon over the previous three years through its energy efficiency measures, including a £1.4 million distribution of smart metering technology across the company's cell sites, offices and retail stores, and upgrades to more energy efficient systems across its mobile phone network. In addition to distributing energy efficient LED lighting and boiler system controls, the company was also able to reduce energy use by <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> conditioning units from some of its cell sites and reducing computer monitor standby times.|$|E

5000|$|A {{cultipacker}} is a {{piece of}} agricultural equipment that crushes dirt clods, <b>removes</b> <b>air</b> pockets, and presses down small stones, forming a smooth, firm seedbed. Where seed has been broadcast, the roller gently firms the soil around the seeds, ensuring shallow seed placement and excellent seed-to-soil contact.|$|R

50|$|Robert J. MacLean (born March 8, 1970 in Torrejon Air Base, Spain) is a United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) air marshal. On December 8, 2015, the United States Merit Systems Protection Board's November 3, 2015 ruling, in MacLean's favor, became final {{after the}} United States Department of Homeland Security {{chose not to}} appeal. The {{decision}} legally designates MacLean a protected federal employee whistleblower. On July 28, 2003, he made disclosures to national media about a strict dress policy that exposed air marshals' identities, and a proposed TSA operational plan that he believed would have reduced aviation security: <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> marshals from long distance, nonstop flights to save on hotel costs. TSA reversed all of the policies MacLean blew the whistle on. He was fired on April 11, 2006, and has claimed whistleblower protections.|$|E
50|$|Bocci's {{success as}} a company allowed Arbel to move several more designs into production, notably 22 and 28. 22 is a {{collection}} of electrical accessories designed without the visual disruption of a cover plate, allowing outlets and switches to sit flush with their surroundings. Arbel was awarded a Red Dot Award and a Yellow Pencil yearbook entry at the D&AD awards in 2009 for 22. 28 is a hand-blown glass pendant with interior glass satellites that is available in a multitude of colours. It is created through a complicated technique that involves adding and <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> while heating and cooling a glass matrix. It is emblematic of Arbel’s search for “specificity in manufacturing,” essentially designing a system that produces form rather than designing the form itself. Arbel received an iF product design award and the Best of Year Award from Interior Design Magazine in 2011 for 28.|$|E
5000|$|Natural {{ventilation}} is {{the process}} of supplying air to and <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> from an indoor space without using mechanical systems. It refers to the flow of external air to an indoor space as a result of pressure differences arising from natural forces. There are two types of natural ventilation occurring in buildings: wind driven ventilation and buoyancy-driven ventilation. Wind driven ventilation arises from the different pressures created by wind around a building or structure, and openings being formed on the perimeter which then permit flow through the building. Buoyancy-driven ventilation occurs {{as a result of the}} directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior. Since the internal heat gains which create temperature differences between the interior and exterior are created by natural processes including the heat from people, and wind effects are variable, naturally ventilated buildings are sometimes called [...] "breathing buildings".|$|E
30|$|Sugar maple, Norway maple, and aspen logs {{measuring}} approximately 81 – 96  cm {{in length}} by approximately 15 – 25  cm diameter were inoculated with liquid media and incubated in a {{temperature and humidity}} controlled chamber for 12  weeks. After incubation, logs were <b>removed,</b> <b>air</b> dried for 1  week, cut, and analyzed as described above.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{completion}} of the surgical procedure, the chest is closed. One or more chest tubes—with one end inside the opened pleural cavity and the other submerged under saline solution inside a sealed container, forming an airtight drainage system—are necessary to <b>remove</b> <b>air</b> and fluid from the pleural cavity, preventing the development of pneumothorax or hemothorax.|$|R

50|$|In subways, {{derailment}} {{is usually}} less dangerous (speeds are lower, trains cannot jackknife in tunnels and so on). It {{is dangerous to}} stop in a tunnel if a fire develops; an emergency exit could lead to electrocution by the third rail (typically energized with 825 volts DC). Instead drivers try to reach the next station, even in an emergency. As a result, there are no emergency brakes directly visible to passengers. However, there are hidden stop valves and simplified train controls, allowing each car to act on its own in need. In an emergency, there are door-control handles (visible to passengers) which are intended to make the pneumatic train doors able to be opened by <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> pressure. Subway trains have mechanisms and alarms which prevent trains from moving if the doors are open, and alert the driver or engage the brakes if doors open while a train is moving. Penalties for misuse of emergency door-opening handles {{are similar to those}} for stop-valve misuse.|$|E
5000|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} {{can result}} from puncture of parts of the respiratory or gastrointestinal systems. Particularly {{in the chest and}} neck, air may become trapped as a result of penetrating trauma (e.g., gunshot wounds or stab wounds) or blunt trauma. Infection (e.g., gas gangrene) can cause gas to be trapped in the subcutaneous tissues. Subcutaneous emphysema can be caused by medical procedures and medical conditions that cause the pressure in the alveoli of the lung to be higher than that in the tissues outside of them. [...] Its most common causes are pneumothorax and a chest tube that has become occluded by a blood clot or fibrinous material. It can also occur spontaneously due to rupture of the alveoli with dramatic presentation. [...] When the condition is caused by surgery it is called surgical emphysema. The term spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema is used when the cause is not clear. Subcutaneous emphysema is not typically dangerous in and of itself, however it can be a symptom of very dangerous underlying conditions, such as pneumothorax. [...] Although the underlying conditions require treatment, subcutaneous emphysema usually does not; small amounts of air are reabsorbed by the body. However, subcutaneous emphysema can be uncomfortable and may interfere with breathing, and is often treated by <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> from the tissues, for example by using large bore needles, skin incisions or subcutaneous catheterization.|$|E
40|$|A {{device is}} {{described}} suitable for <b>removing</b> <b>air</b> from water under both zero and one g gravity conditions. The device {{is comprised of}} a pair of spaced membranes, one being hydrophobic and the other being hydrophilic. The air-water mixture is introduced into the space between, and the selective action of the membranes removes the air from the water...|$|E
25|$|The {{cylinder}} {{also has}} an air vacuum chamber which <b>removes</b> <b>air</b> bubbles from the dough before extruding. Otherwise small bubbles will form in the pasta and decreases the mechanical strength which cause breakage from hours to days after drying. The air also oxidizes the carotenoid or xanthophyll which results in a white, chalky appearance of the pasta.|$|R
50|$|A {{change in}} residence, however, loomed {{on the horizon}} for the 48th. Disagreements arose {{concerning}} atomic storage and custody issues within NATO, resulting in a decision to <b>remove</b> <b>Air</b> Force atomic-capable units from French soil. Simultaneously, {{the advent of the}} inter-continental ballistic missile had reduced the United States’ dependence on European-based airborne medium- and long-range bombers.|$|R
50|$|The Merrill-Crowe Process is a {{separation}} technique for removing gold from the solution {{obtained by the}} cyanide leaching of gold ores. It is an improvement of the MacArthur-Forrest process, where an additional vacuum is managed to <b>remove</b> <b>air</b> in the solution (invention of Crowe), and zinc dust is used instead of zinc shavings (improvement of Merril).|$|R
