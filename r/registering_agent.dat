40|$|Concept maps (CMs), as {{pedagogical}} tools, have {{well established}} uses to support teaching, learning, and knowledge assessment. This chapter {{focuses on the}} use of CMs as knowledge assessment tools. The CM-based adaptive intelligent knowledge assessment system (IKAS) is described. The kernel of the IKAS is the intelligent knowledge assessment agent which is implemented as a multi-agent system consisting of the agent-expert, the communication agent, the knowledge evaluation agent, and the interaction <b>registering</b> <b>agent.</b> The knowledge evaluation agent compares the teacher’s and the learner’s CMs on the basis of graph patterns and assigns score for a submitted solution. Five-year long experience of developing and using IKAS has resulted in improvements and extensions of the system’s functionality and adaptivity. Evolution of IKAS and its characteristics are summarized. This chapter presents student opinions elicited from questionnaires about CMs as knowledge assessment tools. The results of the practical use of four versions of IKAS in different study courses are described...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays concept maps as a {{pedagogical}} tool have stable {{positions in}} education {{because they are}} used for teaching, learning and knowledge assessment. The paper gives the basic conceptions of concept maps and their usage for knowledge assessment. The concept map based multiagent adaptive intelligent knowledge assessment system (IKAS) is described from the systems and interior structure’s viewpoint. The kernel of the IKAS is the intelligent knowledge assessment agent consisting of the agent-expert, the communication agent, the knowledge evaluation agent and the interaction <b>registering</b> <b>agent.</b> The knowledge assessment agent using the comparison algorithm based on graph patterns compares a teacher’s and a learner’s concept maps and assigns score for submitted solution. Five years experience of the IKAS practical use along with student feedback gathered in questionnaires {{is the driving force}} for extension of the functionality of the system. The paper presents student opinion about concept maps as knowledge assessment tool confirming that concept maps help systematization of knowledge and construction of its structure, and promote logical thinking. Evaluation results of four prototypes of the system used for knowledge assessment in different study courses are described. Evolution of the IKAS is reflected and its characteristics are summarized...|$|E
50|$|<b>Registered</b> <b>agent</b> - Almost all {{the states}} require every {{corporation}} to have a <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> of their own {{in the state of}} incorporation. <b>Registered</b> <b>agents</b> will receive all the important legal as well as tax documents on behalf of the corporation. A typical <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> will need a physical address (P.O box nos.) in the state of incorporation and should be accessible during normal business hours.|$|R
50|$|Different {{states have}} {{different}} requirements for <b>registered</b> <b>agents.</b> Typically, the agent {{must be a}} natural person resident {{of the state in}} question or, in states that allow entities to serve as <b>registered</b> <b>agents,</b> an entity having a business office within the state and authorized to do business in the state. In some states a business entity is legally allowed to act as its own <b>registered</b> <b>agent,</b> if at least one of its officers is a resident of the state, but other jurisdictions may require that a business entity designate a third party as its registered agent.Because most states permit one business entity to serve as a <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> for others, some businesses exist to serve that exact function, charging a fee to act as the <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> for hundreds or thousands of businesses in a given state.|$|R
5000|$|In United States {{business}} law, a <b>registered</b> <b>agent,</b> {{also known}} as a resident agent or statutory agent, is a business or individual designated to receive service of process (SOP) when a business entity is a party in a legal action such as a lawsuit or summons. The <b>registered</b> <b>agent's</b> address may also be where the state sends the paperwork for the periodic renewal of the business entity's charter (if required). The <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> for a business entity may be an officer or employee of the company, or a third party, such as the organization's lawyer or a service company. Failure to properly maintain a <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> can affect a company negatively.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} the experience obtained {{during the last}} decade from usage of developed system IKAS. The IKAS is the adaptive intelligent system for knowledge assessment and selfassessment based on concept maps (CMs). The kernel of the IKAS is the intelligent knowledge assessment agent which is implemented as a multiagent system. The latter consists of the agentexpert, the communication agent, the knowledge evaluation agent, and the interaction <b>registering</b> <b>agent.</b> The knowledge evaluation agent compares a teacher’s and a learner’s CMs on the basis of graph patterns taking or not into account semantics of links (depending on the given tasks) and assigns score for a submitted solution. The paper focuses on architecture and general principles of functioning of the IKAS, the variety of provided tasks, changing of the degree of task difficulty, system’s feedback and scoring and adaptation mechanisms. Lessons learnt from practical testing of the IKAS in different study courses are discussed both from teachers and students point of view. The advantages of knowledge assessment based on CMs are at least twofold — it is possible to assess students’ knowledge structure and to automate the assessment process thus reducing the workload of teachers. At the same time from the usage of the IKAS it is concluded that CM based knowledge assessment is very well suitable for self-assessment, but it is not fully acceptable for giving the final marks to students for their knowledge in the subject. Results of practical use of the IKAS are presented...|$|E
5000|$|The Secretary of State acts as <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> for {{all foreign}} corporations, limited {{partnerships}} and {{limited liability companies}} unless an additional agent has been appointed.

50|$|Some state {{business}} entity laws name the Secretary of State's office or {{business entity}} filing office as the <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> of last resort, {{in the event}} the named <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> can't be found.

MoRAA eliminated this provision but some of the states that adopted MoRAA maintained this provision.|$|R
5000|$|Technically {{any person}} may {{incorporate}} an IBC or a CAC by subscribing and filing the Articles of Incorporation, but as all IBCs and CACs {{are required by}} law to maintain a <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> at all times, in practice the <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> will invariable deal with the incorporation procedure.

40|$|The 2007 Model <b>Registered</b> <b>Agents</b> Act (“the Act”), {{combined}} with statutory amendments and repeals, consolidates provisions regarding {{service of process}} and <b>registered</b> <b>agents</b> {{for a wide variety}} of Arkansas businesses. This article provides an overview of the essential provisions of the Act and its effects on business entities, agents, and third parties. Additionally, it offers a brief assessment of how the provisions change prior law. The Act is much more extensive than the business entity statute provisions it replaced. The provisions of the Act address commercial agents, duties of agents, jurisdiction and venue, and provide detailed rules for service of process when a <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> cannot be served with reasonable diligence. A substantive set of new provisions in the Act relate to the concept of the “commercial <b>registered</b> <b>agent.</b> ” The Act also contains an important provision that has no precursor under Arkansas law, which gives a specific recitation of a <b>registered</b> <b>agent’s</b> duties, regardless of whether an agent is a commercial <b>registered</b> <b>agent.</b> The main benefits of this Act are that the rules are now consistent, thorough, and collected in a single place, making Arkansas law more clear and simple for both businesses and persons needing to obtain service over them...|$|R

5000|$|Most jurisdictions in the United States {{require that}} any {{business}} entity that is formed or doing business within their borders designate {{and maintain a}} [...] "registered agent". This person may {{be known as the}} [...] "resident agent" [...] or [...] "statutory agent", depending on the laws of the individual jurisdiction in which the business entity is registered. The purpose of a <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> is to provide a legal address (not a P.O. Box) within that jurisdiction where there are persons available during normal business hours to facilitate legal service of process being served {{in the event of a}} legal action or lawsuit. Generally, the <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> is also the person to whom the state government sends all official documents required each year for tax and legal purposes, such as franchise tax notices and annual report forms. It is the <b>registered</b> <b>agent's</b> job to forward these suit documents and notices to the entity itself. <b>Registered</b> <b>agents</b> generally will also notify business entities if their state government filing status is in [...] "good standing" [...] or not. The reason that these notifications are a desired function of a <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> is that it is difficult for a business entity to keep track of legislative changes and report due dates for multiple jurisdictions given the disparate laws of different states.|$|R

It then would reestablish the NARAB without those contingent conditions, converting it into a nonprofit corporation with the responsibility to prescribe, on a multi-state basis, licensing and insurance producer qualification requirements and conditions.|$|R
5000|$|In most all cases, the <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> for a {{business}} entity is assigned in the formation documents filed in a jurisdiction when the entity is originally created. For example, a person forming a corporation in the State of Nevada or Delaware, would designate the <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> along with the agent's address on the articles of incorporation filed with the Nevada Secretary of State or Delaware Secretary of State respectively. If the agent cannot sign the articles to be filed, some states such as Nevada provide that the <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> may be designated using a separate [...] "Registered Agent Acceptance" [...] form with the appropriate acceptance and signature. A representative of the business or the individual accepting responsibility as <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> must sign to accept the responsibility of acting as agent. In most states it is a crime to knowingly file a false document {{with the office of}} the Secretary of State, although the penalties vary widely. For example, in Nevada it is a Class [...] "D" [...] felony to forge this signature, but in Michigan it is only a misdemeanor.|$|R

50|$|If a <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> {{fails to}} perform their function, it can have dire {{consequences}} for the business entity. For example, if a customer fell inside a store and sued the store, and the store's <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> failed to notify the business entity of a summons {{to appear in court}} to respond to the lawsuit, then when the case went to trial, nobody would appear to defend the store and the customer would win by a default judgment. Additionally, the store would likely {{not be able to get}} the judgment overturned on appeal because they had been properly served. This is one of the most common reasons that business entities generally will utilize a third party as their <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> be it a commercial service company, an attorney, or in some cases, a CPA.|$|R
