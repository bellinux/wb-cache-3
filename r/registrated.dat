We propose algorithms for the calibration of a TOF camera which in combination with rigidly mounted standard cameras enables the photorealistic 3 -D surface reconstruction of the current field of view by <b>registrating</b> the optical centres of the involved cameras and projecting the 3 -D surface reconstruction into the standard camera image plane. For various applications not only the surface in the current field of view has to be reconstructed: We propose an algorithm to <b>registrate</b> consecutively acquired 3 -D surface reconstructions of static scenes. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{continuous}} monitoring both fetal {{heart rate and}} uterine activity during pregnancy and birth is described in the paper. Electrodes, placed on the maternal abdomen are used to obtain signals from the uterus {{as well as from}} fetal and maternal cardiac activity.

The fetal electrocardiogram is used to compute the heart rate whereas the electromyogram is processed so as to result in the uterine activity curve. Besides a substantial improvement in the reliability of fetal heart rate monitoring, it is for the first time, that uterine activity could be <b>registrated</b> other than by mechanical means and without any additional signal transducers...|$|E

40|$|Mgr. Miluše Skálová The {{aim of this}} {{rigorous}} {{work was}} to specify content of flavonoids and to learn antioxidant activity of methanolic extractions of drugs, which are used as diuretics. The drugs, which were tested: Epilobii herba, Equiseti herba, Ononidis radix and the tea mixture Nephrosal. In order to test antioxidant activity it was used free radical 2, 2 -difenyl- 1 -pikrylhydrazyl (DPPH). To compare the antioxidant activity, it was calculated value IC 50, which clarificates the amount of extract, which is required for retrenchment of 50 % free radical DPPH. The lowest antioxidant activity was <b>registrated</b> in methanolic extracts of drug Ononidis radix from Ononis spinosa IC 50 = 29, 1049 mg/ml and in extracts of drug Ononidis radix from Ononis arvensis IC 50 = 13, 7670 mg/ml. Comparable antioxidant activities had methanolic extract of Equiseti herba IC 50 = 3, 5856 mg/ml and the tea mixture Nephrosal IC 50 = 2, 2856 mg/ml.

40|$|Introduction. Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) {{is a rare}} developmental, {{epithelial}} and benign cyst of {{the jaws}} of odontogenic origin with high recurrence rates. The third molar region, especially {{the angle of the}} mandible and the ascending ramus are involved far more frequently than the maxilla. The choice of treatment approach was based {{on the size of the}} cyst, recurrence status, and radiographic evidence of cortical perforation. Different surgical treatment options like marsupialization, decompression, enucleation, enucleation with Carnoy’s solution, peripheral ostectomy with or without Carnoy’s solution, and jaw resection have been discussed in the literature with variable rates of recurrence. Case report. We presented a 52 -yearold male with orthokeratinized odontogenic keratocyst. Elliptical unilocular radiolucency located in the third molar region and the ascending ramus of the mandible, 40 × 25 mm in diameter with radiographic evidence of cortical perforation at the anterior ramus border of the mandible 20 mm in diameter, was <b>registrated</b> on orthopantomographic radiography. Surgical treatment included enucleation of the cyst and peripheral ostectomy with the use of Carnoy’s solution and excision of the overlying attached mucosa. Postoperatively, no paresthesia in the inervation area of the inferior alveolaris nerve was <b>registrated.</b> Recurrences were not <b>registrated</b> within 5 years post-intervention. Coclusion. Treatment of odontogenic keratocyst with enucleation and peripheral ostectomy with the use of Carnoy’s solution and excision of the overlying attached mucosa had a very low rate of recurrence. Radical and more aggressive surgical treatments as jaw resection should be reserved for multiple recurrent cysts and when OKC is associated with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS). Following the treatment protocol in the management of OKC and systematic and long-term postsurgical follow-up are considered key elements for successful results...|$|E
