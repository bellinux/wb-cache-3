As an alternative of this problem, waste plastic disposal has been reuse to fill the displaced volume of the designed <b>rescue</b> <b>boat.</b> The main objective of this thesis is to design a fiberglass <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> that has arrangement of bottles under the waterline section of the designed <b>rescue</b> <b>boat.</b> Lines plan of the <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> and general arrangement {{has been designed to}} visualize the design.

5|$|Offshore, a ship called Southern Isle was wrecked by {{the high}} surf. It had been sailing from Puerto Rico with a full load of iron ore and, as it {{approached}} the hurricane, the vessel changed directions and slowed down. By October 5, winds were strong and the seas were moderately rough. Very quickly, the ship broke into two, which prevented any time to escape on lifeboats.

25|$|With the North Vietnamese forces {{advancing}} on the South Vietnamese {{capital of}} Saigon, Ford ordered {{the evacuation of}} U.S. personnel, while also allowing U.S. forces to aid others who wished {{to escape from the}} Communist advance. Forty-thousand U.S. citizens and South Vietnamese were evacuated by plane until enemy attacks made evacuation by plane impossible. In the final phase of the evacuation, known as Operation Frequent Wind, military and Air America helicopters took evacuees to U.S. Navy ships off-shore during an approximately 24-hour period on April 29 to 30, 1975, immediately preceding the fall of Saigon. During the operation, so many South Vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people. Other helicopters, having nowhere to land, were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers, close to the ships, their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by <b>rescue</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{captain of}} the Loch Earn, after first {{sighting}} the Ville du Havre and realising she was dangerously close, rang the ship's bell and ported his helm. The helm of the Loch Earn was put to starboard, but Ville du Havre came right across the Loch Earn's bow. The Ville du Havre was violently shaken by the collision and noise, and woke all the passengers. Confused, most passengers went on deck, only to discover the ship was rapidly sinking. The captain assured them that all was fine, but in reality the cruiser had been nearly broken in two, and it didn't take long for passengers to realize the situation was desperate. Commotion and chaos overtook panicked passengers. They started grabbing life preservers and trying to push lifeboats into the water. Unfortunately, these had recently been painted, and they were now stuck fast to the deck. Finally {{a few of them}} were yanked loose, and passengers fought desperately {{to be one of the}} few travelers to board those <b>rescue</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|E
