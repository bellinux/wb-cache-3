40|$|It is {{suggested}} that the narrow width of the recently observed resonance Θ + (1540) with strangeness S = + 1 could {{be a result of}} the super-radiance mechanism of the redistribution of the widths of overlapping resonances due to their coupling through common decay channels. Fifty years ago, Dicke [1] introduced the notion of a “super-radiance ” when discussing the formation of a short-lived state in a radiant gas of N identical two-level atoms. When the gas is confined to a volume with a linear size smaller than the wave length of the radiation, the atoms are coherently coupled through the common radiation field. This leads to a formation of the many-body state that has a width ∼ NΓa, where Γa is the <b>radiation</b> <b>width</b> of an isolated individual atom. This is the “super-radiant ” (SR) state. The SR state gets its width {{at the expense of other}} states of the system, which are “robbed ” of their decay widths and become very narrow.

40|$|Almost {{since the}} time it was formulated, the {{overwhelming}} consensus has been that random matrix theory (RMT) is in excellent agreement with neutron resonance data. However, over the past few years, we have obtained new neutron-width data at Oak Ridge and Los Alamos National Laboratories that are in stark disagreement with this theory. We also have reanalyzed neutron widths in the most famous data set, the nuclear data ensemble (NDE), and found that it is seriously flawed, and, when analyzed carefully, excludes RMT with high confidence. More recently, we carefully examined energy spacings for these same resonances in the NDE using the Δ_ 3 statistic.

Comparison of experimental data with predictions made within the nuclear statistical model indicates that standard models of Photon Strength Functions (PSFs) and Nuclear Level Density predict Γγ distributions which are too narrow. We found that satisfactory agreement between experimental and simulated distributions can be obtained only by a strong suppression of the PSFs at low γ-ray energies and/or by violation of the usual assumption that primary transitions from neutron resonances follow the PTD.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the neutron capture mechanisms in magic nuclei (8 8 Sr, 1 3 9 La and 1 4 1 Pr) and in 3 2 S is reported. Valence capture in 3 2 S and 8 8 Sr is expected to dominate the capture mechanism in some resonances and partial <b>radiation</b> <b>width</b> measurements are needed for a direct comparison with valence capture calculations. For 1 3 9 La and 1 4 1 Pr neither valence nor statistical mechanisms are applicable, and a 2 p-lh mechanism has been proposed. It is decided to further investigate the capture mechanism in these nuclei through neutron capture gamma-ray measurements. A well-shielded 20 x 15 cm Nal detector is used with time of flight discrimination of scattered neutron events to obtain gamma-ray spectra for average neutron energies up to 1000 keV. Neutron capture theory is reviewed in Chapter 1, with emphasis on the statistical model of the giant dipole resonance, and the nonstatistical valence and doorway models. The neutron capture cross sections of the magic nuclei are relatively small. To obtain accurate reduced gamma-ray spectra, {{a high degree of}} sophistication is needed in the detector, associated electronics and pulsed Van de Graaff accelerator performance. In Chapter 2 the accelerator is calibrated, special shielding is designed for the Nal detector, the gamma-ray line shape is explained and the effect of self-shielding, multiple scattering and gamma-ray selfattenuation are calculated for the samples. The absolute number of neutrons in the solid angle subtended by the sample at the source, i. e. the number of neutrons per keV at En, are obtained in Chapter 3. Since the neutron angular distribution is not isotropic, a theoretical expression based on the 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be reaction kinematics is used to calculate the total number of neutrons incident on the sample as a function of total number of neutrons incident on the 6 Li neutron monitor. The valence contribution to the total <b>radiation</b> <b>width</b> of some resonances in 3 2 S are strong. The correlation between experimental and calculated partial widths is needed to provide definite evidence for valence capture in both s- and p-wave resonances in 3 2 S. In Chapter 4 the partial radiative widths of resonances with large Γ 2 n and (ΓVγ/Γγ) values atandkeV neutron energies in 3 2 S are measured. The observed data are compared with valence calculations and the width correlations are calculated. The ground and low-lying states of 8 8 Sr {{have been found to be}} almost pure single particle states in (d,p) studies and strong positive correlations have been observed between the reduced neutron and radiation widths for both p 3 ⁄ 2 and p½ wave resonances. Hence the valence effect is expected to dominate the neutron capture processes in 8 8 Sr, and in Chapter 5 neutron capture gamma-ray spectra are measured at eleven average neutron energies for resonances at 12. 4, 29. 5, 54. 6, 122, 150, 287, 321, 336, 399, 423 and 508 keV in 8 8 Sr. The intensity of the primary gamma-rays per neutron capture are calculated. The partial radiation widths and the calculated partial valence widths are compared for the p-wave resonances and the correlation between these widths is calculated. The total valence <b>radiation</b> <b>width</b> for 1 3 9 La and 1 4 1 Pr is about sixty times smaller than the average radiation widths of both nuclei, yet their neutron capture gamma-ray spectra show anomalous gamma-ray transitions to the low-lying states. Neither statistical nor valence models alone could account for the anomalous gamma-ray intensities. Since the energies of the anomalous gamma-rays are similar to the energies of unperturbed p-h states for El transitions, a 2 p- 1 h mechanism was suggested to explain the observed data. To further investigate the capture mechanism for these nuclei, detailed gamma-ray spectra are needed. In Chapter 6 neutron capture gamma-ray spectra are measured at average neutron energies and keV in 1 3 9 La and at,, and keV in 1 4 1 Pr. The corrected energy level densities are obtained and the reduced intensities are investigated. The data fit well within the framework of the Lorentzian model, and the non-statistical capture mechanism hypothesis is ruled out as a dominant mechanism in these nuclei. The nuclei used in this work were found to have different neutron capture mechanisms and conclusions are therefore given at the end of the last three chapters...|$|E

The transmission experiments were carried out at a 25 m station using a Li glass scintillator.

40|$|Part I. The {{shell model}} near 208 Pb. The nucleus 208 Pb has a double closed shell of protons and neutrons. Because of the {{stability}} of this structure {{it is possible that}} a nucleus with a few extra particles outside the double closed shell can be described as a system in which these few particles move in an average central field produced by the 208 Pb core. It is assumed that the individual particle levels are those predicted by the shell model, and that the nuclear forces acting between the extra particles can be treated as a perturbation on their station in the central field. The behaviour of vacancies in the closed shell is equivalent to the behaviour of particles in the same states. Thus nuclei with a few holes in the closed shell and nuclei with a few extra particles can be treated by identical methods. Similar considerations hold for nuclei with a few holes and a few extra particles except for some details in the coupling of the angular moments of holes and particles. To investigate the effect of internucleon forces it is necessary to calculate matrix elements of the internucleon potential two-particle states. It has been hoped that in heavy nuclei, where the radius of the nucleus is large compared with the range of nuclear forces, the effect of the range of the forces would be small so that zero range forces could be used. The effect of the range of the forces has been investigated and a relatively simple expansion obtained for the matrix elements of the internucleon potential as a power series in the ratio of the range of the nuclear forces to the nuclear radius. Calculations have been extended to take the second term of the series into account, and it is found that, in many cases, the contribution of this term is very important. This is particularly so for Majorana forces in a two-particle state coupled to give a low spin. The zero range approximation gives too large an interaction in states of low spin, while it gives a good estimate of the interaction in states of high spin. In particle hole configurations this situation is exactly reversed. As an example of the application of the model the energy levels of the four nuclei 210 Bi, 208 Te, 204 Pb and 202 Pb have been investigated. In 210 Bi it is possible to classify the known low lying levels in terms of two particle neutron-proton configurations and in particular to predict a low lying isomeric state with I - 8. 208 Te is of interest as it gives an example of a particle hole configuration. The even-even nuclei 204 Pb and 202 Pb have very similar level schemes each with a 9 -isomeric state. These scemes can be understood {{on the basis of the}} above model. Part II. Some reactions with neutrons. Reactions with neutrons are of considerable importance in the study of heavy nuclei. The interaction producing the reaction is the short range nuclear force, the cross sections are large, and there is no Coulomb barrier to complicate the interpretation of the experiments. Two types of reaction have been considered. The first is a process of inelastic scattering in the 1 MeV region and the second resonance scattering at slow neutron energies. The inelastic scattering of neutrons is usually thought of as a compound nucleus process. In regions of atomic weight A = 170 and A = 230, however, the nucleus is highly distorted and there is the possibility of a direct inelastic process which can be described as follows. The neutron strikes the target nucleus and on reflection from its surface the neutrons set the target nucleus into rotation (i. e. excite a surface rotational mode) and are scattered with reduced energy. The interaction of the neutron with the nucleus has been represented by a complex potential well (the 'optical model'} the complex parts of the potential giving an absorption to be identified with compound nucleus formation. It is known that the "optical model" gives large cross sections in the region of atomic weights A = 150 and A = 240 corresponding to S, D and P partial wave resonances inside the nucleus. In these regions of atomic weight it is found that the scattering cross section predicted by the direct process is comparable with the compound inelastic cross section, while in intermediate regions of atomic weight the direct process is unimportant. The two processes are incoherent and give different neutron and Î³-ray angular distributions. In recent years there has been an intensive experimental investigation of the properties of slow neutron resonances in many nuclei. These resonances correspond to virtual levels of the compound nucleus and the experiments tell us something about high nuclear states. In general these states will be a complicated mixture of single particle configurations and there is a possibility that their properties can be treated statistically. On this assumption the distribution function for reaction widths has been investigated and it is found that reduced partial widths have a distribution which is approximately exponential. Photo capture of neutrons is the inverse process to the nuclear photo effect. The dipole photo effect is known to have a broad resonance at about 13 â 20 MeV where the width and position of this resonance very slowly with atomic weight and appear insensitive to details of nuclear structure. An equation to the resonance is assumed and used to calculate the expectation values of the dipole radiation widths of slow neutron resonances. The theory predicts radiation widths too large by a factor of 3; but gives the right variation with atomic weight. The variation of <b>radiation</b> <b>width</b> with the spin of the emitting state is considered and it is found, using a modified sum rule, that the total radiation with ÎÎ³ should be independent of spin. The spectral distribution of the emitted Î³-rays and the dependence of the total width on the energy of the radiating state are investigated. </p...|$|E
40|$|Casimir {{interaction}} between two media of ground-state atoms is well described with a help of Lifshitz formula depending upon permittivity of media. We {{will show that}} this formula is in contradiction with experimental evidence for excited atoms. We calculate Casimir force between two atoms {{if one of them}} or both atoms are excited. We use methods of quantum electrodynamics specially derived for the problem. It enables us to take into account excited-state <b>radiation</b> <b>widths</b> of atoms. Then we calculate the force between excited atom and medium of ground-state atoms. The results are in agreement with the ones, obtained by other authors using perturbation theory or linear response theory. Generalization of our results to the case of {{interaction between}} two media of excited atoms results in a formula, which is in not only in quantitative, but in qualitative contradiction with Lifshits formula. This contradiction disappears if media of ground-state atoms are taken. Moreover, our result does not include permittivity of the media. It includes the quantity which differs from the permittivity only for excited atoms. The main features of our results are as follows. The interaction is resonant; the force may be either attractive or repulsive depending on resonant frequencies of the atoms of different media; the value of Casimir force may be several orders of magnitude lager than that predicted by Lifshitz formula. The features mentioned here are in agreement with known experimental and theoretical evidences obtained by many authors for interaction of a single excited atom with dielectric media...|$|R

The parameter most sensitive to UV radiation was the rise time of variable fluorescence.
