40|$|Abstract—Analysis of 1 {{noise in}} MOSFET {{circuits}} is typically {{performed in the}} frequency domain using the standard stationary 1 noise model. Recent experimental results, however, {{have shown that the}} estimates using this model can be quite inaccurate especially for switched circuits. In the case of a periodically switched transistor, measured 1 noise power spectral density (psd) was shown to be significantly lower than the estimate using the standard 1 noise model. For a ring oscillator, measured 1 -induced phase noise psd was shown to be significantly lower than the estimate using the standard 1 noise model. For a source follower <b>reset</b> <b>circuit,</b> measured 1 noise power was also shown to be lower than the estimate using the standard 1 model. In analyzing noise in the follower <b>reset</b> <b>circuit</b> using frequency-domain analysis, a low cutoff frequency that is inversely proportional to the circuit on-time is assumed. The choice of this low cutoff frequency is quite arbitrary and can cause significant inaccuracy in estimating noise power. Moreover, during reset, the circuit is not in steady state, and thus frequency-domain analysis does not apply. This paper proposes a nonstationary extension of the standard 1 noise model, which allows us to analyze 1 noise in switched MOSFET circuits more accurately. Using our model, we analyze noise for the three aforementioned switched circuit examples and obtain results that are consistent with the reported measurements.

An NFC digital protocol module is combined with an energy efficient front-end, ADC, energy harvester and NFC data link to form a passive NFC tag with a fully integrated and complete sensor interface. This work builds on previous work where parts of this system have been designed and tested as standalone solutions. Previously, a sensor interface ASIC has been developed that provides the front-end to a resistive or capacitive sensor and converts its output (e. g. blood sugar concentration) into digital data ready to be transferred. Another NFC physical layer ASIC has been developed which hosts the energy harvesting and physical communication layer required to operate with an NFC enabled mobile phone, or other NFC readers.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{feasibility}} of causing the state of a closed quantum system leap backwards in time. The system (the target) is out of our control: this means that we ignore both its free Hamiltonian and how the system interacts with other quantum systems we may use to influence it. Under these conditions, we prove that there exist protocols {{within the framework of}} non-relativistic quantum physics which reset the target system to its exact quantum state at a given past time. Each "resetting protocol" is successful with non-zero probability for all possible free Hamiltonians and interaction unitaries, save a subset of zero measure. When the target is a qubit, the simplest <b>resetting</b> <b>circuits</b> have a significant average probability of success and their implementation is within reach of current quantum technologies. Finally, we find that, in case the resetting protocol fails, it is possible to run a further protocol that, if successful, undoes both the natural evolution of the target and the effects of the failed protocol over the latter. By chaining in this fashion several such protocols, one can substantially increase the overall probability of a successful time leap. Comment: New references and abstract and minor improvements.

This thesis presents the work on development of three control circuits including a bias circuit, an active quench and <b>reset</b> <b>circuit</b> and a gain control circuit all of which are used for control and performance enhancement of the APDs. The bias circuit designed is used to bias planar APDs for operation in both linear and Geiger modes. The circuit is based on a dual charge pumps configuration and operates from a 5 V supply. It is capable of providing milliamp load currents for shallow-junction planar APDs that operate up to 40 V. With novel voltage regulators, the bias voltage provided by the circuit can be accurately controlled and easily adjusted by the end user. The circuit is highly integrable and provides an attractive solution for applications requiring a compact integrated APD device. The active quench and <b>reset</b> <b>circuit</b> is designed for APDs that operate in Geiger-mode and are required for photon counting. The circuit enables linear changes in the hold-off time of the Geiger-mode APD (GM-APD) from several nanoseconds to microseconds with a stable setting step of 6. 5 ns. This facilitates setting the optimal `afterpulse-free 2 ̆ 7 hold-off time for any GM-APD via user-controlled digital inputs.
