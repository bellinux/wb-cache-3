Preliminary {{research}} has shown that red mud is a viable option {{to be used as a}} fluxing agent in the steelmaking process, as it is able to achieve similar results as fluxes currently used in steel refining. This research focused on how red mud can be used as a flux for refining steel. Desulfurization was conducted with aluminum additions and temperature variations. The results showed that experiments utilized waste residues from the aluminum industry as <b>refining</b> <b>flux</b> for steel refining; more than 95 % sulfur reduction was achieved; increasing temperature and aluminum content can improve desulfurization...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Magnesium {{die-casting}} {{has experienced}} dramatic {{growth over the}} past decade and the recycling of magnesium scrap has become increasingly important due to the generation of substantial quantities of scrap in the die-casting process. Magnesium is a readily recyclable material and the recycling of magnesium scrap is crucial in making magnesium more competitive. The main concern associated with using the secondary magnesium is the high level of Fe content and oxide inclusions that are detrimental to the corrosion and mechanical properties of the secondary alloy. In this study, the die-cast specimens were produced using the recycled class 1 scrap which is refined by means of Ar bubbling and Mn addition without using <b>refining</b> <b>fluxes,</b> and their mechanical properties and corrosion characteristics were investigated. The results showed that the tensile properties of the secondary AZ 91 alloy were equivalent to those of the primary magnesium alloy after appropriate treatments. The corrosion resistance of the recycled magnesium was also found to increase by Ar bubbling and Mn addition...|$|R
40|$|Gamma-ray {{emission}} {{from the}} Crab Nebula has been recently {{shown to be}} unsteady. In this paper, we study the flux and spectral variability of the Crab above 100 MeV on different timescales ranging from days to weeks. In addition to the four main intense and day-long flares detected by AGILE and Fermi-LAT between Sept. 2007 and Sept. 2012, we find evidence for week-long and less intense episodes of enhanced gamma-ray emission that we call "waves". Statistically significant "waves" show timescales of 1 - 2 weeks, and can occur by themselves or in association with shorter flares. We present a <b>refined</b> <b>flux</b> and spectral analysis of the Sept. - Oct. 2007 gamma-ray enhancement episode detected by AGILE that shows both "wave" and flaring behavior. We extend our analysis to the publicly available Fermi-LAT dataset and show that several additional "wave" episodes can be identified. We discuss the spectral properties of the September 2007 "wave"/flare event and show that the physical properties of the "waves" are intermediate between steady and flaring states. Plasma instabilities inducing "waves" appear to involve spatial distances l ∼ 10 ^ 16 cm and enhanced magnetic fields B ∼ (0. 5 - 1) mG. Day-long flares are characterized by smaller distances and larger local magnetic fields. Typically, the deduced total energy associated with the "wave" phenomenon (E_w ∼ 10 ^ 42 erg, where E_w is the kinetic energy of the emitting particles) is comparable with that associated to the flares, and can reach a few {{percent of the total}} available pulsar spindown energy. Most likely, flares and waves are the product of the same class of plasma instabilities that we show acting on different timescales and radiation intensities. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|Shewanellae are gram-negative facultatively {{anaerobic}} metal-reducing bacteria {{commonly found}} in chemically (i. e., redox) stratified environments. Occupying such niches requires the ability to rapidly acclimate to changes in electron donor/ acceptor type and availability; hence, the ability to compete and thrive in such environments must ultimately {{be reflected in the}} organization and utilization of electron transfer networks, as well as central and peripheral carbon metabolism. To understand how Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 utilizes its resources, the metabolic network was reconstructed. The resulting network consists of 774 reactions, 783 genes, and 634 unique metabolites and contains biosynthesis pathways for all cell constituents. Using constraint-based modeling, we investigated aerobic growth of S. oneidensis MR- 1 on numerous carbon sources. To achieve this, we (i) used experimental data to formulate a biomass equation and estimate cellular ATP requirements, (ii) developed an approach to identify cycles (such as futile cycles and circulations), (iii) classified how reaction usage affects cellular growth, (iv) predicted cellular biomass yields on different carbon sources and compared model predictions to experimental measurements, and (v) used experimental results to <b>refine</b> metabolic <b>fluxes</b> for growth on lactate.

40|$|The use of {{ferrous scrap}} {{in the world}} {{continues}} to increase due {{to a number of}} reasons including depletion of high quality iron ore, and requirement of reduction of CO 2 gas emission. However, tramp elements in ferrous scrap such as Cu hinder it from being used for source of wide range of steel grades, since they may cause harmful defects in the final products. Therefore, development of a new technology which is effective in removing the tramp elements or nullifying their harmful effects is essential to utilize ferrous scrap more widely. A number of technological attempts have been proposed for copper removal; namely, sulfide <b>flux</b> <b>refining,</b> vacuum distillation, low melting point bath, and chlorination.

40|$|The main {{environmental}} {{stresses of}} Italian croplands {{are discussed in}} relation to their interactions with ozone effects on crops. Water deficit and salinization are frequent in Mediterranean environments during spring-summer causing a decrease of soil water potential and water uptake by roots and consequently stomatal closure. These stresses also stimulate secondary metabolism and antioxidant accumulation, which also serves as a stress protection mechanism. High concentrations of tropospheric ozone are common all over Italy during the spring-summer season. Ozone injuries to vegetation are related to its penetration into plant tissues, mostly via stomatal uptake, rather than to tropospheric concentrations per se. In several crops, closure of stomata due to drought/salinization reduces ozone entering into leaf tissues and counteracts possible ozone damages. Furthermore, the stimulation of antioxidant synthesis as a response to environmental stresses can represent a further protection factor from ozone injuries for Mediterranean crops. The co-existence of stress-induced stomatal closure and high ozone levels during spring-summer in Mediterranean environments implies that models that do not take into account physiological responses of crops to drought and salinity stress may overestimate ozone damages when stress responses overlap with seasonal ozone peaks. The shift from concentration-based to flux-based approaches has improved the accuracy of models to assess ozone effects on agricultural crops. It is, however, necessary to further <b>refine</b> the <b>flux</b> concept with respect to the plant abiotic stress defense capacity that can differ among genotypes, climatic conditions, and physiological states...|$|R
40|$|<b>Refining</b> carbon <b>flux</b> {{measurements}} in {{the carbon}} cycle {{is an ongoing}} challenge. This study attempted to identify plant species in Sallie’s Fen, a nutrient-poor fen in Barrington, New Hampshire, at a fine scale {{in order to better}} model and understand carbon exchange between plants and the atmosphere in this type of ecosystem. A protocol for estimating percent cover of species in plots via ground measurements was developed. The next stage of this project was to compare these measurements with measurements derived from spectral images using ImageJ computer software. Statistical tests of the ground measurement data revealed that patterns of seasonal defoliation had a strong effect on the apparent species richness, evenness, and biodiversity of plants as seen aerially. The presence of Sphagnum mosses excluded the presence of other species, but the presence of other plants only excluded the visibility of Sphagnum since it resides in the understory of the layered community. A regression comparing percent cover of the vascular plant functional group and fractal dimensions from a digital camera was statistically significant, indicating that ground and aerial measurements agree and that spectral imaging can be used to save time in the field in place of ground measurements. Additionally, since ecosystem science is such an interdisciplinary field, it provides the perfect platform around which students can apply their scientific knowledge and understanding. Modifications to this project were suggested {{so that it can be}} carried out in a secondary school classroom setting while aligning with the Next Generation Science Standards...|$|R

Three wetting regimes denoted by absorbing regime, engulfing regime and penetration regime correlating with the removal of oxide films (the most typical and common oxide inclusions in molten aluminum) were proposed in terms of different types and distributions of oxide films and different size ratios of the molten flux to oxide films. Particularly, from a thermodynamic point of view, for the first time, the penetration regime provided concrete evidence that the practical oxide inclusions can be wet by molten flux under ambient fluid of molten aluminum. A spreading model was proposed, according to which ingredients and size parameters of practical solid fluxes can be optimized...|$|R
40|$|The Gaseous Diffusion Plants, or GDPs, have {{significant}} amounts {{of a number of}} metals, including nickel, aluminum, copper, and steel. Aluminum was used extensively throughout the GDPs because of its excellent strength to weight ratios and good resistance to corrosion by UF{sub 6 }. This report is concerned with the recycle of aluminum stator and rotor blades from axial compressors. Most of the stator and rotor blades were made from 214 -X aluminum casting alloy. Used compressor blades were contaminated with uranium both as a result of surface contamination and as an accumulation held in surface-connected voids inside of the blades. A variety of GDP studies were performed to evaluate the amounts of uranium retained in the blades; the volume, area, and location of voids in the blades; and connections between surface defects and voids. Based on experimental data on deposition, uranium content of the blades is 0. 3 %, or roughly 200 times the value expected from blade surface area. However, this value does correlate with estimated internal surface area and with lengthy deposition times. Based on a literature search, it appears that gaseous decontamination or melt <b>refining</b> using <b>fluxes</b> specific for uranium removal have the potential for removing internal contamination from aluminum blades. A melt refining process was used to recycle blades during the 1950 s and 1960 s. The process removed roughly one-third of the uranium from the blades. Blade cast from recycled aluminum appeared to perform as well as blades from virgin material. New melt refining and gaseous decontamination processes have been shown to provide substantially better decontamination of pure aluminum. If these techniques can be successfully adapted to treat aluminum 214 -X alloy, internal and, possibly, external reuse of aluminum alloys may be possible...|$|R
40|$|We have {{conducted}} a radio study at 3. 6, 6 and 20 cm using ATCA and VLA and reprocessed XMM-Newton and Chandra {{data of the}} pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in the supernova remnant (SNR) G 0. 9 + 0. 1. The new observations revealed that the morphology and symmetry suggested by Chandra observations (torus and jet-like features) are basically preserved in the radio range {{in spite of the}} rich structure observed in the radio emission of this PWN, including several arcs, bright knots, extensions and filaments. The reprocessed X-ray images show {{for the first time that}} the X-ray plasma fills almost the same volume as the radio PWN. Notably the X-ray maximum does not coincide with the radio maximum and the neutron star candidate CXOU J 174722. 8 - 280915 lies within a small depression in the radio emission. From the new radio data we have <b>refined</b> the <b>flux</b> density estimates, obtaining S(PWN) ~ 1. 57 Jy, almost constant between 3. 6 and 20 cm. For the whole SNR (compact core and shell), a flux density S(at 20 cm) = 11. 5 Jy was estimated. Based on the new and the existing 90 cm flux density estimates, we derived alpha(PWN) =- 0. 18 +/- 0. 04 and alpha(shell) =- 0. 68 +/- 0. 07. From the combination of the radio data with X-ray data, a spectral break is found near nu ~ 2. 4 x 10 ^(12) Hz. The total radio PWN luminosity is L(radio) = 1. 2 x 10 ^(35) erg s^(- 1) when a distance of 8. 5 kpc is adopted. By assuming equipartition between particle and magnetic energies, we estimate a nebular magnetic field B = 56 muG. The associated particle energy turns out to be U(part) = 5 x 10 ^(47) erg and the magnetic energy U(mag) = 2 x 10 ^(47) erg. Based on an empirical relation between X-ray luminosity and pulsar energy loss rate, and the comparison with the calculated total energy, a lower limit of 1100 yr is derived for the age of this PWN.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIContext. The Public European Southern Observatory Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO) {{began as}} a public spectroscopic survey in April 2012. PESSTO classifies {{transients}} from publicly available sources and wide-field surveys, and selects science targets for detailed spectroscopic and photometric follow-up. PESSTO runs for nine months of the year, January - April and August - December inclusive, and typically has allocations of 10 nights per month. Aims. We describe the data reduction strategy and data products that are publicly available through the ESO archive as the Spectroscopic Survey data release 1 (SSDR 1). Methods. PESSTO uses the New Technology Telescope with the instruments EFOSC 2 and SOFI to provide optical and NIR spectroscopy and imaging. We target supernovae and optical transients brighter than 20. 5 (m) for classification. Science targets are selected for follow-up based on the PESSTO science goal of extending knowledge of the extremes of the supernova population. We use standard EFOSC 2 set-ups providing spectra with resolutions of 13 - 18 angstrom between 3345 - 9995 angstrom. A subset of the brighter science targets are selected for SOFI spectroscopy with the blue and red grisms (0. 935 - 2. 53 mu m and resolutions 23 - 33 angstrom) and imaging with broadband JHK(s) filters. Results. This first data release (SSDR 1) contains flux calibrated spectra from the first year (April 2012 - 2013). A total of 221 confirmed supernovae were classified, and we released calibrated optical spectra and classifications publicly within 24 h of the data being taken (via WISeREP). The data in SSDR 1 replace those released spectra. They have more reliable and quantifiable flux calibrations, correction for telluric absorption, and are made available in standard ESO Phase 3 formats. We estimate the absolute accuracy of the flux calibrations for EFOSC 2 across the whole survey in SSDR 1 to be typically similar to 15 %, although a number of spectra will have less reliable absolute flux calibration because of weather and slit losses. Acquisition images for each spectrum are available which, in principle, can allow the user to <b>refine</b> the absolute <b>flux</b> calibration. The standard NIR reduction process does not produce high accuracy absolute spectrophotometry but synthetic photometry with accompanying JHK(s) imaging can improve this. Whenever possible, reduced SOFI images are provided to allow this. Conclusions. Future data releases will focus on improving the automated flux calibration of the data products. The rapid turnaround between discovery and classification and access to reliable pipeline processed data products has allowed early science papers {{in the first few}} months of the survey...|$|R
