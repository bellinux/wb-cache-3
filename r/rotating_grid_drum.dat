40|$|Texture {{analysis}} of self-structured surfaces in formation process using directional fractal signature method M Wolski, P Podsiadlo and GW Stachowiak The range of applications for self-structured surfaces is growing. They {{are used to}} increase wear resistance, reduce friction and corrosion, and also used in design of biosensors and innovative coatings. However, to effectively manufacture these surfaces on a large scale, methods for their texture characterisation/description are required. Currently, {{we do not have}} any effective and accurate methods to characterise these surfaces. This is severely hindering their wider applications and further developments in this area. The texture of self-structured surfaces, like any texture of any other surface, would need to be characterised/described during the formation (production) process and for specific applications. During formation process, the self-structured surfaces change texture roughness and directionality. These changes are gradual, complex and occur over many scales. In this work, a recently developed method, called an augmented blanket with <b>rotating</b> <b>grid</b> method, is applied to microscopic images of real self-structured surface textures. Groups of isotropic and anisotropic texture images were analysed. In the first group the textures were formed through the growth of nanorods on indium oxide substrates while in another the laser beam irradiation was used to treat the polymer films. Results obtained showed that the augmented blanket with <b>rotating</b> <b>grid</b> method accurately quantifies minute decreases in roughness of isotropic surfaces and changes in roughness with directions of anisotropic surfaces observed during the formation process...|$|R
50|$|For a {{standard}} finite difference model, uniform gridlines converge towards the poles.

Some experiments use geodesic grids and icosahedral grids, which (being more uniform) do not have pole-problems.

In order to prevent loss of accuracy, two distinct families of higher-order sliding mesh interfaces are developed. These approaches fit naturally in a high-order finite volume framework.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{examines}} two {{varieties of}} super-sample anti-aliasing: <b>Rotated</b> <b>Grid</b> Super-Sampling (RGSS) and Ordered Grid Super-Sampling (OGSS). RGSS employs a sub-sampling <b>grid</b> that is <b>rotated</b> around the standard {{horizontal and vertical}} offset axes used in OGSS by (typically) 20 to 30 °. RGSS is seen to have one basic advantage over OGSS: More effective anti-aliasing near the horizontal and vertical axes, where the human eye can most easily detect screen aliasing (jaggies). This advantage also permits the use of fewer sub-samples to achieve approximately the same visual effect as OGSS. In addition, this paper examines the fill-rate, memory, and bandwidth usage of both anti-aliasing techniques. Super-sampling anti-aliasing {{is found to be}} a costly process that inevitably reduces graphics processing performance, typically by a substantial margin. However, anti-aliasing’s positive impact on image quality is significant and is seen to be very important to an improved gaming experience and worth the performance cost. What is Aliasing?

40|$|We combine {{recently}} computed {{models of}} stellar evolution {{using a new}} treatment of rotation with a Bayesian statistical framework to constrain the ages and other properties of early-type stars. We find good agreement for early-type stars and clusters with known young ages, including beta Pictoris, the Pleiades, and the Ursa Majoris Moving Group. However, we derive a substantially older age for the Hyades open cluster (750 +/- 100 Myr compared to 625 +/- 50 Myr). This older age results from both the increase in main-sequence lifetime with stellar rotation and {{from the fact that}} rotating models near the main-sequence turnoff are more luminous, overlapping with slightly more massive (and shorter-lived) nonrotating ones.
