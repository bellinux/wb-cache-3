40|$|This {{study is}} in {{response}} to the findings of Winter et al. (1999) that in 1994 Poland, compared to urban households, rural households experienced worse domain living conditions yet rated their household situation as better. Using the same data, which were collected in the province of Lublin in Poland from primarily female respondents, 592 households are analyzed;The relationship between socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the household (constraints), <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> in the household 2 ̆ 7 s situation, conditions (objective well-being), and satisfaction (subjective well-being) is assessed globally and within five specific domains: health, housing, household equipment, food, and Transportation; Parallel ordinary least squares regression analyses are performed and total effects are decomposed for urban and rural residents, and further, for rural-nonfarm and rural-farm households. The means of the exogenous and endogenous variables are compared for urban, rural-nonfarm and rural-farm households;The results of the comparison-of-means procedures indicate that respondents in urban areas tend to have the highest levels of education, and urban households are apt to have the best conditions. Respondents from rural-nonfarm households tend to be the oldest, and rural-farm households are likely to have the most household members, children, and workers;The findings of the regression analyses and the decomposition of total effects indicate that, of the household characteristics entered into the analyses, age of the respondent, education of the respondent, and total household income are the most consistent predictors of conditions, and of satisfaction, indirectly through their influence on conditions;As expected, constraints and <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> affect objective well-being, and constraints, <b>recent</b> <b>change,</b> and objective well-being affect subjective well-being. A finding that was not expected, however, is that <b>recent</b> <b>change,</b> rather than objective well-being, is a more consistent and a stronger predictor of subjective well-being. It is possible that the measures of <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> and conditions are entered into the model in reverse order; rather than reported <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> leading to conditions, it is the perception of <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> that is influenced by current conditions, which, in turn, affects satisfaction. It also is likely that <b>recent</b> <b>change</b> and conditions influence one another, and it is this relationship that affects satisfaction...|$|R

5|$|The most <b>recent</b> <b>changes</b> to {{the ethnic}} {{composition}} of Slavonian counties occurred between censuses conducted in 1991 and 2001. The 1991 census recorded a heterogenous population consisting mostly of Croats and Serbs—at 72 percent and 17 {{percent of the}} total population respectively. The Croatian War of Independence, and the ethnic fracturing of Yugoslavia that preceded it, caused an exodus of the Croat population followed by an exodus of Serbs. The return of refugees since the end of hostilities is not complete—a majority of Croat refugees returned, while fewer Serbs did. In addition, ethnic Croats moved to Slavonia from Bosnia and Herzegovina and from Serbia.|$|E

5|$|The {{first modern}} {{population}} census {{in the country}} was conducted in 1857, and 15 more have been performed since then. Since 1961 the censuses are conducted in regular ten-year intervals, with the latest one in 2011. The first institution {{set up in the}} country specifically for the purposes of maintaining population statistics was the State Statistical Office, founded in 1875. Since its founding, the office changed its name and structure several times and was alternately subordinated to other institutions and independent, until the most <b>recent</b> <b>changes</b> in 1992, when the institution became the Croatian Bureau of Statistics. The 2011 census was performed on 1–28 April 2011, recording situation as of 31 March 2011. The first census results, containing the number of the population by settlement, were published on 29 June 2011, and the final comprehensive set of data was published in December 2012. The 2011 census and processing of the data gathered by the census was expected to cost 171.9million kuna (23.3million euro). The 2011 census was performed using new methodology: the permanent population was determined as the enumerated population who lived in the census area for at least 12 months prior to the census, or plans to live in the same area for at least 12 months after the census. This method was also retroactively applied to the 2001 census data.|$|E
5|$|The next year, {{a council}} held at Westminster {{became one of}} the early stages in the king's growing quarrel with Becket over {{criminal}} clerks. The quarrel was sparked by the problem of clergy who committed crimes; Becket supported the Church's position that all clergy, even those in minor orders, could be tried only in ecclesiastical courts. As perhaps as many as a fifth of the population of England may have been in some form of clerical orders, including the minor ones, allowing this would have diminished the king's authority. In the past, English law had tried clerks who committed serious offences in the royal courts, but <b>recent</b> <b>changes</b> in canon law were changing this practice. At Westminster, Henry tried to get the leading laymen and bishops to swear to uphold the old customs of England, instead of the newer canon law practices. All the bishops swore, with the reservation that the customs were not in conflict with canon law. Hilary, however, added no qualifiers to his oath. Although the oath supported Becket's position, after the council most of the bishops, including Hilary, were persuaded by the king to support some compromise position, and threw their support behind Henry.|$|E

5|$|France, {{friendly}} towards both Russia and Austria, {{suggested a}} series of territorial adjustments, in which Austria would be compensated by parts of Prussian Silesia, and Prussia in turn would receive Polish Ermland (Warmia) {{and parts of the}} Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a Polish fief already under Baltic German hegemony. King Frederick II of Prussia had no intention of giving up Silesia, gained recently in the Silesian Wars. He was, however, also interested in finding a peaceful solution– his alliance with Russia would draw him into a potential war with Austria, and the Seven Years' War had left Prussia's treasury and army weakened. He was also interested in protecting the weakening Ottoman Empire, which could be advantageously utilized {{in the event of a}} Prussian war either with Russia or Austria. Frederick's brother, Prince Henry, spent the winter of 1770–71 as a representative of the Prussian court at Saint Petersburg. As Austria had annexed 13 towns in the Hungarian Szepes region in 1769 (violating the Treaty of Lubowla), Catherine II of Russia and her advisor General Ivan Chernyshyov suggested to Henry that Prussia claim some Polish land, such as Ermland. After Henry informed Frederick of the proposal, the Prussian monarch suggested a partition of the Polish borderlands by Austria, Prussia, and Russia, with the largest share going to the party most weakened by the <b>recent</b> <b>changes</b> in balance of power, Austria. Thus Frederick attempted to encourage Russia to direct its expansion towards weak and dysfunctional Poland instead of the Ottomans. Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz counter-proposed that Prussia take lands from Poland in return for relinquishing Silesia to Austria, but this plan was rejected by Frederick.|$|E
