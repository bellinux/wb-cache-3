50|$|Payments for {{exports are}} open to risks even at the best <b>of</b> times. The <b>risks</b> have assumed large {{proportions}} today due to the far-reaching political and economic changes that are sweeping the world. An outbreak of war or civil war may block or delay payment for goods exported. A coup or an insurrection may also bring about the same result. Economic difficulties or balance of payment problems may lead a country to impose restrictions on either import of certain goods or on transfer of payments for goods imported. In addition, the exporters have to face commercial <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>insolvency</b> or protracted THE default of buyers.

50|$|The {{financial}} risks providers accept in capitation are traditional insurance risks. Provider revenues are fixed, and each enrolled patient makes a claims against the full {{resources of the}} provider. In exchange for the fixed payment, physicians essentially become the enrolled clients' insurers, who resolve their patients' claims {{at the point of}} care and assume the responsibility for their unknown future health care costs. Large providers tend to manage the risk better than do smaller providers because they are better prepared for variations in service demand and costs, but even large providers are inefficient risk managers in comparison to large insurers. Providers tend to be small in comparison to insurers and so are more like individual consumers, whose annual costs as a percentage of their annual cash flow vary far more than do those of large insurers. For example, a capitated eye care program for 25,000 patients is more viable than a capitated eye program for 10,000 patients. The smaller the roster of patients, the greater the variation in annual costs and the more likely that the costs may exceed the resources of the provider. In very small capitation portfolios, a small number of costly patients can dramatically affect a provider's overall costs and increase the provider's <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>insolvency.</b>|$|E

Thus, tax deductions for net losses could be used to provide an insurance for individuals against the insurer's <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>insolvency.</b> These findings could also be used to explain why a government provides supplementary public insurance or government relief.

40|$|The capital {{structure}} and regulation of financial intermediaries {{is an important}} topic for practitioners, regulators and academic researchers. In general, theory predicts that firms choose their {{capital structure}}s by balancing the benefits of debt (e. g., tax and agency benefits) against its costs (e. g., bankruptcy costs). However, when traditional corporate finance models have been applied to insured financial institutions, the results have generally predicted corner solutions (all equity or all debt) to the capital structure problem. This paper studies the impact and interaction of deposit insurance, capital requirements and tax benefits on a bankÇs choice of optimal capital structure. Using a contingent claims model to value the firm and its associated claims, we find that there exists an interior optimal capital ratio {{in the presence of}} deposit insurance, taxes and a minimum fixed capital standard. Banks voluntarily choose to maintain capital in excess of the minimum required in order to balance the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>insolvency</b> (especially the loss of future tax benefits) against the benefits of additional debt. Because we derive a closed- form solution, our model provides useful insights on several current policy debates including revisions to the regulatory framework for GSEs, tax policy in general and the tax exemption for credit unions...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the current}} {{rules of the}} game, Argentina's central bank (BCRA) is charged with being the lender of last resort as well as {{providing}} full convertibility between pesos and U. S. dollars - two objectives with one instrument, namely, reserves. Within those rules, it may be well that the balance of responsibilities needs to shift. Complete dollarization can significantly reduce risks but not entirely eliminate them. If the BCRA can concentrate more on building up reserves and helping to ward off crises of confidence in the currency, perhaps the banking system can protect itself better from liquidity shocks. But this will require, among other things, consolidation of the sector (which could give it greater access to outside liquidity) and prudential strengthening of the system. Triage of weaker banks should continue and not await another crisis. More experience with the new liquidity policy is needed and so is reform of the settlement system, as it affects the functioning of the interbank market, which is essential for containing crises. Essentially, however, no grand solution seems to exist for the problems that seem inevitable in a system where the central bank is also the currency board.

In asbestos disease cases, a worker may have been employed with at a number of jobs where he was exposed to asbestos, but his injury cannot with certainty be traced to any one. Although he may be able to sue all of them, a number may have already gone insolvent. In Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd the House of Lords held that if any employer had materially increased the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> harm to the worker, they could would be jointly and severally liable and could be sued for the full sum, leaving it up to them to seek contribution from others and thus the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> other businesses' <b>insolvency.</b> For a brief period, in Barker v Corus the House of Lords then decided that employers would only be liable on a proportionate basis, thus throwing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> employers' <b>insolvency</b> back onto workers.
