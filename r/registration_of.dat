5|$|The French {{national}} stud, the Haras Nationaux, {{allows the}} <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> horses bred using artificial insemination and embryo transfer, {{but does not}} allow the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> cloned horses. It considers the breed to be endangered, along with several other French draft breeds. A 2009 study of French equine genetics proposed that the Boulonnais, along with four other French breeds, should be a conservation priority, with a goal of maintaining maximum genetic variability in France's native horse population. This follows from studies done as early as 1983 that showed inbreeding {{and a lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed.|$|E

5|$|The Jersey Act was {{introduced}} to prevent the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> most American-bred Thoroughbred horses in the British General Stud Book. It had {{its roots in the}} desire of the British to halt the influx of American-bred racehorses of possibly impure bloodlines during the early 20th century. Many American-bred horses were exported to Europe to race and retire to a breeding career after a number of US states banned gambling, which depressed Thoroughbred racing as well as breeding in the United States. The loss of breeding records during the American Civil War and the late beginning of the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> American Thoroughbreds led many in the British racing establishment to doubt that the American-bred horses were purebred.|$|E
5|$|Any Canadian citizen or {{corporate}} body can petition for {{a grant of}} new arms or <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> existing arms. In general, eligibility for a grant of arms {{is based on an}} individual's contributions to the community, although the exact criteria for grants or registrations have not been published. A number of grants have been made to people who have already been recognized with state honours for their notable achievements, such as through admission to the Order of Canada, and who are accordingly entitled to a grant of arms. Those who are Companions of the order may also request the chief herald to grant them supporters.|$|E
5|$|Article 14(3) {{provides}} {{that the right}} to form associations may also be restricted by any law relating to labour or education. The Trade Unions Act regulates labour organizations, while schools are generally required to be registered under either the Education Act or the Private Education Act. Under the Education Act, it is an offence for pupils or other persons to assemble on the premises of a school the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> which has been cancelled. Statutes governing universities provide that student bodies created pursuant to a university's constituent documents must be registered under the Societies Act unless the Minister for Home Affairs has exempted such bodies.|$|E

5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because party politics required him to do so. His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his role on the councils, Laybourne Smith was an adviser during {{the development of the}} State Building Act of 1923, and he was largely responsible for the framing of the 1939 Architects Act, (which provided for the formal <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> architects in South Australia). Because of his work on the State Building act, Laybourne Smith sat on the Board of Referees responsible for adjudicating disputes, and his position on the Architects Board of South Australia was a direct result of his involvement {{in the creation of the}} Architects Act.|$|E
5|$|In the House of Representatives, Voorhis was a loyal {{supporter}} of the New Deal and compiled a liberal voting record. His major legislative achievement was the Voorhis Act of 1940 requiring <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> certain organizations controlled by foreign powers. After being re-elected by comfortable margins four times, he faced Nixon in 1946 in a bitter campaign in which Voorhis' supposed endorsement by groups linked to the Communist Party {{was made into a}} major issue. Nixon won the Republican-leaning district by over 15,000 votes and Voorhis refused to run against Nixon in 1948.|$|E

5|$|<b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> Business: Business {{registration}} {{is linked to}} a Lebanese Identity Card holder's Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) to help identify them as the true owner of their business. The Registrar General’s Department make it a requirement for all business owners to provide their PIN on the Lebanese Identity Card during business registration. This eliminates business registration fraud through the exposure of false identities and prevents multiple registrations of businesses for fraudulent purposes.|$|E
5|$|The daric also {{improved}} {{government revenues}} as {{the introduction of}} the daric made it easier to collect new taxes on land, livestock and marketplaces. This led to the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> land which was measured and then taxed. The increased government revenues helped maintain and improve existing infrastructure and helped fund irrigation projects in dry lands. This new tax system also {{led to the formation of}} state banking and the creation of banking firms. One of the most famous banking firms was Murashu Sons, based in the Babylonian city of Nippur. These banking firms provided loans and credit to clients.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion, {{with a few}} exceptions. In Delaware v.

5|$|The makers {{violated}} {{the rules of}} The Cinematograph Act, 1952 and the Central Board of Film Certification regarding the re-working of its title from The Businessman to Businessman after the board cleared the film with the former title.

The set of posters sent to the board for certification purpose carried the full title. The film was publicised without the definite article, which was also missing from the posters. Also the 'A' certification was omitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{new rule}} was not applied retroactively, {{therefore}} all American-bred horses registered before 1913 {{remained on the}} register, and their descendants were also eligible for <b>registration.</b> <b>Of</b> the 7,756mares in Volume 27 of the General Stud Book, published in 1933, 930 would have been ineligible under the new rule. The Jersey Act did have an immediate impact however, as {{the winner of the}} 1914 Epsom Derby, Durbar II, was ineligible for registration, as his dam, Armenia, was bred in the United States and was not herself eligible for the General Stud Book.|$|E
