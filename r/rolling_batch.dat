40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} hot <b>rolling</b> <b>batch</b> {{planning}} problem in production scheduling {{of iron and}} steel enterprises, a hot <b>rolling</b> <b>batch</b> planning model is formulated based on multiple travelling salesmen problem(MTSP) model. The objective is to minimize the total limit penalty value of adjacent stripped steels in width, thickness and hardness. The main constraints include jumps in width, thickness and hardness between adjacent stripped steels, which are essential for steel production process. An improved genetic algorithm is designed to solve the model. A simulation example shows the reasonability of the model {{and validity of the}} algorithm...|$|E
50|$|One simple {{version of}} the LSM tree is a {{two-level}} LSM tree.As described by Patrick O'Neil, a two-level LSM tree comprises two tree-like structures, called C0 and C1. C0 is smaller and entirely resident in memory, whereas C1 is resident on disk. New records are inserted into the memory-resident C0 component. If the insertion causes the C0 component to exceed a certain size threshold, a contiguous segment of entries is removed from C0 and merged into C1 on disk. The performance characteristics of LSM trees stem {{from the fact that}} each component is tuned to the characteristics of its underlying storage medium, and that data is efficiently migrated across media in <b>rolling</b> <b>batches,</b> using an algorithm reminiscent of merge sort.Most LSM trees used in practice employ multiple levels. Level 0 is kept in main memory, and might be represented using a tree. The on-disk data is organized into sorted runs of data. Each run contains data sorted by the index key. A run can be represented on disk as a single file, or alternatively as a collection of files with non-overlapping key ranges. To perform a query on a particular key to get its associated value, one must search in the Level 0 tree, as well as each run.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{recrystallization}} of hot-rolled aluminum strips was monitored inline after inline annealing at Commonwealth Aluminum Corporation (CAC) using laser-ultrasonics. The noncontact measurement {{is based}} on sensing {{the ratio of the}} compressional to the shear sound velocity in the strip thickness direction. This ratio is insensitive to strip thickness variations and varies with crystallographic texture and temperature. Therefore, recrystallization is sensed as a change of texture, from a rolling to an annealing texture. A pyrometer is used to decouple temperature and texture effects on the velocity ratio. The measurements were made on two alloys: AA 5754 and AA 5052. The capabilities and limitations of the sensor are discussed. Introduction: Aluminum sheets are often made by melting scrap aluminum, adjusting the chemistry, casting using a twin belt caster, hot <b>rolling,</b> cooling, <b>batch</b> annealing, and cold rolling. Clearly, letting the hot-rolled coil cool to subsequently anneal in a batch anneal furnace is less energy efficient than would be a new process involving hot rolling followed immediately by inline annealing. Moreover, energy savings and sheet quality would be optimal if the degree o...|$|R
