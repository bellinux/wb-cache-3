40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} solvency risk, underwriting risk, investment incentives and tax management objectives on the reinsurance demand by a sample of UK-based liability insurance companies. In addition, the effects of firm-specific factors including firm size and firm profitability on the reinsurance decision of the sample of UK liability insurance companies is tested. Due {{to the fact that}} the demand for reinsurance is measured by the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>claims</b> ratio which should be restricted to the unit interval of zero to one, the sample panel data of 2103 firm/year observations is divided into two separate groups. One group includes the UK liability insurers with <b>reinsurance</b> <b>claims</b> ratios defined on the open interval of zero to one and the other group includes the UK liability insurance firms with <b>reinsurance</b> <b>claims</b> ratios equal to the boundary values of zero and/ or one. In group one, it is observed that underwriting risk and firm size are important determinants of the level of the reinsurance purchased by the UK liability insurance companies. Additionally, it is shown that firm size, firm profitability and solvency risk impact the amount of reinsurance purchased by the UK liability insurers in group two. As it is proved that firm size is an important determinant of the reinsurance demand, it should be investigated why it has opposite impacts on the UK liability insurers’ reinsurance decisions in the two separate groups of this study. It is shown that the sample of UK liability insurers mostly constitutes of large insurance companies which are engaging in reinsurance activities contrary to our prediction as they are providing reinsurance internally through their captives or their subsidiaries. On the other hand, the small to normal sized UK liability insurance companies are engaging in reinsurance activities consistent with our prediction and the smaller ones have higher reinsurance demands.

40|$|When {{commuting}} workers compensation <b>reinsurance</b> <b>claims,</b> {{the standard}} {{method is to}} project the future value of the claims using stated assumptions for future medical usage, medical inflation, cost-of-living adjustments, and investment income. The actuary selects a best estimate for each variable, and assumes this deterministic number will be realized in the future. To account for the date of death being stochastic, a mortality table is used to model the future lifetime. By assuming deterministic values for future medical usage, medical inflation, cost-of-living adjustments, and investment income, the calculation ignores the possibilities of higher or lower values. It is shown that these do not generally balance out, and that the standard method produces biased results. In low reinsurance layers, the 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a dynamic reinsurance market, where the traded risk process {{is driven by}} a jump-diffusion and where claim amounts are unbounded. These markets {{are known to be}} incomplete, and there are typically infinitely many martingale measures. In this case, no-arbitrage pricing theory can typically only provide wide bounds on prices of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>claims.</b> Optimal martingale measures such as the minimal martingale measure and the minimal entropy martingale measure are determined, and some comparison results for prices under different martingale measures are provided. This leads to a simple stochas-tic ordering result for the optimal martingale measures. Moreover, these optimal martingale measures are compared with other martingale measures that have been suggested in the literature on dynamic reinsurance markets.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for pricing {{structured}} CAT bonds based on utility indifference pricing. The CAT bond considered here is issued in two distinct notes called tranches, specifically senior and junior tranches {{each with its own}} payment schedule. Our contributions to the literature of CAT bond pricing are two-fold. First, we apply indifference pricing to structured CAT bonds. We find a price for the senior tranche as a relative indifference price, that is, relative to the price of the junior tranche. Alternatively, one could take the approach that the senior tranche is priced first and the price of the junior tranche is relative to that. Second, instead of simply supposing that the "not-issue-a-CAT-bond" strategy of the reinsurer is to do nothing, we suppose that the reinsurer reduces its risk by reinsuring proportionally less claims. We assume that the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>claims</b> follow a (Poisson) jump-diffusion process. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{consists}} of two parts: Part 1 : Estimating the loading of the largest <b>claims</b> <b>reinsurance</b> covers. Part 2 : On the loading of the ECOMOR. Abstract on part 1 The largest <b>claims</b> <b>reinsurance</b> treaties are reconsidered. Two approaches for estimating a certain {{main part of the}} loading are given. For the first approach certain bounds are derived, for the second the Monte-Carlo-Integration-method adapted. The second, not so practicable approach can be used for finding adequate mixing coefficients for the first, quite practicable approach. Abstract on part 2 Unfortunately the in part one given, very practicable, first approach can not be used in case of the ECOMOR-cover, though this treaty is related to the largest claims covers of part 1. So this note gives further, more special results on the loading of the ECOMOR, in case of using again the standard-deviation or variance principle. 1 Estimating the loading of the largest <b>claims</b> <b>reinsurance</b> covers...|$|R

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of the “follow the settlements” clause in English law is well settled: the reinsurer is obliged to follow the reinsured’s settlement {{so long as the}} settlement is bona fide and businesslike and the loss is covered by the terms of the reinsurance agreement. In the United States, the “follow the fortunes” clause is used interchangeably with the “follow the settlements” clause to express a similar interpretation that the reinsurer cannot second-guess the reinsured’s settlement made in good faith. However, a further issue which may arise in relation to the {{interpretation of}} the “follow the fortunes/settlement” clause is the allocation of the settled insured amount to the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>claim.</b> Long-tail risks, such as claims for asbestos exposure, may be insured and reinsured by several different insurance and reinsurance arrangements covering different periods of time. If the reinsurers have agreed to follow the reinsured’s fortunes, does this preclude the reinsurers from challenging the allocation made by the reinsured especially if the reinsured’s incentive is to allocate the loss in a way maximising the reinsurance coverage.
