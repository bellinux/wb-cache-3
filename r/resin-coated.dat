25|$|The late 1950s {{and early}} 1960s in France saw art forms {{that might be}} {{considered}} Pop Art. Yves Klein had attractive nude women roll around in blue paint and throw themselves at canvases. Victor Vasarely invented Op-Art by designing sophisticated optical patterns. Artists of the Fluxus movement such as Ben Vautier incorporated graffiti and found objects into their work. Niki de Saint-Phalle created bloated and vibrant plastic figures. Arman gathered together found objects in boxed or <b>resin-coated</b> assemblages, and César Baldaccini produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures. In May 1968, the radical youth movement, through their atelier populaire, produced {{a great deal of}} poster-art protesting the moribund policies of president Charles de Gaulle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the manner}} of Greek wine, Roman wine was often flavored with herbs and spices (similar to modern vermouth and mulled wine) and was {{sometimes}} stored in <b>resin-coated</b> containers, giving it a flavor similar to modern retsina. Romans were {{particularly interested in the}} aroma of wine and experimented with various methods of enhancing a wine's bouquet. One technique that gained some usage in southern Gaul was planting herbs such as lavender and thyme in the vineyards, believing that their flavors would pass through the ground and into the grapes. Modern-day wines from the Rhone are often characterized by using the aroma descriptors of lavender and thyme, presumably as a reflection of the grape varieties used and the terroir. Another widespread practice was the storage of amphoras in a smoke chamber called a fumarium to add smokiness to a wine's flavor.|$|E
2500|$|Electricity {{readings}} may {{be recorded}} continuously with a device {{known as an}} electrograph. [...] Francis Ronalds created an early electrograph around 1814 in which the changing electricity made a pattern in a rotating <b>resin-coated</b> plate. [...] It was employed at Kew Observatory and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in the 1840s to create records of variations in atmospheric electricity. In 1845, Ronalds invented photographic means of registering the atmospheric electricity. [...] The photosensitive surface was pulled slowly past of the aperture diaphragm of the camera box, which also housed an electrometer, and captured ongoing movements of the electrometer indices as a trace. [...] Kelvin used similar photographic means for his quadrant electrometer (see above) in the 1860s.|$|E
50|$|The paper base of <b>resin-coated</b> papers {{is sealed}} by two {{polyethylene}} layers, making it impenetrable to liquids. Since no chemicals or water are {{absorbed into the}} paper base, the time needed for processing, washing and drying durations are significantly reduced in comparison to fiber-based papers. Resin paper prints can be finished and dried within twenty to thirty minutes. <b>Resin-coated</b> papers have improved dimensional stability, and do not curl upon drying.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{black-and-white}} {{papers are}} coated {{on a small}} range of bases; baryta-coated paper, <b>resin-coated</b> paper or polyester. In the past, linen {{has been used as}} a base material.|$|E

5000|$|Slovenia: lončeni bas (pottery bass), {{also called}} gudalo or vugaš. The {{instrument}} is a clay pot, generally between 20 and 40 cm tall, covered with skin or parchment {{and with a}} <b>resin-coated</b> hardwood stick of similar length tied in the center.|$|E
50|$|Pellets {{conforming}} to the European standards norms which contain recycled wood or outside contaminants are considered Class B pellets. Recycled {{materials such as}} particle board, treated or painted wood, melamine <b>resin-coated</b> panels and the like are particularly unsuitable for use in pellets, since they may produce noxious emissions and uncontrolled variations in the burning characteristics of the pellets.|$|E

50|$|A {{suspension}} of silver salts in gelatin is coated onto a support such as glass, flexible plastic or film, baryta paper, or <b>resin-coated</b> paper. These light-sensitive materials are stable under normal keeping conditions {{and are able}} to be exposed and processed even many years after their manufacture. This is in contrast to the collodion wet-plate process dominant from the 1850s-1880s, which had to be exposed and developed immediately after coating.|$|E
50|$|The mordançage {{process can}} be used to treat either fiber-based or <b>resin-coated</b> paper. After making a silver gelatin print, the {{photograph}} is placed in the mordançage solution, and left in until the image has bleached. The hydrogen peroxide in the solution softens the gelatin in the emulsion. Next, the chemicals are rinsed off of the print. Some people choose to remove the parts of the emulsion that have started to disintegrate while washing; these areas will be the darkest portions of the print.|$|E
50|$|Some {{seeds are}} {{produced}} every year, and good seed crops occur at three- to five-year intervals. At maturity, the cone scales with their <b>resin-coated</b> seeds adhering to them, or sometimes entire cones, {{drop to the}} water or ground. This drop of mature seeds is often hastened by squirrels, which eat bald cypress seeds, but usually drop several scales with undamaged seeds still attached to each cone they pick. Floodwaters spread the scales or cones along streams and {{are the most important}} means of seed dissemination.|$|E
50|$|The {{proppant}} is a {{granular material}} that prevents the created fractures from closing after the fracturing treatment. Types of proppant include silica sand, <b>resin-coated</b> sand, bauxite, and man-made ceramics. The choice of proppant {{depends on the}} type of permeability or grain strength needed. In some formations, where the pressure is great enough to crush grains of natural silica sand, higher-strength proppants such as bauxite or ceramics may be used. The most commonly used proppant is silica sand, though proppants of uniform size and shape, such as a ceramic proppant, are believed to be more effective.|$|E

50|$|The {{roof was}} made from 25,000 Akita Cypress trees which were aged {{over the course of}} 60 years. This wooden {{framework}} is covered with a special double Teflon-coated membrane made from translucent fluorethylene <b>resin-coated</b> fibreglass. This membrane is very strong and light. The stadium is location in a region of Japan that it subjected to heavy snowfall of 2 to 3 m. Because of this, the dome itself also has an aerodynamic design to resist strong winds and heavy snowfall. Buildup of snow on the roof is prevented by circulating warm air between the 2 Teflon-coated membranes, this shakes off the snow and allows the stadium to be used in all weathers.|$|E
5000|$|Fiber-based (FB or Baryta) {{photographic}} papers {{consist of}} a paper base coated with baryta. Tints are sometimes added to the baryta to add subtle colour to the final print; however most modern papers use optical brighteners to extend the paper's tonal range. [...] Most fiber-based papers include a clear hardened gelatin layer above the emulsion which protects it from physical damage, especially during processing. This is called a supercoating. Papers without a supercoating are suitable for use with the bromoil process. Fiber-based papers are generally chosen as a medium for high-quality prints for exhibition, display and archiving purposes. These papers require careful processing and handling, especially when wet. However, they are easier to tone, hand-colour and retouch than <b>resin-coated</b> equivalents.|$|E

5000|$|The Roman {{settlements}} in Illyria, Cisalpine Gaul and Gallia Narbonensis {{did not use}} <b>resin-coated</b> amphorae {{due to the lack}} of suitable local pine trees and began to develop solid, less leak-prone wooden barrels in the 1st century AD. By the 3rd century, barrel making was prevalent throughout the Roman Empire. The exception was the eastern empire regions of Byzantium which had developed a taste for the strong, pungent wine and continued to produce resinated wine long after the western Roman empire stopped. The difference in taste between the two empires took center stage in the work of the historian Liutprand of Cremona and his Relatio de Legatione Constantinopolitana. In 968, Liutprand was sent to Constantinople to arrange a marriage between the daughter of the late Emperor Romanos II and the future Holy Roman Emperor Otto II. According to Liutprand, he was treated very rudely and in an undignified manner by the court of Nikephoros II, being served goat stuffed with onion and served in fish sauce and [...] "undrinkable" [...] wine mixed with resin, pitch and gypsum—very offensive to his Germanic tastes.|$|E
5000|$|According to NIOSH and OSHA, a {{combination}} of engineering controls, protective personal equipment, safety education, alternative proppant, and work site safety practices {{are the key to}} protecting workers from respirable crystalline silica exposure. One particular engineering control that is used in field testing is the mini-baghouse that reduces the silica dust produced by the sand movers. Personal protective equipment is normally used in jobs with silica exposure, however NIOSH discovered that incorrect respirators, a half mask type, was used and did not meet the silica exposure levels. [...] NIOSH and OSHA recommend a full face air purifying respirator (PAPR) for all workers exposed to high levels of silica. Another control measure is using a silica substitute proppant such as sintered bauxite, ceramics, or <b>resin-coated</b> sand, however OSHA notes that the safety testing must be performed on these alternatives. Besides these controls measures, the recommend exposure limits (REL) and permissible exposure levels (PEL) need to be set lower than current levels. By June 2016, new regulations for silica will take effect, which lower the PEL to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of silica in the air.|$|E

40|$|Removal of {{the oxygen}} {{inhibition}} layer {{from the surface}} of <b>resin-coated</b> gutta-percha cones during packaging has been hypothesized for their weak adhesion to a methacrylate-based root canal sealer, resulting in their frequent delamination from the sealer after root canal obturation. This study examined the feasibility of creating oxygen inhibition layers on <b>resin-coated</b> gutta-percha cones via the adjunctive application of a dual-cured dentin adhesive just before bonding. Composite cylinders were bonded with EndoREZ to flat, <b>resin-coated</b> gutta-percha disks and similar disks that were post-treated with Prime&Bond NT Dual Cure adhesive and stressed to failure using a modified microshear testing design. Although shear strengths for both groups were relatively low, a 5 -fold increase in shear strength was observed after adhesive application, with complex interfacial failures instead of complete sealer delamination from the resin-coating. In-situ dentin adhesive application appears to have merits in enhancing the coupling of <b>resin-coated</b> gutta-percha to methacrylate sealers...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} mechanical properties of resin-based luting agents {{on the strength of}} <b>resin-coated</b> porcelain. The luting agents tested were two flowable resin composites (Filtek Z 350 Flow and Tetric-N Flow), a light-cured resin cement (Variolink Veneer [VV]), and a dual-cured resin cement (Variolink II) in either light-cured (base paste) or dualcured (base + catalyst pastes [VD]) mode. Flexural strength (sigma(f)) and modulus of elasticity (E-f) of the luting agents were measured in three-point bending mode (n= 5). Porcelain discs (Vita VM 7) were tested either untreated (control) or acid etched, silanized, and coated with the luting agents. Biaxial flexural strength (sigma(bf)) of the porcelain discs was tested using a ball-onring setup (n= 30). The sigma(bf) of the <b>resin-coated</b> specimens was calculated at z-axial positions for multilayer specimens in the ball-on-ring test: position z = 0 (ceramic surface at the bonded interface) and position z = -t(2) (luting agent surface above ring). The sigma(f) and E-f data were subjected to analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls test (alpha= 0. 05). A Weibull analysis was performed for sigma(bf) data. Weibull modulus (m) and characteristic strength (sigma(0)) were calculated. Linear regression analyses investigated the relationship between mechanical properties of the luting agents and the strengthening of porcelain. VD had higher and VV had lower mechanical strength than the other materials. At z = 0, all <b>resin-coated</b> groups had higher sigma(bf) than the control group. No significant differences between the luting agents were observed for sigma(bf) and sigma(0). At z = -t(2), VD had the highest sigma(bf) and sigma(0), whereas VV had the poorest results. No significant differences in m were observed across groups. A linear increase in flexural strength of the porcelain was associated with increased sigma(f) and E-f of the luting agents at position z = -t(2). In conclusion, resin coating and use of luting agents with better physical properties generally improved the mechanical performance of porcelain...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the obturation quality between canals obturated with gutta-percha/AH Plus sealer (GP group) and <b>resin-coated</b> GP/EndoREZ® sealer (ER group). Methods: A total sample of 90 mandibular premolar teeth was divided into 2 groups (2 × 45 canals) : the GP group and ER group. Each group was further divided into 3 subgroups (n = 15) : cold lateral compaction (CLC), warm lateral compaction (WLC) and single cone (SC). The teeth were subsequently embedded in resin and sectioned horizontally at 1, 3, 6 and 9 mm. All sections were then viewed with a stereomicroscope at × 40 magnification. The area occupied by core filling materials was determined using Cell^D software. Results: With CLC, the percentage of core filling materials in the ER group was significantly higher than in the GP group at the 1 -and 3 -mm levels. Similarly, with WLC, the percentage of core filling material in the ER group was significantly higher than in the GP group at the 1 -, 3 -and 9 -mm levels. With SC, the percentage of core filling materials in the ER group was significantly higher than in the GP group at all levels. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the <b>resin-coated</b> GP/EndoREZ® sealer is superior to the gutta-percha/AH Plus in the percentage of core filling material...|$|E
