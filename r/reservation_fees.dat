40|$|Abstract—In many services, such as cloud computing, cus-tomers {{have the}} option to make {{reservations}} in advance. However, {{little is known about the}} strategic behavior of customers in such systems. In this paper, we use game theory to analyze several models of time-slotted systems in which customers can choose whether or not making an advance reservation of server resources in future time slots. Since neither the provider nor the customers know in advance how many customers will request service in a given slot, the models are analyzed using Poisson games, with decisions made based on statistical information. The games differ in their payment mechanisms, and the main objective is to find which mechanism yields the highest average profit for the provider. Our analysis shows that the highest profit is achieved when advance <b>reservation</b> <b>fees</b> are charged only from customers that are granted service. Furthermore, informing customers about the availability of free servers prior to their decisions do not affect the provider’s profit in that case. I...|$|E

Revenue management, however, is underutilized in the golf industry, as customers are believed to perceive such practices as unacceptable and unfair. This paper explores six revenue management practices that might be suitable in a golf context and examines their perceived fairness. The results show that golfers perceive arrival duration control practices {{in the form of}} <b>reservation</b> <b>fees</b> or no-show fees as fair. In addition, it was found that golfers perceive demand-based pricing in the form of coupons (two for the price of one), time-of-day and reduced tee time intervals as fair. Conversely, time-of-booking pricing was perceived as neutral to slightly unfair. Varying price levels were seen as unfair, with potential negative consumer reactions to this practice. Furthermore, the paper explores whether framing demand-based pricing as discounts rather than surcharges would make a difference. It was found that demand-based pricing presented as discounts were generally seen as fairer and therefore less likely to {{have a negative impact on}} consumer perceptions and reactions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} integrating contract markets with spot markets using tradable options for capacity. Sellers and Buyers may either contract for delivery in advance (the " option) or they may sell and buy {{some or all of}} their output/input in a spot market. Contract pricing involves both a reservation fee per unit of capacity and an execution fee per unit of output if capacity is called. The key question addressed is the structure of the optimal portfolios of contracting and spot market transactions for these Sellers and Buyers, and the pricing thereof in market equilibrium. We show that when Sellers properly anticipate demands to their bids, then bidding a contract execution fee equal to variable cost dominates all other bidding strategies yielding the same contract output. The optimal capacity <b>reservation</b> <b>fees</b> are determined by Sellers to trade o the risk of underutilized capacity against unit capacity costs. Buyers ' optimal portfolios are shown to follow a merit order (or greedy) shopping rule, under which contracts are signed following an index that is an increasing function of the Sellers ' reservation cost and execution cost. Existence and structure of market equilibria are characterized for the associated competitive game between Sellers, under the assumption that they know Buyer demand functions. 1...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the airline}} {{industry}} has drastically changed since its deregulation in 1978, publically available sources of data have remained nearly the same. In the U. S., most researchers and decision-makers rely on government data that contains highly aggregated price information (e. g., average quarterly prices). However, aggregate data can hide important market behavior. With the emergence of online distribution channels, {{there is a new}} opportunity to model air travel demand using detailed price information. 	 	This dissertation uses online prices and seat maps to build a dataset of daily prices and bookings at the flight-level. Several research contributions are made, all related to leveraging online data to better understand airline pricing and product strategies, and how these strategies impact customers, as well as the industry in general. One major contribution is the finding that the recent product debundling trend in the U. S. airline industry has diluted revenues to the U. S. Airport and Airways Trust Fund by at least five percent. 	Additionally, several new behavioral insights are found for one debundling trend that has been widely adopted by U. S. airlines: seat <b>reservation</b> <b>fees.</b> Customers are found to be between 2 and 3. 3 times more likely to purchase premium coach seats (with extra legroom and early boarding privileges) when there are no regular coach window or aisle seats that can be reserved for free, suggesting that the ability of airlines to charge seat fees is strongly tied to load factors. Model results are used to explore optimal seat fees and find that an optimal static fee could increase revenues by 8 percent, whereas optimal dynamic fees could increase revenues by 10. 2 percent. 	Another major contribution is in modeling daily bookings and estimating price elasticities using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression without correcting for price endogeneity and two-stage least squares (2 SLS) regression, which corrects for endogeneity. Results highlight the importance of correcting for price endogeneity (which is not often done in air travel applications). In particular, models that do not correct for endogeneity find inelastic demand estimates whereas models that do correct for endogeneity find elastic demand estimates. This is important, as pricing recommendations differ for inelastic and elastic models. A set of instrumental variables are found to pass validity tests and can be used to correct for price endogeneity in future models of daily flight-level demand. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Service-oriented {{computing}} is {{an increasingly}} popular approach for providing applications, computational resources and business services over highly distributed and open systems (such as the Web, computational Grids and peer-to-peer systems). In this approach, service providers advertise their offerings {{by means of}} standardised computer-readable descriptions, which can then be used by software applications to discover and consume appropriate services without human intervention. However, despite active research in service infrastructures, and in service discovery and composition mechanisms, little work has recognised that services are offered by inherently autonomous and self-interested entities. This autonomy implies that providers may choose not to honour every service request, demand remuneration for their efforts, and, in general, exhibit uncertain behaviour. This uncertainty is especially problematic for the service consumers when services are part of complex workflows, as is common in many application domains, such as bioinformatics, large-scale data analysis and processing, and commercial supply-chain management. In order to address this uncertainty, we propose a novel algorithm for provisioning services for complex workflows (i. e., for selecting suitable services for the constituent tasks of a workflow). This algorithm uses probabilistic performance information about providers to reason about service uncertainty {{and its impact on}} the overall workflow. Furthermore, our approach actively mitigates this uncertainty by employing two key techniques. First, it proactively provisions redundant services for particularly critical or failure-prone tasks (thus increasing the probability of success). Second, it recovers dynamically from service failures by re-provisioning services at run-time (without necessarily receiving explicit failure messages). Unlike existing work in this area, our algorithm employs principled decision-theoretic techniques to determine which services to provision, whether to introduce redundant services and when to re-provision failed services. In doing so, it explicitly balances the cost of provisioning with the expected value of the workflow. To show how our algorithm applies to a range of common service-oriented systems, we consider a variety of different scenarios in this thesis. More specifically, we first examine environments where the consumer lacks specific knowledge to differentiate between distinct service providers, as is common in highly dynamic and open systems. Despite this lack of detailed knowledge, we demonstrate how the consumer can use redundancy and dynamic re-provisioning to influence the outcome of a workflow and to deal with uncertainty. Then, we look into systems where the consumer has more specific knowledge about highly heterogeneous providers. While existing work has concentrated on selecting the single best provider for each workflow task, we show that a consumer can often improve its performance by provisioning multiple providers with different qualities for a single task. Finally, we discuss how our algorithm can be adapted for systems where consumers and providers reach explicit service contracts in advance. In this context, we are the first to propose a gradual provisioning approach, whereby the consumer negotiates contracts for some tasks in advance, but leaves the negotiation of others to a later time. This approach allows the consumer to better react to uncertain service outcomes and to avoid paying <b>reservation</b> <b>fees</b> that are later lost when services fail. Throughout this thesis, we compare our approach empirically to current provisioning algorithms. In doing so, we demonstrate that our approach typically achieves a significantly higher utility for the service consumer than approaches that do not reason about uncertainty, that rely on fixed levels of redundancy or service time-outs, and approaches that select single services to achieve the optimal balance of various performance characteristics. Furthermore, we show that these results hold over a large range of environments and workflow types and that our algorithm copes well even in highly uncertain environments where most services fail. As our approach relies on fast heuristics to solve a problem that is known to be intractable, it scales well to larger workflows with hundreds of tasks and thousands of providers. Finally, where it is tractable to compute an optimal solution, we show empirically that our algorithm achieves a high utility that is within 87 % or more of the optimal.
