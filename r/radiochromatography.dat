40|$|Prostaglandins are {{important}} modulators {{of the action}} of vasopressin. Others researchers have proposed that vasopressin stimulates prostaglandin synthesis, completing a negative feedback loop and thereby limiting vasopressin's antidiuretic effect. We have re-examined this question, using specific radioimmunoassay and thin-layer <b>radiochromatography</b> to determine prostaglandin synthesis by the toad bladder. Under control conditions, the bladder synthesizes prostaglandin (PG) E 2 and thromboxane (TX) B 2. There was no evidence for synthesis of PGE 1 or PGF 2 alpha by radioimmunoassay, or of other prostaglandins by <b>radiochromatography.</b> Furthermore, {{there was no evidence}} for metabolism of PGE 2 by the bladder. Using a variety of protocols, in isolated epithelial cells as well as intact bladders, we were unable to detect any significant increase in PGE 2 or TXB 2 synthesis after stimulation with arginine vasopressin (AVP) or deamino- 8 -D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP). Arachidonic acid, the specific precursor of prostaglandin synthesis, increased PGE 2 synthesis twofold, and significantly inhibited AVP- and DDAVP-stimulated water flow by 60 and 75 %, respectively. Naproxen and acetaminophen inhibited prostaglandin synthesis and enhanced water flow in response to AVP and DDAVP (44 - 54 %). Our findings indicate that the toad bladder produces tow prostaglandins, PGE 2 and TXB 2, and that vasopressin does not alter their rate of synthesis. Because agents such as acetaminophen and naproxen inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and enhance vasopressin- and DDAVP-stimulated water flow, we suggest that it is the inhibitory effect of these agents on the hormone-independent rate of prostaglandin synthesis that is responsible for their enhancement of water flow. Furthermore, because AVP appears to increase prostaglandin synthesis by the intact kidney, we suggest that cells other than those of the collecting tubule are responsible for the increased prostaglandin production...|$|E

Tumor uptake was rapid and tumor retention was prolonged. Fifty-nine lesions were identified by conventional imaging methods. 18 F-FDG PET was positive in 57 of 59 lesions (97 %), with an average lesion maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) 5. 22. 18 F-FDHT PET was positive in 46 of 59 lesions (78 %), with the average positive lesion SUVmax 5. 28. Treatment with testosterone resulted in diminished 18 F-FDHT up-take at the tumor site. Conclusion: 18 F-FDHT localizes to tumor sites in patients with progressive clinically metastatic prostate can-cer and may be a promising agent to analyze antigen receptors {{and their impact on}} the clinical management of prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|Strict {{anaerobic}} culture {{techniques were}} used to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria present at the sediment-water interface of hyperutrophic Wintergreen Lake (Augusta, Mich.). Anaerobic plate counts remained constant from March through December, 1973, ranging from 2. 4 X 10 (6) to 5. 7 X 10 (6) organisms/g (dry weight) of sediment. The isolatable bacteria represented {{a small percentage of}} the total microbial community, which was shown by direct microscopic counts to be 2. 0 X 10 '' organisms/g (dry weight) of sediment during June and July. Bacteria of the genus Clostridium dominated the isolates obtained, accounting for 71. 8 % of the 960 isolates examined. A single species, Clostridium bifermentens, comprised 47. 7 % of the total. Additional bacterial groups and the percentage in which they were isolated included: Streptococcus sp. (10. 8 %), unidentified curved rods (9. 5 %y, gram-positive nonsporing rods (5. 6 %), and motile gram-negative rods (1. 9 %). Temperature growth studies demonstrated the ability of all the isolates to grow at in situ sediment temperatures. Gas-liqid <b>radiochromatography</b> was used to determine the soluble metabolic end products from [U- 14 C]glucose and a U- 14 C-labeled amino acid mixture by representative sedimentary clostridial isolates and by natural sediment microbial communities. At in situ temperatures the natural sediment microflora produced soluble fermentative end products characteristic of those elaborated by the clostridial isolates tested. These results are considered strong presumptive evidence that clostridia are actively metabolizing in the sediments of Wintergreen Lake...|$|E
40|$|N-(4 -(5 -Nitro- 2 -furyl) - 2 -thiazolyl) formamide (FANFT) {{demonstrated}} carcinogenic {{activity for}} the urinary bladder of many species. The present study sought the metabolites of FANFT {{in the urine}} of rats fed this compound, and determined their mutagenic activity for Salmonella typhimurium TA 100. Three yellow FANFT metabolites, designated as FM I, FM 2 and FM 3, were present in urine and could be separated by polyvinylpyrrolidone column chromatography or cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC). The Rf values on cellulose TLC were 0. 89, 0. 19 and 0. 37 (aqueous 2 % methanol) or 0. 40, 0. 30 and 0. 14 (aqueous 6 % acetic acid) for FM 1, FM 2 and FM 3, respectively. FM 2 was identified as 2 -amino- 4 -(5 -nitro- 2 -furyl) thiazole (ANFT) by comparison with authentic ANFT. Three rats were fed a diet containing 0. 188 % FANFT for 1 week and then were injected i. p. with [14 C]FANFT. The urine excreted during 24 hours was analyzed by <b>radiochromatography</b> on cellulose plates (aqueous 2 % methanol). About 33 %, 30 % and less than 5 % of the radioactivity in the urine were respectively accounted for FM I, FM 2, and FM 3, and no [14 C]FANFT could be detected. The cellulose chromatogram was cut into 1 cm long pieces, and each piece {{was placed in the}} center of a petri dish containing Salmonella typhimurium TA 100. Only FM 2 (ANFT) clearly demonstrated mutagenic activity. These data suggest that ANFT may be a proximate metabolite responsible for the induction of bladder cancer in rats fed FANFT...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Current {{management}} of anxiety, a common and debilitating disorder {{with a high}} social and personal cost, is far from satisfactory. Therefore, {{in the last years}} an urgent need for novel pharmacological approaches has emerged. One such strategy involves targeting the endocannabinoid system (ECS), and there is now considerable evidence for the central role played by ECS in coping with the regulation of stress and emotions. More recently, attention has moved from directly targeting type- 1 cannabinoid (CB 1) receptors to indirectly enhancing the content of their endogenous ligands, a more valuable strategy that preserves the spatiotemporal specificity of endocannabinoid activity. Despite recent evidence suggesting the benefits of inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme that degradates the endogenous CB 1 agonist arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide), {{further research is needed to}} demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of FAAH inhibitors, and their putative translation into the clinic. Methods: ST 4070, a novel, potent and selective reversible inhibitor of FAAH, was administered per os in CD 1 male mice (3 to 30 mg/ 10 ml/kg), that were tested in the elevated-plus maze, and in Wistar male rats (3 to 30 mg/ 2. 5 ml/kg), that were tested in the light-dark apparatus. In addition, the effect of ST 4070 on FAAH activity and on the content of FAAH substrates (anandamide and palmitoylethanolamide) in selected brain regions was assessed by <b>radiochromatography</b> and LC-MS analysis. Results: ST 4070 showed clear anxiolytic-like properties in both rodent models, and in parallel it also produced a clear inhibition of FAAH activity, and a significant increase of anandamide and palmitoylethanolamide in behaviorally-relevant brain regions. Conclusions: Investigation into novel pharmacological targets for the {{management of}} anxiety holds the promise to further our understanding of its aetiology, and to develop new and more effective anxiolytic drugs, like the reversible FAAH inhibitor ST 4070.

40|$|Several {{lines of}} growth hormone (GH) -overexpressing fish have been {{produced}} and analysed for growth and fertility parameters. However, only few data {{are available on the}} growth-promoting hormone insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) that mediates most effects of GH, and these are contradictory. Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, radioimmunoassay, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and <b>radiochromatography</b> we investigated IGF-I and IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) in an adult (17 months old) transgenic (GH-overexpressing) tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The transgenics showed an around 1. 5 -fold increase in length and an approximately 2. 3 -fold higher weight than the non-transgenics. Using radioimmunoassay, the serum IGF-I levels were lower (6. 22 +/- 0. 75 ng/ml) in transgenic than in wild-type (15. 01 +/- 1. 49 ng/ml) individuals (P = 0. 0012). Radioimmunoassayable IGF-I in transgenic liver was 4. 2 -times higher than in wild-type (16. 0 +/- 2. 21 vs. 3. 83 +/- 0. 71 ng/g, P = 0. 0017). No hepatocytes in wild-type but numerous hepatocytes in transgenic liver contained IGF-I-immunoreactivity. RT-PCR revealed a 1. 4 -times higher IGF-I mRNA expression in the liver of the transgenics (10. 51 +/- 0. 82 vs. 7. 3 +/- 0. 49 pg/microg total RNA, P = 0. 0032). In correspondence, in situ hybridization showed more IGF-I mRNA containing hepatocytes in the transgenics. A twofold elevated IGF-I mRNA expression was determined in the skeletal muscle of transgenics (0. 33 +/- 0. 02 vs. 0. 16 +/- 0. 01 pg/microg total RNA, P < 0. 0001). Both liver and serum of transgenics showed increased IGF-I binding. The increased IGFBP content in the liver may lead to retention of IGF-I, and/or the release of IGF-I into the circulation may be slower resulting in accumulation of IGF-I in the hepatocytes. Our results indicate that the enhanced growth of the transgenics likely is due to enhanced autocrine/paracrine action of IGF-I in extrahepatic sites, as shown here for skeletal muscle...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Sm- 153 {{has found}} {{widespread}} use in nuclear medicine. It has favorable radiation characteristics, {{such as the}} medium-energy beta particles emission (Emax = 810 keV) which is desirable for treatment, the medium-energy gamma photon (103 keV) which is suitable for imaging and dosimetry measurement and the short half-life (46. 3 h). Both emissions allow to use Sm(III) complexes as therapeutic radiopharmaceutical and to follow {{the distribution of the}} radionuclide in vivo. Maltol (3 -Hydroxy - 2 -methyl- 4 -pyron) is produced by some plants and is commonly formed when sugars are heated. Maltol loses its hydroxyl proton from neutral to basic pH levels, forming the Maltolate anion; this anionic molecule forms a strong bidentate chelate with gallium, as well as with iron, zinc, aluminum, vanadium, and many other metals. Methods: Production of 153 Sm was performed at the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) using 152 Sm (n, gamma) 153 Sm nuclear reaction. <b>Radiochromatography</b> was performed by counting of Whatman No. 2 using a thin layer chromatography scanner. Gama-Spectroscopy on the base of 103 keV peak was carried out by using the HPGe. 153 Sm-Maltolate was produced using 153 Sm-SmCl 3 and was purchased Maltol in 2 h at 60 &deg;C. The analytical data for the structure determination and purity of the compound was obtained. The Radiochemical purity of 153 Sm-Maltolate was checked by RTLC. Also the biodistribution of 153 Sm-Maltolate in normal rat was checked. Results: The radiolabeled Sm complex was prepared in high radiochemical purity (&gt; 90 %, RTLC). In this study, at first stability test was done in normal saline and then checked by RTLC. For investigation of biodistribution in different tissues and comparing with free Sm, SmCl 3 and labeled compound were injected to the tail vein of the rat normal tissues, then absorption dose was determined. Conclusion: RTLC test results show that this complex synthesize with high percentage (radiochemical purity (&gt; 90 %)), and the biodistribution of 153 Sm-Maltolate in the normal tissues of rat show that it has high value in lymphoma tissues (Lung, Liver, Spleen and Sternum), especially in liver respect to the other tissues. Also its stability in normal saline is hig...|$|E
40|$|Not {{infrequently}} {{an important}} clinical drug {{is found to}} have side-effects far beyond those initially anticipated. Epinephrine, administered topically {{in the management of}} open-angle glaucoma, effectively lowers intraocular pressure, but it has side-effects which may be both local and systemic. As a first approach to the understanding of these widespread effects, the present studies report the specific distribution of radioactivity labeled epinephrine [...] after it is applied topically to one eye [...] in the same eye, the opposite eye, and in other certain nonocular tissues. Further, because of the existence of the clinical syndrome known as "aphakic epinephrine maculopathy," similar measurements of distribution of labeled epinephrine after topical administration are reported for aphakic eyes. Autoradiography is used to localize radioactive epinephrine specifically within tissues histologically, and <b>radiochromatography</b> is used to confirm specific association of radioactivity with chemically authentic epinephrine. In general, after topical administration, the exogenously administered epinephrine is taken up and stored substantially in the iris and ciliary body {{and to a lesser extent}} in the choroid in the treated eye. If the treated eye is aphakic, significantly more labeled epinephrine appears in the choroid. Far less epinephrine is found in the retina and still less in the optic nerve of the treated eye, but uptake and storage in these tissues also increases substantially in the treated eye if the eye is aphakic. Very small but definitely measurable and identifiable amounts of epinephrine also appear in the tissues of the opposite eye, again in similar proportions. There is no difference in the amount of epinephrine which appears in the opposite eye if either or both eyes are aphakic. Significant amounts of epinephrine are also seen in nonocular tissues such as those of the heart and spleen following topical administration. While these findings do not speak to the mechanism of epinephrine side-effects on the anterior eye, the posterior eye, the opposite eye, or on systemic tissues and organs, they do address the possibility that epinephrine can cause side-effects in these areas by demonstrating its localization there following topical administration. These findings have clinical implications relevant to glaucoma management, to toxic ocular syndromes such as epinephrine maculopathy in aphakia, and to toxic systemic effects of epinephrine...|$|E
40|$|Addition of {{physiological}} concentrations (10 (- 12) - 10 (- 8) M) of platelet-activating factor (PAF) to rabbit iris muscle induced a rapid release (in 15 s) of prostaglandin (PG) E 2 and 6 -oxo-PGF 1 alpha, measured by radioimmunoassay and rapid release of 14 C-labelled arachidonate and PGE 2 in muscle prelabelled with [14 C]arachidonic acid, measured by <b>radiochromatography.</b> These PAF actions are concentration- and time-dependent. The effect of PAF on PG release is not mediated through the cyclo-oxygenase pathway. The {{studies on the}} properties and mechanism of arachidonate release from phosphatidylinositol and other phospholipids in prelabelled irides by PAF suggest the involvement of a phospholipase A 2. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} findings: (a) that both the removal of arachidonate and formation of lysophosphatidylinositol, from phosphatidylinositol, by PAF occur concomitantly in a time-dependent manner, (b) that Ca 2 + is required for the agonist-induced release of arachidonate and PGE 2, and (c) that in contrast to the rapid release of [3 H]myo-inositol phosphates by carbachol and other Ca 2 +-mobilizing agonists previously reported in the iris muscle [Akhtar & Abdel-Latif (1984) Biochem. J. 224, 291 - 300], PAF (10 (- 12) - 10 (- 8) M) did not appreciably enhance the release of [14 C]myo-inositol phosphates and 32 P labelling of phosphatidate and phosphatidylinositol in this tissue. Ca 2 +-channel antagonists, such as nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem and manganese inhibited PAF-induced arachidonate and PGE 2 release in a dose-dependent manner. K+ depolarization, which causes influx of extracellular Ca 2 + in smooth muscle, did not increase the release of arachidonate and PGE 2. The ability of Ca 2 + antagonists to inhibit arachidonate release by PAF in this tissue probably reflects interference with PAF binding to its receptor. The PAF-induced release of arachidonate and PGE 2 occur independently of the cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Whether the PAF-induced release of arachidonate and PG in the iris muscle is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and/or physiological reactions in the eye, and how much the inhibitory effects of Ca 2 +-entry blockers on the PAF actions contribute to the therapeutic use of these drugs, remain to be established...|$|E
