50|$|Rotating Cell Biofilm Reactor (RCBR) is a {{new type}} of {{biological}} process based on biofilm active sludge used in wastewaters treatment. RCBR reactors represent an evolution of <b>Rotating</b> <b>Biological</b> Contactors plants: in fact, they are able to develop about ten times the <b>biological</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>Rotating</b> <b>Biological</b> Contactors plants, considering the same biological reactors volume (made of the set of disks). Such a result is obtained using - instead of a set of disks fixed on the central structured tree - many tridimensional plastic elements as carriers. These carriers are used to furnish the necessary <b>biological</b> <b>surface</b> for the cohesion of the bacterial film, responsible of the depuration process. These plastic elements are contained in a cilindric permeable cell, which is like the shape of the reactor cell of a traditional rotating RBC plant. One of the main peculiarity of the RCBR plant is represented {{by the fact that the}} biological carriers are common recycled water bottle plastic caps.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: We {{present the}} synthesis, {{characterization}} and initial structure-function {{analysis of a}} new class of bioactive agent that allows the application of techniques from colloid science to <b>biological</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Stable colloidal suspensions can be generated by immobilizing a dense brush of soluble polymer at the colloidal surface, creating a zone protected against the adhesion of approaching particles, a phenomenon termed polymeric steric stabilization. This is often accomplished for aqueous colloidal dispersions using adsorbing block copolymers. We demonstrate that water-soluble block copolymers can be designed to adsorb onto heterogeneous <b>biological</b> <b>surfaces</b> and block cell-cell and cell-surface adhesion, using polymer compositions and architectures that are quite different from surfactants used for stabilizing nonbiological colloidal dispersions. Results: Comb copolymers were synthesized having polycationic backbones (poly-L-lysine, PLL), serving as the anchor for binding to the net negatively charged <b>biological</b> <b>surfaces,</b> grafted with water-soluble polynonionic chains (polyethylene glycol, PEG), to block biological recognition, producing PILL-graft-PEG copolymers. Specific copolymers were found to sterically stabilize red blood cells from lectin-induced hemagglutination and fibroblasts from adhesion to fibronectin-coated surfaces. The polymer design principles, which appear to be unique for adsorption to heterogeneous <b>biological</b> <b>surfaces,</b> require the use of very high molecular weight comb copolymers, perhaps because anionic sites are non-uniformly distributed on <b>biological</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and the ability of larger copolymers to span between highly anionic sites.

50|$|A <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> {{contactor}} or RBC is {{a biological}} treatment process {{used in the}} treatment of wastewater following primary treatment. The primary treatment process means protection by removal of grit and sand and course material through a screening process, followed by a removal process of sediment by settling. The RBC process involves allowing the wastewater to come in contact with a biological medium in order to remove pollutants in the wastewater before discharge of the treated wastewater to the environment, usually a body of water (river, lake or ocean). A <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> contactor is a type of secondary (Biological) treatment process. It consists of a series of closely spaced, parallel discs mounted on a rotating shaft which is supported just above the surface of the waste water.

The present study puts emphasis on the significance of this control or design parameter because it allows direct comparison of the RBC system's performance when operated under various circumstances and with different kinds of wastewater. The results of the paper proved that, the COD removal in <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> contactor systems {{is a function of the}} organic loading rate. However, each of the wastewater concentration and flow rate are also influence on the system efficiency but theirs impact can be combined by the effect of organic loading. The majority of COD removal (40 - 85 % of the total removal depending on the organic loading applied) occurs in the first stages of the system. There is a strong correlation between the organic loading and the concentration of the suspended solids in the <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> contactor basin. At higher loadings higher concentrations noted. At a loading of about, (24 g/m 2. d) suspended solids were 225, 125, 35, and 25 mg/L in the first, second, third and, the fourth stage respectively. To achieve an effluent quality of (BOD < 25 mg/L, COD < 60 mg/L), the system must be operated on organic loadings of about (22 gBOD/m 2. d and 65 gCOD/m 2. d) respectively. For nitrification process, the system must be designed to operate at organic loading of about (10 g/m 2. d) or less and, the reactor or basin volume should be designed to achieve a hydraulic loading of about (40 L/m 2. d) or less...|$|R
