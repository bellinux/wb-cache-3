2500|$|In USSR, a {{deficiency}} of any {{vehicles in the}} market and low personal incomes led to great increasing of cheap 50cc mopeds and kits production. It achieves approximately a half million per year at the later 70s. As to technical level, it was analogous to pre-WW2 German models, with minimal changes made to later 80s. The only clip-on kit engine was [...] "D" [...] series ("Д-4" ... "Д-8Э"), a single-speed chain-driven 45cc 2-stroke motor with manual clutch and a <b>rotary</b> <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> in a crankschaft. It was destined for clipping into a classic twin-diamond bike frame. At 2010s, it's still widely produced by some Chinese factories like Jiangdu in a piston distribution version, and has some popularity even in United States.|$|E
40|$|A failed <b>Rotary</b> <b>Slide</b> <b>Valve</b> (RSV) of {{the main}} fuel pump of an {{aeroengine}} was analyzed. Examination showed that the RSV has failed by seizure. Scanning electron microscopic study revealed presence of foreign particles rich in O, Al, Si and Ca in the seized area. It appears most probable that the ingression of foreign hard particles in the annular space between one of the guide lands on the slide and the sleeve would {{have led to the}} seizure of the RSV...|$|E

40|$|In view of {{the large}} number of {{failures}} of <b>rotary</b> <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> (RSVs) in the recent past, seven numbers of RSVs were withdrawn from service and were forwarded to the laboratory for estimation of retained austenite. Volume percent of retained austenite in both slide and sleeve of each RSV was measured using x-ray diffraction technique. The results did not show any pattern with the hours in service. Out of the seven RSVs, six were found to have retained austenite in excess of 10 volume percent either in the slide or sleeve or in both. The slide heat treated at HAL, Bangalore, showed about 8. 4 volume percent retained austenite...|$|R
40|$|This paper fully {{describes}} the working principle of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> in single-screw expanders (SSEs). A geometric analysis of suction and volume ratio <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{is presented to}} determine the relations between volume ratio, suction closure volume, discharge opening volume and <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) thermodynamic model with SSE integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> is developed to analyze the power output of SSE and the net power output of ORC system and variation law of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. Analysis of a typical ORC system under changing operating conditions shows that the power output of the expander and the net output power of the ORC system with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> are much better than those without <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b> When the condensing temperature is 40 °C and the waste availability is 80 kW, the increase in output power and net output power are approximately 3. 4 kW and 5 kW, respectively. The presented geometric analysis of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> and the thermodynamic model integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{can be used to}} provide a theoretical and technical basis for designing the <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> of SSEs and the control strategies of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> under varied operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|A portion (half cut) of {{the slide}} and {{the sleeve of}} a failed <b>rotary</b> <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> (RSV) were {{forwarded}} to the laboratory for analysis. Examination revealed that the RSV has got seized at the land towards to cardon shaft. Presence of hard abrasive particles was observed in the seized region. Chemical analysis indicated these particles to be rich in silicon, aluminium and oxygen. The size of the particles {{was found to be}} in the range 10 - 30 m. No damages were observed {{at the edges of the}} working lands. However, a few shallow circumferential scoring marks were observed on these lands and also on the corresponding locations in the sleeve. The volume percent retained austenite in sleeve and slide was measured to be 5. 8  0. 5 and 5. 3  0. 4 respectively...|$|E
40|$|Components from crashed {{aeroengine}} {{were sent}} to the laboratory for metallurgical investigation. Investigation revealed that the <b>Rotary</b> <b>Slide</b> <b>Valve</b> (RSV) got seized due to presence of foreign abrasive particles rich in silicon, aluminum and oxygen. These particles were found to be in the size range 5 - 15 m. The seizure of the RSV has led to the shearing off of cardon shaft due to torsional overload. Fractographic study indicated that the failure of the cardon shaft took place under the superimposition of bending stresses, probably due to misalignment. The damages seen on the other components such as LPTR blades, HPTR blades and Nozzle Guide Vanes (1 st and 2 nd stages) are secondary in nature and subsequent to the primary failure. It appears most probable that the failure of RSV has resulted in overspeeding of the engine leading to subsequent failures...|$|E
