40|$|The {{explosion}} {{limits of}} <b>refrigerants</b> and lubricants’ mixture were studied. The <b>refrigerants</b> like R 161, R 1234 yf and R 152 a are combustible. Lubricants, {{to a certain}} extent, are combustion-supporting. In many actual conditions, lubricants and <b>refrigerants</b> are mixed together. In this paper, a test device which can be run automatically was established according to ASTM E 681 - 09, and the explosive experimental of <b>refrigerants</b> and lubricants’ mixture in some ratio was studied.

5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma tube and <b>refrigerant</b> applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is the only source, it is considerably more expensive than helium.|$|E
5|$|Neon is the second-lightest noble gas, after helium. It glows reddish-orange in {{a vacuum}} {{discharge}} tube. Also, neon has the narrowest liquid range of any element: from 24.55 K to 27.05 K (−248.45°C to −245.95°C, or −415.21°F to −410.71°F). It has over 40 times the refrigerating capacity of liquid helium and three times that of liquid hydrogen (on a per unit volume basis).

Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride.|$|E

40|$|A certain {{percentage}} of the vapor compression based refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump systems continue to run on halogenated <b>refrigerants</b> due to its excellent thermodynamic and thermo-physical properties along with the low cost. However, the halogenated <b>refrigerants</b> have adverse environmental impacts such as ozone layer depletion potential and global warming. Hence, {{it is necessary to}} look for alternative <b>refrigerants</b> to full fill the objectives of the international protocols (Montreal and Kyoto) and to satisfy the growing worldwide demand. In this context, the use of "natural " <b>refrigerants</b> (air, CO 2 or ammonia) becomes a possible solution. We introduce in this study the merit of redeploying these natural <b>refrigerants</b> as an alternative solution to replace halogenated <b>refrigerants.</b> This paper reviews the various experimental and theoretical studies carried out around the globe with environment friendly alternatives such as hydrocarbons (HC), hydroflurocarbons (HFC) and their mixtures, which {{are going to be the}} promising long-term alternatives. In addition, the technical difficulties of mixed <b>refrigerants</b> and future challenges of the alternatives are also discussed...|$|R
5|$|The Montreal Protocol, {{signed in}} 1987, set strict {{regulations}} on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons {{due to their}} ozone damaging potential (ODP). The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant {{that they were not}} decomposing until they reached higher altitudes, where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules. Even with the ban, and early indications of its efficacy, predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery. With one-tenth the ODP of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the current replacements, and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030–2040 by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with no chlorine and zero ODP. In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries; the Environmental Protection Agency had already prohibited one HCFC's production and capped those of two others in 2003. Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials (GWPs) of about 100 to 10,000; sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20,000. An outlier is HFO-1234yf which is a new type of <b>refrigerant</b> called a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) and has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1,430 for the current <b>refrigerant</b> standard HFC-134a.|$|E
5|$|Like dry ice, {{the main}} use of liquid {{nitrogen}} is as a <b>refrigerant.</b> Among other things, {{it is used}} in the cryopreservation of blood, reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and other biological samples and materials. It {{is used in the}} clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin. It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during normal operation. Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary (around −200°C). Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.|$|E
25|$|The {{absorption}} {{cycle is}} similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the <b>refrigerant</b> vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber which dissolves the <b>refrigerant</b> in a suitable liquid, a liquid pump which raises the pressure and a generator which, on heat addition, drives off the <b>refrigerant</b> vapor from the high-pressure liquid. Some work is needed by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of <b>refrigerant,</b> it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. In an absorption refrigerator, a suitable combination of <b>refrigerant</b> and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (<b>refrigerant)</b> with water (absorbent), and water (<b>refrigerant)</b> with lithium bromide (absorbent).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} the different operating conditions of three <b>refrigerants</b> i. e. R 22, R 410 A and R 32. For analysis 1 Ton of window air conditioner has been chosen.

The HFC groups of <b>refrigerants</b> {{do not have any}} Ozone Depletion Potential and <b>refrigerants</b> like R 32 has the advantage of lower Global Warming Potential (GWP: 675) with compare to R 22 (GWP: 1700) and R 410 A(GWP: 2100) <b>refrigerants.</b> As per the indication of Montreal and Kyoto protocol, the world community has decided to phase down the HCFC group <b>refrigerants.</b> The refrigeration and air conditioning industry required to evaluate new alternative <b>refrigerants</b> to HCFC- 22 also known as R 22.

40|$|<b>Refrigerants</b> used {{in process}} and {{facilities}} {{systems in the}} US include R- 12, R- 22, R- 123, R- 134 a, R- 404 A, R- 410 A, R- 500, and R- 502. All but R- 134 a, R- 404 A, and R- 410 A contain ozone-depleting substances that will be phased out under the Montreal Protocol. Some of the substitutes do not perform {{as well as the}} <b>refrigerants</b> they are replacing, require new equipment, and have relatively high global warming potentials (GWPs). New <b>refrigerants</b> are needed that addresses environmental, safety, and performance issues simultaneously. In efforts sponsored by Ikon Corporation, NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), ETEC has developed and tested a new class of <b>refrigerants,</b> the Ikon (registered) <b>refrigerants,</b> based on iodofluorocarbons (IFCs).

25|$|Heat pumps use a <b>refrigerant</b> as an {{intermediate}} fluid to absorb heat where it vaporizes, in the evaporator, and then to release heat where the <b>refrigerant</b> condenses, in the condenser. The <b>refrigerant</b> flows through insulated pipes between the evaporator and the condenser, allowing for efficient thermal energy transfer at relatively long distances.|$|E
25|$|A strong {{magnetic}} field {{is applied to}} the <b>refrigerant,</b> forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the <b>refrigerant</b> into a state of lowered entropy. A heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the <b>refrigerant</b> due to its loss of entropy. Thermal contact with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated, and the {{magnetic field}} is switched off. This increases the heat capacity of the <b>refrigerant,</b> thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} {{similarities}} between adsorption chillers and absorption refrigeration, {{the former is}} based on the interaction between gases and solids. The adsorption chamber of the chiller is filled with a solid material (for example zeolite, silica gel, alumina, active carbon or certain types of metal salts), which in its neutral state has adsorbed the <b>refrigerant.</b> When heated, the solid desorbs (releases) <b>refrigerant</b> vapour, which subsequently is cooled and liquefied. This liquid <b>refrigerant</b> then provides a cooling effect at the evaporator from its enthalpy of vaporization. In the final stage the <b>refrigerant</b> vapour is (re)adsorbed into the solid. As an adsorption chiller requires no compressor, it is relatively quiet.|$|E
50|$|When <b>refrigerants</b> {{are removed}} {{they should be}} {{recycled}} to clean out any contaminants and return them to a usable condition. <b>Refrigerants</b> should never be mixed together outside of facilities licensed {{to do so for}} the purpose of producing blends. Some <b>refrigerants</b> must be managed as hazardous waste even if recycled, and special precautions are required for their transport, depending on the legislation of the country's government.|$|R

25|$|The air {{conditioning}} system on the new Insight has an expanded thermodynamic range compared to conventional systems. Unlike the separate low pressure and high pressure <b>refrigerant</b> pipes used in conventional systems, the Insight has its low pressure cold pipe enclosing the high pressure hot <b>refrigerant</b> pipe that allows the cold <b>refrigerant</b> on its {{way back to the}} engine bay to cool the warm <b>refrigerant</b> traveling to the cabin. A unique, spiral groove along the outside of the inner pipe increases the surface area and therefore the efficiency of the heat transfer between the outer and inner tubes. This improves the thermal efficiency of the air-conditioning system and, as a result, less effort is required from the compressor, resulting in improved fuel efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Phosgene {{may also}} be {{produced}} during testing for leaks of older-style <b>refrigerant</b> gases. Chloromethanes (R12, R22 and others) were formerly leak-tested in situ by employing a small gas torch (propane, butane or propylene gas) with a sniffer tube and a copper reaction plate in the flame nozzle of the torch. If any <b>refrigerant</b> gas was leaking from a pipe or joint, the gas would be sucked into the flame through the sniffer tube and would cause a colour change of the gas flame to a bright greenish blue. In the process, phosgene gas would be created due to the thermal reaction. No valid statistics are available, but anecdotal reports suggest that numerous refrigeration technicians suffered the effects of phosgene poisoning due to their ignorance of the toxicity of phosgene, produced during such leak testing. Electronic sensing of <b>refrigerant</b> gases phased out the use of flame testing for leaks in the 1980s. Similarly, phosgene poisoning is a possibility for people fighting fires {{that occur in the}} vicinity of <b>refrigerant</b> leaks from air-conditioning systems or refrigeration equipment, smoking in the vicinity of a freon <b>refrigerant</b> leak, or fighting fires using halon or halotron.|$|E
25|$|The working fluid, in its gaseous state, is {{pressurized}} and circulated {{through the}} system by a compressor. On the discharge side of the compressor, the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a heat exchanger, called a condenser, until it condenses into a high pressure, moderate temperature liquid. The condensed <b>refrigerant</b> then passes through a pressure-lowering device also called a metering device. This may be an expansion valve, capillary tube, or possibly a work-extracting device such as a turbine. The low-pressure liquid <b>refrigerant</b> then enters another heat exchanger, the evaporator, in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils. The <b>refrigerant</b> then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated.|$|E
