5|$|The {{station was}} the first {{to be able to be}} resupplied by the newly {{developed}} unmanned Progress freighters, although they could only dock at the <b>rear</b> <b>port,</b> as the front port lacked the plumbing used to refuel the propulsion system. The freighters docked automatically to the station via the Igla, and were then opened and emptied by the cosmonauts on board, whilst transfer of fuel to the station took place automatically under supervision from the ground.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for {{the launch}} resumed on 22 January, and the launch {{occurred}} successfully at 04:28:42 GMT on 24 January. Following the launch, Progress M1-5 {{spent three days}} in free flight before docking with the <b>rear</b> <b>port</b> of the Kvant-1 module of Mir at 05:33:31 GMT on 27 January. The docking port had previously been occupied by Progress M-43, which departed at 05:19:49 on 25 January, and subsequently remained in orbit until Progress M1-5 had docked with Mir. Progress M-43, which had originally been launched to carry supplies and raise Mirs orbit, in anticipation of manned flights which were never launched, was subsequently deorbited at 02:12 GMT on 29 January, burning up during re-entry at 02:58.|$|E
5|$|Mir was {{primarily}} {{supported by the}} Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft and had two ports available for docking them. Initially, the fore and aft ports of the core module {{could be used for}} dockings, but following the permanent berthing of Kvant-1 to the aft port in 1987, the <b>rear</b> <b>port</b> of the new module took on this role from the core module's aft port. Each port was equipped with the plumbing required for Progress cargo ferries to replace the station's fluids and also the guidance systems needed to guide the spacecraft for docking. Two such systems were used on Mir; the rear ports of both the core module and Kvant-1 were equipped with both the Igla and Kurs systems, whilst the core module's forward port featured only the newer Kurs.|$|E

500|$|The {{cabin crew}} started the evacuation, {{even before the}} plane {{had come to a}} halt, via both forward galley doors, both rear doors and the {{starboard}} overwing exits. Eighteen passengers escaped via the overwing exits before the fire grew too intense to use that route. The forward port galley door escape slide caught fire before it could be used, but one person jumped from there. 84 people escaped via the starboard galley door. Three of the crew escaped by the emergency cockpit rope. The rear starboard door escape slide had twisted on deployment, so Steward Taylor climbed down to straighten it, leaving stewardess Jane Harrison at the door assisting the passengers. Six passengers escaped via this route before the slide was punctured and deflated. Harrison encouraged the passengers to jump, and pushed out those too frightened to do so. 11 people escaped via this route, and five more escaped via the <b>rear</b> <b>port</b> door before the slide was destroyed. Harrison was last seen alive preparing to jump herself, but then she turned back and disappeared into the burning fuselage in an attempt to save the remaining four female passengers, including a disabled woman and eight-year-old girl. It was these actions which led to the award of the George Cross posthumously [...] to Harrison in recognition of her selfless gallantry. 35 people were injured, and five killed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{equivalent}} of five expansion cards were built-in and {{integrated into the}} Apple IIc motherboard: [...] An Extended 80 Column Card, two Apple Super Serial Cards, a Mouse Card, and a disk floppy drive controller card. This meant the Apple IIc had 128 KB RAM, 80-column text, and Double-Hi-Resolution graphics built-in and available {{right out of the}} box, unlike its older sibling, the Apple IIe. It also meant less of a need for slots, as the most popular peripheral add-on cards were already built-in, ready for devices to be plugged into the <b>rear</b> <b>ports</b> of the machine. The built-in cards were mapped to phantom slots so software from slot-based Apple II models would know where to find them (i.e. mouse to virtual slot 4, serial cards to slot 1 and 2, floppy to slot 6, and so on). The entire Apple Disk II Card, used for controlling floppy drives, had been shrunk down into a single chip called the “IWM” which stood for Integrated Woz Machine.|$|R

50|$|Apple {{discontinued}} the III in October 1983 {{because it}} violated Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, and the FCC required {{the company to}} change the redesigned computer's name. It introduced the Apple III Plus in December 1983 at a price of US$2995. This newer version includes a built-in clock, video interlacing, standardized <b>rear</b> <b>port</b> connectors, 55-watt power supply, 256 KiB RAM as standard, and a redesigned, IIe-like keyboard.|$|E
50|$|The EO-2 crew {{conducted}} an emergency EVA on April 11 {{to investigate the}} problem. The crew found a piece of debris, probably a trash bag, that was left by Progress 28. After removing it, Kvant-1 {{was finally able to}} achieve a hard dock with the station on the same day. The Kvant-FSM, which contained the now unneeded propulsion of the Kvant-1 module, was finally jettisoned on April 12, revealing Kvant-1's <b>rear</b> docking <b>port.</b>|$|R

Both rear lights were substantially similar, except that the <b>rear</b> <b>Port</b> Penn light was 30 ft higher.|$|E
50|$|Progress 9 was undocked 20 May, {{leaving the}} <b>rear</b> <b>port</b> vacant {{for the arrival}} of the next crew. Soyuz 36 was {{launched}} 26 May with Valery Kubasov and Hungarian cosmonaut Bertalan Farkas. The flight was originally scheduled for 5 June 1979, but was cancelled due to the Soyuz 33 failure. The launch {{was a part of the}} Soviet Intercosmos program whereby guest cosmonauts from allied nations would visit the space station, typically for about a week. Upon boarding, the visiting crew carried out some Hungarian experiments, including one measuring radiation doses received by the crew and another studying the formation of interferon in human cells under weightless conditions.|$|E
50|$|Soyuz 35 was {{launched}} 9 April 1980 with Leonid Popov and Valery Ryumin aboard for a planned rendezvous with the orbiting Salyut 6 space station. The launch followed increased recent activity with the unmanned space station. An unmanned test craft, Soyuz T-1, spent several months docked {{to the station}} until it was undocked 23 March and deorbited 25 March. Progress 8, an unmanned supply tanker, {{was launched}} almost immediately afterwards, on 27 March, and it docked with the <b>rear</b> dock <b>port</b> of the two-dock facility. Several manoeuvres were carried out by 2 April using the Progress to adjust the station's orbit.|$|R
50|$|The crew {{first entered}} the Kvant-1 module on 13 April, {{when they began}} {{unloading}} equipment. On 23 April the next Progress spacecraft docked with the station via Kvant's <b>rear</b> docking <b>port,</b> where the FSM used to be. Progress 29 had a mass of 7,100 kg, and undocked from the station on 11 May. During this time Mir was short on electricity, so for most of May the EO-2 crew performed activities that used little electricity, such as medical experiments or Earth observations. On 22 May the next resupply craft arrived, Progress 30, which had a mass of 7,249 kg. It remained docked until 19 July.|$|R
