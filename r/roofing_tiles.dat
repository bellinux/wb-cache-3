5|$|A {{survey by}} {{archaeologist}} Howard Thomas in 1979 unearthed {{a number of}} medieval potsherds {{in the vicinity of}} the farmhouse and found evidence of continuous occupation of the island including middens containing numerous animal bones along with oyster and cockle shells. Fragments of green glazed jugs and flagons from the late 12th to 13th century and shards of pottery from the 14th century were also found on the island. The presence of Pennant sandstone <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> and a fragment of a 14th-century glazed ridge tile indicate the existence of a substantial medieval building, possibly a chapel, demolished when the present farmhouse was constructed. Property records from 1542 show that King Henry VIII granted a lease to farm the island to a gentleman by the name of Edmund Tournor. His family remained on Flat Holm until the end of the 17th century when the lease passed to Joseph Robins.|$|E

Variable that mostly influence the production of <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> is the clay.

40|$|Utilization {{of waste}} matter in {{building}} construction {{is becoming more}} popular in the world mostly because it not only gives alternative for construction material but also gives a solution for waste management while reducing environmental pollution. Among many waste materials, Rice Husk Ash (RHA), a waste from clay products manufacturing process has no proper usage in many countries including in Sri Lanka. Objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of waste RHA collected from a brick kiln on structural and thermal properties of clay <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> <b>Roof</b> <b>tile</b> specimens with different RHA percentages (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %) were manufactured in industrial scale. Structural properties of clay <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> such as transverse breaking load, bulk density and water absorption were determined. In addition, thermal behaviour of <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> was examined. Furthermore, the physical and chemical properties of RHA and clay were also determined in order to find the reasons for characteristic behaviour of RHA added clay <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> For 10 % RHA replacement, transverse breaking load can be increased by 47. 24 %. Bulk density is reduced with the percentage of RHA added, which is a favourable property for <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> as a <b>roofing</b> material. RHA increases water absorption property. However, addition of RHA up to 15 % is acceptable, as it satisfies the limits specified in standards. Heat transmitted through the <b>roof</b> clay <b>tile</b> is reduced with increasing RHA percentage. Hence, cooler environment can be built under RHA added <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> than under conventional <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> It was found that the brick kiln RHA contains high amount of SiO 2 content of 84. 14 % and that may be the most probable reason for the strength gain property of RHA added <b>roof</b> <b>tiles...</b>|$|R

500|$|Over time, and {{particularly}} with the colonization of Madagascar by the French, these earthen houses (known as trano gasy – [...] "Malagasy house") underwent constant evolution. [...] The simplest form of earthen house is one or more stories tall, rectangular, and features a thatched roof with slightly overhanging eaves to direct rain away from the foundation and thereby prevent its erosion. [...] Wealthier families replace the thatch with clay <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> and construct a veranda on the west face of the building supported by four slender equidistant columns; this design is even more effective at protecting the building's foundations from the eroding effects of rainfall. [...] Further expansion often entails the enclosure of the western veranda in wood {{and the construction of}} an open veranda on the eastern face of the building, and so forth, leading to wrap-around verandas, the connection of two separate buildings with a covered passage, the incorporation of French wrought-iron grills or glass panels into verandas, the application of painted concrete over the brick surface and other innovations. [...] In suburban and rural zones, the ground floor of the trano gasy is often reserved as a pen for livestock, while the family inhabits the upper floors. [...] The entrance typically faces west; the kitchen is often to the south, while the family sleeps {{in the northern part of}} the building. [...] This configuration is consistent with that seen in the traditional Zafimaniry houses and reflects traditional cosmology.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{remaining}} walls were 1 foot high or less and of dry-set flint and chalk. They were only 1 foot to 1 foot 6inches in width (with offsets) in shallow foundation trenches. The excavator thought that {{the upper part of}} the walls were probably made of wychert, a local building material still existing in some buildings particularly at Haddenham and consisting of chalk mud mixed with straw which would set very solid. The roofs may have been partly thatched but part must have been tiled, because a fair number of <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> were found spread over the site. Looking at the building from the church side, the excavator thought that on the left was probably a two-storey building which would have been the accommodation reserved for the lord of the manor. The room on the first floor would have been the [...] "great chamber" [...] serving as bedroom and sitting room. The great hall probably extended in front of this part of the building towards the church, but this was not found or excavated. On the right of this room was probably the kitchen and beyond that more living accommodation, perhaps for the steward, with a smaller hall extending in front of it. This was roughly in the centre of the building. The excavator considered whether this might be the great hall but thought it probably too small. Beyond it to the right was a range of single storey rooms.|$|E

2500|$|Henry III in 1217 {{recognised}} by royal charter the town's oldest institution, Berkhamsted's pre-existing market. Trades within medieval Berkhamsted were extensive: {{early in}} the 13th century the town had a merchant, two painters, a goldsmith, a forester, two farriers, two tailors, a brewer of mead, a blacksmith, carpenters, wood turners, tool makers, a manufacturer of <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> and wine producers. In the mid–13th century, a banker, the wealthy Abraham of Berkhamsted, financier to the Earl of Cornwall, lived in the town; this was unusual for {{a small town in}} a time of heightened persecution of Jews. In 1290, a taxation list mentions a brewer, a lead burner, a carpenter, leather workers, a fuller, a turner, a butcher, a fishmonger, a barber, an archer, a tailor, a cloth-napper, a miller, a cook, a seller of salt and a huntsman. At this time, larger houses of merchants and castle officials appeared {{on the south side of}} the high street (including 173High Street, the oldest known extant jettied building in England). In 1307 Berkhamsted was a large town with an estimated population of 2,000 to 2,500. In 1355, there were five butchers, two bakers, nine brewers, two cobblers, a pelter, a tanner, five cloth dyers, six wheelwrights, three smiths, six grain merchants, a skinner and a baker/butcher.
