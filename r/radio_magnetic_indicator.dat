The alternator's frequency limits were rather low to where a frequency multiplier had to be utilized to generate higher radio frequencies than the alternator was capable of producing. Even so, early magnetic amplifiers incorporating powdered-iron cores were incapable of producing radio frequencies above approximately 200 kHz. Other core materials, such as ferrite cores and oil-filled transformers, would have to be developed to allow the amplifier to produce higher frequencies.|$|R

Thus, the new water- soluble iron-containing copolymers have been synthe-sized by using the neutralization and radical copolymerization reactions. Iron content in these copolymers has been determined by using atomic absorption spectroscopy.

Magnetite contamination of urban soils in Russia has both common {{features of the}} world and its specificity. The magnetite content through the magnetic susceptibility is used as an indirect indicator of the contamination degree of urban soils with some heavy metals. In the cities of Russia: Moscow, Cherepovets, Perm and Chusovoy, magnetite soil pollution is in agreement with some of the heavy metals pollution. The correlation coefficients between magnetic susceptibility and mobile forms contents are higher than coefficients with a total contents of heavy metals. The volume magnetic susceptibility, measured in the field conditions, is less correlated with the pollution of urban soils with heavy metals than an express specific magnetic susceptibility, which is determined in the laboratory.
