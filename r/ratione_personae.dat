2500|$|In the Instructions {{that were}} drawn up since 1462 the {{jurisdiction}} of the court as a tribunal of first instance was defined according to people who fell under its jurisdiction (<b>ratione</b> <b>personae)</b> and subject matters (ratione materiae) under its jurisdiction. In the category of people fell privileged persons like noblemen, Church officials and government officials, and [...] "defenseless" [...] people like women, clergymen, and widows and orphans, who deserved the special protection of the Count. Furthermore, foreigners without a fixed abode in Holland fell into this category. As to subject matter for the original jurisdiction of the court: all matters of concern to the Count, like his feudal Fees and domains, his rights (like Mint and High justice), and offices in his gift (read for [...] "Count" [...] after 1572 the States of Holland and Zeeland, who had already de facto taken over his sovereignty). Furthermore, important land-use cases, and conflicts between local governments fell under its jurisdiction, as did legal actions in connection with Possession (as opposed to Property actions). The last category was transferred to the original jurisdiction of the Hoge Raad after 1582, as was the original jurisdiction over cases of maritime law, and the grant of middelen van herstel en gunst (certain legal actions like e.g. the Cession of property by a debtor to his creditor). Unfortunately, when the Hoge Raad received its Instruction from the States-General in 1582 the Instruction of the Hof was not changed {{at the same time to}} reflect the transfer of competences in these respects.

In spite of strong objections from various states, ITLOS affirmed a broad advisory jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> materiae and <b>personae,</b> and {{found that there were}} no compelling reasons to exercise its discretionary power to dismiss the request.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the legal challenges arising {{in the context}} of the ‘fragmentation or unity of public international law’. The question of the so-called fragmentation of public international law mainly refers to the phenomenon of diversification and expansion of public international law. In recent years, the proliferation of international bodies entrusted with the task of monitoring States’ compliance with their international obligations has increased the possibility of conflicting interpretations of similar or identical rules of international law. In this context, it is claimed that international courts with limited <b>ratione</b> materiae and <b>personae</b> jurisdiction fragment international law and threaten its unity. This thesis examines the question of the fragmentation of public international law from the perspective of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). In the view of the present author, the European Court has developed the autonomous interpretative principle of taking cognisance of public international law norms when interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The ECtHR employs this interpretative principle in a fashion that is distinct from other seminal interpretative principles, namely the so-called comparative interpretation, the dynamic interpretation and the principle of effectiveness. Furthermore, this thesis provides in depth analysis of the ECtHR’s legal reasoning. It reaches conclusions on the type of public international law norms that the ECtHR takes into account and the conditions a norm must satisfy to qualify as ‘relevant’ and ‘applicable in the relations between the parties’. This thesis also provides an overall assessment of the different uses of public international law norms in the ECtHR’s reasoning, when expanding or restricting the scope of the rights and freedoms of the ECHR. It stresses the importance of the ECtHR’s practice of relying upon public international law norms in order to (re-) interpret the ECHR and overrule its previous case-law. Finally, this thesis explores the boundaries that should be set to restrict the impact of other relevant public international law norms on the construction of the ECHR. The study concludes that, in principle, the ECtHR does not threaten the unity of international law, but reads the ECHR harmoniously to public international law. The findings of this thesis also furnish evidence that the ECtHR has competence to pronounce on questions relating to international law and that, on certain occasions, it develops and enriches the scope and content of international law.

50|$|The ICJ {{delivered}} its {{judgment on}} the objection on 25 March 1947, voting fifteen-to-one, with Igor Daxner—Albania's designated ad hoc judge—being the sole dissenter. The majority held that Albania had voluntarily submitted to {{the jurisdiction of the}} International Court. Specifically, two successive pieces of correspondence were held to have established Albania's informal submission to the Court's jurisdiction: the British transmission of the application to Albania, followed by the Albanian letter to the Court. These documents established jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> and ratione materiae. An important factor in this decision {{was the fact that the}} Albanian letter had not been produced by Albania's Agent, but by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. In a separate opinion, while concurring with the majority that Albania had voluntarily submitted to the Court's jurisdiction, Judges Basdevant, Álvarez, Winiarski, Zoričić, de Visscher, Badawi, and Krylov argued that the Security Council's Article 36 recommendation did not place the case within the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.|$|E
50|$|Applications by {{individuals}} against contracting states, {{alleging that the}} state violates their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, {{can be made by}} any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals. Although the official languages of the Court are English and French, applications may be submitted in any one of the official languages of the contracting states. An application has to be made in writing and signed by the applicant or by the applicant's representative. Once registered with the Court, the case is assigned to a judge rapporteur, who can make a final decision that the case is inadmissible. A case may be inadmissible when it is incompatible with the requirements of ratione materiae, ratione temporis or <b>ratione</b> <b>personae,</b> or if the case cannot be proceeded with on formal grounds, such as non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, lapse of the six months from the last internal decision complained of, anonymity, substantial identity with a matter already submitted to the Court, or with another procedure of international investigation. If the rapporteur judge decides that the case can proceed, the case is referred to a Chamber of the Court which, unless it decides that the application is inadmissible, communicates the case to the government of the state against which the application is made, asking the government to present its observations on the case. The Chamber of the Court then deliberates and judges the case on its admissibility and its merits. Cases that raise serious questions of interpretation and application of the European Convention on Human Rights, a serious issue of general importance, or which may depart from previous case law can be heard in the Grand Chamber if all parties to the case agree to the Chamber of the Court relinquishing jurisdiction to the Grand Chamber. A panel of five judges decides whether the Grand Chamber accepts the referral.|$|E

The Statute of the ICTY is not and does not purport to be a meticulously detailed code providing for every possible scenario and every solution thereto. It sets out in somewhat general terms the jurisdictional framework within which the Tribunal has been mandated to operate. The list in Article 7(1) appears to be non-exhaustive in nature as the use of the phrase 'or otherwise aided and abetted' suggests.:The nature of joint criminal enterprise: insofar as a participant shares the purpose of the joint criminal enterprise (as he or she must do) as opposed to merely knowing about it, he or she cannot be regarded as a mere aider and abettor to the crime which is contemplated.

40|$|State {{immunity}} {{under international}} law extends to protect some individuals from criminal prosecution before national courts. This thesis aims to identify which individuals are immune from prosecution before the English courts, for what conduct, and for what period. The justifications for immunity are examined, {{and the extent of}} immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> and immunity ratione materiae are explored. This thesis argues that immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> is only narrowly available to high state officials, and that the immunity accorded, by consent, to special missions is sufficient to cover other official visits. In Pinochet (No 3) all seven judges agreed: 1. An ex-head of state is immune from prosecution for murder and conspiracy to murder alleged to have been committed in the forum state. 2. All state officials no matter how minor are entitled to continuing immunity This thesis analyses state practice in arresting or prosecuting foreign state officials, and argues that both of these statements are incorrect. This thesis argues that immunity does not attach to conduct alone, for a person to have continuing immunity ratione materiae they must have had immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae.</b> The forum state must have agreed to the official being present on its territory, and agreed to the purpose of the visit. Those officials present on the territory of a foreign state with the consent of that state who have immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> have continuing immunity ratione materiae only for official conduct, acta jure imperii. This does not extend to acts of violence. Finally the development of the regime for the prosecution and punishment of international crimes by national courts is considered. The conflict with immunity is examined, and a possible reconciliation between the two principles is suggested by using the complementarity principle in the statute of the International Criminal Court.

40|$|To date, investor-state tribunals {{have been}} preoccupied {{with a range}} of issues {{revolving}} around the territorial application (territoriality) of international investment agreements (IIAs). The importance, as well as the various forms such issues take, has recently been highlighted in the decision of the Singapore High Court (SGHC) in Laos v. Sanum. In this case, the SGHC was asked by Laos to set aside an earlier arbitral award (in Sanum v. Laos), filed by a Macanese legal entity and rendered under the China-Laos bilateral investment treaty (BIT). In approaching the matter, the SGHC set aside the award {{on the grounds that the}} China-Laos BIT did not extend to Macao. This decision has provoked mixed feelings, as it may weigh heavily against the territorial application of Chinese IIAs to Hong Kong and Macao. At the same time, from an academic perspective, the decision provides an opportunity to delve deeper into the territorial elements inherent to jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> as this pertains to international investment law. Within this setting, this article seeks to provide a conceptual framework for analyzing future investor-state arbitration disputes under IIAs where similar territorial application issues may arise. This article is nevertheless limited to issues of jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae.</b> Therefore, the territorial nexus of investments, particularly as it pertains to cases involving sovereign bonds, is not addressed in this article.

40|$|Summary: This article aims to {{identify}} the link between EU electoral rights and national citizenship and to situate these rights in the broader context of EU citizenship. For these purposes, two recent judgments of the European Court of Justice regarding EU elections dated 12 September 2006 are discussed (Spain v United Kingdom and Eman & Sevinger). These judgments establish important principles for {{the election of the}} European Parliament, especially the scope <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> of recognised electoral rights of EU citizens and the boundaries framing national policies in this respect. They either leave Member States free to apply residence criteria in order to limit the scope <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> of EU electoral rights or to invoke their own constitutional traditions to extend that scope. This is not to say, however, that the Member States enjoy complete freedom in this respect. The paper concludes that the current fundaments of EU citizenship are weak in EU primary law, in particular in the field of political rights. For this reason, the European elections and, more generally, the European democratic process should be discussed once again at the highest political level...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between State immunity and diplomatic immunity {{has always been}} a rather complex one. The two concepts undoubtedly have a common juridical background {{in the form of the}} concepts of sovereignty, independence and dignity. 1 On the other hand, recent developments in both fields have seen a move towards a more functional-based approach. Thus, in relation to diplomatic immunity, the dominant theoretical basis is that of functional necessity. 2 As regards State immunity, recent developments in both international law 3 and, more particularly, in UK law 4, from absolute to restrictive State immunity, have resulted in a more functionally orientated approach, that is, a shift of emphasis in matters of State immunity from immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> to immunity ratione materiae. 5 Now two recent cases in the United Kingdom have raised the possibility that, in the case of diplomats at least, the two concepts may be combined to provide a double immunity for diplomatic agents against civil suit. More controversially, the cases have raised the possibility of a third type of protection based upon immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> in what could be said to amount to a modified act of State doctrine. The cases in question are Propend Finance Pty Ltd. v. Alan Sing and The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police 6 and Re P (Diplomatic Immunity: Jurisdiction). ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the extent to which}} state officials are subject to prosecution in foreign domestic courts for international crimes. We consider the different types of immunity that international law accords to state officials, the reasons for the conferment of this immunity and whether they apply in cases in which it is alleged that the official has committed an international crime. We argue that personal immunity (immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>personae)</b> continues to apply even where prosecution is sought for international crimes. Also we consider that instead of a single category of personal immunity there are in fact two types of such immunity and that one type extends beyond senior officials such as the Head of State and Head of Government. Most of the article deals with functional immunity (immunity ratione materiae). We take the view that this type of immunity does not apply in the case of domestic prosecution of foreign officials for most international crimes. However, we reject the traditional arguments which have been put forward by scholars and courts in support of this view. Instead we consider the key to understanding when functional immunity is available lies in examining how jurisdiction is conferred on domestic courts. © EJIL 2011; all rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Supervisor: Prof. Marise CremonaAward date: 1 September 2012 The {{main subject}} of the thesis focuses {{on the concept of}} {{jurisdiction}} and its limits, with special attention put to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The first half of the work delivers the broad theoretical approach concerning types of jurisdictions and the notion of forum shopping. As far as the Court of Justice of the European Union is concerned, not only it describes its jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae,</b> ratione materiae, and defines its exclusivity, especially in the dimension of external relations of the EU, but it also presents the possible conflicting or complementary judicial regimes. Thus, the most important stress is given to the problem of overlapping jurisdiction in the context of international relations of the EU and the principle of the autonomy of the EU legal order. The second half of the work is dedicated to the practical example of the mixed agreement -United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - which has particular effects on the area of the competences of the EU and on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court. The Swordfish dispute and the MOX Plant dispute, taken as examples, bring relevant input, especially to the case of jurisdictional conflicts in front of mixed agreements. To sum-up, the thesis contributes to the delineation of the jurisdictional competence of the European Court of Justice as a mechanism that functions in very autonomous legal regime of the European Union...|$|E

The scope <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> and {{the current state of the}} principle of free movement of persons is assessed by looking at the most recent case law of the European Court of Justice and the recently adopted Directive on the rights of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states. But what are the hidden and visible obstacles to free movement of persons in Europe? How can these barriers be overcome to make free movement and residence rights more inclusive? This working document addresses these questions along with: 1. Who are the beneficiaries of the free movement of persons in an enlarged Europe? 2. What is the impact of the recent legal developments in the freedom of movement dimension, such as the European Court of Justice case law and the new Directive? 3. To what extent are pro-security policies such as the Schengen Information System II and an enhanced interoperability between European databases fully compatible with the freedom of movement paradigm...|$|E
40|$|PhDThe World Bank {{produces}} sample bidding {{documents for}} use by its member countries to prepare tender forms and contract conditions for Bankfinanced civil engineering construction contracts. The contract conditions provide for arbitration of disputes and parties to a contract may choose {{to submit to the}} International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) which was established by members of the World Bank for the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states. The objectives of the Thesis are to (i) examine the legality of generally submitting disputes in international civil engineering contracts to ICSID arbitration, (ii) provide an analysis of ICSID as an international arbitral institution and (iii) discuss the legal aspects of submission of disputes to ICSID arbitration in breach of the Convention that established ICSID. Chapters One, Two and Three are devoted to describing the importance of civil engineering works to economic growth and arbitration as a method of resolution of disputes. An analysis is made of the fundamentals and complexity of the arbitral process and the interfacing between legal systems, national laws and international law in international arbitrations. Chapter Four traces the genesis of ICSID and Chapter Five examines critically the salient features of ICSID arbitration, which according to the Thesis are not all exclusive to ICSID arbitration. Chapters Six and Seven analyse in depth ICSID jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae</b> and ratione materiae. Chapter Eight argues that disputes in freestanding international civil engineering contracts are not investment disputes and that submission to ICSID is in breach of the Convention. Chapters Nine and Ten discuss the legitimate role of ICSID in developing rules of international economic law and conclude by recommending that ICSID should not detract from that role by becoming just another arbitral institution in. the business of arbitration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractReasoning {{refers to}} the {{application}} of the rule, once interpreted, to the facts of the cause established by the Court and to the deduction of the conclusion of an infringement or non-infringement – in the respective case – of the rule invoked. The order of the examination of the questions – classical according to the opinion of a French judge – is the following: the competence of the Court, the admission of the petition, a good substantiation of the demand. The competence can be denied for incompatibility ratione materiae, if the litigation is outside the material domain of application of the Convention, <b>ratione</b> <b>personae,</b> if the defendant State {{is not part of the}} Convention or if the defendant is not the State or State-related; finally, ratione temporis, if the defendant State did not ratify the Convention or the pertinent protocol at the date when the facts were committed. The issue of the incompetence ratione loci is out of the question. Certainly, we can mention that renunciation exists and it triggers the disappearance of the case from the Court's roll; yet, the priority of this situation over that of incompetence is not solved as clearly as via the French administrative jurisprudence. Actually, the competence-related issues are dealt with by the Convention organs, the Commission and then the Court, as admission issues, which the State solves with the help of some preliminary exceptions or which the Court solves ex officio. Finally, it is essential that the European Court of Human Rights must defend the persons against the abusive violation of their rights by States, without condemning them systematically and a priori. And after 50 years of jurisprudence, we consider that, neither systematic, nor dogmatic, the reasoning of the Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg tends to evolve towards a pragmatic syncretism, which seems to us to be an acceptable possible approach...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{projected}} Arab Court of Justice (ACJ) as a regional court, expected to be created within the League of Arab States system. Chapter one deals mainly with {{the basic structure of}} the League of Arab States itself, its membership, its organs, the settlement of disputes, and the reasons that are delaying the creation of the ACJ and the role it will be expected to play in settling inter-Arab disputes. In the second chapter comprehensive information on the function of the judicial power in Islamic Shariah is presented, including the status of judges in Islam, their appointment, qualifications, independence and other issues related to them. Chapter three concentrates on the organisation of the projected ACJ, comparing its draft Statute with the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and other regional international courts. The chapter will also show how far the Arab draftsmen have been influenced by principles and rules of Islamic Shariah, especially in matters relating to the qualification of judges. Furthermore, the chapter will discuss other points related to the organisation of the bench such as nomination of candidates, system of election, constituting chambers, appointing ad hoc judges etc. The fourth chapter explains in detail at the level of theory as well as of practice the role of Islamic Shariah as a source to be applied by the projected ACJ. The chapter points to the need to discuss the origins and fundamental conceptions of Islamic Shariah as a law capable to be applied by the projected ACJ. Chapter five continues with a discussion of the jurisdiction of the ACJ, and makes detailed reference to the concepts of jurisdiction <b>ratione</b> <b>personae,</b> ratione materiae and the function of the ACJ to give advisory opinions. The thesis considers whether the Arab drafters have developed the above terms or have simply adopted them as they exist in the Statute of the International Court of Justice. The conclusions summarise the findings of the Thesis, and are accompanied by some critical remarks...|$|E
40|$|A globalização modificou substancialmente as relações entre os Estados, derrubando fronteiras até então rígidas. Nesse novo momento histórico, surgiu também a oportunidade, pela necessidade, de expansão dos investimentos dos particulares a novos territórios além de seu próprio Estado. Assim, com o tempo, a economia assistiu uma transformação intensa, por meio da qual o capital adquiriu uma mobilidade até então desconhecida, de modo que os investimentos realizados em um determinado Estado passaram a ter como origem diversos outros Estados, e, mais importante, sendo proveniente das reservas da iniciativa privada. A esta passou a serem necessárias garantias de que seu investimento não sofreria intervenção do Estado que o recebia, para que seu patrimônio não fosse prejudicado. Dentre estas garantias destacam-se os contratos de investimento, as legislações nacionais do Estado {{receptor}} que visavam proteger o investimento estrangeiro e, por fim, os tratados internacionais. Cada um destes instrumentos, a seu próprio modo, buscava oferecer segurança ao investidor estrangeiro, para que ele então se aventurasse naquele território. Uma das principais formas de se garantir o investimento estrangeiro é a transferência da competência para julgar eventuais disputas concernentes a tais investimentos do judiciário do Estado receptor à arbitragem internacional. Por se tratar de um tribunal independente e, teoricamente, melhor municiado para lidar com a problemática envolvida em uma controvérsia desta natureza, a arbitragem se tornou atrativa aos investidoras, receosos dos atos expropriatórios que poderiam vir a ser tomados pelos Estados receptores de seu capital. O surgimento do ICSID (ou CIRDI) através da Convenção de Washington de 1965, como instituição especializada neste tipo de controvérsia de investimento estrangeiro entre investidor privado e Estado receptor, deu ainda maior solidez a este sistema. A jurisdição do ICSID não é, entretanto, questão simples, pois exige a análise de diversos fatores para sua definição, tanto no âmbito dos sujeitos envolvidos (<b>ratione</b> <b>personae)</b> quanto no âmbito da matéria em disputa (rafione materiae). A Convenção de Washington estipula ainda um procedimento especifico a ser seguido pela arbitragem sob seus auspícios, bem como para a execução do laudo arbitral dela derivado. Trata-se, portanto, de assunto recheado de nuances que devem ser cautelosamente analisadas e detalhadasThe globalization changed substantially {{the relationships}} among States, breaking boundaries that were rigids until then. In this new moment in time, an opportunity also came up, by need, of expansion of the private investments towards new territories beyond the ones of their own. So, in time, the economy watched an intense transformation, by which capital gained mobility so far unknown, {{in a way that}} investments made in a given State had sources from various other States and, most importantly, coming from the reserves of the private initiative. To the private initiative guarantees started to be needed in order to that its investment did not suffer intervention from the State receiving the investment, and so that its asset wouldn't be damaged. Of these guarantees, the highlights are the investment agreements, the domestic legislation of the host State that aimed to protect the foreign investment and, at last, the international treaties. Each one of these instruments, at its own way, tried to offer security to the foreign investor, so that it would then venture in that territory. One of the main forms of guaranteeing the foreign investment is to transfer the competence to judge eventual disputes concerning such investments from the courts of the host State to international arbitration. Because it is an independent tribunal and, theoretically, better provided with resources {{to deal with the issue}} involved in such a controversy, arbitration has become attractive to investors afraid of the expropriatory acts that could be taken by the host States of their capital. The emergence of ICSID (or CIRDI) through the Washington Convention of 1965 as an institution specialized in this kind of dispute of foreign investment between private investor and host State granted even more soundness to this system. However, the ICSID jurisdiction is not simple, because it demands the analysis of various factors to its definition, both as the parties involved (<b>ratione</b> <b>personae)</b> and the subject in dispute (ratione materiae). The Washington Convention still sets forth a specific procedure to be followed by the arbitration under its auspices, as well as to the enforcement of the award stemming from it. Therefore, this is a subject filled with nuances that must be carefully analyzed and detaile...|$|E
