25|$|The {{reinforcement}} in a RC structure, {{such as a}} steel bar, has {{to undergo}} the same strain or deformation as the surrounding concrete {{in order to prevent}} discontinuity, slip or separation of the two materials under load. Maintaining composite action requires transfer of load between the concrete and steel. The direct stress is transferred from the concrete to the bar interface so as to change the tensile stress in the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> along its length, this load transfer is achieved by means of bond (anchorage) and is idealized as a continuous stress field that develops {{in the vicinity of the}} steel-concrete interface.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 a magnitude-6.6 {{earthquake}} in San Fernando caused some {{damage to the}} Caltech campus. Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating {{from the early days}} of the Institute—Throop Hall and the Goodhue-designed Culbertson Auditorium—had cracked. These were some of the first reinforced concrete buildings, and their plans did not contain enough details (such as how much <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> had been embedded in the concrete) to be sure they were safe, so the engineers recommended demolition. However, demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse. A large wrecking ball was used to demolish Throop Hall, and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar, far in excess of safety requirements. The rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be hauled away, and the process took much longer than expected.|$|E
25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or stainless steel rebar. Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar.</b> Reference ASTM standard specifications A1035/A1035M Standard Specification for Deformed and Plain Low-carbon, Chromium, Steel Bars for Concrete Reinforcement, A767 Standard Specification for Hot Dip Galvanised Reinforcing Bars, A775 Standard Specification for Epoxy Coated Steel Reinforcing Bars and A955 Standard Specification for Deformed and Plain Stainless Bars for Concrete Reinforcement.|$|E
40|$|Several {{strategies}} {{are available to}} the Iowa Department of Transportation (IaDOT) for limiting deterioration due to chloride-induced corrosion of embedded <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete bridge decks. While the method most commonly used throughout the Midwestern United States is to construct concrete bridge decks with fusion-bonded epoxy-coated <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars,</b> galvanized <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> are an available alternative. Previous studies of the in situ performance of galvanized <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> in service in bridge decks have been limited. IaDOT requested that Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.

40|$|Based on fractal {{theory and}} damage mechanics, {{the aim of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the monofractal and multifractal characteristics of corrosion morphology and develop a new approach to characterize the nonuniform corrosion degree of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars.</b> The relationship between fractal parameters and tensile strength of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> are discussed. The results showed that corrosion mass loss ratio of a bar cannot accurately reflect the damage degree of the bar. The corrosion morphology of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> exhibits both monofractal and multifractal features. The fractal dimension and the tensile strength of corroded steel bars exhibit a power function relationship, while the width of multifractal spectrum and tensile strength of corroded steel bars exhibit a linear relationship. By comparison, using width of multifractal spectrum as multifractal damage variable not only reflects the distribution of corrosion damage in <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars,</b> but also reveals the influence of nonuniform corrosion on the mechanical properties of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars.</b> The present research provides a new approach for the establishment of corrosion damage constitutive models of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|R

Both the specimens had an identical span-to-depth ratio of 3. 0.

40|$|Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> have {{attracted}} considerable attention for applications where corrosion of steel reinforcement is problematic. Due to the generally low elastic modulus and poor bond characteristics of FRP {{as compared to}} steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars,</b> the use of FRP results in larger crack widths under service loads. Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is proposed for use with FRP to reduce crack widths.

3000|$|The {{increment}} of {{the total}} strain (Δε [...])_i on the left-hand side of Eqs. (3) and (4) denotes the strain change of concrete rather than that of reinforced concrete. The incremental strain is therefore converted to an equivalent nodal load {{that can be used}} in the finite element analysis to obtain the strain change of the reinforced concrete members, which are internally and externally restrained by the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> and other connected members such as outriggers. The internal restraint due to the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> is represented by the area and second moment of the transformed section that is used for calculating the stiffness matrix of the beam element (Kim 2013). For the wall element, the internal restraint of vertical <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> was considered by adding truss elements, and the effect of horizontal <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> was neglected because the horizontal <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> have no significant effect on vertical displacement.

50|$|Kahn saw {{problems}} with the concrete reinforcement systems used in building construction {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century. The existing technique of construction of the time was using concrete with a plain straight steel in the center of a concrete beam. The steel in the concrete would slip if there was even the tiniest bit of room between the hardened concrete and the steel and it would break adhesion. The main <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> had plain steel beam members rigidly attached to it. This diagonal tension fractured the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bar</b> beams since the adhesion was broken. This caused weakness in the concrete/steel reinforced beam and a failure that could cause catastrophic results. The problem was that the plain steel beam separated from the concrete causing a failure since the two materials were no longer working together for strength.|$|E

This thesis summarizes work performed in a research project on the use of HSS <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> for concrete shear friction interfaces. Particularly, this research investigated the behavior of ASTM A 706 Grade 80 <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars.</b> This thesis includes two manuscripts. First, an overview of the testing program and main results are provided in manuscript 1, which describes twenty push-off test specimens that were subjected to interface shear forces along a concrete-concrete interface. The twenty specimens included five specimens of: (i) # 4 ASTM A 706 Grade 60 reinforcing bars; (ii) # 4 ASTM A 706 Grade 80 reinforcing bars; (iii) # 5 ASTM A 706 Grade 60 reinforcing bars; and (iv) # 5 ASTM A 706 Grade 80 <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars.</b> Results indicate that the shear interfaces with the # 4 <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> showed no significant difference in peak interface shear force resistance. In addition, the shear interfaces with the # 5 <b>reinforcing</b> <b>bars</b> showed significantly higher peak interface shear force resistance. These results are the focus of manuscript 2 that address in more detail the new findings, which ultimately can lead to modifications to current design equations available in US standards and codes.
