25|$|Speed of {{processing}} is another theory {{that has been}} raised to explain working memory deficits. As a result of various studies he has completed examining this topic, Salthouse argues that as we age our speed {{of processing}} information decreases significantly. It is this decrease in processing speed that is then <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> inability to use working memory efficiently as we age. The younger persons brain is able to obtain and process information at a quicker rate which allows for subsequent integration and manipulation needed to complete the cognitive task at hand. As this processing slows, cognitive tasks that rely on quick processing speed then become more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Supernova {{nucleosynthesis}} {{occurs in}} the energetic environment in supernovae, in which the elements between silicon and nickel are synthesized in quasiequilibrium established during fast fusion that attaches by reciprocating balanced nuclear reactions to 28Si. Quasiequilibrium {{can be thought of}} as almost equilibrium except for a high abundance of the 28Si nuclei in the feverishly burning mix. This concept was the most important discovery in nucleosynthesis theory of the intermediate-mass elements since Hoyle's 1954 paper because it provided an overarching understanding of the abundant and chemically important elements between silicon (A=28) and nickel (A=60). It replaced the incorrect although much cited alpha process of the B2FH paper, which inadvertently obscured Hoyle's better 1954 theory. Further nucleosynthesis processes can occur, in particular the r-process (rapid process) described by the B2FH paper and first calculated by Seeger, Fowler and Clayton, in which the most neutron-rich isotopes of elements heavier than nickel are produced by rapid absorption of free neutrons. The creation of free neutrons by electron capture during the rapid compression of the supernova core along with assembly of some neutron-rich seed nuclei makes the r-process a primary process, and one that can occur even in a star of pure H and He. This is in contrast to the B2FH designation of the process as a secondary process. This promising scenario, though generally supported by supernova experts, has yet to achieve a totally satisfactory calculation of r-process abundances. The primary r-process has been confirmed by astronomers who have observed old stars born when galactic metallicity was still small, that nonetheless contain their complement of r-process nuclei; thereby demonstrating that the metallicity is a product of an internal process. The r-process is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> natural cohort of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, as well as the most neutron-rich isotopes of each heavy element.|$|E

Explaining how this apparent contradiction is resolved, Maimonides said that just as God desired that fire rises upward and water descends downward, so too, God desired that people have free choice and be responsible for their deeds, without being pulled or forced. Rather, people, on their own initiative, with the knowledge that God granted them, do anything that people are able to do. Therefore, people are judged according to their deeds. If they do good, they are treated with beneficence. If they do bad, they are treated harshly. This is implied by the prophets.|$|E
2500|$|What I am {{concerned}} about is the trend, common among present-day Buddhist teachers, of recasting the core principles of the Buddha's teachings into largely psychological terms and then saying, [...] "This is Dhamma." [...] When this is done we may never get {{to see that the}} real purpose of the teaching, in its own framework, is not to induce [...] "healing" [...] or [...] "wholeness" [...] or [...] "self-acceptance," [...] but to propel the mind in the direction of deliverance – and to do so by attenuating, and finally extricating, all those mental factors <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> bondage and suffering. We should remember that the Buddha did not teach the Dhamma as an [...] "art of living" [...] – though it includes that – but above all as a path to deliverance, a path to final liberation and enlightenment. And what the Buddha means by enlightenment is not a celebration of the limitations of the human condition, not a passive submission to our frailties, but an overcoming of those limitations by making a radical, revolutionary breakthrough to an altogether different dimension of being.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{research}} showed capsaicin {{to evoke}} a long-onset current {{in comparison to}} other chemical agonists, suggesting the involvement of a significant rate-limiting factor. Subsequent to this, the TRPV1 ion channel {{has been shown to}} be a member of the superfamily of TRP ion channels, and as such is now referred to as [...] There are a number of different TRP ion channels that have been shown to be sensitive to different ranges of temperature and probably are <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> range of temperature sensation. Thus, capsaicin does not actually cause a chemical burn, or indeed any direct tissue damage at all, when chili peppers are the source of exposure. [...] The inflammation resulting from exposure to capsaicin is believed to be the result of the body's reaction to nerve excitement. For example, the mode of action of capsaicin in inducing bronchoconstriction is thought to involve stimulation of C fibers [...] culminating in the release of neuropeptides. In essence, the body inflames tissues as if it has undergone a burn or abrasion and the resulting inflammation can cause tissue damage in cases of extreme exposure, as is the case for many substances that cause the body to trigger an inflammatory response.|$|E
2500|$|The Greeks, however, {{looked upon}} the brain as {{the seat of}} the soul. Hippocrates drew a {{connection}} between the brain and behaviors of the body saying [...] "The brain exercises the greatest power in the man". Apart from moving the focus from the heart as the [...] "seat of the soul" [...] to the brain, Hippocrates did not go into much detail about its actual functioning. However, by switching the attention of the medical community to the brain, the doors were opened to a more scientific discovery of the organ <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> behaviors. For years to come, scientists were inspired to explore the functions of the body and to find concrete explanations for both normal and abnormal behaviors. Scientific discovery led them to believe that there were natural and organically occurring reasons to explain various functions of the body, and it could all {{be traced back to the}} brain. Over the years, science would continue to expand and the mysteries of the world would begin to make sense, or at least be looked at in a different way. Hippocrates introduced man to the concept of the mind – which was widely seen as a separate function apart from the actual brain organ.|$|E
2500|$|Neuroethics also {{encompasses}} the ethical {{issues raised by}} neuroscience as it affects {{our understanding of the}} world and of ourselves in the world. [...] For example, if everything we do is physically caused by our brains, which are in turn a product of our genes and our life experiences, how can we be held <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> actions? [...] A crime in the United States requires a [...] "guilty act" [...] and a [...] "guilty mind". As neuropsychiatry evaluations have become more commonly used {{in the criminal justice system}} and neuroimaging technologies have given us a more direct way of viewing brain injuries, scholars have cautioned that this could lead to the inability to hold anyone criminally responsible for their actions. In this way, neuroimaging evidence could suggest that there is no free will and each action a person makes is simply the product of past actions and biological impulses that are out of our control. [...] The question of whether and how personal autonomy is compatible with neuroscience ethics and the responsibility of neuroscientists to society and the state is a central one for neuroethics. However, there is some controversy over whether autonomy entails the concept of 'free will' or is a 'moral-political' principle separate from metaphysical quandaries.|$|E

[...] After the first expedition, Simonson told Kurt Heisler, then-senior tent designer for Eureka!, that the Eureka! tents had been “great” and that he and his team of explorers “could have used these tents much higher on the mountain.” [...] Heisler offered to design tents for Simonson’s next exhibition in 2001, the goal of which was to find Irvine’s body and to determine whether Mallory had been the first man to reach the Everest summit, nearly three decades prior to Sir Edmund Hillary’s historic expedition. Eureka! donated sixty tents to the expedition, from their largest style of military tents to their lightest and smallest backpacking tents, and designed several custom tents, working closely with the explorers to balance stability and strength.
