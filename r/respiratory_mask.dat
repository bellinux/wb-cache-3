40|$|AIM: This {{study was}} {{designed}} in a cross sectional pattern {{in order to determine}} workers&# 8217; behaviors about <b>respiratory</b> <b>mask</b> use and the factors involved. METHOD: The study was conducted with 100 workers in the welding department of a factory operating in automotive sector and employing approximately 1000 people. The data in the study was collected by means of &# 8216;Form for the Assessment of Descriptive Features of Employees&# 8217; and &# 8216;Respiratory Mask Use Behaviors Form&# 8221;, developed by the researchers; the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, developed by Wallston and De Wellis; Self-Actualization Scale and Health Responsibility Scale, developed by Walker, Sechrist and Pender. RESULTS: It was found out {{that a majority of the}} workers are aged between 26 and 33 (32 %), 76 % of them are married, 37 % are primary school graduates and 58 % of them have been working for more than 11 years. It was also determined that 60 % of the workers regularly wear <b>respiratory</b> <b>mask.</b> 14 % of those using masks irregularly stated that they &# 8220;used a <b>respiratory</b> <b>mask</b> for a short time&# 8221; and 26 % of them stated that they &# 8220;never wore a respiratory mask&# 8221;. The findings from the study showed that factors like the physical formation of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>mask,</b> the level of information about the mask, and the cognitive perceptual factors related to the employee&# 8217;s health influenced <b>respiratory</b> <b>mask</b> use. Two variables with significant odds ratios were identified thorough logistic regression analysis. Worker who reported that they had inability to breathe when wearing a mask were over 9 times (OR= 9, 48, % 95 CI= 1, 86 - 16, 52) and &# 8220;the time spent putting on and removing a mask&# 8221; were over 4 times (OR= 4, 85, % 95 CI= 0, 03 - 8, 81) more likely to have never wear a <b>respiratory</b> <b>mask</b> than those who used regularly wear mask.

However, in some cases, mask application can cause pressure ulcers to specific features of the face, resulting in pain and reduced {{quality of life for}} the individual. This study investigated the effects of mask strap tension on the biomechanical and biomarker responses at the skin interface. Healthy participants (n= 13) were recruited and assigned two different masks in a random order, which were fitted with three strap conditions representing increments of 5  mm to increase tension. Masks were worn for 10  minutes at each tension followed by a 10 -minute refractory period. Assessment at the device–skin interface included measurements of pressures at the nose and cheeks, temperature and humidity, a selection of inflammatory cytokine concentrations collected from sebum and scores of comfort. The results indicated significantly higher interface pressures at the bridge of the nose compared to the cheeks for both masks (p< 0. 05), with nasal interface pressures significantly increasing with elevated strap tension (p< 0. 05). One inflammatory cytokine, IL- 1 α, increased following mask application at the highest tension, with median increases from baselines ranging from 21 to 33 %. The other cytokines revealed a less consistent trend with strap tension. The participants reported statistically greater discomfort during elevated strap tension. Temperature and humidity values under the mask were elevated from ambient conditions, although no differences were observed between mask type or strap tension. The bony prominence on the bridge of the nose represented a vulnerable area of skin during <b>respiratory</b> <b>mask</b> application. This study has shown that mask strap tension has a significant effect on the pressure exerted on the nose. This can result in discomfort and an inflammatory response at the skin surface.

One proposed method of doing so is using a <b>respiratory</b> training <b>mask</b> to provide breathing resistance to increase the intensity of a warm-up. Though there is limited empirical evidence on the topic, many athletes have adopted this warm-up strategy, possibly due to testimonials from high-profile athletes in their respective sports. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of a high-intensity warm-up (HWU) using a <b>respiratory</b> training <b>mask</b> on sprint performance, heart rate measures (HR), and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) in Division I football athletes using a timing system. METHODS: Seventeen male (mean ± SD: age = 17. 94 ±. 75 years, weight = 104. 43 ± 23. 02 kg, height 184. 93 ± 7. 06 cm) American football athletes from a NCAA Division I level were recruited to participate in this study from a Midwestern university. Athletes were informed of risks, and upon completing an informed consent document, completed 2 testing sessions separated by 7 days. Each testing session took place on artificial turf in the university’s indoor training facility at the same time of day. Both testing sessions began with a warm-up (WU) under the instruction of a member of the university’s strength and condition staff. The WU consisted of dynamic exercises targeting the lower body musculature. During the initial visit, participants completed the dynamic WU and testing without a <b>respiratory</b> training <b>mask.</b> During the second visit, the HWU was completed with the <b>respiratory</b> training <b>mask</b> set to increase the resistance level of breathing by 12 -fold.

40|$|The {{emission}} of unipolar air ions {{in the vicinity}} of a filtering facepiece respirator has been recently shown to considerably enhance its respiratory protection efficiency. The effect is driven by the electric repelling forces that develop between the unipolarly charged mask and the aerosol particles, thus creating a shield for the incoming particles and consequently decreasing the penetration efficiency through the filter. The manikin-based preliminary evaluation of this concept has been performed with a very limited number of variables. In this study, four types of half-mask facepiece filtering devices (N 95, R 95, and dust-mist respirators, as well as surgical masks), operating at two different breathing flow rates, were tested with unipolar air ion emitters exhibiting different emission rates and polarities. The particle penetration efficiency through the facepiece filter was determined in a room-size indoor test chamber by a real-time particle size selective aerosol monitoring performed inside and outside of the mask, which was face-sealed onto a manikin.

The laminators were followed during an usual workweek from Monday to Thursday. The external styrene exposure was measured by means of passive active carbon badges. The excretion of mandelic acid (MA) and phenyl glyoxylic acid (PGA) in endof-shift urine samples was used to quantify the internal styrene load.

PURPOSE: The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate the effectiveness of beet juice on lowering VO 2 during steady-state exercise in trained versus untrained individuals. METHODS: Seventeen subjects; 8 trained and 9 untrained, age 21 ± 2 yr, performed two submaximal graded exercise tests on a cycle ergometer. Work rate was increased every two to three minutes until a target heart rate (65 % heart rate reserve (HRR)) was achieved. Once at this rate, subjects continued to bike for 10 min. The same procedure for the first performance trial was repeated for the second performance trial. Prior to each trial, subjects were instructed to drink 70 mL/d of either concentrated beet juice or a cranberry juice placebo in counterbalanced order for 6 d. VO 2 was measured using a <b>respiratory</b> <b>mask</b> and Parvo metabolic cart. Resting heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) data were collected at baseline. Heart rate was also measured throughout each trial in the last 10 s of each work rate. Repeated measures analysis of variance was run to detect any differences in VO 2 between groups, between the change in VO 2 for the experimental conditions, and between beet juice and placebo trials. RESULTS: A significant difference in VO 2 was detected between trained (30. 1 ± 4. 5 mL·kg- 1 ·min- 1) and untrained (23. 5 ± 4. 2 mL·kg- 1 ·min- 1) individuals (p = 0. 000) confirming the presence of two distinct levels of training. No significant difference was found in the change in VO 2 between the beet juice and placebo conditions on trained (- 0. 1 ± 3. 8 mL·kg- 1 ·min- 1) or untrained (0. 0 ± 2. 5 mL·kg- 1 ·min- 1) groups (p = 0. 862).

Methods: This study assessed the thermotolerant airborne fungi based on NIOSH 0800 on 200 ambient samples from four composting processes and outdoor spaces in a composting plant. Results: The concentration of fungi during shredding, separatingand screening washigher than 1000 CFU/m 3. The level of fungi in all stages was higher than outdoor(p< 0. 001). The highest concentration was detected in shredding (6749 ± 1347 CFU/m 3) (p= 0. 007), and the lowest concentration was related to screening (113 ± 32 CFU/m 3) (p= 0. 013). The predominant species was varied during the stages. Yeast andA. niger were predominant species in shredding and separating. Conclusion:The results of this study showed that the concentration of airborne fungi was decreased during composting process. The effect of these aerosols on indoor air was more than that in the outdoor space and workers at this sitewere exposed to high levels of thermotolerantfungi. Therefore,air-condition, ventilation system and safety operations such as <b>respiratory</b> <b>masks</b> are essential. The results of this studycan be used inrisk assessment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : Airborne {{transmission}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) remains an occupational health hazard particularly in crowded and resource limited healthcare settings. AIM : The study aimed to quantify airborne TB in a busy outpatient clinic in Gauteng, South Africa. METHODS : Personal (HCWs) and stationary air {{samples were collected}} in the Polyclinic and Administrative block. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect airborne TB. Walkthrough observations and work practices of HCWs were also recorded. FINDINGS : TB was detected in 11 / 49 (22. 4 %) of the 9 / 25 (36 %) personal and 2 / 24 (8. 3 %) stationary samples. Samples from 5 of 10 doctors (50 %) and 3 of 13 nurses (23 %) were positive. Repeat measurements on different days showed variable results. Most of the HCWs (87. 5 %) with positive results had {{been in contact with}} coughing patients and had not worr <b>respiratory</b> <b>masks</b> despite been training. CONCLUSION : The use of air sampling coupled with real-time qPCR is a simple and effective tool to demonstrate the risk of TB exposure. The findings provide an impetus for hospital management to strengthen TB infection prevention and control measures. Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).

40|$|An {{analytical}} method for determination of isoprene in expired breath {{as a marker}} of body cholesterol synthesis was developed with a special accent to breath sampling. Patients were breathing controlled air using <b>respiratory</b> <b>masks</b> for 2 min (washout period) and then their expired breath was collected into 8 l Tedlar bags. The bags were heated to 40 C and the SPME fibre Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxan 75 m was inserted through the septum. Extraction time was 10 min. Analytes were desorbed in the GC injector for 2 min at 270 C. Analyses were performed on a Q-PLOT column and fragment ions 68, 67 and 53 were quantified. The concentration range was 1 - 40 nmol/l, limit of detection was 0, 25 nmol/l, the calibration curve was linear. Precision, expressed as RSD, was 5, 5 - 12, 5 %. Isoprene monitoring {{was carried out in}} healthy volunteers and various groups of patients. It can be summarized that by the method developed reliable results of isoprene content in human breath are obtained. The advantage of the method is the non-invasive sampling, which enables frequent sampling and determination of accurate daily profiles characteristic for each individual patientAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
40|$|Caretakers {{and pigs}} in dusty environments with {{particles}} and toxic gases may sustain health consequences. We studied concentrations of ammonia, endotoxin, and total and respirable dust particles in four mechanically ventilated swine nurseries and two grower facilities using an ammonia sampler, filter, and British cyclone. In {{two of the}} nursery facilities, we determined the protection offered by <b>respiratory</b> <b>masks</b> that were mounted on glass funnels with filters or British cyclones and sampled for dust. In response to the increasing summer ventilation, large, nonrespirable particle concentrations in swine building atmospheres were reduced more completely by ventilation air movement than smaller respirable particles or ammonia. Total airborne endotoxin concentrations {{were similar to those}} eliciting pulmonary reactions. Total airborne endotoxin correlated with total suspended particles rather than respirable particles. Smaller respirable fecal particles enriched in endotoxin apparently stick to larger nonrespirable particles or are agglomerated before they became airborne. Internal recirculated air partially limited the mass concentration of respirable particles in the breathing zone of swine caretakers at lower but not higher ventilation rates. Respiratory protection limited the potential total dust exposures of swine caretakers in such atmospheres (< 25 %, 2 -tie masks; < 50 %, I-tie masks of the total suspended particles). Respirable particles were reduced to < 55 % by 2 -tie masks. Properly worn 2 -tie masks protect against both large and small respirable particles in swine confinement facilities...|$|R
40|$|A rapid {{epidemiological}} assessment (REA) {{of industrial}} dental erosion was undertaken {{with the aim}} of formulating a range of treatment strategies which could be used to settle an industrial dispute. This dispute concerned compensation for a group of adult male metalworkers who had complained of dental sensitivity and that their teeth had been "eaten by acid" at their workplace, an electroplating factory in Springs near Johannesburg, South Africa. The REA methods employed included a clinical examination, a structured socio-demographic questionnaire and colour photographs of each subject. Sixty per cent of the subjects reported pain and/or sensitivity to eating and/or drinking, 76 per cent showed varying degrees of loss of tooth structure, and 25 per cent reported teeth had been lost {{as a result of the}} industrial erosion. The project involved negotiating with mine management and trade union representatives, each with conflicting interests, and with people's oral health and large sums of money at stake. In this context, the aim of the research was to design an instrument to resolve conflict and to promote oral health at an industrial site, while retaining scientific objectivity and rigour. As a result of the REA, the workers who were examined are in the process of being compensated, while the National Union of Mineworkers and mine management are engaged in reaching a settlement. Preventive measures have been initiated at the factory. The area has been declared a "respiratory zone", which makes the wearing of <b>respiratory</b> <b>masks</b> obligatory. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this survey}} {{was to assess the}} {{seroprevalence}} of antibodies against Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii) in subjects at risk of exposure in Sicily, Southern Italy. Material and Methods: Prevalence of IgG antibodies to C. burnetii phase II antigens was evaluated by ELISA in a group of 140 workers at risk of exposure (38 veterinarians, 38 slaughterhouse workers, 44 livestock handlers, 20 laboratory and technical personnel) included in a medical surveillance program and in 42 control subjects. Positive samples were classified as suggestive of prior exposure to C. burnetii. Results: Antibodies against C. burnetii were detected in 88 out of 140 (62. 9 %) exposed workers and in 6 out of 42 (14. 3 %) subjects of the control group. The variables evaluated did not seem to {{have a significant effect on}} seropositivity to Coxiella with the exception of symptoms in the last 6 months preceding the survey. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated a high seroprevalence of C. burnetii in the group of exposed workers in comparison to non-exposed subjects of the control group. Clinical illness appears to be rare; nevertheless, physicians should consider Q fever in patients with compatible symptoms and occupational exposure to animals and their products. As aerosols represent the main route of infection in animals and humans, these workers are strongly advised to wear <b>respiratory</b> <b>masks.</b> In addition, occupational physicians should consider routine serologic evaluation and vaccination of occupationally exposed workers...|$|R
40|$|Four male {{volunteers were}} exposed at rest for two periods of two hours, {{separated}} by a one hour exposure free interval, to 50 ppm 2 -butoxyethanol (BE) vapour generated in an exposure chamber. During the first two hour period the men were exposed by mouth only via a respiratory valve connected by tubes to the exposure chamber. During the second exposure period the men were exposed by skin only while sitting inside the exposure chamber, naked except for shorts, and wearing a <b>respiratory</b> protection <b>mask</b> supplied with compressed air. Capillary blood samples were collected at regular intervals and analysed for BE by a gas chromatographic method. Two experiments {{separated by a}}t least two weeks were carried out with each volunteer, one at "normal" (23 degrees C, 29 % relative humidity) and one at raised (33 degrees C, 71 % relative humidity) air temperature and humidity in the chamber. The average concentration in blood and the calculated rate of uptake of BE were about three to four times higher during dermal exposure than during inhalation exposure. These experiments suggest that dermal uptake of BE accounts for about 75 % (45 - 85 % in individual experiments) of the total uptake during whole body exposure to BE vapour. Thus it appears that the use of a <b>respiratory</b> protection <b>mask</b> will not protect efficiently against exposure to BE vapours. A tendency towards increased percutaneous absorption rate was seen in the raised temperature and humidity condition...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{there has}} been an {{abundant}} literature in recent years about farmer's lung disease, few addressed occupational measures able to maintain the farmer in his work. Nevertheless we know now that most of the farmers can be kept at the workplace by the way of occupational preventive measures. Methods: This matter is discussed from a case report. A farmer affected by the farmer's lung disease was sent to us by his pneumologist, in order to estimate the possibility of maintaining him in his job and to determine relevant changes at his workplace to minimize risk of exposure to dust antigen. This approach required a visit to the workplace by occupational physician and hygienist. Results: The visit of the workplace pointed out different habits and architectural particularities which were potential sources of exposure. The two main proposed measures to reduce the risk, were to wear <b>respiratory</b> <b>masks</b> while working inside the barn, such as preparing hay, feeding the cattle or sweeping the floor, and to build a direct access from the bathroom (shower and toilet) to the outside, allowing to go out of the barn after taking a shower and changing, without risk of being contaminated again. Although upgrading the shower-toilet is not yet completed to date, the already performed modifications led currently to significant clinical improvements, despite the risk of exposure was high since the animals were in the barn for more than two months. Conclusion: The treatment of the farmer's lung disease must be multidisciplinary involving general practitioner, pneumologist, occupational hygienist and occupational physician...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Protective <b>respiratory</b> face <b>masks</b> {{protect the}} nose and mouth of the wearer from vapor drops {{carrying}} viruses or other infectious pathogens. However, incorrect use and disposal may actually {{increase the risk of}} pathogen transmission, rather than reduce it, especially when masks are used by non-professionals such as the lay public. Copper oxide displays potent antiviral properties. A platform technology has been developed that permanently introduces copper oxide into polymeric materials, conferring them with potent biocidal properties. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate that impregnation of copper oxide into <b>respiratory</b> protective face <b>masks</b> endows them with potent biocidal properties in addition to their inherent filtration properties. Both control and copper oxide impregnated masks filtered above 99. 85 % of aerosolized viruses when challenged with 5. 66 +/- 0. 51 and 6. 17 +/- 0. 37 log(10) TCID(50) of human influenza A virus (H 1 N 1) and avian influenza virus (H 9 N 2), respectively, under simulated breathing conditions (28. 3 L/min). Importantly, no infectious human influenza A viral titers were recovered from the copper oxide containing masks within 30 minutes (< or = 0. 88 log(10) TCID(50)), while 4. 67 +/- 1. 35 log(10) TCID(50) were recovered from the control masks. Similarly, the infectious avian influenza titers recovered from the copper oxide containing masks were < or = 0. 97 +/- 0. 01 log(10) TCID(50) and from the control masks 5. 03 +/- 0. 54 log(10) TCID(50). The copper oxide containing masks successfully passed Bacterial Filtration Efficacy, Differential Pressure, Latex Particle Challenge, and Resistance to Penetration by Synthetic Blood tests designed to test the filtration properties of face masks in accordance with the European EN 14683 : 2005 and NIOSH N 95 standards. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Impregnation of copper oxide into <b>respiratory</b> protective face <b>masks</b> endows them with potent anti-influenza biocidal properties without altering their physical barrier properties. The use of biocidal masks may significantly reduce the risk of hand or environmental contamination, and thereby subsequent infection, due to improper handling and disposal of the masks...|$|R
