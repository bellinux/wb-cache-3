Walter Taylor proved {{recently}} {{that there is}} no algorithm for deciding of a finite set of equations whether it is topologically compatible with the real line {{in the sense that it}} has a model with universe R and with basic operations which are all continuous with respect to the usual topology of the real line.

If R is a separable extension over S, then the multiplication mapping is split as an R-R-bimodule epi, so there is a right inverse s of m satisfying for s(1) := e, re = er for all r in R, and m(e) = 1. Conversely, if such an element (called a separability element in the tensor-square) exists, one shows by a judicious use of this element (like Maschke, applying its components within and without the splitting maps) that R is a separable extension of S.|$|E
