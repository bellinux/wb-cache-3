Several <b>regulary</b> functions of the grp could be proved in E. coli. Gpr acts in a leucine-independent manner as an activator of the ilvIH operon, and it enhances the expression of a glutamate uptake system. At the same time it was demonstrated that grp reprimizes the expression of the glutamate/aspartate uptake system GluEMP isolated from Z. Moblis. Expression of grp in Z. mobilis and E. coli was studied by means of lacZ-mobilis and E. colie was studied by means of lacZ-gene fusion.

40|$|Abstract The {{bachelor}} thesis Evaluation {{of dietary}} habits of nurses of standard wards by NutriDan program is dividend into {{theoretical and practical}} parts. The theoretical part focuses on personality of a nurse, her education and conditions for performance of her work. Eating habits are assessed among nurses at standard wards. Furthermore, it is focused on nutrition which is important not only for nurses but for all of us. There are all the meal components such as sugars, fats and proteins delat with. They are followed by vitamins, minerals and trace elements and of course drinking regime, which is also important. The first aim of this thesis was to investigace how nurses of standard wards eat. The socond objective {{was to determine whether}} there is any diference in the diet, hen nurses are at home or while at work. The following hypotheses were stated to meet these aims: H 1 Nurses at standard wards eat irregulary at work. H 2 More than a half of the nurses of standard wards adhere to heatlthy diet principles in their free time. H 3 Nurses know how to eat properly. There was a method of quantitative research ? an anonymus questionnaire used in the research. The questionnaire contained 18 questions, 10 questions were closed, 4 were half-open and the remaining were supplementary. The questinnaire also included two record sheets, where nurses recorded thein 24 -hour diet including the liquids they drank. One answer sheet was for the days hen the nurses were at work and the second one when they were off and were at home. It was possible to use 102 questionnaires and records for the research. The records were then evaluated in the NutriDan programe. The research results show that the energy supply of a nurse at work is lower than its expenditure. They also show that Nurses generally know how to eat properly and thein BMI values are mostly balanced. Most nurses know that their diets vary during their free time and hen they are at work but they try to eat <b>regulary</b> and according to the principles of good nutrition at home. Therefore, there are noticeable differences in their diet and results of NutriDan on the diet inegredients show the same except for proteins and fiber. These nutritional components are neglected at home and at work too. They regularly have breakfast and more than a half of them eat <b>regulary.</b> The <b>regulary</b> eat fruits and dairy products. The diet of nurses is less balanced and less nutritious when they are at work. Nurses are eating irregulary and inadequately at work. Meal at working time is mostly represented by dairy products, fruits, vegetables and food rich in cholesterol and lipids. In practice, the results of the research could be provided to nurses at wards, so as they learn about the mistakes they make in their diets, about their eating habits in general so as they could change or modify their diets. The results could also be publishied in professional journals or articles dealing with this problem...|$|E
