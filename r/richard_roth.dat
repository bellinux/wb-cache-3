25|$|With the {{imposition}} of martial law, the Chinese government cut off the satellite transmissions of foreign broadcasters such as CNN and CBS. Broadcasters attempted to defy these orders by reporting via telephone. Footage was quickly smuggled out of the country. The only network which was able to record shots during the night of June 4 was Televisión Española of Spain (TVE). During the military action, some foreign journalists faced harassment from authorities. CBS correspondent <b>Richard</b> <b>Roth</b> and his cameraman were taken into custody while filing {{a report from the}} Square via mobile phone.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer <b>Richard</b> <b>Roth</b> over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E
2500|$|The trial {{started on}} 30 March 1978 in the {{district}} court and drew intense interest. Before the court, doctors testified that Michel was not possessed, stating {{that this was a}} psychological effect because of her strict religious upbringing and her epilepsy, but the doctor <b>Richard</b> <b>Roth,</b> who was asked for medical help by Alt, allegedly told her during the exorcism, that [...] "there is no injection against the devil, Anneliese". Schmidt-Leichner said that the exorcism was legal and that the German constitution protected citizens in the unrestricted exercise of their religious beliefs. The defense played tapes recorded at the exorcism sessions, sometimes featuring what was claimed to be [...] "demons arguing", to assert their claim that Michel was possessed. Both priests said the demons identified themselves as Lucifer, Cain, Judas Iscariot, Hitler, and Nero among others; they further said that she was finally freed because of the exorcism just before her death.|$|E

2500|$|Chinese {{government}} officials have long asserted that no one died in the Square itself {{in the early morning}} hours of June 4, during the 'hold-out' of the last batch of students in the south of the Square. Initially foreign media reports of a [...] "massacre" [...] on the Square were prevalent, though subsequently journalists have acknowledged that most of the deaths occurred outside of the Square in western Beijing. Several people who were situated around the square that night, including Jay Mathews, former Beijing bureau chief of the Washington Post, and <b>Richard</b> <b>Roth,</b> CBS correspondent, reported that while they had heard sporadic gunfire, they could not find enough evidence to suggest that a massacre took place on the Square itself. Records by the Tiananmen Mothers suggest that three students died in the Square the night of the Army's push into the Square. Democracy activist Wu Renhua asserted that the government's discussion of the issue was a red herring intended to absolve itself of responsibility and showcase its benevolence. Wu said that it was irrelevant whether the shooting occurred inside or outside of the Square itself, as it was still a reprehensible massacre of unarmed civilians.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Roth's sons, Julian and Richard, had joined the firm many years earlier, {{it was not until}} 1947 that the firm's name was changed to Emery Roth & Sons, {{approximately}} one year before Roth's death. Julian (1901-1992) specialized in construction costs and building materials and technology, while Richard (1904-1987) was named the firm's principal architect. In the 1950s and 1960s Emery Roth & Sons became the most influential architectural firm in New York and contributed substantially in changing the appearance of Midtown and Lower Manhattan. In that particular period of time Emery Roth & Sons designed dozens of speculative office buildings, mostly with curtain wall facades, which soon became a ubiquitous feature of the city. Beginning in the mid-1960s, the firm was also hired as associate architects in large-scale projects like the Pan Am Building (1963), the World Trade Center (1966-1973) and the Citicorp Center (1977). In the early 1960s, Richard Roth's son, <b>Richard</b> <b>Roth,</b> Jr. (b. 1933) became the third generation to join the firm, eventually rising to chief architect CEO and shareholder. As the firm expanded and diversified over six decades, it remained a family business through the 1990s. In 1988 <b>Richard</b> <b>Roth</b> Jr's daughter Robyn Roth-Moise joined the firm as comptroller. <b>Richard</b> <b>Roth</b> Jr's son Richard Lee Roth joined the firm in 1982 and became the chief specification writer for Emery Roth & Sons. Both retired from the firm when <b>Richard</b> <b>Roth</b> Jr retired and was replaced as the company's CEO in 1993 by Robert Sobel, Roth's cousin. But only three years later, in 1996, the firm ceased to operate, apparently because of financial distress. Emery's great-grandson Richard Lee Roth currently works in the architectural profession and resides in South Florida.|$|E
