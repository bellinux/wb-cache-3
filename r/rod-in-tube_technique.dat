They find numerous applications in diverse fields such as medical, material processing, defence, oil and gas, aerospace, metrology, astrophysics, and space communications etc thanks to their outstanding features such as good beam quality, thermal management, and flexibility. However, non-linear effects have always been an obstacle for power scaling of fiber lasers. Several fiber designs such as Photonic Crystal Fibers (PCFs), 2 D-All solid Photonic Bandgap Fiber (2 D-ASPBGFs) etc, have been demonstrated to overcome these limitations by offering effective single mode operation and large effective area of the fundamental mode. However, such fibers are relatively expensive to manufacture as they require stack-and-draw technique to fabricate them.

Indeed soft glasses such as phosphate and tellurite can incorporate large amounts of rare earth ions while keeping a high absorption and emission cross sections, without clustering effects. This research work aimed at developing rare earth doped phosphate glass optical fibers doped with Yb 3 + and Er 3 + ions suitable for short pulsed fiber lasers. The phosphate glasses were prepared by melt quenching technique in a controlled atmosphere furnace at temperature above 1300 °C and then cast on brass molds. The glasses were thermally characterized by differential scanning calorimetry in order to measure the characteristic temperatures. Optical characterization was carried out to measure the refractive index of the prepared glasses. The characteristic temperatures (glass transition temperature and crystallization temperature) and the refractive index of the fabricated glasses are reported in Table I. The core glass was doped with Er 3 + and Yb 3 + ions (2. 5 x 1026 ions/m 3) of and the calculated numerical aperture (NA) between core and 1 st cladding was 0. 11, while between 1 st and 2 nd cladding was equal to 0. 36.

In fact, they can be doped with large amounts of rare earth (RE) ions (up to 1021 ions/cm 3) without clustering, therefore enabling the realization of compact active devices with high gain per unit length. Moreover, phosphate glasses possess a large glass forming range, good thermo-mechanical and chemical properties, low nonlinear refractive index and no evidence of photodarkening even at high population inversion. The aim {{of this research was}} the realization of different configurations of Nd 3 +-doped phosphate glass waveguides, in particular a double cladding (DC) optical fibre and circular and D-shaped cladding rods, to be used in lasers and optical amplifiers, in a CW or pulsed regime. Three different phosphate glass compositions (for the core, inner cladding and outer cladding) were designed in order to obtain an adequate numerical aperture between different elements while maintaining similar thermo-mechanical properties in view of the drawing process. The glasses were prepared by conventional melt-quenching technique in a controlled atmosphere furnace at 1400 °C and then cast on pre-heated brass molds. Physical, thermal and spectroscopic properties of the manufactured glasses were measured. The waveguides realized for this research were manufactured by preform drawing with the preforms being obtained by <b>rod-in-tube</b> <b>technique.</b> The fabrication of each preform required one rod of core glass fabricated by melt quenching and one or two tubes shaped by rotational casting, using an in-house built equipment.

40|$|Gallium {{lanthanum}} sulphide (GLS) {{glass was}} investigated {{as a potential}} host material for rare-earth (RE) doped mid-infrared fibre lasers. Glasses were fabricated from gallium sulphide and lanthanum sulphide powders by melt quenching and drawn into fibres using the <b>rod-in-tube</b> <b>technique.</b> Typical values for the attenuation in the loss minimum around 4 µm are a few dB/m. The quality of the fibre is currently limited by impurities such as transitions metals, silicon, and aluminium, imperfections at the core/clad interface, and the tendency to crystallisation. Absorption, fluorescence, and lifetime measurements were performed for eleven RE ions for wavelengths ranging from the visible to the mid-infrared {{with a focus on}} mid-infrared transitions. The results of the measurements were used to study the multiphonon decay in GLS glass and to obtain important laser parameters such as the absorption and emission cross sections, branching ratios, and quantum efficiencies from the Judd-Ofelt theory, the Füchtbauer-Ladenburg equation, and the McCumber theory. Twenty-one transitions with peak emission wavelengths longer than 2 µm were identified, seven of which have not been reported in a glass before. Some transitions overlap with the fundamental absorption bands of environmentally important gases such as the 3. 4 µm (methane and other hydrocarbons) and 4. 7 µm (carbon monoxide) praseodymium transitions and the 4. 3 µm (carbon dioxide) dysprosium transitions, whereas the 3. 8 µm thulium and the 3. 9 µm holmium transitions coincide with an atmospheric transmission window. Co-doping schemes such as thulium/terbium, praseodymium/ytterbium, praseodymium/erbium, and dysprosium/erbium which offer more favourable absorption bands for diode laser pumping were investigated with respect to ion-ion energy transfer. Excited-state absorption (ESA) measurements in erbium and thulium doped GLS glasses revealed transitions from excited RE energy levels to levels at energies relative to the ground state which are larger than the energy bandgap of the glass (~ 2. 6 eV). Transitions from the RE ions to the conduction band of the glass, as they have been reported in RE doped crystals, could not be found. The results support the model of isolated ions with shielded 4 f levels and rule out ESA from RE ions to the conduction band of the glass as a potential loss mechanism for RE lasers in GLS glass. Lasing was demonstrated in neodymium doped GLS glass and glass fibre at 1. 08 µm, representing the first reported laser action in a RE doped chalcogenide bulk glass and glass fibre, respectively.

The optical fiber core was doped with high Er 3 + ions concentrations or co-doped with Er 3 + and Yb 3 + iones; and third the development of lasers and broadband optical fiber amplifiers around 1550 nm A computational algorithm based on the ray traced method over tridimensional objects which are decomposed in small triangular planes was used in order to realize {{the qualitative}} and quantitative study of the PAE. With this algorithm (developed in this work, for the first time). The PAE was evaluated in “D” shape DCFs and the results were compared with the circular shape DCFs. The simulation results indicate {{that in the case of}} the “D” shape DCFs, the PAE increases when the position of the core inside the inner clad is off the geometrical center of the fiber cross section. On the other hand, when the incidence of the pump beam is off the geometrical center of the fiber cross-section or when the angle of incidence δ> 0. 10 rad, the PAE decreases in a Circular-shape DCFs while in D-Shape DCFs the PAE is higher and it is kept constant The CTFs presented and studied in this work were fabricated by the <b>rod-in-tube</b> <b>technique.</b> On the other hand, the MTFs were fabricated by the stack-and-draw technique. The studies of luminescence and up-conversion process in the CTFs, reveal that the Er 3 +/Yb 3 + codoped CTFs produce a more intense and efficient emission both in the VIs and NIR than the Er 3 + doped CTFs. However, when the telurito glasses (which correspond to the core) are doped with high Er 3 + and/or Yb 3 + concentration, the refractive index of the fiber core decreases and for that reason, the light confinement in the fiber core is inefficient. From the ASE spectrum of the Er 3 +/Yb 3 + codoped tellurite fibers with regard to pumping power and fiber lengths it was observed both an increase in the maximum power of the ASE and in the bandwidth as the fiber length increased. The results show that the maximum power of the ASE was achieved for short fiber lengths from 3 cm to 6 cm.

40|$|As {{the optical}} power levels {{extractable}} from current single-mode (SM) fiber amplifiers are reaching regions where optical nonlinearities become significant, even under cw operation, {{it is becoming}} increasingly important to develop methods for reducing these nonlinearities to further boost the amplifier performance. Here we demonstrate a simple new approach, namely the SM excitation of specially designed large-core multimode (MM) fibers. Cladding-pumped Er/Yb amplifier versions of such fibers allow the direct amplification of diffraction-limited optical soliton pulses with peak powers up to 12 kW, about one order of magnitude larger than possible with conventional fiber amplifiers. Under SM excitation of a MM mode fiber, the amount of power propagating in the fundamental mode as a function of fiber length decreases due to micro-bending-induced mode-coupling. The resulting M 2 -value as a function of fiber length, as calculated from mode-coupling experiments, in various 50 µm-core diameter fibers is shown in Fig. 1. The excitation wave-length was 1. 55 µm. In this fiber # 1 was made by the <b>rod-in-tube</b> <b>technique,</b> whereas fibers # 2 and # 3 where made using modified chemical-vapor deposition. The low-micro-bending fiber # 3 indeed allows to obtain an M 2 -value < 1. 2 for fiber lengths up to 10 m, allowing for essentially diffraction-limited amplification in cladding-pumped Er/Yb amplifiers, which typically vary in length between 1 - 10 m. The fundamental mode is launched in these MM fibers with high accuracy by suppressing modal speckle by using broad-bandwidth excitation sources such as ultrashort pulses. As the temporal coherence length of broad-bandwidth sources is very short, temporal interference between the modes and thus the presence of speckle is prevented. The stability of the spatial beam profile was verified by coupling the output of a MM fiber into a SM dummy fiber and measuring the launched signal power as a function of time. The result for both single-frequency (SF) excitation and broad-band excitation of the MM fiber is shown in Fig. 2. The large random power fluctuations due to modal speckle for the case of SF excitation are clearly visible, whereas the power fluctuations for broad-band excitation are about a factor of 5 smaller. Figure 3 shows the autocorrelation and the spectrum of 340 fs pulses directly amplified to a peak power of 12 kW in a 1. 5 m length of 30 -µm-core diameter cladding-pumped Er/Yb amplifier fiber. The pulses had an energy of 4 nJ and were near-transform-limited with a time-bandwidth-product of 0. 29. The autocorrelation is displayed on a logarithmic scale to demonstrate the absence of a pedestal. Secondary autocorrelation peaks due to small residual excitation of higher-order modes are suppressed to better than 0. 5 %. Pulses amplified to similar peak powers in such Er/Yb fibers have recently also been frequency-doubled to generate 300 femtosecond pulses with peak powers of 25 kW and a record average power of 300 mW at 780 nm. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new technique for greatly expanding the operation limits of fiber lasers. The very large-core, low micro-bending fiber amplifiers discussed here should allow {{the construction of a new}} generation of ultrahigh-power fiber laser systems...|$|E
40|$|Step-index {{optical fibers}} {{are widely used}} waveguides for light transmission. However, {{non-linear}} effects are always a severe challenge for optical fibers with increasing power level. This challenge is more severe at shorter wavelengths, where core size has to be much smaller {{in order to maintain}} a single mode operation. For an example, for 0. 005 core refractive index with respect to cladding, a 10 µm core diameter can ensure single mode operation at 1550 nm. On other hand, core diameter has to be ~ 4 µm and ~ 2 µm at lambda= 632 nm and 300 nm respectively for single mode operation. At these shorter wavelengths, photonic crystal fiber (PCF) and hollow core photonic bandgap fiber (HC-PBGF) have been proposed to address non-linear effects by offering large core diameter and air-core respectively [1 - 2]. However, such fibers are relatively difficult to fabricate. Moreover, presence of air-holes causes considerable difficulties in cleaving and splicing. Recently, we proposed an all-solid fiber design known as multi-trench fiber (MTF) as shown in Fig. 1 (a) [3]. In this paper, we demonstrated their mode area scaling capability for UV-VIS wavelengths. Numerical simulations show the potential of achieving an effective single mode for 10 µm and 20 µm core diameter MTF by ensuring high loss to the higher order modes (HOMs) at ~ 300 nm and ~ 632 nm respectively. Fig. 1 (b) shows numerically computed bending loss of a 20 µm core MTF with trench thickness (t) = 1. 34 µm, refractive index difference between core and cladding (Delta. n) = 0. 005, and resonant ring thickness (d) = 6 µm at 632 nm. It {{is important to note that}} MTF ensures similar level of loss (as shown in Fig. 1 (b)) to the HOMs even in an unbent case thanks to the resonant coupling between modes of core and resonant ring, which ensures suitability for beam delivery applications. Fig. 1 (c) shows the RIP and microscope image of a 20 µm core MTF fabricated by MCVD process in conjunction with <b>rod-in-tube</b> <b>technique.</b> Fig. 1 (d) shows the measured bending loss of fiber. The loss remains lower than 0. 2 dB/m and 0. 5 dB/m at ~ 30 cm and ~ 15 cm bend radius respectively at ~ 632 nm. This loss can even be reduced down with further refinement in fabrication process. We investigated the output profile of a 2 m long MTF using the experimental set-up shown in Fig. 1 (e) with respect to the multi-mode input beam as shown in Fig. 1 (g). Fig. 1 (f) shows the output for different offset launching, while fiber is coiled at ~ 20 cm bend radius. On the other hand, Fig. 1 (h) shows the output at different coil radii for optimum launching. In this paper, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, an effective-single-mode behaviour of an all-solid and cylindrical symmetrical fiber of a large core (~ 20 µm) fiber at ~ 632 nm has been demonstrated. All-solid design and cylindrical symmetry ensure suitability for mass-scale production and easy cleaving and splicing. Further, with these advantages, a large core (~ 10 µm) MTF at ~ 300 nm as confirmed by our simulations can also be achieved and details will be presented at conference...|$|E
40|$|High power fiber lasers {{have several}} {{applications}} {{thanks to their}} outstanding features such as good beam quality, all fiberized compact device size, robustness, wavelength tuning, high wall-plug efficiency, and low cost. Due to these features high power fiber lasers are replacing other solid-state lasers for several applications. Fiber lasers are being used commercially for several applications such as surgery, material processing (cutting, drilling, polishing etc.), oil and gas sensing, pumping several other lasers, and space communication etc. However, nonlinear effects restrict the output power level of fiber lasers. Although reducing power density by using large core diameter fibers can increase the threshold of non-linear effects, however large core diameter leads to multimode behavior and is prone to bend-induced effective area reduction. Several novel large mode area fibers have been proposed to scale the output power level. However, the advantages of all-fiberized device and low cost disappear as most of these fibers involve complex fabrication and cannot be spliced to optical components such as conventional pump fibers. This thesis deals with novel large mode area fibers which are suitable for mass scale production and can offer low cost production compared to other competitive fiber designs thanks to their simple design. These novel fibers are all-solid and can be easily spliced to other fibers, thus can lead to an all-fiberized device. Moreover, some of the novel fibers proposed in this thesis offer the delocalization of powers of the higher order modes outside the core. This delocalization of the higher order modes can be useful to ensure an effective single mode operation in a double clad configuration. The proposed novel fibers offer better or competitive mode area scaling performance compared to other competitive fibers. In this thesis, firstly conventional step-index fibers have been exploited for mode area scaling by reducing the refractive index of the actively doped core {{with respect to the}} cladding. Prior to this thesis, the lowest reported NA of a Yb-Al doped fiber was 0. 048 corresponding to 0. 0008 refractive index of core with respect to cladding. In this thesis, optimized solution doping process leads to a NA of 0. 038 for a Yb and Al doped core corresponding to 0. 0005 refractive index of core with respect to cladding. This reduction in NA of core leads to an effective area increase from ~ 450 µm 2 to ~ 700 µm 2 at 32 cm bend diameter ensuring effective single mode operation. This is the lowest NA ever reported using cost-effective solution doping process to the best of author’s knowledge, which is widely used in manufacturing of rare-earth doped fiber. Further, in a 4 %- 4 % laser configuration, a 35 µm core diameter 0. 038 NA fiber shows high laser efficiency (~ 81 %) with good M 2 (~ 1. 1) value of output beam at 1040 nm. Thesis also reports a novel fiber design known as single trench fiber, where a passive Ge-doped ring has been added around the core. This ring known as resonant ring facilitates the suppression of the higher order modes thanks to resonant coupling between modes of core and ring. The combination of ultra-low NA (~ 0. 038) and a surrounding ring can lead to an effective single mode operation of fiber having a core diameter as large as of 50 µm offering an effective area of ~ 1, 500 µm 2 at ~ 40 cm bend diameter. A 40 µm core diameter single trench fiber has been successfully fabricated in house and shows robust effective single mode behavior. Further, a 30 µm single trench fiber has been tested in a master oscillator power amplifier configuration delivering ~ 23. 5 ps pulses at 13. 5 MHz repetition rate carrying up to ~ 3. 8 µJ pulse energy corresponding to > 160 kW peak power and ~ 52. 3 W of average power, while maintaining ~ 76 % slope efficiency. Numerical Performance of STF has also been reported at other wavelengths such as 1550 nm and 2000 nm. A detailed comparative analysis has been performed with other competitive fiber designs showing the advantages of single trench fiber over other fiber designs. Further, another fiber design known as multi trench fiber has also been proposed. Multi trench fiber can scale effective area as large as of 12, 000 µm 2 in a rod-type configuration. Multi-trench fibers offer several advantages such as easy cleaving and splicing thanks to the all solid structure; however refractive index of active core has to be same as of passive cladding. Nevertheless, this fiber has shown a strong potential for applications in ultrafast rod-type fiber lasers. A 90 µm core diameter passive fiber has been fabricated in house using <b>rod-in-tube</b> <b>technique</b> in conjunction with modified chemical vapour process. Experiments ensure an effective single mode operation. Furthermore, this fiber also shows the potential to be used for beam delivery applications with a small core diameter thanks to effective single mode operation over a wide range of bend radii. MTFs of 30 µm and 20 µm core diameter have been successfully fabricated and both ensure robust single mode operation over a wide range of bend radii at 1060 nm and 632 nm respectively. Numerical simulations show the possibility of a 10 µm fiber to be effectively single moded at a wavelength of 300 nm. <br/...|$|E
