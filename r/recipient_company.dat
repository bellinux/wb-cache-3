This is especially evident in the evaluation of input additionality.

40|$|Several {{empirical}} {{studies have shown}} that apparently competing companies cooperate extensively through an informal exchange of valuable information. Since international interfirm relations have become elementary in many markets, the informal information exchange across national borders gains significance. Cross-cultural discrepancies in information-trading patterns may impede the emergence of stable and intensive informal relations between companies of different countries. So far, however, the question of whether information trading patterns are similar across nations has remained widely unexplored. Therefore this research compares the informal exchange of technical information among 438 managers in US and German steel companies. We assumed that a greater inclination to cooperate predominates in German firms (cooperative managerial capitalism) in comparison to their American counterparts (competitive managerial capitalism). Nevertheless, the findings indicate a more complex situation. Managers of German companies are found to interact more frequently than US managers with colleagues in other companies. However, in contradiction to the generally accepted assertion, the information exchanged among German firms proves to be of less importance to the <b>recipient</b> <b>company</b> than in the US.

40|$|Technology {{transfer}} is often {{perceived to be}} transfer of intellectual property (IP). Very few {{realize that there are}} other means of transferring technology. Most common means of technology {{transfer is}} the transfer of the IP alone. While this is interesting in itself, it is not the best means of transferring technology in all cases. IP such as patents, trademark and copyrighted material can easily be transferred in this manner. However, that is the lowest level of technology transfer possible. The next level of technology transfer is the ability to handover technology from the originating team to the recipient team. This involves having the creator(s) of technology innovation working with a team from the recipient side handing over technology and know-how. Transfer of software works best in this manner. This level is followed by the next higher form wherein the person or team creating the intellectual property is transferred over to the <b>recipient</b> <b>company.</b> This would certainly be of immense value in situations where a trade secret is being transferred. Excellent examples of level three technology transfer are leading and bleeding edge technologies in domains such as space and military. The best form of technology transfer is when the team/the entire organization and the culture are transferred over. This is where the most challenges are met in merger and acquisition situations.

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} a {{research}} study of knowledge acquisition by Chinese firms involved in collaborative ventures with foreign enterprises. The study uses 152 Chinese businesses located in the cities of Shenzhen and Shanghai and examines how the successful transfer of knowledge into <b>recipient</b> (or learner) <b>companies</b> occurs and whether management interventions in that process can significantly improve successful knowledge absorption and exploitation. The study uses a multivariate modeling approach to {{examine the impact of}} a number of factors on successful knowledge transfer. It finds that absorptive capacity (ACAP), as conceptualized by Cohen and Levinthal (1990) and developed by Zahra and George (2002), and the structural antecedents associated with the knowledge to be transferred, {{have a significant effect on}} successful knowledge transfer. However the strength of communication relationships adds significantly to successful learning by <b>recipient</b> <b>companies,</b> and this is an important moderating factor on the overall performance relationship. This is similar to the social integration mechanisms proposed Zahra and George (2002), but examines them empirically. These social integration mechanisms are also facilitated by soft and hard systems in the firm. The research found little evidence to show that different national cultures affected transfer, and this may be because individual firm culture predominated in this relationship. For these firms the development of a common organizational culture facilitated knowledge transfer and overcame national cultural differences. In addition, specific MIS system investments also facilitated the social integration mechanisms. Information systems and learner firm capability and resources had a strong impact on successful communications but not directly on successful knowledge transfer performance. As predicted by Cohen and Levinthal, a combination of the direct and indirect effects on knowledge transfer performance emphasize the importance of pre-existing conditions and ACAP but also highlight the impact of managerial interventions on this process. Social capital between learner and teacher firm is a critical factor, but for it to become important it requires complementary organizational inputs...|$|R
40|$|Commonly {{employed}} in corporate rescue situations, the Quistclose trust (from Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1970] AC 567) is {{a device that}} enables an investor to advance funds to a troubled company {{to be used for}} a specific purpose. If the <b>recipient</b> <b>company</b> becomes insolvent before the money is spent then the funds will be held on trust for the original lender, thus ensuring that the property is not available for distribution amongst the company's unsecured creditors. This thesis examines both the theory and context of Quistclose trusts. It is argued that, whilst the devices are most commonly found in insolvency situations, the Quistclose analysis should be available wherever property is transferred for a specific purpose. Thus the paper identifies and discusses such issues as the 'requirement' of segregation of the trust property, the specificity of purpose necessary, and the type of property that may be subject to a Quistclose trust. The context of the Quistclose trust is also examined by reference to other security devices: equitable charges and retention of title agreements. Similarities and differences are identified and analysed in the context of insolvency regimes: should Quistclose trusts be subject to legislative controls, given their apparent ability to circumvent legislative provisions? Various commentators have attempted to categorise Quistclose trusts as express trusts, resulting trusts, sui generis trusts, or even full beneficial transfers coupled with equitable rights to restrain misuse. Following consideration of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each proposal it is argued that Quistclose trusts can indeed be reconciled with accepted principle. However, it is also suggested that there is no single correct classification: depending on the most accurate construction of the parties' actions and intentions the proper analysis may involve an express trust, a resulting trust, or indeed no trust at all...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increased}} competition and {{fluctuations in the}} highly globalized business environments, managing change has become a key to organizational success. However, changing organizations is difficult. As a consequence, the world has witnessed an ever-increasing focus on management concepts, or fads, that promise success. As such practices are complicated to transfer, especially across national borders within multinational corporations, this is a topic of high current interest. The purpose of this thesis has been to address possible explanations for difficulties in implementation of management concepts within multinational corporations. Not only must the transfer from the headquarters to a subsidiary be understood, but also the further transfer with respect to local stakeholders within the <b>recipient</b> <b>company.</b> Companies constitute a range of different social configurations which can be identified as &# 145;communities of practice&# 146; {{with respect to a}} set of unique characteristics. Identifying and analysing such social configurations within the subsidiary is thus a fruitful approach to gain an understanding of the further transfer of the concept within the case company. This thesis explores the organizational dynamics that emerge as community of practice within a subsidiary of a multinational corporation (MNC) is being faced with a management concept which is developed at the foreign headquarters. This is a single case study of communities of practice within a subsidiary; a Norwegian automobile company, implementing the management concept of the MNC, which based on principles of &# 145;Lean Production&# 146;. The implementation of this concept in the subsidiary has not been entirely successful, as many difficulties have occurred. For this reason, the thesis aims to address the possible explanations for the experienced difficulties. Data has been gathered during a period of several years &# 150; from March of 2010 to October of 2013. This has mainly been done through a research project on &# 145;lean&# 146;, in which the case company is a participating actor. Interviews and observation studies have been conducted, in addition to the writers&# 146; short-term employment in one of the units at the case company during three weeks in May 2013. Few empirical studies have been conducted on the implementation of management concepts seen from the recipient&# 146;s point of view. Due to the wide access to data gathered over several years, in addition to the authors having worked at the plant, this report provides an in-depth understanding of the specific company and the challenges it is facing. In order to carry out the analyses, a literature study was conducted on previous and current research on organizational change, management concepts and fads, implementation of concepts, the content and contextual embeddedness of transfer, and communities of practice. As the main research question is highly complex and comprehensive, six subordinate questions have been derived. For this reason, each chapter of the case study is dedicated to provide an answer to one of these, respectively. The different analyses all expand on the previous ones, but focusing mainly on the specific topic of chapter. By drawing connections between the respective analyses, five main findings can be drawn from this study. Firstly, there is a misfit between the concept and the implementation; the concept attempts to facilitate involvement and communication, although employees are not involved in the process of implementing the concept, and the essence of the concept is not communicated to a sufficient degree. Secondly, there is a poor assessment of the employees&# 146; responses to the change efforts, as the negative response cannot only be explained as result of the concept in itself, but also of the way it is being implemented. Thirdly, the role of mid-level management is identified as problematic, since it functions as what can be conceptualized as a &# 147;buffer of hypocrisy&# 148;. Fourthly, the concept is implemented, although not yet institutionalized. The use of elements of the management concept is not alone a confirmation of a successful implementation. Finally, the community of practice in itself is an obstacle to the implementation of the concept, as it resists interference from the outside. Consequently, due to the complexity of the transfer, this thesis has demonstrated that there is a wide range of different aspects that should be addressed in order to understand and thus prevent the difficulties of the implementation. For the case company, these findings would add {{to the understanding of the}} experienced difficulties, and thus form the basis for further implementation and organizational change of the company in general. In addition, this study provides contributions to the literature in form of three frameworks for identifying communities of practice, comparing communities of practice, and finally, examining the occurring tensions as a community of practice faces a management concept. Although the master&# 146;s thesis describes a contemporary phenomenon in a single company, these developed theoretical frameworks are considered useful also for other studies on similar issues. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{view about}} Italian Industrial Districts (IDs) suggests that firms within IDs finance themselves through internal sources alone. This view, based on Northeastern IDs - {{on which the}} mainstream literature concentrates - implicitly denies any potential role played by state subsidies available to small firms {{within the framework of}} national and regional industrial policies from the 1950 s onwards. This thesis, focusing on a Southern ID, tests whether IDs can also emerge within the context of state intervention, and whether Southern IDs relied heavily on state funding in contrast with North-eastern IDs, which drew on public funds to a much smaller extent. The thesis employs a two-pronged approach, analysing the issue from the perspective of both the lending institutions and the recipient firms. It discusses the development of the 'Extraordinary intervention for the South' - designed to overcome Southern backwardness - and compares it with the national industrial policies. It moves on to provide a detailed breakdown {{of the extent to which}} firms in Southern Italy benefited from subsidised loans and grants more than firms in the North-east, where far fewer firms sought subsidies. The importance of subsidies for the <b>recipient</b> <b>companies</b> is studied using two samples of small manufacturing firms, within the Southern ID of Barletta and the North-eastern ID of San Mauro Pascoli. The analysis of the capital structure of the two samples confirms the greater reliance of Southern companies on subsidies, whereas private finance was more important for the North-eastern counterparts. However, subsidies to companies in the North-eastern ID appear to be more effective. The thesis concludes that the received interpretative framework regarding the types of finance used by companies within IDs is severely limited, in that the role of state subsidies cannot be neglected, particularly for Southern IDs, but also for the more prosperous North-eastern IDs...|$|R

40|$|Recently, in Italy, in {{the public}} sector, an ambitious path for change of the methods and tools of {{accounting}} of local governments was started in order {{to respond to a}} crisis situation of the classical forms of democracy. This path was developed substantially in two directions: on the one hand, laws (see Laws No. 131 / 2003 and Nos. 42 and 196 of 2009) and acts ranked as laws (see Legislative Decrees Nos. 170 / 2006, 118 / 2011 and 126 / 2014) have changed internally the criteria and the traditional accounting logics, to make the public accounting systems more uniform and comparable with each other, on the other hand, voluntarily and through an evolution which be occurred by “topics integration”, additional accounting forms (such as the social budget and the participatory budget) have been introduced to inform the community and groups of stakeholders in the social effects of the collective choices and to extend as much as possible the participation of private entities to public decision-making processes. The paper analyses the financial situation of some Italian municipalities which have recently proposed multi-year financial recovery procedures, as provided by article 243 -bis of the Consolidated Act of the rules on the Italian local governments (Legislative Decree No. 267 / 2000), in order to show, {{in the light of the}} results of their annual financial statements, as these new tools of accounting, borrowed from the business world and the third sector, can now offer to public bodies, and especially to municipalities, an important opportunity to restore a correct relationship with stakeholders (businesses, households and, in general, all recipients of municipal services) and to strengthen the economic and social resilience of municipalities. Moreover, the paper shows how the Public Sector (especially Regional and City Authorities) can support the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the framework of Europe 2020 Strategy. In particular, we want compare the global perspective in the World Bank studies with the EU frameworks for CSR and the Europe 2020 Strategy.
