Moreover, since in several genetic diseases of skeletal muscle the deleterious effects of abnormal gene expression are suppressed in immature fibers, we studied the expression of developmental myosin heavy chain (d-MHC) as a marker of persistent immaturity in mdx <b>regenerated</b> <b>fibers.</b> Our results show that in mdx gastrocnemius: 1) {{the course of the}} disease is accompanied by a prevalent loss of large-calibre original fibers with relative preservation of small-calibre fibers.

In this paper, the inscription of Fibre Bragg Gratings (FBGs) and the later regeneration process to obtain <b>Regenerated</b> <b>Fiber</b> Bragg Gratings (RFBGs) in high-birefringence optical fiber is reported. The obtained RFBGs show two Bragg resonances corresponding to the slow and fast axis that are characterized in temperature terms.

The proposed interrogation setup is based in the use of optical filters in order to convert the wavelength shift of each of the Bragg resonances into optical power changes. The design of the optical filters is also studied in this article. In first place, the ideal filter is calculated using a recursive method and defining the boundary conditions. This ideal filter linearizes the output of the interrogation setup but is limited by the large wavelength shift of the RFBG with temperature and the maximum attenuation. The response of modal interferometers as optical filters is also analyzed. They can be easily tuned shifting the optical spectrum.

40|$|AbstractThe onset and {{progression}} of skeletal muscle regeneration {{are controlled by}} {{a complex set of}} interactions between muscle precursor cells and their environment. Decorin is the main proteoglycan present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of adult muscle while biglycan expression is lower, but both are increased in mdx mice dystrophic muscle. Both of these small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) can bind other matrix proteins and to the three TGF-β isoforms, acting as modulators of their biological activity. We evaluated biglycan and decorin expression in skeletal muscle during barium chloride-induced skeletal muscle regeneration in mice. A transient and dramatic up-regulation of biglycan was associated with newly formed myotubes, whereas decorin presented only minor variations. Studies both in vitro and in intact developing newborn mice showed that biglycan expression is initially high and then decreases during skeletal muscle differentiation and maturation. To further evaluate the role of biglycan during the regenerative process, skeletal muscle regeneration was studied in biglycan-null mice. Skeletal muscle maintains its regenerative capacity in the absence of biglycan, but a delay in <b>regenerated</b> <b>fiber</b> growth and a decreased expression of embryonic myosin were observed despite to normal expression of MyoD and myogenin. Transient up-regulation of decorin during muscle regeneration in these mice may possibly obscure further roles of SLRPs in this process...|$|E
