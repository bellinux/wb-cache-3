Our simulation findings suggest that CAFTA would reduce nominal incomes for nearly all rural household groups in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. However, compensating variations that take into account rural economy-wide adjustments to policy shocks are mostly negative, implying that current agricultural protection policies are disadvantageous for most rural household groups.

It pr ovided the BAS with the services of a consultant for a total of four months between Novembe r 1989 and July 1990; with study tours for senior technical staff to India, Thailand, and Malaysia; and with computer hardware and softwareA set of 85 indicators, grouped into 16 sections, was proposed, test ed, and agreed upon. A manual on the development and maintenance of the agricultural in dicator system was prepared for the use of the BAS; the Data Processing and Agricultura l Information Division was assigned the task of computerizing the indicator systemThree seminars for staff of the Agricultural Accounts and Statistica l Indicators Division of the BAS were organized to provide an overview of the system, and pre sent the manual. A presentation to senior staff and representatives of major data-produc ing and data- using bodies was also organizedAn adequate, sustainable system of agricultural indicators has now b een established. By the end of the project, about 75 percent of the basic data requ ired had been collected, and it was expected that this work would soon be finished. It was re commended that the Government make all possible efforts to ensure the expeditious preparat ion of the draft publication with the full set of compiled indicators; this draft should b e presented to a seminar of data producers, and users of the agricultural indicator system, to have their comments. After revision in the light of these comments, it was recommended tha t this become an annual publication of the BAS.

50|$|Current {{attitudes toward}} welfare in Australia can be {{separated}} into {{support for the}} <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> and support for welfare recipients. A multivariate analysis using canonical correlation analysis identified five distinct profiles of welfare attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics. The main attitude cluster was one toward support for the <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> and <b>welfare</b> recipients. Having receiving government welfare in the past strongly predicted a person supporting the <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> and its beneficiaries. The next most prominent attitude profile was summarized as 'the <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> is good but the people on it are lazy and dependent'. This attitude profile was found among people receiving welfare payments that were either normative (e.g. the age pension) or where there is little expectation that a person will return to work (e.g. disability support pension). Overall, Australian's hold more negative attitudes toward welfare recipients than they do the <b>welfare</b> <b>system.</b> People {{with a history of}} receiving unemployment benefits tend to have more negative welfare attitudes if they live in areas where other community members have more negative attitudes.|$|R
40|$|Introduction [...] . ] In this paper, {{we seek to}} {{identify}} innovative ways to limit inequality in households 2 ̆ 019 disposable incomes and living standards while keeping <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> fiscally sustainable. We focus on the <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> of EU countries in comparison, to better understand their key features. To set the scene, we review trends in income inequality in Europe {{in relation to other}} major world regions. We compare inequality before and after taxes and transfers across European countries to gain insights into the extent of redistribution and, hence, the impact of the national <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> (Section 2). Next we review the experience of five European countries that have been identified as examples of distinct <b>welfare</b> <b>system</b> models. We characterize national <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> in terms {{of the extent to which}} they decommodify labour, emphasize or relax stratification, and engage in social investment rather than income replacement during spells of unemployment (Section 3). We go on to assess the performance of our selected countries in terms of income redistribution, economic growth, polarization between rich and poor, and labour market developments (Section 4). We complement the picture by looking closely at evidence from surveys and economic experiments to assess inequality aversion in our selected countries and relate our findings to the extent of redistribution and other features of the national <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> (Section 5). We look for recent challenges for and responses by the <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> and reflect on adjustment requirements that lie ahead (Section 6). The final section concludes (Section 7).
