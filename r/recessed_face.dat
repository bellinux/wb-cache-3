50|$|The {{house is}} a 2-1/2 story wood frame {{structure}} with a gable roof. An engaged porch wraps around three sides of the building, and the front roof facade is pierced by three shed-roof dormers. The {{second floor of the}} front elevation has five sash windows, while the first floor has an asymmetrical <b>recessed</b> <b>face</b> with its entry slightly less recessed than the surrounding exterior walls. The porch, under the overhanging second floor, is supported by chamfered square posts. The kitchen ell is a two story structure extending {{to the rear of the}} main block. The interior of the first floor main block is one large chamber, accessed via doors from a vestibule area, with a stairwell in the southwest and a narrow hall leading to a bathroom and kitchen. There are four bedrooms on the second floor, and two more in the attic space.|$|E
50|$|Poirot and Hastings {{visit the}} scene of the crime. The library runs the length of one side of the house. At either end are curtained {{recesses}} with French windows, one to the garden and the other to the drive. It was in the <b>recess</b> <b>facing</b> the garden that Reedburn was found. The dead man had a female visitor that night that he let into the house himself but the servants did not see her. Poirot sees a marble seat in the recess whose arm-ends are carved in the form of lions' heads and wonders if they could have caused the wound to Reedburn's head. The doctor says there is no blood on the marble.|$|R

The large claw extractor was eliminated {{in favor of}} a small, but effective part mounted in a newly <b>recessed</b> bolt <b>face.</b> The ejector was now a plunger on the bolt face rather than a blade mounted in the receiver. The safety was simplified and a new trigger mechanism was fitted.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Fusil Ametrellador Systema Mendoza" [...] Model 1934 is an air-cooled, magazine-fed, gas-operated {{light machine}} gun {{weighing}} approximately 18.5 lb. The design features a quick-detachable barrel with 39 radial cooling fins, a flash hider and a bipod. The top-mounted, 20-or 30-round box magazine is offset to the right, allowing the sights to be centered. The rotating bolt has eight locking lugs in three rows that lock directly to the steel receiver. The gas system is fed from an adjustable gas port 11 inches {{from the rear of}} the barrel. Gas flows through a tube in the gas port where it impinges on the <b>recessed</b> <b>face</b> of the piston, which forms part of the operating rod assembly. Cyclic firing rate is 380 to 550 rounds per minute (RPM) depending on the gas system setting. Designers consider that while the Mendoza borrows much from both the Lewis and the Hotchkiss machine guns, the Model 1934 is a first-class design in its own right. In many ways, the Mendoza Model 1934 is what the American BAR should have been.|$|E
50|$|A {{mains socket}} mounted transformer/rectifier {{provided}} 9V DC {{to the speed}} controller board, which used tachometer feedback from the DC motor to regulate its speed. A small brass pulley drove the platter assembly using a flat rubber belt wrapped around a <b>recessed</b> <b>face</b> machined into {{the underside of the}} one-piece acrylic platter, another unconventional material chosen for its vibration dissipation qualities. The thrust element of the bearing was formed by a tungsten carbide sphere mounted in the bearing spindle pressing against a synthetic ruby cup in top of the aluminium support sleeve for the platter. The bearing was positioned close to the centre of gravity of the platter with side load being carried by a lower PTFE sleeve against the bearing spindle. The next product, referred to as the PT1, is often mistakenly assumed to be their first product. The PT1 was an easier to manufacture version of the 'Original' having the glass top plate replaced by a black painted steel plate. Later versions of the PT1 moved the motor from its original 'one o'clock' position to 'seven o'clock', {{on the opposite side of}} the spindle to the tonearm to mounted it on the top plate. This turntable was in production from 1979 until 1985.|$|E

50|$|They {{proceed to}} the Oglander home, along the garden path. In the drawing room, {{the table with the}} cards for the {{interrupted}} bridge game is still in place. Miss Saintclair is still in the house, ill in bed. She tells them that Reedburn held a secret of hers and threatened her but she did not kill him. She went to his house by prior appointment and was pleading with him when a man dressed like a tramp attacked him from behind the curtained recess. She fled from the house towards the lights of the Oglander house. Returning to the drawing room Poirot notices that the king of clubs is missing from the cards on the bridge table. They return to Reedburn's house and in the curtained recess that leads to the drive they find a twin of the marble seat, again with lion's head arms but this one has a faint bloodstain on it. Reedburn was killed here and his body dragged to the <b>recess</b> <b>facing</b> the garden. Poirot has the missing king of clubs, having taken it from the card box before at the Oglander house. He returns there to assure Mrs. Oglander that the police will not find out what happened. He returns the playing card to her, telling her it was their only slip-up.|$|R

50|$|As {{designed}} by Richardson, {{the house was}} a two story L-shaped wood frame structure, with its main entrance to the left of a <b>recessed</b> porch <b>facing</b> Brattle Street. A side entrance is {{on the east side of}} the house, facing Ash Street. The exterior, in a departure from Victorian forms featuring sometimes extensive and elaborate decorative sawn woodwork, is restrained, with most surfaces covered with wooden shingles. The entry leads into a central hall at the crook of the L, which includes a sweeping semicircular staircase leading to the upper floors. From this hall access is gained to most of the public rooms on the ground floor, including a drawing room, music room, study, and dining room. The dining room is to the right of the entrance, with access to the formerly-recessed porch, which has been glassed in. Beyond the dining room to the right is the service wing, including the kitchen and laundry, later converted into a garage, and then again merged into the house proper.

5000|$|Arab {{physicist}} Ibn al-Haytham (known in the West by the Latinised Alhazen) (965-1039) {{explained in}} his Book of Optics (circa 1027) that rays of light travel in straight lines and are distinguished {{by the body}} that reflected the rays and then wrote: [...] "Evidence that light and color do not mingle in air or (other) transparent bodies is (found in) the fact that, when several candles are at various distinct locations in the same area, and when they all face a window that opens into a dark recess, and {{when there is a}} white wall or (other white) opaque body in the dark <b>recess</b> <b>facing</b> that window, the (individual) lights of those candles appear individually upon that body or wall according to the number of those candles; and each of those lights (spots of light) appears directly opposite one (particular) candle along a straight line passing through that window. Moreover, if one candle is shielded, only the light opposite that candle is extinguished, but if the shielding object is lifted, the light will return." [...] In his 1038 essay [...] "On the form of the Eclipse" [...] (Maqalah-fi-Surat-al-Kosuf) (Arabic: مقالة في صورةالكسوف) he wrote: [...] "The image of the sun {{at the time of the}} eclipse, unless it is total, demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow, round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moon-sickle. The image of the sun shows this peculiarity only when the hole is very small. When the hole is enlarged, the picture changes, and the change increases with the added width. When the aperture is very wide, the sickle-form image will disappear, and the light will appear round when the hole is round, square if the hole is square, and if the shape of the opening is irregular, the light on the wall will take on this shape, provided that the hole is wide and the plane on which it is thrown is parallel to it." [...] Al-Haytham also analyzed the rays of sunlight and concluded that they make a conic shape where they meet at the hole, forming another conic shape reverse to the first one from the hole to the opposite wall in the dark room (see illustration). Ibn al-Haytham is reported to have stated about the camera obscura: [...] "We did not invent this". al-Haytam's writings on optics became very influential in Europe through Latin translations since circa 1200. Among the people who he inspired were Witelo, John Peckham, Roger Bacon, Leonardo Da Vinci, René Descartes and Johannes Kepler.|$|R
25|$|The {{powers of}} the Senate {{concerning}} nominations are, however, subject to some constraints.

Nevertheless, presidents have frequently used recess appointments to circumvent the possibility that the Senate may reject the nominee. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court held in Myers v.

500|$|Dinosaurs {{stand with}} their hind limbs erect {{in a manner}} similar to most modern mammals, but {{distinct}} from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side. This posture is due to the development of a laterally <b>facing</b> <b>recess</b> in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur. Their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that surpassed those of [...] "sprawling" [...] reptiles. Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs. Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including rauisuchians, also had erect limbs but achieved this by a [...] "pillar erect" [...] configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the upper pelvic bone was rotated to form an overhanging shelf.|$|R

Their costumes, and especially textiles, may indicate a common origin with Indo-European neolithic clothing techniques or a common low-level textile technology. Chärchän man wore a red twill tunic and tartan leggings. Textile expert Elizabeth Wayland Barber, who examined the tartan-style cloth, discusses similarities between it and fragments recovered from salt mines associated with the Hallstatt culture.

The gable section of the facade includes a stone bearing the date 1829; it, and the stonework {{at the top of the}} gable suggest that the roof was raised after the building's initial construction. An entablature extends along the eaves of the side walls, with short returns on the ends. The building interior is reflective of early 20th-century renovations.|$|R
40|$|The Nabataeans {{were highly}} {{creative}} in their {{adaptation of the}} Greco-Roman construction techniques. Based on their specific natural resources and lexicon of architectural elements, the Nabataeans thus developed their own techniques. Indeed, the size and elaborate nature of many of their monuments would require such innovations, as physically manifested in the two vertical rows of slots located on the <b>recessed</b> back <b>face</b> wall {{on either side of}} the façade of el-Khazneh in Petra in Jordan. These slots have been a matter of some debate on whether their function was for footholds or for scaffolding. Though the slots have been discussed in passing, no scholar has made the in-depth critical investigation in determining their proper technical and functional approach with reference to their preserved fully recorded dimensions. Thanks to a recent study using a combination of 3 D laser scanner and reflector-less total station, we now have precise measurements of the well preserved individual slots. This article is concerned with the particular case of these slots. A detailed examination of these slots in relation to their size and depth, position and arrangement within the façade, probably credits their use, both, as foot holes, and as supports for a smart and simple scaffolding structure. The paper suggests and exemplifies that, these slots are part of an authentic Nabataean construction technique, and they were the foundations used to fix a wooden lightweight socket in a diagonal changeabla cantilever scaffolding. This new assumption is supported with schematic sections and illustrations showing alternative combinations of the cantilever scaffolding at different slot heights, using the embedded putlog and diagonal bracing on which the planks are held. Thus, providing the basis for further research, hopefully encouraging a further knowledge of Nabataean scaffolding construction techniques of rock-cut architecture...|$|R
