50|$|JET is the world’s largest {{nuclear fusion}} {{experiment}} {{on the energy}} producing process which {{takes place in the}} sun.Over time, high-energy neutrons render some components and support structures of the reactor radioactive. This was most severe after the first DT (Deuterium/Tritium) experiments on JET in 1997. Furthermore, many plasma facing tiles are covered in beryllium, which, if breathed in as dust, poses a further hazard to anyone working inside the reactor. Therefore, JET has always placed great emphasis on its Remote Handling, to ensure a maximum of tasks can be carried out fully remotely. This has always relied on the MASCOT telemanipulator system as the main workhorse for all remote handling activities. This remote handling has historically been done by CCFE's <b>RH</b> <b>group,</b> now RACE, RACE will continue supporting JET operating the Mascot system.|$|E

40|$|Majority of {{the genes}} are {{evolving}} under the neutral mutation pressure. However, some genes are evolving through positive selection. Blood types were originally distinguished by the different molecular structure on erythrocytes. Therefore these products of blood group genes may cause interactions with other organisms, and there is possibility of positive selection on those genes. Because the <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> gene products are membrane proteins, these products of blood group genes seemed {{to be affected by}} interactions with other organisms or cells on surface regions. It is known that the <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes have homologous genes named Rh 50, and hominoids have two or three <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes. Therefore the <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes and their related genes experienced a series of gene duplication events. Analyses of gene duplication events are also important to elucidate evolutionary rates and patterns of these genes. I thus analyzed the <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes and their related genes from primates to fish to clarify the tempo and mode of evolution of these genes. 　　　The human Rh blood type {{is one of the major}} blood group systems, and plays important roles in transfusion and clinical medicine, including haemolytic diseases of newborns, autoimmune diseases, and mild haemolytic anemia. Landsteiner and Wiener detected an antibody that agglutinates blood cells from rhesus macaques, and it was named Rh. Nucleotide sequences of <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes in some primates were reported, and the phylogenetic relationship of primate <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes have been conducted. However, the phylogenetic relationship of primate <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes from these studies is not compatible with each other. Because hominoids have two or three loci of <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes by gene duplication, gene conversion events (or some kind of convergent effects) may prevent to determine the true gene tree. 　　　I examined the evolution of the <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes of primates. Because we don 2 ̆ 7 t know the actual gene tree topology of primate <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes, I assumed two plausible trees from nucleotide sequence data by using phylogenetic networks. I used the site by site reconstruction method under the maximum likelihood estimates to identify regions of gene conversion events assuming the two trees, and detected 9 or 11 converted regions. After eliminating the effect of gene conversions, I estimated numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions for each branch of the both trees. Whichever we selected gene trees, the branch connecting hominoids and Old World monkeys showed significantly higher nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions, that is, indication of positive selection by using a statistical test. Many other branches also showed higher nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions, and this suggests that the Rh genes have experienced some kind of positive selection. In any case, we should be very careful when we analyse the evolutionary history of tandemly duplicated genes, for there is always possibility of gene conversions. 　　　To examine evolutionary patterns of other mammalian <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes, I determined complete coding regions of <b>Rh</b> blood <b>group</b> genes of five mouse subspecies and rat, and Rh 50 genes of five mouse subspecies, rat, and crab-eating macaque, and examined these genes.

40|$|Abstract Background The Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is {{the second}} most farmed fish species worldwide. It is also an {{important}} model for studies of fish physiology, particularly because of its broad tolerance to an array of environments. It is a good model to study evolutionary mechanisms in vertebrates, because of its close relationship to haplochromine cichlids, which have undergone rapid speciation in East Africa. The existing genomic resources for Nile tilapia include a genetic map, BAC end sequences and ESTs, but comparative genome analysis and maps of quantitative trait loci (QTL) are still limited. Results We have constructed a high-resolution radiation hybrid (RH) panel for the Nile tilapia and genotyped 1358 markers consisting of 850 genes, 82 markers corresponding to BAC end sequences, 154 microsatellites and 272 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). From these, 1296 markers could be associated in 81 <b>RH</b> <b>groups,</b> while 62 were not linked. The total size of the RH map is 34, 084 cR 3500 and 937, 310 [*]kb. It covers 88 % of the entire genome with an estimated inter-marker distance of 742 Kb. Mapping of microsatellites enabled integration to the genetic map. We have merged LG 8 and LG 24 into a single linkage group, and confirmed that LG 16 -LG 21 are also merged. The orientation and association of <b>RH</b> <b>groups</b> to each chromosome and LG was confirmed by chromosomal in situ hybridizations (FISH) of 55 BACs.
