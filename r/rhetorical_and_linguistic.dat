While her focus is primarily on error, it is underscored by a sensitive understanding of the reasons behind the <b>rhetorical</b> <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> difficulties discussed and a strong belief in the inherent intelligence of learners described as ‘basic writers.’ Shaughnessy's claims about the difficulties faced by basic writers are supported by examples from thousands of student papers. Examples of many kinds of errors are provided. Each chapter also includes suggestions for the teacher on how to reduce the particular kind of error discussed in that specific chapter. Shaughnessy also explains why these errors occur by examining the rules that are manifested in students' writing.

40|$|Shahanshāhnāma {{is one of}} the {{historical}} epic poems composed by Ahmad Tabrizi {{at the end of the}} Ilkhanids’ reign. At the time, the poet was not able to openly criticize the Mongols. At times, one may even think that he is praising them. On the contrary, in the hidden layers of his composition, the poet tries to show his criticism by using <b>rhetorical</b> <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> tools and praising Iran and Iranians, especially Sultan Jalal al-Din Kharazmshahi. The present paper tries to uncover these hidden layers of Shahanshāhnāma and reveal Tabrizi's interest in Iran and Iranians. To this end, the critical discourse analysis approach is adopted. To further uncover the poet’s tilt, the study examines different <b>rhetorical</b> <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> techniques such as choice of diction, similes and metaphors, meaningful and exaggerated description of battles in the Iranian and Mongol fronts as well as references to dominant discourses like drawing analogies between the characters and those of the Shāhnāma...|$|E

Despite its importance, not much {{attention has been paid}} to providing support for teachers to teach this difficult task to medical students who are novices to this form of communication. As a formalized piece of talk that takes a regularized form and used for a specific communicative goal, the case {{presentation is}} regarded as a rhetorical activity and awareness of its <b>rhetorical</b> <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> characteristics should be given due consideration in teaching. This paper reviews practitioners ’ and the limited research literature that relates to expectations of medical educators about what makes a good case presentation, and explains the rhetorical aspect of the activity. It is found there is currently a lack of a comprehensive model of the case presentation that projects the <b>rhetorical</b> <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> skills needed to produce and deliver a good presentation. Attempts to describe the structure of the case presentation have used predominantly opinion-based methodologies. In this paper, I argue for a performance-based model that would not only allow a description of the rhetorical structure of the oral case presentation, but also enable a systematic examination of the tacit genre knowledge that differentiates the expert from the novice. Such a model will be a useful resource for medical educators to provide more structured feedback and teaching support to medical students in learning this important genre...|$|E

Referring to texts the children had read to prepare them for the writing activity, instruction variously focused on drawing their attention to the <b>rhetorical</b> structure <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> features typically associated with the targeted genre. The results reported herein pertain to how the children used their readings as a resource for the informational content of the texts they produced during the post-test. Overall, semantic analysis of the informational content reveals no significant difference between experimental and control groups. However, children in the experimental group significantly outperformed the latter in terms of their ability to produce texts which, from a rhetorical perspective, better reflected the features associated with texts involving comparisons...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{creation}} of a persuasive scientific text involves a combination of innovation and conformity, meeting {{the requirements of the}} genre and the expectations of the discourse community. This is based on an array of <b>rhetorical</b> choices <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> features, one of which has been particularly well researched in recent years: recurrent co-occurrences or ‘collocations’. The author’s study aims at determining to what extent these patterns and their variations contribute to the {{creation of}} a persuasive scientific discourse. The types of combinations between general scientific and specialised terms are studied so as to understand their role in the rhetorical progression of the text. The corpus includes PhD abstracts from two fields that were written in English by native and non-native speakers. The analysis provides evidence that each corpus highlights specific disciplinary strategies based on the use of textual collocational variations, or ‘collocational chains’. While building textual cohesion, these chains contribute to the perception of the text as both coherent and persuasive. However, they do not appear to be mastered equally by native and non-native speakers...|$|R

While writers are concerned about how hypotheses can be strategically linked with other elements in research reports to effectively present an introductory chapter, instructors are considering ways of guiding learners to use the appropriate language in postulating research hypotheses. Using an analytical framework developed by Swales (1990 & 2004) and specialist informants’ qualitative data, this largely qualitative investigation looks into a corpus of experimental doctoral dissertations submitted to 32 American universities from 2001 to 2009 in order to ascertain (i) {{the degree to which}} research hypotheses need to be presented in dissertation introductions, (ii) how hypotheses are strategically linked with other <b>rhetorical</b> segments, <b>and</b> (iii) the salient linguistic mechanisms used to achieve the communicative functions.

The investigation focused on uncovering the communicative purpose, <b>rhetorical</b> structure <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> devices of information summaries. In addition, visual analysis was conducted. An added feature to the study is an investigation of Move 9 : Announcing Possible Risks. The corpus was derived from information summaries of IPO prospectuses submitted to Bursa Malaysia. Ten information summaries each from manufacturing and food and beverages were selected at random from Bursa Malaysia prepared with the assistance of investment advisers and the listed companies. The former comprise 15411 words in size while the latter is 17433 words in length. The whole corpus is 32844 words. The investigation revealed the communicative purpose as “to inform and to warn,” while, the rhetorical structure consists of ten moves. Linguistic devices are presented in realizing the moves such as in the use of Auxiliary Verbs and Passives.

40|$|Second {{language}} (L 2) {{writers have}} historically challenged the writing center tutorial model, which privileges higher order concerns over lower order concerns. This model separates {{the provision of}} <b>rhetorical</b> <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> feedback into different stages of the writing process, with the rhetorical concerns of content and organization addressed {{in the early stages}} and the linguistic concerns of grammar and punctuation addressed in the later stages. Although this separation has been appropriate for native English speakers, it has proven to be problematic for L 2 writers, who often require linguistic feedback throughout all stages of the writing process. Their requests for this feedback and their need for greater linguistic intervention has led to the perception that linguistic feedback is the primary concern of L 2 writers, even at the expense of rhetorical feedback. This study examines the type of feedback requested by eight undergraduate L 2 writers in writing center tutorials. It also examines the balance of <b>rhetorical</b> <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> feedback in the tutorial session, the extent of overlap between the two categories, how the agenda is negotiated with regard to these categories, and the perceptions of both tutors and L 2 writers. Data include pre- and post-tutorial surveys, tutor focus group, and tape-recorded tutorials. Findings that emerge from this study include: (1) L 2 writers express initial interest in linguistic feedback but seek and receive slightly more rhetorical feedback; (2) substantial overlap exists between categories, primarily related to discussions of content; (3) L 2 writers and tutors use opposite strategies for initiating topics in the same feedback category; and (4) L 2 writers 2 ̆ 7 and tutors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of what type of feedback has been provided are most likely to conflict when there has been substantial overlap between categories. These findings indicate the need for a reassessment of the tutorial model for L 2 writers and tutor training that includes the study of second language acquisition and the development of second language writing ability. ...|$|E

In each case, it shows that economic facts, once created, may travel freely through normative debates and claim moral force. The technical process of economic modelling is therefore seen to be a crucial aspect of the economisation of this area, and of economic performativity more generally. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

Soon-to-be new hires graduating from business schools in Singapore and the midwestern United States responded to reporting scenarios.

Analyses of subsamples revealed four issues where these stu-dents had difficulties reporting in writing: contribution, deference, ownership, and objectivity. An ana-lytical tool incorporating these issues and textual alternatives was then used to score a large subsample. Correlations between the holistic scores and scores on the analytical tool suggest that the four issues are distinct yet complementary, with contribution {{on one side of}} a continuum and deference on the other. The finding that Singaporean respondents scored higher on deference than contribution, whereas the reverse was true for U.

40|$|The period 1689 - 1901 was 'the golden age' of {{the sermon}} in Britain. It {{was the best}} selling printed work and {{dominated}} the print trade until the mid-nineteenth century. Sermons were highly influential in religious and spiritual matters, but they also played important roles in elections and politics, science and ideas and campaigns for reform. Sermons touched the lives of ordinary people and formed a dominant part of their lives. Preachers attracted huge crowds and the popular demand for sermons was never higher. Sermons were also taken by missionaries and clergy across the British empire, so that preaching was integral {{to the process of}} imperialism and shaped the emerging colonies and dominions. The form that sermons took varied widely, and this enabled preaching to be adopted and shaped by every denomination, so that in this period most religious groups could lay claim to a sermon style. The pulpit naturally lent itself to controversy, and consequently sermons lay at the heart of numerous religious arguments. Drawing on the latest research by leading sermon scholars, this handbook accesses historical, theological, <b>rhetorical,</b> literary <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> studies to demonstrate the interdisciplinary strength of the field of sermon studies and to show the centrality of sermons to religious life in this period...|$|R

Obtaining the support of the masses, legitimising political policies, or succeeding in public debates and parliamentary negotiations may depend to a great extent on the kind of language a politician employs and its adequacy to each political event. This paper analyses the oral delivery of senator John F.

Our study focuses particularly on the analysis of a series of <b>rhetorical</b> patterns <b>and</b> <b>linguistic</b> devices employed by the senator in order to empower his argumentations, namely: three-part statements, contrastive pairs, lexical and syntactic repetition, purposive selection and use of pronouns, addressing formulae, introductory formulae for personal opinion and ideology, and the usage of discourse organisers. The results of this study hint, inter alia, that behind the apparent spontaneity of Kerry’s oral delivery there is a selective use of linguistic devices, which is necessarily the product of prior consideration and thoughtful discourse elaboration...|$|R

As the teacher’s public speaking is mostly linked to what is known as “instructional speech”, special attention is paid to the characteristics of this. Instructional speech is a component of pedagogical speech with which the teacher communicates field-specific knowledge (by explaining, illustrating, posing instructional questions etc.), and through which students acquire new knowledge.

While patents share many common elements with research articles, and sometimes even cover the exact same scientific discoveries as articles, they differ from articles in substantial ways, largely due to differences in their communicative purposes, their intended readerships, and the presence of significant legal constraints that govern many aspects of patent construction. Here, I present a comparative analysis of a corpus containing pairs of U. S. patents and published research articles covering equivalent scientific discoveries in the area of biotechnology. For this analysis, I have focused on the “Background of the Invention” section of the patents and the Introduction section of the research articles. Research article Introductions are perhaps the most widely studied of all sections of IMRAD-type articles, often displaying a rhetorical structure as described by Swales’s CARS model (Swales, 1990, 2004). While the Background section of patents may address similar scientific elements as article Introductions and may thus be expected to include aspects of the CARS model, the two sections often show fundamentally differences, including with respect to their rhetorical structures, the way in which cited work is addressed, and hedging. These differences, and their functional relations to the divergent communicative purposes of each genre, will be addressed...|$|R

Viewing marketing as an ideological discourse that places consumption in a central position in people's lives provides further insights into the construction of political marketing discourse. Politicians and political parties now follow the 'logic of the market' {{in their attempts to}} connect with voters. Critical discourse analysis can be used in general to study the nature of political marketing discourse and specifically to document the web of identities and power relations that this discourse reproduces.
