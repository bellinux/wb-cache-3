A nonlinear 3 -DoF vehicle model with a piecewise linearization tire model is built up as the rollover predictive model, and its accuracy is verified by vehicle tests. A yaw stability controller and a rollover stability controller are proposed, respectively.

50|$|For the X-3, {{the roll}} {{coupling}} flight {{was the high}} point of its history. The aircraft was grounded for nearly a year after the flight, and never again explored its <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> and <b>control</b> boundaries. Walker made another ten flights between 20 September 1955 and the last on 23 May 1956. The aircraft was subsequently retired to the U.S. Air Force Museum. Although the X-3 never met its intention of providing aerodynamic data in Mach 2 cruise, its short service was of value. It showed the dangers of roll inertia coupling, and provided early flight test data on the phenomenon. Its small, highly loaded unswept wing was used in the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, {{and it was one of}} the first aircraft to use titanium. Finally, the X-3's very high takeoff and landing speeds required improvements in tire technology.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the control methods for roll instability of articulated steering vehicles (ASVs) by taking wheel loaders as the research object. An eight-degrees-of-freedom nonlinear dynamics model of ASVs {{was built on}} the basis of multibody dynamics. Three methods, namely, active braking (the front and rear axles have the same braking torque), active steering, and adjusting the swing bridge (applying a control torque between the rear body and rear axle), were adopted to analyze the effects on the <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> of ASVs through the dynamic model. The results show that active braking is conducive to the <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> of ASVs during turning, active steering can improve the <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> of ASVs during turning and passing over obstacles, and adjusting the swing bridge can improve the <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> of ASVs by changing the vehicle posture and the position of the gravity center...|$|R

40|$|A {{high-speed}} optimal trailer steering controller for a tractor–semitrailer is discussed. A {{linear model}} of a tractor–semitrailer with steered trailer axles is described, and an optimal trailer steering controller is introduced. A path-following controller is derived to minimise the path-tracking error in steady-state manoeuvres using active trailer steering. A <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> controller is introduced by adding the lateral acceleration of trailer centre of gravity as another objective in the steering controller, so as to improve <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> in transient manoeuvres.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the integration of roll moment distribution control and variable torque distribution control to improve vehicle handling and dynamics. A survey of the literature determines {{the current state of}} the art and directs the research toward undeveloped areas. The work is carried out with the racing environment in mind. The most promising control systems prove to be roll moment distribution and variable torque distribution. The control objectives are to both improve the driveability of the vehicle and ensure the stability. The driveability is measured by the ability to track a linear reference yaw rate. This aims to linearise the yaw rate response to the steering input and gives the driver predictable handling. Vehicle stability is determined by the sideslip behaviour of the vehicle, where the controllers aim to minimise the sideslip. The testing is achieved by computer simulation. An eight degree of freedom nonlinear vehicle model is developed to model the University of Leeds Formula Racing Car. Initially independent controllers are developed for both roll moment distribution and variable torque distribution to control the driveability and stability individually. The independent controllers are able to enhance the vehicle behaviour with respect to each of these goals. However, the roll moment distribution is more suited to the <b>stability</b> <b>control</b> while the variable torque distribution achieves the yaw rate tracking more effectively. The independent controllers are combined to determine any interactions between them before a final integrated control strategy is developed. This integrated control strategy integrates the variable torque distribution driveability control and the <b>roll</b> moment distribution <b>stability</b> <b>control</b> to give a complete vehicle control strategy. The integrated controller shows improved yaw rate tracking as well as the ability to stabilise the vehicle at limit handling. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an optimal}} linear quadratic control algorithm {{to improve the}} <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> of a tractor semi-trailer using active semi-trailer steering. The controller minimises {{a combination of the}} path-tracking deviation of the trailer rear end relative to the path of the hitch point (5 th wheel) and the lateral acceleration of trailer centre of gravity (CoG). First a linear vehicle model of tractor semi-trailer is constructed. Then a ‘virtual driver’ model for trailer steering control is introduced to minimise the path-tracking deviation of trailer rear end. The lateral acceleration of trailer CoG is included as a second objective of the optimal controller so as to improve <b>roll</b> <b>stability.</b> A Kalman filter with linear vehicle model is used to estimate unknown vehicle states, needed by the controller. Simulation results show that optimal control of semi-trailer steering could improve the <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> significantly during transient manoeuvres while keeping the path-tracking deviation of trailer rear end within an acceptable range...|$|R

40|$|Narrow Tilting Vehicles {{offer an}} {{opportunity}} to reduce both traffic congestion and carbon emissions by having a small road footprint, low weight, and a small frontal area. Their narrow width requires that they tilt into corners to maintain stability; this may be achieved {{by means of an}} automated tilting system. Automated tilt control systems can be classed as Steering Tilt Control (STC) in which active control of the front wheel steer angle is used to maintain <b>stability,</b> Direct Tilt <b>Control</b> (DTC) in which some form of actuator is used to exert a moment between the tilting part(s) of the vehicle and a non-tilting base, or {{a combination of the two}} (SDTC). Combined SDTC systems have the potential to offer improved performance as, unlike STC systems, they are effective at low speeds whilst offering superior transient <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> to DTC systems. However, alterations to the front wheel steer angle made by STC and SDTC systems may result in unwanted deviations from the driver's intended path. This paper uses multi-body simulations of a three-wheeled Narrow Tilting Vehicle performing an emergency lane change manoeuvre to show that the path followed by a SDTC equipped vehicle in response to a given series of steer inputs differs significantly from that followed by a DTC equipped vehicle. It is also shown that by using a revised series of steer inputs, a vehicle equipped with SDTC is able to successfully follow a similar path to one equipped with DTC, and that the <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> of the vehicle is not unduly compromised. Finally, the influence of higher DTC system gains on the SDTC system is considered.

40|$|International audienceRollover {{of heavy}} vehicle is an {{important}} road safety problem worldwide. Although rollovers are relatively rare events, they are usually deadly accidents when they occur. The <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> loss is {{the main cause of}} rollover accidents in which heavy vehicles are involved. In order to improve the <b>roll</b> <b>stability,</b> most of modern heavy vehicles are equipped with passive anti-roll bars to reduce roll motion during cornering or riding on uneven roads. However these may be not sufficient to overcome critical situations. This paper introduces the active anti-roll bars made of four electronic servo-valve hydraulic actuators, which are modelled and integrated in a yaw-roll model of a single unit heavy vehicle. The control signal is the current entering the electronic servo-valve and the output is the force generated by the hydraulic actuator. The active control design is achieved solving a linear optimal control problem based on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) approach. A comparison of several LQR controllers is provided to allow for tackling the considered multi-objective problems. Simulation results in frequency and time domains show that the use of two active anti-roll bars (front and rear axles) drastically improves the <b>roll</b> <b>stability</b> of the single unit heavy vehicle compared with the passive anti-roll bar...|$|R
