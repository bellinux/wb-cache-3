5|$|The {{original}} lighthouse, {{known as}} the <b>Round</b> <b>Tower,</b> was built after the local vicar, either John Goulden in 1764 or Walter Harris in 1799, raised a subscription amongst the local population to replace {{the light on the}} top of St Andrews Church tower. The four-storey <b>Round</b> <b>Tower</b> was built next to the church. It was taken over and improved by Trinity House in 1815, and operated until 1832, following which the top two storeys were removed.|$|E
5|$|The Upper Ward of Windsor Castle {{comprises}} {{a number}} of major buildings enclosed by the upper bailey wall, forming a central quadrangle. The State Apartments run along the north of the ward, with a range of buildings along the east wall, and the private royal apartments and the King George IV Gate to the south, with the Edward III Tower in the south-west corner. The motte and the <b>Round</b> <b>Tower</b> form the west edge of the ward. A bronze statue of Charles II on horseback sits beneath the <b>Round</b> <b>Tower.</b> Inspired by Hubert Le Sueur's statue of Charles I in London, the statue was cast by Josias Ibach in 1679, with the marble plinth featuring carvings by Grinling Gibbons. The Upper Ward adjoins the North Terrace, which overlooks the River Thames, and the East Terrace, which overlooks the gardens; both of the current terraces were constructed by Hugh May in the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Edward built further luxurious, {{self-contained}} lodgings for {{his court}} around {{the east and}} south edges of the Upper Ward, creating the modern shape of the quadrangle. The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward. In the Lower Ward, the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside. The earliest weight-driven mechanical clock in England was installed by Edward III in the <b>Round</b> <b>Tower</b> in 1354. William of Wykeham went on to build New College, Oxford and Winchester College, where the influence of Windsor Castle can easily be seen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Round</b> <b>towers</b> – The use of <b>round</b> <b>towers</b> as wall towers is {{probably}} contemporary with rectangle towers {{and may be}} mixed with rectangle towers as at St Pölten. There are many 'stadt' with right angle corners to the walls where <b>round</b> <b>towers</b> are used.|$|R
50|$|It {{is one of}} five <b>round</b> <b>towers</b> located {{around the}} county, others include St. Canice's, Tullohern, Kilree and Fertagh. The tower is {{different}} from many <b>round</b> <b>towers</b> as it has two doors. Nearby is a holy well and Castlemorres Demesne.|$|R
50|$|The layout {{is nearly}} a triangle, with <b>round</b> <b>towers</b> at each angle. The square keep {{and the main}} {{building}} of the medieval period still remain. Its conception was very imposing, with three enclosing walls, wide curtain walls, and nine <b>round</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1855, the {{businessman}} Charles Seale Hayne restored Kingswear {{to form a}} summer house, using the local architect Thomas Lidstone; the ground floor was redesigned, a conical roof added and a detached <b>round</b> <b>tower</b> constructed on the north-west side. During the Second World War, it {{was used by the}} Royal Marines and the site reinforced by a concrete blockhouse. The Landmark Trust acquired it in 1987 for use as a holiday let, restoring the ground floor of the main building to its original appearance and recreating the earlier flat, lead roof. It is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The East and West Blockhouses were Device Forts {{built by}} King Henry VIII in 1539 {{to protect the}} harbour of Milford Haven in Wales. The two blockhouses were {{positioned}} {{on either side of}} the Milford Haven Waterway in the villages of Angle and Dale respectively, overlooking the sea. The East Blockhouse was never completed, but the remains were reused as a defensive site in the Second World War. The West Blockhouse was described by contemporaries as forming a <b>round</b> <b>tower</b> with gunports, but it was demolished when West Blockhouse Fort was built on the same site in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The Minčeta Tower {{was built}} by a local builder named Nicifor Ranjina and Italian {{engineers}} sent by Pope Pius II in 1463, {{at the height of}} the Turkish threat. Originally as a strong four-sided fort, it is the most prominent point in the defensive system towards the land. The tower's name derives from the name of the Menčetić family, who owned the ground upon which the tower was built. By its height and impressive volume, the tower dominates the northwestern high part of the city and its walls. In the middle of the 15th century, around the earlier quadrilateral fort, Michelozzo built a new <b>round</b> <b>tower</b> using new warfare technique and joined it to the new system of low scarp walls. The full six-meter (20feet) thick walls of the new tower had a series of protected gun ports. The architect and sculptor Giorgio da Sebenico of Zadar continued the work on the Minčeta tower. He designed and built the high narrow <b>round</b> <b>tower</b> while the battlements are a later addition. The tower was completed in 1464 and became the symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik.|$|E
50|$|More recently, Thomas Davis faced <b>Round</b> <b>Towers</b> in the 2006 final of the Dublin AFL Division 1 and {{won by a}} {{scoreline}} of 0-10 to 0-07. Shane Smith {{played a}} prominent role, scoring a prolific 0-08 points in the game which denied <b>Round</b> <b>Towers</b> their first ever league title.|$|R

5|$|The Norse {{legacy of}} art and {{architecture}} is limited. The Christchurch at Brough of Birsay, now reduced, was the early seat of the Bishop's of Orkney. St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall is peerless {{as an example of}} Norse-era construction in Scotland and St. Magnus Church, on Egilsay retains its <b>round</b> <b>tower.</b> The iconic Lewis chessmen are the best known treasure trove and numerous finds of grave goods including brooches and weaponry such as the Scar boat burial are well-documented.|$|E
5|$|After the {{reinforcements}} {{had settled}} in, the Spanish began digging siege lines and trenches towards the confederate positions. The first attack came on 26 October when Spanish guns {{opened fire on}} the confederate defences around the <b>Round</b> <b>Tower,</b> causing considerable damage. A French force carried out a simultaneous raid of Gibraltar's harbour, burning the bomb ship. Villadarias then carried out a heavy bombardment of the San Pablo bastion using 27 guns and 16 mortars, which managed to breach it. Among the casualties were the two feuding colonels, Fox and Nugent, who were killed on successive days. At the same time, an epidemic disease broke out among the Gibraltar garrison, reducing their effective numbers to about 1,300 men.|$|E
5|$|In the Barons' War of 1215–17 {{the castle}} was {{attacked}} again, prompting further improvements in its defences. In 1220 Falkes de Breauté, who controlled many royal castles {{in the middle}} of England, demolished the Church of St Budoc to the south-east of the castle and built a moated barbican to further defend the main gate. The remaining wooden buildings were replaced in stone, including the new <b>Round</b> <b>Tower</b> which was built in 1235. King Henry III turned part of the castle into a prison, specifically for holding troublesome University clerks, and also improved the castle chapel, replacing the older barred windows with stained glass in 1243 and 1246. Due to the presence of Beaumont Palace to the north of Oxford, however, the castle never became a royal residence.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{originally}} {{comprised the}} 12th- or 13th-century hall house, which was extended in the 15th century. In the 16th century the central range {{was built to}} the south of the tower house, and new inner and outer courtyard walls were constructed. The east part of the inner courtyard wall is reduced to foundations, but the base of a <b>round</b> <b>tower</b> and a porter's lodge survive. To the west, the inner courtyard wall remains, enclosing the former service courtyard, which comprises a brewery and bakehouse, with ovens. The east range was added in the 17th century, along the south edge of the outer courtyard. The castle was originally approached from the north, with the entrance moved to the west, along with the 17th-century gate, when the Aberdour railway line was constructed in 1890.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} by the Campbells in the late 15th century, replacing an earlier <b>round</b> <b>tower</b> in the east corner. It {{takes the form of}} a four-storey harled tower house, with the entrance passage running through half the vaulted basement, the other half forming guard rooms with arrow slits facing the gate. The present approach to the gate is by a stone stair, replacing an earlier drawbridge. The tower was remodelled in the 18th century to provide reception rooms and a private suite. The dormer windows at the top are capped by the pediments from the 1725 house (see below), and bear the date, the Campbell arms, and the initials AEC and DLC, for Aeneas Campbell, 11th Captain, and his wife Dame Lilias. The pediments were moved here during the 1903 restoration works.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Christianity into Scotland from Ireland from {{the sixth century}} led {{to the construction of}} basic masonry-built churches, beginning on the west coast and islands. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings. However, from the eighth century, more sophisticated buildings emerged. Early Romanesque ashlar masonry produced block-built stone buildings, like the eleventh century <b>round</b> <b>tower</b> at Brechin Cathedral and the square towers of Dunblane Cathedral and The Church of St Rule.|$|E

5|$|The {{west side}} of the walls include nine towers, rising upwards towards the {{south-west}} corner. Two of the towers were significantly affected by 19th-century developments; one was converted into an entrance way for the Bangor Road in 1827, whilst another suffered a deep fissure caused by subsidence from the excavation of the Chester to Holyhead railway tunnel in 1845, and had to be underpinned in 1963. One of the remaining merlons on this stretch of the walls' battlements has a stone finial on top, a design originally used along all of the town walls. The western wall originally extended out to the river Conwy itself, ending in a <b>round</b> <b>tower,</b> but this has since been lost; a similar spur arrangement was seen at Chester and Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Balfour {{also gave}} the island its most {{noticeable}} landmark when he recruited an Edinburgh architect, David Bryce, to transform Cliffdale House into the Scottish Baronial Balfour Castle. Other buildings he {{added to the}} island include the porter's lodge (now a public house called The Gatehouse), a water mill, a school, and a gasworks that remained operational until the 1920s. The gasworks {{is in the form}} of a <b>round</b> <b>tower</b> with a corbelled parapet of red brick and carved stones—including one possibly removed from Noltland Castle on Westray, which is inscribed with the year 1725. The structure appears to be fortified, in accordance with Balfour's intention to give the village a medieval appearance. David Balfour was also responsible for the construction of Mill Dam, a wetland which was once the water supply for the mill and is now an RSPB nature reserve.|$|E
5|$|Bruce Castle {{is now a}} museum, {{holding the}} {{archives}} of the London Borough of Haringey, and housing a permanent exhibition on the past, present and future of Haringey and its predecessor boroughs, and temporary displays {{on the history of the}} area. Other exhibits include an exhibition on Rowland Hill and postal history, a significant collection of early photography, a collection of historic manorial documents and court rolls related to the area, and one of the few copies available for public reading of the Spurs Opus, the complete history of Tottenham Hotspur. In 1949, the building was Grade I listed; the <b>round</b> <b>tower</b> was separately Grade I listed at the same time, and the 17th-century southern and western boundary walls of the park were Grade II listed in 1974. In 1969 the castle became home to the regimental museum of the Middlesex Regiment whose collection was subsequently transferred to the National Army Museum.|$|E

5|$|The two-storey west range {{contains}} the main entrance, which enters the courtyard via an arched passage. Above the outside gate are spaces where armorial panels were once displayed. The windows on this front, {{larger than the}} original ones in the tower house, had iron grilles, and small gun holes beneath them. Beside the entrance was a kitchen, and above, a larger hall and drawing room. Only {{the western part of}} the three-storey north range was completed, although the Lindsays planned to complete the courtyard. This range had another kitchen, as well as private chambers within the <b>round</b> <b>tower</b> at the north-west corner. It was entered via a stair turret in the courtyard, fragments of which remain, including parts of an intricately carved door surround. Only the foundations of the east and south buildings remain, which probably contained a bakehouse and stables.|$|E
5|$|During the Queen's tenure {{much has}} been done, not only to restore and {{maintain}} {{the fabric of the}} building, but also to transform it into a major British tourist attraction, containing {{a significant portion of the}} Royal Collection of art, which is managed from Windsor. Archaeological work has continued at the castle, following on from limited investigations in the 1970s, the work on the <b>Round</b> <b>Tower</b> from 1988–92 and the investigations following the 1992 fire. During 2007, 993,000 tourists visited the castle. This has had to be achieved in co-ordination with security issues and the castle's role as a working royal palace. In late 2011 two large water turbines were installed upstream of the castle on the River Thames to provide hydroelectric power to the castle and the surrounding estate. In April 2016 it was announced that the Royal Collection Trust is to fund a £27m project that will reinstate the original entrance hall of the castle to visitors, as well as a new cafe that will be housed in the 14th Century undercroft. The project will be completed at the end of 2018, and will include a visitor centre and a dedicated learning centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Christianity into Scotland from Ireland, from the sixth century, {{led to the}} construction of basic masonry-built churches beginning on the west coast and islands. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings. However, from the eighth century, more sophisticated buildings emerged. Early Romanesque ashlar masonry produced block-built stone buildings, like the eleventh century <b>round</b> <b>tower</b> at Brechin Cathedral and the square towers of Dunblane Cathedral and The Church of St Rule. After the eleventh century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing that can be seen in corbelling, buttressing, lintels and arching. At the same time there was increasing influences from English and continental European designs, such as the Romanesque chevron pattern detailing on the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral, and the thirteenth century East-end of Elgin Cathedral, which incorporated typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery. In the fifteenth century continental builders are known to have been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. The interiors of churches were often elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, created in the mid-fifteenth century, elaborately depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style. Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas. The early sixteenth century saw crown steeples built on churches with royal connections, symbolising imperial monarchy, as at St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh.|$|E
