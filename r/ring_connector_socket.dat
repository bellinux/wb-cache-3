50|$|The XJACK was {{originally}} used in modem and network cards, {{to attach a}} standard RJ11 or 8P8C plug directly to the PC card. They do not require a separate dongle, which could be lost or misplaced, and {{do not need to}} be removed from the laptop when travelling. An alternative approach is to use larger type III cards with a regular modular <b>connector</b> <b>socket,</b> but this approach requires more space.|$|R
50|$|The 16-bit AT bus slot {{originally}} {{used two}} standard edge <b>connector</b> <b>sockets</b> in early IBM PC/AT machines. However, with {{the popularity of}} the AT-architecture and the 16-bit ISA bus, manufacturers introduced specialized 98-pin connectors that integrated the two sockets into one unit. These can be found in almost every AT-class PC manufactured after the mid-1980s. The ISA slot connector is typically black (distinguishing it from the brown EISA connectors and white PCI connectors).|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{improve the}} {{surgical}} results of aortic dissection, {{we used a}} novel vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connector</b> for anastomosis. MethodsThe vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connector</b> is a titanic ring used as a stent in the vascular graft to achieve a quick, blood-sealed, and sutureless anastomosis. From November 2007 to December 2008, 19 consecutive patients (age range 36 – 77 years; 16 male and 3 female) with aortic dissection underwent open surgery. All patients received aortic reconstruction with vascular grafts (including 5 cases of arch replacement). The combined procedures were 5 Bentall and 4 {{coronary artery bypass graft}} operations. ResultsThere were no significant blood leaks from the anastomotic sites. The time required for each anastomosis was 1 to 2 minutes. All patients were discharged uneventfully and are still doing well after a follow-up period of 1 to 12 months. ConclusionThe vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connector</b> may improve the early surgical results of aortic dissection by reducing both the time for anastomosis and the risk of bleeding and may be an alternative technique for aortic reconstruction. Its usefulness in the routine treatment of aortic dissection warrants further evaluation...|$|R
50|$|To {{make the}} printer cheap {{enough to be}} {{included}} with every PCW, Amstrad placed {{the majority of its}} drive electronics inside the PCW cabinet. The printer case contained only electromechanical components and high current driver electronics; its power was supplied via a coaxial power <b>connector</b> <b>socket</b> on the monitor casing, and rather than using a traditional parallel interface, pin and motor signals were connected directly by a 34-wire ribbon cable to an 8041 microcontroller on the PCW's mainboard.|$|R
5000|$|Edge <b>connector</b> <b>sockets</b> {{consist of}} a plastic [...] "box" [...] open on one side, with pins on one or both side(s) of the longer edges, sprung to push {{into the middle of}} the open center. Connectors are often keyed to ensure the correct {{polarity}}, and may contain bumps or notches both for polarity and to ensure that the wrong type of device is not inserted. The socket's width is chosen to fit to the thickness of the connecting PCB.|$|R
50|$|Note the {{connections}} to the common ground bus from sockets 2 (top left), 19 (center bottom row), 22, 24, 26, 30, and 40 on all connectors. Also note (enlarged detail, bottom, looking from {{the opposite side of}} the <b>connector)</b> that <b>socket</b> 34 of the blue connector does not contact any conductor but unlike socket 34 of the other two connectors, it does connect to the common ground bus. On the gray <b>connector,</b> note that <b>socket</b> 28 is completely missing, so that pin 28 of the drive attached to the gray connector will be open. On the black <b>connector,</b> <b>sockets</b> 28 and 34 are completely normal, so that pins 28 and 34 of the drive attached to the black connector will be connected to the cable. Pin 28 of the black drive reaches pin 28 of the host receptacle but not pin 28 of the gray drive, while pin 34 of the black drive reaches pin 34 of the gray drive but not pin 34 of the host. Instead, pin 34 of the host is grounded.|$|R

50|$|Plug and <b>socket</b> <b>connectors</b> {{are usually}} {{made up of}} a male plug (typically pin contacts) and a female {{receptacle}} (typically socket contacts), although hermaphroditic connectors exist, such as the original IBM token <b>ring</b> LAN <b>connector.</b> Plugs generally have one or more pins or prongs that are inserted into openings in the mating socket. The connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit. When working with multi-pin connectors, it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin.|$|R
50|$|A typical TAE {{installation}} is a multi-socket {{junction box}} {{with at least}} one N connector and one F <b>connector</b> <b>socket</b> in the box, but having usually two N and one F connector. Up to three N connectors are possible. Network service enters the box and connects to pins 1 and 2 on the right-most N connector. Service is daisy-chained from pins 5 and 6 on the N connector to pins 1 and 2 on the next N connector to the left. The F connector is attached to pins 5 and 6 on the last N connector {{at the end of the}} chain.|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{observed}} midterm {{results of}} vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connectors</b> in surgery for aortic dissection. MethodsVascular <b>ring</b> <b>connectors</b> {{were used as}} stents in vascular grafts to achieve quick, sutureless anastomoses. Tapes were used to secure ringed vascular grafts from outside the aorta. ResultsFrom November 2007 to February 2011, 113 consecutive patients with aortic dissection, except 3 in preoperative profound shock, underwent open surgery. All underwent aortic reconstruction with vascular grafts and vascular ring connectors: ascending aorta in 29, descending thoracic aorta in 20, distal hemiarch plus descending thoracic aorta in 22, total arch in 14, ascending aorta plus total arch in 12, total arch plus descending thoracic aorta in 7, ascending aorta plus arch plus descending thoracic aorta in 8, and thoracoabdominal aorta in 1. Concomitant operations were 19 Bentall procedures, 14 coronary bypasses, 2 mitral valve replacements, 1 aortic valve replacement, and 1 heart transplant. We used sternotomy to repair 77 % of type B dissections, 83 % with elephant trunks. Time to extubation was 9. 0 ± 6. 2 hours. Average blood loss was 345 ± 195 mL. Half the patients needed no blood transfusion. In-hospital mortality was 5. 3 %; late mortality was 2. 7 %. ConclusionsUse of vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connectors</b> in surgical repair for aortic dissection might reduce risks and improve early and midterm results. With addition of elephant trunk, most type B dissections could be repaired through sternotomy. With the improved surgical results, we can suggest open repair for most uncomplicated type B dissections; however, more long-term follow-up is needed...|$|R

The IBM token <b>ring</b> <b>connector</b> was another widespread example, {{but it has}} become obsolete and is being phased out. The General Radio Corporation (GenRad) developed a hermaphroditic coaxial radio frequency connector often called the [...] "GR connector".|$|R
50|$|The Rhythm 55 can not {{interface}} with other instruments (e.g. to synchronize its tempo with another machine). The Rhythm 55 has a mono audio output, available on two unbalanced phone <b>connector</b> sockets—one <b>socket</b> is high impedance, the other low impedance.|$|R
50|$|Most {{models of}} PCW were bundled with a 9-pin {{dot matrix printer}} mechanism, with the later 9512 and 9512+ models using a {{daisywheel}} (with a different cable; the printers were not interchangeable with the dot matrix models). These PCW printers could not, of course, be used on other computers, and the original PCW lacked a then-standard Centronics printer port. Instead, the Z80 bus and video signals were brought to an edge <b>connector</b> <b>socket</b> {{at the back of}} the cabinet. Many accessories including parallel and serial ports were produced for this interface. Some of the later models included a built-in parallel port; these could be bundled with either the dedicated Amstrad printer, or a Canon Bubblejet model.|$|R

The DR-110 has a 10kΩ impedance unbalanced mono audio output, available on an ¼" [...] phone <b>connector</b> <b>socket.</b> This output can be plugged into a keyboard amplifier or PA system. The socket was configured as the [...] "Roland P-bus", which meant {{it also could}} be used as a simultaneous audio input, the input source being mixed with the output signal.
