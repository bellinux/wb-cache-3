40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} phenomenon of budgeting practices in the Tanzanian Central Government. It seeks to understand how budgeting systems under the New Public Management (NPM), World Bank- and IMF-exhorted systems were adopted and implemented. There were several motives for this research: the significance of budgeting in financial management, the sparsity of empirical studies on NPM in developing countries, and a call for {{an understanding of the}} local contexts of the country and an evaluation of the reforms themselves. Additionally, the complexity of NPM reforms and the mixed results of previous empirical studies, indicated the need for a more appropriate methodology. The study adopts interpretive research and executes a grounded theory strategy. It develops a substantive grounded theory on budgeting practices and a formal grounded theory on accounting changes in organizations (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss, 1987). Fieldwork was undertaken in three Tanzanian Ministries. Struggling for conformance is the central phenomenon of the substantive and the formal grounded theory. The substantive grounded theory explained a process through which the Tanzanian Central Government actors were determined to implement budgetary reforms, despite difficulties. Struggling for conformance was illustrated by the establishment of rhetorically applied (<b>rhetorical)</b> <b>rules</b> and regulations, followed by budgeting attempts and games in their implementation, due to the uncertain environment, complex budgeting systems, the donors? influence, and cultural and administrative practices. The process of struggling for conformance had positive and negative impacts on budgeting operations and budgeting allocations. The formal grounded theory proposes that organizations adopt and implement accounting changes in order to achieve legitimacy, efficiency and self-interests. <b>Rhetorical</b> <b>rules</b> on accounting changes are established and implemented through accounting attempts and games, which may reveal the coexistence of instrumental and ceremonial aspects of accounting (Covaleski and Dirsmith, 1991), and even fulfill individual, rather than organizational, interests (strategic deterioration). Struggling for conformance is caused by conflicting and enabling power, complex rules, and a fragmented environment. Its consequences reflect the extent of the acquisition of efficiency and legitimacy. This research contributes to the limited amount of empirical accounting research on NPM in developing countries, to grounded theory and interpretive accounting research, and to the expansion of New Institutional Sociology. It further provides a framework of struggling for conformance, which produces possible explanations for the complexities of budgetary and NPM reforms, the adoption and implementation of accounting changes in organizations, and loose coupling...|$|R

The resulting ‘Struggling for Conformance’ led to the establishment of <b>rhetorical</b> <b>rules</b> and regulations; manipulation of the measurement of performance and the playing of budgeting games.

The passages from Menegaldus which are here considered can be divided in two main fields: the wide employment of quotations from other auctores (here e. g.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to analyze how and with what kind of means {{election}} posters can persuade. The material we used were posters of Swedish parliament political parties from the campaign before the parliament election in September 2006. Together we used 94 posters of 6 six political parties. For the analysis we got inspiration of rhetoric, because of two reasons. The first reason was that rhetoric and election posters have got the same purpose: to persuade. Because of that we thought that they should use the same means of persuading. The second reason was that rhetoric could help us to get structure in our analysis. We analyzed {{different aspects of the}} posters: 1. ways of argumentation, 2. disposition and structure, 3. language and style, 4. emotional persuading, and finally 5. layout.

40|$|I have {{demonstrated}} {{in a series}} of articles that it is possible to uncover the arrangement of Augustine's Nativity sermons in a different manner than by looking at the traditional <b>rhetorical</b> <b>rules.</b> Thus the parts into which the texts of thes sermons are divided can be identified by using a twofold method, in which the results of an analysis of the use of language (e. g. changes in sentence type, the use of various kinds of particles and unusual word and constituent order, often indicative of poetic use of language) and the results of an analysis of the use of Scripture (changes in quoted or referenced verses or clusters of verses from Scripture) support each other. On the basis of this twofold method, which is comparatively easy to apply and verify, it has been possible to determine divisions of sermons into four, three and five parts. The division into four parts (in ss. 186 and 187) corresponds to the division which Augustine himself proposes in the fourth book of doctr. chr. He says nothing about divisions into three and five parts, but the sermons in which these are used appear chaotic and difficult to understand if the arrangement is not recognized. Using the twofold method it has been possible to determine that ss. 189 and 194 consist of five parts. This means that - depsite marked differences in composition - they have the same coherent structure and a clear argument, representing a strategy in which Augustine moves from the introduction, through a preparation for a didactic moment, to this didactic moment itself, followed by a supporting part and, finally, a conclusion. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} I propose to discuss John Stewart of Baldynneis's version of Ludovico Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso. Written between 1585 and 1589, this work precedes John Harington’s English translation, and was {{composed}} {{at the court}} of James VI of Scotland. It is a much abridged and truncated translation; but what is more important is that in undertaking this work the poet was entering a literary project conceived by his king, kinsman and dedicatee. Recently ascended the throne, James immediately showed {{a keen interest in}} poetic production and in literary theory, promoting a vernacular revival through a group of poets who would thereafter be grouped by modern critics under the common denomination of Castalians. With his Reulis and Cautelis (1584), James was setting down and proposing to his courtiers and fellow-poets a series of norms concerning poetic composition, stylistic and <b>rhetorical</b> <b>rules,</b> the choice of topics and topoi, and the correct precepts for a harmonious execution of the poetic work. John Stewart’s sense of duty towards his king (possibly coupled with his precarious position at court) induced him to obey perhaps supinely the king’s literary precepts, even when this meant a radical move away from Ariosto’s original intentions. Torn between literary and political authority, Stewart did choose Ariosto as a model to propose to his fellow poets, but through his abbregement of the original work he improved on it, mainly by means of drawing out the best in Ariosto and eliminating the bad, and in so doing he followed to the letter the king’s precepts on the point. The poet keeps the king as his constant interlocutor, and though such devices as a reiterated modesty topos proclaims its author’s active participation in the king’s project. Stewart finds in James’s precepts a guide to reformulate Ariosto’s matter according to poetic principles that are uniquely national...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} on the theory and {{practice}} of comic sexual euphemism in Renaissance France and England. The term ‘comic sexual euphemism’ means the use of non-literal descriptions for sexual topics for the purposes of comedy, similar to an innuendo or double-entendre. Crucially, instances are often more explicit than straightforward literal statement, so fail to be euphemistic. I use ancient, early modern, and modern theory, as well as my own theoretical insights, and apply this to three types of Renaissance text: texts associated with the court from England and France, medical texts from France and their English translation, and theatre from England and France. Primary authors include Baldesar Castiglione, Pierre de Brantôme, Sir John Harington (who translated Ludovico Ariosto into English – Ariosto is also translated into French by Jean Martin), Laurent Joubert, Jacques Ferrand (translated into English by Edmund Chilmead), Thomas Middleton, Ben Jonson, Edward Sharpham, John Marston, and Pierre de Troterel. At the court of both countries a dangerous line was walked between protecting women and gossiping about them, between proving yourself witty regarding sexual material and going too far. In the world of French medicine, where you might expect professional and clinical language, there is instead a trend towards outrageous sexual humour. As at court, if deemed to have exceeded social norms, this could get writers into trouble. The stage was in some ways a safer environment in which to use comic sexual euphemism, as it was expected more in comic drama. This does not, however, lessen how vibrant and multi-faceted such language could be in early modern drama. Interestingly, similar imagery is found across texts and genres. In this period overall there was a tension between the <b>rhetorical</b> <b>rules</b> which forbid the discussion of the sexually obscene and the clear delight writers took in breaking these.

40|$|The {{premise of}} Helen Abbott's study is intriguing: {{to show that}} Baudelaire and Mallarmé ‘are profoundly aware of the {{aesthetic}} value of using one's voice through poetry by drawing on the heritage of both music and oratory’ (p. 226). Her pertinent discussion of nineteenth-century prosodic and <b>rhetorical</b> <b>rules</b> sets the scene for an interesting rehabilitation of actio (which privileges voice and immediacy of effect) and memoria (memory and longevity of effect) — ancient rhetorical tropes that she fruitfully applies to Baudelaire's and Mallarme's works to assess the many vocal and musical resonances therein. These resonances are subsequently explored in a section on the body, which compares Baudelaire's mannered poetic recitations with Mallarmé's more understated diction and draws on neuroscience to consider the notion of ‘rhythmic sensation’, strategies of vocalization and verbalization based on the interstitial ‘sensory’ relationships between words rather than on their inherent meanings. There then follows a subtle account {{of the implications of}} conversational exchange, especially with regard to both poets' productive reappropriation of the ‘foreign’ voice. A trenchant final section on music convincingly argues that ‘instrumental music’ is the perfect metaphor for their poetry because it frees this genre from the dual bonds of semantics and subjectivity. Abbott covers much fascinating uncharted territory, supported by a number of insightful close readings, of which ‘Portraits de maîtresses’ and ‘Un coup de dès’ stand out as particular highlights. The very strength of Abbott's study, however — its innovative and wide-ranging methodology — is also, paradoxically, its weakness, for it invites us as readers to explore Baudelaire's and Mallarmé's œuvres in directions that are undeniably new and exciting, but which for that very reason also risk making us lose sight of some of the core tenets of their poetic theory. No doubt mindful of the lessons of post-structuralism and obviously anxious to stay clear of excessive authorial intentionality and overprescriptive theories, Abbot, unfortunately, at times shifts the balance of power too far from the poets themselves towards a largely unspecified reader. True, both poets were prepared — indeed were willing — to concede significant interpretative autonomy to their readers, but not to the extent of relinquishing that essential degree of authorial control that their uncompromising and rigorously conceived aesthetic agendas demanded. Abbott's claims that ‘it {{is not a question of}} any great import’ (p. 221) whether or not their poetry should be read out loud, or that ‘neither poet specifies precisely what kind of reader he envisages for his poetry’ (p. 226), thus seem somewhat hasty, especially in the light of the public and private modes of reading meticulously theorized by Mallarmé in his notes on ‘le Livre’ and ‘Le Mystère dans les Lettres’ and Baudelaire's famous ethical injunction to his ‘Hypocrite lecteur’. Abbott's study, though a welcome addition to Baudelaire and Mallarmé criticism, is thus perhaps even more valuable as a blueprint for a promising new type of interdisciplinary methodology that might selectively be applied to other major poets or movements...|$|R

Autor raspravlja o razvitku isupostojanju antikvarnih studija i likovnih umjetnosti do vremena oko sredine 15. stoljeća. Prepoznaje tri polja nadahnuća za umjetnike prije 1450. g., a potom raspravlja o temeljnim zakonitostima gradnje njihova likovnog jezika na temelju izravnog ili neizravnog poznavanja antičkih arhetipova s talijanskog tla. Autor pritom nudi raspravu o mogućim rimskim izvorima za neka djela Jurja Dalmatinca te predlaže produbljivanje istraživanja veza ovoga umjetnika i umjetničkih ambijenata srednje Italije. The text {{discusses}} {{the perception of}} antique monuments in Croatian fifteenth-century art. The author posits {{as a basis for}} this perception the development of Italian humanism, especially in view of the inquiry into sense perception undertaken by the early humanists: Bruni, Vergerio and Chrysoloras, who are seen as precursors to the theorists of visuality (Alberti). These procedures by the humanists and men-of-letters, as already shown by Ernst Gombrich, went hand in hand with an active study of antiquity by artists. The text, therefore, wishes to explore the impact of the archetypes of Roman antiquities on the perception and invention of the early Renaissance artists. Following earlier philological research (Fisković, Kokole), the author suggests three sources of influence for artists before 1450. These were, respectively, to respect the continuity of the Gothic art; to break the continuity by means of regression and the study of antique monuments; to combine the two. Using as examples three sculptures from Giorgio da Sebenico 2 ̆ 7 s workshop (the Hercules from the cathedral of Šibenik; the angel at the portal of the church of St Augustine and the cavalier from Loggia dei Mercanti in Ancona), the author examines the ways of imitating and translating these influences into an authentic artistic invention. The antique sculpture of Dioscorus at the Roman Quirinal, which had been represented by Pisanello, Gozzoli and Mantegna, is taken as a possible source for the angel of Ancona. The procedure of taking over a source and transposing it was practised by earlier Florentine artists, such as Ghiberti, whose works have been identified as a model for Dalmatian artists. The statue of the medieval cavalier in Ancona is similar in this respect. That work shows the influence a local environment exerts on the interpretation of antiquities, since the myth of Ciriaco of Ancona concerning the missing Traianus 2 ̆ 7 s statue from the town 2 ̆ 7 s triumphal arch is adjusted to fit a modern interpretation in the Renaissance artwork. The discussion on the impact of Alberti 2 ̆ 7 s remarks on historia is compounded by formulations from De imitatione, a treatise by Alberti 2 ̆ 7 s master and a distinguished professor of rhetoric in northern Italy, Gasparino Barzizza. The treatise points out that the art of rhetorical imitation can be reduced to Quintilian 2 ̆ 7 s fourfold division of solecisms. These <b>rhetorical</b> <b>rules</b> are shown to contain analogies with the procedures used by the fifteenth-century artists, and are observable also in the work of Giorgio da Sebenico as a principal harbinger of changes in the Dalmatian art {{of the first half of}} the fifteenth century. It is therefore argued that this master has taken part in conceptualizing and solving central problems of the humanist concepts of imitation and invention...|$|R

Since the 20 th century, {{there have been many}} invaluable research results among the definition, classification, <b>rhetorical</b> effects and <b>rules</b> of usage of analogy as a figure of speech in modern Chinese. Their research methods and frameworks, however, are different and cause obstructions of learning and further studies. In order to clear the problem, this study aims at {{examining the}} use of analogy as a figure of speech in modern Chinese. The thesis consists of 6 chapters. Chapter 1 is an introduction which outlines the background, objectives, major points and methodology of the research. Chapter 2 is a literature review. It points out different contents of related researches since the 20 th century and shows the discrepancy between different research results. Nowadays, the definition, classification, <b>rhetorical</b> effects, <b>rules</b> of usage and comparison with other figures of speech were common categories of doing research in analogy as a figure of speech in modern Chinese. However, there are wide discrepancies between different research results in their definition and classification. Chapter 3 introduces a new definition of analogy. “Analogy is a figure of speech that under a specific context, the writer or the speaker uses one or more understandable or attractive things to express one or more non-understandable or unattractive things to produce more understandable or attractive rhetorical effects where the two or more things are different but similar in properties. ” This new definition is illustrated after reviewing different definitions in other researches and after examining a sufficient amount of texts. Chapter 4 unifies the classification of analogy as a figure of speech. 60 kinds of analogy as a figure of speech are found presently, but their contents are seriously overlapping. A very detailed classification is illustrated in this chapter. The overlapping situation can be avoided by creating sub-groups in this system. Two versions were created. The detailed version {{can be used as a}} reference by linguistics experts whereas the simple version can be used for reference by secondary school students or the general public. Chapter 5 organizes and classifies the rhetorical effects and the rules of usage of analogy as a figure of speech. Using simple, concrete or familiar things to express difficult, abstract and unfamiliar things are conservative rules of usage. It helps to create an easy, concrete or familiar feeling. Using lifelike, bright or associated things to express ordinary, mediocre or dull things are aggressive rules of usage. It helps to create a lifelike, bright or unforgettable feeling. Chapter 6 is a conclusion which summarizes the findings and provides suggestions on researches in other figures of speech. This chapter states that research results of other figures of speech may also have discrepancies. Therefore, the methodology and finding of this study can be used as reference for other researches of other figures of speech. published_or_final_versionChineseMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Głównym celem książki jest rekonstrukcja teorii retorycznej, wyłożonej przez Bartłomieja Keckermanna (1572 - 1609), profesora filozofii w Gdańskim Gimnazjum Akademickim, w obszernym traktacie pod tytułem System retoryki (Systema rhetoricae, Hanau 1608). Opierając się na przejrzystej metodzie, u której podstaw leżała zasada podziału dychotomicznego, wywiedziona wprost z pism logicznych Arystotelesa (Organonu), Keckermann przeprowadził systematyzację sztuki przemawiania. Dzięki twórczemu wykorzystaniu koncepcji Stagiryty, Cycerona i Kwintyliana, a także współczesnych sobie teoretyków wymowy, głównie Rudolfa Agricoli, Erazma z Rotterdamu, Filipa Melanchtona i Piotra Ramusa, stworzył on summę renesansowej wiedzy o retoryce. Retoryka ujmowana paradoksalnie (oksymoronicznie) jako antystrofa dialektyki, ukazująca się nam w figuratywnym przebraniu wiernej służebnicy albo nieodłącznej, choć często niepożądanej, towarzyszki logiki (filozofii), została skrojona na miarę ludzkich zdolności i słabości. Jako względnie autonomiczna forma racjonalności (a więc zgodnie z intencją Arystotelesa) i model dyskursywności zbudowany wokół amplifikacji i figuratywności (czyli zgodnie z koncepcją Keckermanna) stanowi apologię niemal powszechnej niekonkluzywności dyskursu, sprzeciwu wobec supremacji intelektu w dziedzinie praktyk sensotwórczych i zgody na brak ostatecznego wyjaśnienia. Mimo tego ma być ona lekarstwem uśmierzającym chroniczną niepewność poznania i środkiem przynoszącym wytchnienie podczas gorączkowego poszukiwania sensu. Dlatego w zależności od potrzeb chwili i celu perswazji retoryka staje się lekarką serc i dusz ludzkich, twórczynią zmysłowych i wielobarwnych obrazów rzeczywistości, a także rewelatorką prawd doskonale już znanych. Za każdym razem zjawia się przed nami pod postacią figury przekształcającej prostą mowę litery w wieloznaczną sekwencję znaków, symboli i obrazów. Przemawiając we własnym imieniu na gruncie teorii wymowy (nawet tej najbardziej metodycznej i usystematyzowanej), retoryka nie może mówić inaczej, jak tylko retorycznie, ożywiając zastygłe w dyskursie toposy i budząc uśpione w języku figury. The main aim of {{the book}} is to {{reconstruct}} the rhetorical theory discussed by Bartholomew Keckermann (1572 - 1609), a professor of philosophy at the Academic Gymnasium Danzig, in a large textbook entitled Systema rhetoricae, in quo artis praecepta plane et methodice traduntur et tota simul ratio studii eloquentiae tam quoad epistolas et colloquia familiaria, quam quoad orationes conformatur modusque ostenditur et oratores dextre legendi et resolvendi, denique locos communes oratorios concinnandi (The system of rhetoric, in which the rules of art are given precisely and methodologically and the whole program of eloquence study in regard to both letters and familiar colloquies is created; in which the principles of proper reading and discussing the orators and systematizing the rhetorical commonplaces are explicated, Hanau 1608). The humanist, interested in a logical and epistemological (re) interpretation of Aristotle’s philosophy, attempted a systematization of the art of eloquence. As the result, he created a Renaissance summa of the knowledge on rhetoric consisting of two parts, six volumes, seventy eight chapters, seven hundred twenty pages (without an extensive index of terms). The textbook was written with precise definitions, dichotomous divisions, terminological distinctions, binary sub-divisions and divisions of sub-divisions, often multiplicated beyond necessity. The foundation of Keckermann’s approach, based on the method derived from Aristotle’s logic (Organon), was the rule of dichotomous division, which allowed him to present a structured (methodological) and consistent (systematic) rhetorical theory. While discussing the most important terms and concepts concerning the art of speech, from invention to rhetorical performance, and referring to the concepts for a more complete description of Keckermann’s theoretical thoughts, I concentrate on what the humanist defines as general rhetoric (as opposed to the specific, like ecclesiastical eloquence). His theory constitutes a collection of abstract rules for constructing a text that preserve their functionality and analytical usefulness regardless of the historically and culturally determined language of their description. The reconstruction of a given theory, including a rhetorical one, is not as much a matter of its precise (re) transcription, as an art of interpretation - creative to a certain extent. For this reason, I do not reconstruct Keckermann’s terms, definitions, and divisions word-by-word, but have chosen those which give a full flavour of the humanist’s thoughts on the nature and functions of rhetoric. In terms of interpretative practice, this means that I enumerate and discuss in detail, for instance, all the forms of metonymy or eight figures of irony distinguished by Keckermann, and I deliberately omit numerous types of allegorical speech or epithet. Nevertheless, these forms of discourse might prove fruitful for studies in early modern theories of figurativity. A detailed analysis of some rhetorical figures carefully following Keckermann’s observations demonstrates how logical categories diffuse into the exposition on the forms of speech in his textbook. This both analytical and interpretative strategy makes it possible, on the one hand, to describe and explain a “deformation” of meaning constitutive for those figures, and, on the other hand, to point out a clear principle of their ordering. Thus, by analyzing a given argumentative strategy (like the topos of similarity or opposition) or a linguistic formula (the already mentioned metonymy or irony), I depict Keckermann’s rhetorical theory as a coherent and thoroughly considered whole. I perceive the history of rhetoric as the history of ideas. Rhetoric is inseparably connected with thinking about creating a discourse in terms that sometimes hide behind various tropes and rhetorical figures. Using many rhetorical devices, the rhetors presented the art of persuasion as a fully autonomous discipline. The essence of a critical reconstruction of eloquence is, firstly, an attempt to overcome the limitations that stem from the opposition between historical and descriptive rhetoric, between a static description and genetic explication, between synchrony and diachrony. This is done by means of a more detailed re-contextualization of the term analyzed, one that allows for its (re) interpretation depending on the changing historical context and the rhetorical tradition. The ideas brought to life by humanists’ works had their own term-related genealogies that require careful reconstruction, an interpretative work revealing changes of understanding over time. Secondly, the project is founded in the theory that eloquence is a kind of rhetorical practice, so as such it can be interpreted by terms which explain and arrange (rhetorical analysis of the theoretical discourse of eloquence). Human beings’ immersion in language (and thus in rhetoric) results in the fact that we can talk about logical topoi only using words. Keckermann’s discussion of eloquence is guided by Aristotle’s famous statement that “rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic” (Rhetoric 1354 a). Its enigmatic character and openly figurative form has for many centuries provided scholars with material for numerous treatises. This formula, in my opinion, accurately and concisely flags the main problem with Keckermann’s rhetorical system. It is an attempt to describe most precisely and in the greatest detail the relations between two “trivial” arts, rhetoric and dialectic (as well as philosophy as such), distinguishing the main object for each of the disciplines, and drawing a clear dividing line between them. The issue of the connection between rhetoric and logic organizes Keckermann’s discussion of the precepts of rhetorical invention and disposition. These precepts are shaped to a large extent by logic (analysis and typology of topics, logical topoi, argumentative schemes, order of arguments and parts of speech). Rhetorical analysis of Aristotle’s ambiguous formula demonstrates that {{it turns out to be}} paradoxically the combination of affirmation and negation, similarity and difference, metaphor and irony. While discussing Keckermann’s basic definitions, divisions and concepts, I conserve his order of discourse presentation, which reflects the traditional parts of eloquence that normally appear after one another. For that reason, after a short introduction in which I present the circumstances surrounding the writing of the humanist’s treatise and the possible interpretations of Aristotle’s formula about “the counterpart of dialectic,” I discuss the precepts of invention (application of topoi and logical categories for analyzing a given speech topic, the <b>rules</b> of <b>rhetorical</b> argumentation, amplification strategies), disposition (various ways of ordering speech and making it coherent), elocution (the doctrine on tropes, problems of figurative language, issue of parrhesia), art of memory (intellectual and sensory tools for remembering, creating mnemonic places and images) and rhetorical performance (instructions for using voice and gesture). In the conclusion of my work, I attempt to present Keckermann’s rhetorical theory as a consistent, yet open and unconcluded whole, which I describe in three categories close to any Aristotle-oriented humanist’s heart and mind: imitation (mimesis), language (semiosis) and system (mathesis). Keckermann, drawing inspiration from Stagirite’s philosophy and its early-modern interpretations, introduced the idea of rhetorical form into the dictionary of terms describing the eloquence. He combined this form with two skills appropriate only to rhetoric – amplification and figurativity. Both of them are foolproof strategies for artistic “processing” of the argumentative and lexical matter previously collected by|$|R
