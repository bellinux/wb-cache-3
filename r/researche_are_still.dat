In case of hypothyroidism we observed a moderate anemia (MPV slight under 36 % in most of cases) with normochromic-nirmocitary or slight normochrome-macrocitary pattern. Eritrocite morphology was characteristic to a nonregenerative anemia. Reticulocite count remain low. We observe the absence of polychromasia.

In all these cases, therapy is preventive and receive appropriate according to age and needs. Their dose increases in case of injuries or extensive bleeding. Conclusion: Early prophylactic use of clotting factors with severe haemophilia is gaining acceptance as a way to prevent pain and morbidity associated with bleeding disorders. Treatment of severe haemophilia A or B consists of administration of plasma-derived or recombinant clotting factor concentrates. ...|$|R

Inherited forms of hypercholesterolemia can also cause health problems related to the buildup of excess cholesterol in other tissues In this research are used the results of biochemical analyses and laboratory testing of cholesterol from private health diagnostic laboratory in east Macedonia of two years (2010 - 2011). The purpose of this <b>researche</b> <b>is</b> to show the prevalence {{and the risk of}} appearance of possible hypercholesterolemia defined by gender and age. Results and discussion: According to the analyzed results, we have concluded that in the male population most of the patients with higher concentration of cholesterol are in the age group between 40 and 60, but in the female population most cases of elevated higher concentration of cholesterol are in the age group over 60. It has been established a generation link i. e. elevated concentration of cholesterol appearing in two generations in one family. Conclusion: Hypercholesterolemia is a disease which is primary importance is to be detected and treated accordingly in its early stages with clinical laboratory methods and criteria, and molecular diagnostic methods for detection of the gentic reason for the appearance of this disease and appropriate treatment for patients and extention of their life span.
