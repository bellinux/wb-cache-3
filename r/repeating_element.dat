40|$|AbstractIn Campoletis sonorensis Ichnovirus (CsIV), the <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> genes {{constitute}} a gene family of 28 members. In the present work, we document {{the presence of}} members of this gene family in two additional ichnoviruses, Hyposoter didymator Ichnovirus (HdIV) and Tranosema rostrale Ichnovirus (TrIV). Two <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> genes, representing at least one functional gene, were identified in TrIV, whereas HdIV was found to contain at least three such genes. In both HdIV and TrIV, the known <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> genes are encoded on single genome segments, with hybridization studies suggesting the presence of other, related but as yet uncharacterized genes. The HdIV and TrIV <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> genes are all transcribed in infected caterpillars, although differences exist among genes in levels and in tissue specificity of expression. A heuristic tree was generated indicating that the <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> genes are more similar within a species of wasp than between species, with TrIV genes being {{more closely related to}} the CsIV than to the HdIV genes. These results suggest that the most significant duplication, divergence, and expansion of the <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> genes occurred after speciation. The finding that <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> genes form an interspecific family within the genus Ichnovirus supports the view that the proteins they encode {{play an important role in}} ichnovirus biology...|$|R

40|$|In a NASA SBIR Phase I program (Contract No. NAS 8 - 40119), Giner, Inc. {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} fabricating an all-solid-ionomer multicell electrochemical capacitor having a unit cell capacitance greater than 2 F/sq cm and a <b>repeating</b> <b>element</b> thickness of 6 mils. This capacitor can possibly be used by NASA as a high-rate energy source for electromechanical actuator (EMA) activation for advanced space missions. The high unit cell capacitance and low <b>repeating</b> <b>element</b> thickness will allow for the fabrication of a low-volume, low-weight device, favorable characteristics for space applications. These same characteristics also make the capacitor attractive for terrestrial applications, such as load-leveling batteries or fuel cells in electric vehicle applications. Although the projected energy densities for electrochemical capacitors are about two orders of magnitude {{lower than that of}} batteries, the high-power-density characteristics of these devices render them as potentially viable candidates for meeting pulse or peak electrical power requirements for some anticipated aerospace mission scenarios, especially those with discharge times on the millisecond to second time scale. On a volumetric or gravimetric basis, the advantages of utilizing electrochemical capacitors rather than batteries for meeting the peak power demands associated with a specific mission scenario will largely depend upon the total and pulse durations of the power peaks. The effect of preparation conditions on RuO(x), the active component in an all-solid-ionomer electrochemical capacitor, was evaluated during this program. Methods were identified to prepare RuO(x) having a surface areagreater than 180 sq m/g, and a capacitance of greater than 2 F/sq cm. Further efforts to reproducibly obtain these high-surface-area materials in scaled-up batches will be evaluated in Phase 2. During this Phase 1 program we identified a superior Nafion 105 membrane, having a film thickness of 5 mils, that showed excellent performance in our all-solid-ionomer capacitors and resulted in electrochemical capacitors with a <b>repeating</b> <b>element</b> thickness of 8 mils.

We hypothesised that a single whole-body exposure of low dose radiation would induce a radioadaptive response thereby reducing or abrogating aging-related changes in <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> DNA methylation in mice. Following sham or 10 mGy X-irradiation, serial peripheral blood sampling was performed and differences in Long Interspersed Nucleic Element 1 (L 1), B 1 and Intracisternal-A-Particle (IAP) <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> methylation between samples were assessed using high resolution melt analysis of PCR amplicons. By 420 days post-irradiation, neither radiation- or aging-related changes in the methylation of peripheral blood, spleen or liver L 1, B 1 and IAP elements were observed. Analysis of the spleen and liver tissues of cohorts of untreated aging mice showed that the 17 - 19 month age group exhibited higher <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> methylation than younger or older mice, with no overall decline in methylation detected with age. This is the first temporal analysis of the effect of low dose radiation on <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> methylation in mouse peripheral blood and the first to examine the long term effect of this dose on <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> methylation in a radiosensitive tissue (spleen) and a tissue fundamental to the aging process (liver). Our data indicate that the methylation of murine DNA <b>repeat</b> <b>elements</b> can fluctuate with age, but unlike human studies, do not demonstrate an overall aging-related decline. Furthermore, our results indicate that a low dose of ionising radiation does not induce detectable changes to murine <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> DNA methylation in the tissues and at the time-points examined in this study. This radiation dose is relevant to human diagnostic radiation exposures and suggests that a dose of 10 mGy X-rays, unlike high dose radiation, does not cause significant short or long term changes to <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> or global DNA methylation.

40|$|Adaptive {{conformational}} transitions of DNA accompanying protein-DNA interaction are {{now considered}} as a structural basis underlining stability and functional properties of protein-DNA complexes (Jones et al., 1999). The nature and direction of ligand-induced perturbations are potentially determined by sequence-dependent fine structural peculiarities of the free DNA, thus increasing the significance of DNA structural modeling. However the detailed studies are still required to estimate the extent of these correlations for particular DNA-protein complexes. The present study is targeted to experimental detection of DNA structural rearrangements, which take place upon transcription complex formation by E. coli RNA polymerase with promoter D of bacteriophage T 7. The nucleotide sequence of this promoter possesses a set of periodically distributed direct repeats with high propensity to form unusual tertiary structure. To reveal promoter regions with altered DNA conformation both in the free DNA and transcription complexes, KMnO 4 footprinting technique was applied. Results: A pronounced helix deformation was detected {{in the structure of}} T 7 D DNA complexed with RNA polymerase. This distortion is located distantly from the transcription start point and takes place in the region of <b>repeating</b> <b>element,</b> which exhibits sensitivity to KMnO 4 in the free promoter DNA. Overall conformation of the transcription complexes could therefore be controlled by the sequence-dependent structure of free promoter DNA...|$|E
40|$|The most distal known gene on Neurospora crassa {{linkage group}} VR, his- 6, was cloned. A genomic walk {{resulted}} in {{isolation of the}} telomere at VR. It was obtained from a library in which the endmost nucleotides of the chromosome had not been removed by nuclease treatment before being cloned, and mapping indicates that the entire chromosome end has probably been cloned. Sequences homologous to the terminal 2. 5 kilobases of DNA from VR from these Oak Ridge N. crassa strains are found at other sites in the genome. To characterize these sites, I crossed an Oak Ridge-derived his- 6 strain with a wild-type strain of different genetic background (Mauriceville) and characterized the hybridization patterns seen in the progeny. It appears that the sequences homologous to the VR terminus are found at genetically different sites in the two parental strains, and no hybridization to the VR telomere from Mauriceville was detected. The other genomic copies identified in the Oak Ridge parent were not telomeres. I suggest that any repeating sequence blocks found immediately adjacent to the VR terminus in Oak Ridge strains must be small and that the <b>repeating</b> <b>element</b> identified in that background may be an N. crassa transposable element integrated near the the chromosome end at VR...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is an {{economically}} significant swine pathogen that colonizes the respiratory ciliated epithelial cells. Cilium adherence is mediated by P 97, a surface protein containing a <b>repeating</b> <b>element</b> (R 1) {{that is responsible}} for binding. Here, we show that the cilium adhesin is proteolytically processed on the surface. Proteomic analysis of strain J proteins identified cleavage products of 22, 28, 66, and 94 kDa. N-terminal sequencing showed that the 66 - and 94 -kDa proteins possessed identical N termini and that the 66 -kDa variant was generated by cleavage of the 28 -kDa product from the C terminus. The 22 -kDa product represented the N-terminal 195 amino acids of the cilium adhesin preprotein, confirming that the hydrophobic leader signal sequence is not cleaved during translocation across the membrane. Comparative studies of M. hyopneumoniae strain 232 showed that the major cleavage products of the cilium adhesin are similar, although P 22 and P 28 appear to be processed further in strain 232. Immunoblotting studies using antisera raised against peptide sequences within P 22 and P 66 /P 94 indicate that processing is complex, with cleavage occurring at different frequencies within multiple sites, and is strain specific. Immunogold electron microscopy showed that fragments containing the cilium-binding site remained associated with the cell surface whereas cleavage products not containing the R 1 element were located elsewhere. Not all secreted proteins undergo multiple cleavage, however, as evidenced by the analysis of the P 102 gene product. The ability of M. hyopneumoniae to selectively cleave its secreted proteins provides this pathogen with a remarkable capacity to alter its surface architecture. 12 page(s...|$|E

Repetitive elements, heavily methylated in post-natal tissue, have variable methylation profiles in cancer but methylation of repetitive {{elements in the}} heart has never been examined. Results: We analyzed repetitive <b>elements</b> from all <b>repeat</b> families in human myocardial samples, and found that satellite <b>repeat</b> <b>elements</b> were significantly hypomethylated in end-stage cardiomyopathic hearts relative to healthy normal controls. Satellite <b>repeat</b> <b>elements</b> are almost always centromeric or juxtacentromeric, and their overexpression correlates with disease aggressiveness in cancer.

40|$|AbstractMassively {{parallel}} sequencing (MPS) is on {{the advent}} of a broad scale application in forensic research and casework. The improved capabilities to analyse evidentiary traces representing unbalanced mixtures is often mentioned as one of the major advantages of this technique. However, most of the available software packages that analyse forensic short tandem repeat (STR) sequencing data are not well suited for high throughput analysis of such mixed traces. The largest challenge is the presence of stutter artefacts in STR amplifications, which are not readily discerned from minor contributions. FDSTools is an open-source software solution developed for this purpose. The level of stutter formation is influenced by various aspects of the sequence, such as the length of the longest uninterrupted stretch occurring in an STR. When MPS is used, STRs are evaluated as sequence variants that each have particular stutter characteristics which can be precisely determined. FDSTools uses a database of reference samples to determine stutter and other systemic PCR or sequencing artefacts for each individual allele. In addition, stutter models are created for each <b>repeating</b> <b>element</b> in order to predict stutter artefacts for alleles that are not included in the reference set. This information is subsequently used to recognise and compensate for the noise in a sequence profile. The result is a better representation of the true composition of a sample. Using Promega Powerseqâ„¢ Auto System data from 450 reference samples and 31 two-person mixtures, we show that the FDSTools correction module decreases stutter ratios above 20 % to below 3 %. Consequently, much lower levels of contributions in the mixed traces are detected. FDSTools contains modules to visualise the data in an interactive format allowing users to filter data with their own preferred thresholds...|$|E

In vivo genetic tests demonstrate that the BCDD'D" repeats form part of the origin of replication, while some of the downstream <b>repeat</b> <b>elements</b> (HIJ) are involved in the sensing and setting of plasmid copy number. RepA DNA binding to these groups of repeats has been investigated in vivo by utilizing the fact that the replicon contains three active promoters (orip, repAp, and EFp), one of which has previously been shown to control the expression of repA (repAp). All three promoters are closely associated with the <b>repeat</b> <b>elements</b> flanking repA, and an investigation using lacZ or cml gene fusions has demonstrated that RepA expressed in trans is able to repress each promoter.

Whether it is the identification of genes and associating them with known phenotypes or identifying and discerning individuals from one another, the role they play in the genetic field has been immense. Parentage testing of horses today is done via molecular means as opposed to serology. Microsatellite marker panels are decided upon by bodies such as the International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG) in order to uphold international genotyping standards. The current horse microsatellite marker panel is not fully characterized and many markers are amplified by primers originally designed for linkage studies and were never intended for multiplex PCR analysis. The aim {{of this study was to}} refine and validate the current marker panel used for horses through sequencing of the <b>repeat</b> <b>elements</b> and flanking regions as well as the design of new primers for the setup of a marker panel incorporating more microsatellites and better primers. Sequencing of microsatellite flanking regions revealed that much variation lies within the regions flanking a microsatellite <b>repeat</b> <b>element.</b> Sequencing of the <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> showed that not all markers are simple repeats, as was previously thought. The primers used to amplify microsatellite markers for horses were re-designed in the course of this study, utilizing knowledge gained from flanking region variation and <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> length. New primers and known allele sizes allowed for the implementation of a nomenclature system in horses based on <b>repeat</b> <b>element</b> length as opposed to alphabet letters.

The distributions of <b>repeat</b> <b>elements,</b> secretory proteins, CAZymes and SNPs showed significant variation across host-specific lineages of Magnaporthe indicating an independent genome evolution orchestrated by multiple genomic factors...|$|R
