50|$|Under IFRS, AFS {{assets are}} defined as being all {{financial}} assets that do not {{fall into one of}} the other classifications. As such, the treatment closely follows that of US GAAP. Gains or losses from revaluation of the asset are put through Other Comprehensive Income in Shareholders' Equity, except to the extent that any losses are assessed as being permanent and the asset is therefore impaired (under IAS 39, paragraph 58), or if the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of. If the asset is impaired, sold or otherwise disposed of, the <b>revaluation</b> <b>gain</b> or loss implicit in the transaction is recognised as a income or expense.|$|E
40|$|Undervalued {{firms with}} high {{information}} asymmetry may announce takeover bids {{to attract the}} attention of investors with a view to increasing the share price through revaluation. Announcement period returns to such bidders should include both <b>revaluation</b> and synergy <b>gains</b> although the <b>revaluation</b> <b>gains</b> should be confined to early bids and decline with the number of bids announced within a reasonable period. Our results offer strong support to these predictions. Undervalued firms with high pre-bid information asymmetry gain the most from early bids and the gains decline with the number of bids announced. These findings are robust to methods of payment, relative size of deals, target status, relatedness of businesses, domicile of target, M&A activities and alternative measures of information asymmetry, and confirm that gains from early bids include revaluation as well as synergy gains, especially in the cases of undervalued firms with high information asymmetry.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{two issues}} related to fair value accounting and compensation contracts. The first essay focuses on the adoption of IAS No. 40 by property companies in Hong Kong {{and its impact on}} executive compensation. As a departure from the conservatism principle, IFRS allows firms to revalue investment property and record the <b>revaluation</b> <b>gains</b> or losses (RGL) in income statement. This study shows that the <b>revaluation</b> <b>gains</b> are associated with executive compensation after convergence to IFRS, but not before. It also shows that this association {{is likely to be the}} result of opportunistic behavior for the following reasons. First, the executive compensation is not penalized by the revaluation losses. Second, the association is more evidenced in firms with more severe agency problems, such as those with lower founding family ownership, fewer independent non-executive directors on the board and the compensation committee, and no longer run by its founder. Thus, when agency problems are more severe, the IFRS’ treatment of the RGL can result in early distributions of unrealized gains to executives. The second essay focuses on the adoption of SFAS No. 130 by financial institutions in the US. SFAS No. 130 allows firms to choose to report the components of comprehensive income in either a performance-statement or a statement-of-equity format. The study shows that compensation contracts affect the choice of reporting format. In particular, firms whose executive compensation is more sensitive to unrealized gains or losses (UGL) from available-for-sale (AFS) securities are more likely to choose the performance-statement format. Furthermore, the association between UGL and executive compensation exists before and after SFAS No. 130 adoption in firms that choose the performance-statement format. The results indicate that firms take advantage of SFAS No. 130 to choose reporting formats that are aligned with their compensation schemes...|$|R
40|$|International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) allow {{firms to}} record {{adjustments}} (gains or losses) from the revaluation of investment properties in their income statements. After Hong Kong adopted IFRS in 2005, property companies {{were required to}} move their <b>revaluation</b> <b>gains</b> and losses (RGL) from equity to income. We find RGL {{to be a significant}} determinant of executive compensation in these firms after 2005, but not before. We further find evidence that the RGL-compensation association is driven by firms with relative weak corporate governance structure, such as firms in which the controlling shareholders own a relatively small percentage of shares, firms in which the controlling shareholders have control rights that exceed ownership rights, and firms that are no longer run by their founders.

40|$|Financial {{globalisation}} has led {{to large}} increases in foreign assets and liabilities in recent decades, increasing the scope for valuation changes that are potentially greater than trade or financial flows. We confirm that the United States enjoys an ‘exorbitant privilege’ on flow income from foreign assets, which is primarily related to foreign direct investment (FDI). The geographical allocation of FDI assets explains {{only a small part}} of the US yield advantage. The key reason is that US, and also British and Japanese, investors were able to outperform the average yield earned in the countries of their FDI destinations, while most continental European investors earn the average. Further research should explore if large FDI investment in ‘tax optimisation’ countries, the improper consideration of intellectual property, or financial sophistication contributed to these high yields. For several countries, valuation changes were larger than current account and financial transactions, highlighting the importance of such changes. In the European Union, the generally negative international investment positions of a number of central and southern European countries were greatly supported by EU transfers. Valuation changes on net foreign assets do not look random and played an important role in the sustainability of international investment positions before and after the 2008 crisis. Countries with negative net international investment positions tend to have positive <b>revaluation</b> <b>gains,</b> while countries with large net foreign assets tend to suffer from revaluation losses. Large net foreign asset holders including China, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Japan and Germany, suffered significant losses in 2007 - 16, helping the sustainability of the negative positions of other countries. Risk sharing was also fostered by losses suffered by the US since 2007. There is no uniform tendency in relation to the asset classes from which these losses arose. Future research should aim to better understand the drivers of these valuation changes...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate takeover gains for UK bidding firms and offer a behavioural approach to empirical analysis. The main issues and key findings of the three empirical chapters are summarised as follows. Chapter 3 empirically investigates the hubris hypothesis for corporate takeovers (Roll (1986)). This thesis examines whether overconfident managers destroy shareholder value (in public deals) or whether their actions generally lead to lower wealth effects (in private deals) relative to rational bidders. Bidders’ short and long-term performance is also examined by employing, {{for the first time}} in a UK study, three different measures of overconfidence namely Stock Options, Multiple Acquirers and Business Press proxies. The results indicate that managers infected by hubris fail to generate superior returns than those generated by rational bidders, for all three proxies of overconfidence after controlling for various bidder and deal characteristics. We therefore argue that the well-documented destructive effect upon shareholder wealth of managerial overconfidence is not sensitive to the measure used for this behavioural bias (i. e. overconfidence). The Hubris hypothesis assumes a rational market-irrational manager framework while Shleifer and Vishny (2003) offer rational manager-irrational market framework and suggest that takeovers are driven by overvalued markets. Chapter 4 empirically investigates the proposal of Baker et al. (2007) who claims that ‘the irrational manager and irrational investor stories can certainly coexist’. Findings show that rational managers who announce takeovers in high valuation periods enjoy the highest abnormal returns while overconfident managers who announce takeover bids in low valuation periods cannot hide the poor quality or possible overpayment of their deals ending up suffering the highest losses. Lastly, Chapter 5 offers a behavioural approach to explain short –run bidder gains. Neoclassical theories suggest that the market reaction following the announcement of a takeover bid reflects either synergy or <b>revaluation</b> <b>gains.</b> Chapter 5 suggests that acquirers’ abnormal returns reflect a market overreaction. Results suggest that under conditions of low information uncertainty when investors do not possess private information, the market reaction is complete (zero abnormal returns) for any type of acquisition. On the other hand, under conditions of high information uncertainty, investors overweight their private information and overreact to takeover announcements. Therefore, they generate highly positive and significant gains following the announcement of private stock and public cash deals (considered to be ‘good’ news), positive gains following private cash acquisitions (also defined as ‘good’ news) while investors heavily punish public stock deals (classified as ‘bad’ news) EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
