2500|$|In {{cases of}} fraud, the same {{principle}} applies; the property is held by the fraudster on constructive trust for the original owner, unless the original owner {{was involved in the}} fraud, as in Lonrho plc v Fayed (No. 2). An exception to this principle is fraudulent misrepresentation, where the courts disagree over whether it immediately forms a constructive trust or requires action by the victim. In Collings v Lee, an estate agent transferred property to a non-existent purchaser (in reality an alias) and then claimed that as he was not the transferee, {{he did not have to}} pay the vendors; it was held that this fraudulent misrepresentation meant he held the property on constructive trust. However, in Lonrho, Millett J held that [...] "A contract obtained by fraudulent misrepresentation is voidable, not void, even in equity. The representee may elect to avoid it, but until he does so, the <b>representor</b> is not a constructive trustee of the property transferred pursuant to the contact, and no fiduciary relationship exists between him and the representee".|$|E

50|$|Hoffmann LJ {{said that}} section 2(1) is {{concerned}} with the ‘damage flowing from having entered into the contract, while section 2(2) {{is concerned with}} damage caused by the property not being what it was represented to be.’ The point of s 2(2) is to have a different effect to s 2(1), so that <b>representors</b> are not unfairly oppressed when someone gets out of a bargain after a little misrepresentation. In this case he would have exercised discretion under s 2(2) so as to prevent William Sindall plc escaping from a bad bargain.|$|R
40|$|Misrepresentation {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the most commonly pleaded vitiating factors. When such a plea is made, the <b>representor’s</b> reply has often been that there is a contractual clause which affects the matter at hand, and the legal inquiry turns to whether the clause excludes liability for misrepresentation and, if so, whether it is reasonable. In recent times, a somewhat surprising argument has surfaced – that the clause estops any allegation of misrepresentation. Such estoppel takes two forms. The first – estoppel by representation – is a reasonably well-established doctrine. The second – contractual estoppel – is a recent and controversial concept, and has been gaining judicial support. But the application of the doctrine of contractual estoppel raises serious questions and doubts. This case note considers how and the extent to which Mr Justice Clarke’s judgment in Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG v Royal Bank of Scotland [2010] EWHC 1392 (Comm) provides the clarification much needed in this area...|$|R

A multidisciplinary discourse theoretical analysis combines Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s discourse theory with Nancy Fraser’s contributions to the struggle over needs of counterpublics to examine textual, photographic and ethnographic data. Two levels of identities of #NiUnaMenos are extracted from the investigation: Internal agonistic identities pinpoint at the friction between the <b>representors</b> and the represented identities of the counterpublic. A collective identity evolves {{in the context of the}} struggle for justice, freedom and dignity through the construction of an antagonistic “Others” who are held responsible for femicidal violence.

5000|$|The {{negotiating}} {{stage of}} a contract can be a time-consuming process. Because of this, new information may arise and circumstances may change. This can result in two situations which {{can result in a}} misrepresentation if silence is kept. The first is if the <b>representor</b> subsequently discovers that the statement was false, the second being if the statement becomes false at a later time.If a statement is made and it is subsequently made known to the <b>representor</b> that it is false, it would obviously be inequitable to allow the <b>representor</b> to remain silent with the new information. In Lockhart v. Osman 1981 VR 57, an agent had advertised some cattle as being “well-suited for breeding purposes”. Later on, it was discovered that the stock had been exposed to a contagious disease which affected the reproductive system. It was held that the agent had a duty to take remedial action and correct the representation. The failure by the agent to take such measures resulted in the contract being set aside.Should a statement be made which is true at the time, but subsequently becomes untrue due to a change in circumstances, the <b>representor</b> is obligated to amend the original statement. In With v O’Flanagan 1936 Ch. 575, the plaintiff entered into a contract to purchase O’Flanagan’s medical practice. During negotiations it was said that the practice produced an income of £2000 per year. Before the contract was signed, the practice took a downward turn and lost a significant amount of value. After the contract had been entered into, {{the true nature of the}} practice was discovered and the plaintiff took action in misrepresentation. In his decision, Lord Wright said, [...] "...a representation made as a matter of inducement to enter into a contract is to be treated as a continuing representation.". This means that the representation must be true till the contract is made; creating the obligation mentioned above and accordingly the plaintiff’s petition was successful.|$|E
50|$|A <b>representor</b> {{may make}} a {{statement}} which prima facie is technically true; however this may tell only half the story. If a statement of fact is made but the <b>representor</b> fails to exclude information which would significantly alter the interpretation of this fact, then a misrepresentation may have occurred. In Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd (1995) 183 CLR 563, Krakowski agreed {{to enter into a}} contract to buy a shop premises from Eurolynx as long as a 'strong tenant' had been organised. The contract proceeded on the grounds that such a tenant had been arranged. Unbeknown to Krakowski, Eurolynx had entered into an additional agreement with the tenant to provide funds for the first three months rent to ensure the contract went ahead. When the tenant defaulted on the rent and subsequently vacated the premises, Krakowski found out about the additional agreement and rescinded the contract with Eurolynx. It was held that Eurolynx's failure to disclose all material facts about the 'strong tenant' was enough to constitute a misrepresentation and the contract could be rescinded on these grounds.|$|E

5000|$|Innocent {{misrepresentation}} {{occurs when}} the <b>representor</b> had reasonable grounds for believing {{that his or her}} false statement was true. Prior to Hedley Byrne, all misrepresentations that were not fraudulent were considered to be innocent. This type of representation primarily allows for a remedy of rescission, the purpose of which is put the parties back into a position as if the contract had never taken place. Section 2(2) Misrepresentation Act 1967, however, allows for damages to be awarded in lieu of rescission if the court deems it equitable to do so. This is judged on both the nature of the innocent misrepresentation and the losses suffered by the claimant from it.|$|E
5000|$|The SCC later adopted Spring for {{representations}} concerning {{those associated}} with the <b>representor</b> in Young v Bella, in which the Court declared, [...] "There is no reason in principle why negligence actions {{should not be allowed}} to proceed where (a) proximity and foreseeability have been established, and (b) the damages cover more than just harm to the plaintiff’s reputation (i.e. where there are further damages arising from the defendant’s negligence)... In fact, all of the cases cited by the respondents as standing for the proposition that defamation had 'cornered the market' on reputation damages were cases in which (unlike here) there was no pre-existing relationship between the parties that gave rise to a duty of care." ...|$|E
5000|$|Where {{one person}} ('the representor') {{has made a}} {{representation}} of fact to another person ('the representee') in words or by acts or conduct, or (being under a duty to the representee to speak or act) by silence or inaction, with the intention (actual or presumptive) and with the result of inducing the representee on the faith of such representation to alter his position to his detriment, the <b>representor,</b> in any litigation which may afterwards take place {{between him and the}} representee, is estopped, as against the representee, from making, or attempting to establish by evidence, any averment substantially at variance with his former representation, if the representee at the proper time, and in proper manner, objects thereto.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{decisions}} from Australian courts have also affected the circumstances where legal action {{can be taken}} regarding contracts, recognising factors that change contractual obligations.These include situations involving [...] "unconscionable dealings", where one party is at a [...] "special disadvantage", or where a party exercises [...] "undue influence", and will commonly result in the contract being declared void or voidable by the court. Other vitiating factors may include [...] "misrepresentation" [...] if it amounts to a false statement of a material fact made by the <b>representor</b> to the representee in order to induce the representee {{to enter into the}} contract and which has this effect, [...] "misleading and deceptive conduct", [...] "mistake", [...] "duress", and [...] "unconscionable conduct". In general law, the remedy for vitiating factors is rescission and full restoration, even in cases of third party impropriety.|$|E
5000|$|Back in Zurich for 1968-69 he {{proposed}} elementary (first-order) axioms for toposes generalizing {{the concept of}} the Grothendieck topos (see history of topos theory) and worked with the algebraic topologist Myles Tierney to clarify and apply this theory. Tierney discovered major simplifications in the description of Grothendieck [...] "topologies". Anders Kock later found further simplifications so that a topos can be described as a category with products and equalizers in which the notions of map space and subobject are representable. Lawvere had pointed out that a Grothendieck topology can be entirely described as an endomorphism of the subobject <b>representor,</b> and Tierney showed that the conditions it needs to satisfy are just idempotence and the preservation of finite intersections. These [...] "topologies" [...] are important in both algebraic geometry and model theory because they determine the subtoposes as sheaf-categories.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Wright MR {{held that}} Mr With could rescind either {{because there was}} a duty to point out the change in {{circumstance}} or because the representation continued till the point when the contract was signed. He referred to Fry J in Davies v London Provincial Marine Insurance that there is no duty to disclose, even when someone believes facts to be operating on another’s mind. He noted fiduciary relationships can bring an entire duty of disclosure. Uberrimae fidei contracts, including partnership and marine insurance, do too. But also where in negotiations a statement is false and then the <b>representor</b> discovers it, though if he had said nothing he is entitled to hold his tongue throughout. He noted that a ‘representation made as a matter of inducement to enter a contract is to be treated as a continuing representation.’ ...|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{the effect}} of {{misrepresentation}} {{is that it makes}} the contract voidable not void ab initio. This is important for two reasons. Firstly because the represent can continue to be bound by the contract at his or her will. Secondly because the transactions and effects of the (voided) contract are recognised to have taken place, therefore, if a party transfers title of property to a third party of which the former holds the title only, pursuant to the voided contract, the third party can retain legal title. Rescission can be done either by informing the <b>representor</b> or by requesting an order from the court. There are certain circumstances where rescission is not possible though. The idea behind rescission is that the parties are restored to the positions they were before entering into the contract. Therefore, if this is not possible, rescission is not an option.|$|E

5000|$|Alexander Nisbet in A System of Heraldry Vol 1, 1722, {{states that}} 'Buchannan of Lenie' {{is now the}} <b>representor</b> of 'Buchannan of that Ilk.'

[...] In Nisbet's (posthumously published) A System of Heraldry Vol 2, 1742, he recognises Buchanan of Auchmar as the successor of the chiefly line. [...] In the 1826 claim for the chiefship by Dr Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, the extinction of both the main chiefly line and the Auchmar line are identified as preconditions to the claim. The later Clan historian, John Guthrie Smith, omits any reference to Buchanan of Auchmar’s claim when he details the Buchanans of Auchmar.|$|E

Secondly, I argue that the so-called “semantic” or “model-theoretic” construal of theories does not give proper due to the role played by true propositions in successful representing practices. Thirdly, I attempt to show that the force of van Fraassen’s pragmatic - and antirealist - “dissolution” of the “loss of reality objection” loses its bite when we realize that our cognitive contact with real phenomena is achieved not by representing but by expressing true propositions about them...|$|E
