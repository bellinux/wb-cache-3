40|$|Efficient {{mixing of}} fuel and air is a major {{objective}} for the successful operation of scramjet engines, in which the supersonic combustion process must occur within an extremely short time frame in the hypersonic flight. This paper presents the insights gained into the key design factors and underlying mechanism for fuel/air mixing enhancement with streamwise vortices introduced by alternating wedges called hypermixers. The results of a parametric numerical study and sensitivity analysis suggest that narrow spanwise intervals between the alternating wedges and large fuel/air equivalence ratios are beneficial for effective mixing, while higher total pressure recovery is associated with shallower <b>ramp</b> <b>angles</b> and lower fuel/air equivalence ratios. Higher fuel penetration is achieved with steeper <b>ramp</b> <b>angles</b> and higher fuel/air equivalence ratios.

40|$|In fault-related folds {{that form}} by axial surface migration, rocks undergo {{deformation}} {{as they pass}} through axial surfaces. The distribution and intensity of deformation in these structures has been impacted by the history of axial surface migration. Upon fold initiation, unique dip panels develop, each with a characteristic deformation intensity, depending on their history. During fold growth, rocks that pass through axial surfaces are transported between dip panels and accumulate additional deformation. By tracking the pattern of axial surface migration in model folds, we predict the distribution of relative deformation intensity in simple-step. parallel fault-bend and fault-propagation anticlines. In both cases the deformation is partitioned into unique domains we call deformation panels. For a given rheology of the folded multilayer, deformation intensity will be homogeneously distributed in each deformation panel. Fold limbs are always deformed. The flat costs of fault-propagation anticlines are always undeformed. Two asymmetric deformation panels develop in fault-propagation folds above <b>ramp</b> <b>angles</b> exceeding 29 degrees.

Ramps have the potential to be particularly hazardous with regards to slips and falls since higher shear forces are created. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of <b>ramp</b> <b>angle</b> on slip potential at the feet during downward and upward gait. This was accomplished by investigating the relationship between the horizontal and vertical foot forces during gait as a function of <b>ramp</b> <b>angle.</b> A ramp was designed and built which incorporated a force plate. Foot forces were measured while subjects walked up and down the ramp. The ramp ang 1. e was varied from 0 to 20 degrees in 4 degree intervals.

40|$|Laminar boundary-layer {{separation}} in the {{supersonic flow}} past a corner point on a rigid body contour, also termed the compression ramp, is considered {{based on the}} viscous–inviscid interaction concept. The ‘triple-deck model’ is {{used to describe the}} interaction process. The governing equations of the interaction may be formally derived from the Navier–Stokes equations if the <b>ramp</b> <b>angle</b> [theta] is represented as [theta] = [theta] 0 Re[minus sign] 1 / 4, where [theta] 0 is an order-one quantity and Re is the Reynolds number, assumed large. To solve the interaction problem two numerical methods have been used. The first method employs a finite-difference approximation of the governing equations with respect to both the streamwise and wall-normal coordinates. The resulting algebraic equations are linearized using a Newton–Raphson strategy and then solved with the Thomas-matrix technique. The second method uses finite differences in the streamwise direction in combination with Chebychev collocation in the normal direction and Newton–Raphson linearization. Our main concern is with the flow behaviour at large values of [theta] 0. The calculations show that as the <b>ramp</b> <b>angle</b> [theta] 0 increases, additional eddies form near the corner point inside the separation region. The behaviour of the solution does not give any indication that there exists a critical value [theta]* 0 of the <b>ramp</b> <b>angle</b> [theta] 0, as suggested by Smith & Khorrami (1991) who claimed that as [theta] 0 approaches [theta]* 0, a singularity develops near the reattachment point, preventing the continuation of the solution beyond [theta]* 0.

40|$|Air inlets in {{some form}} are used on all {{commercial}} airliners today. The type of air inlet investigated in this report is a NACA inlet submerged into a surface. This surface is within this thesis a test section wall of a wind tunnel. The considered wind tunnel is TWG in Göttingen (Germany) that operates in transonic speeds. Submerged inlets have the main advantage of low aeroynamic drag from the inlet itself. The importance of reducing drag, and the attention given to this subject is increasing as fuel prices rise as well as public awareness of environmental impact by all of us. The outcome of this thesis contributes to the government-funded project ECOCENTS which deals with the design of innovative new aircraft cooling systems and the detailed flow analysis of these systems. This thesis was carried out at the company Airbus in Bremen, Germany. The main objective of this report was {{the evaluation of the}} ram pressure efficiency of four different ramp angles of a NACA inlet and the estimation of the drag caused by these geometries with the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The flow solver used was TAU, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The inlet consisted of one ramp section where the <b>ramp</b> <b>angle</b> was fixed at 7 degrees, and a second variable ramp section. The following different angles were investigated: 4, 7, 10 and 15 degrees. These configurations were evaluated at a velocity of Mach 0. 8 and a Reynolds number of 10 * 10 ^ 6. The <b>ramp</b> <b>angle</b> of 7 degrees was evaluated at two additional velocities (Mach 0. 73 and Mach 0. 87) and at two additional Reynolds numbers (5 * 10 ^ 6 and 15 * 10 ^ 6) at Mach 0. 8. The inlet efficiency outcome of this study was located between two other investigations. The results of this RANS computation predicted a higher total pressure at the inlet throat plane compared to a previous CFD investigation where a different RANS solver at the same geometry was used. In comparison to an estimation method mainly based on experimental data (ESDU method), the recent study showed a lower total pressure at the inlet throat plane. The aerodynamic drag that arised by the presence of the inlet system was calculated within this thesis to be higher than the outcome of the experimental data based (ESDU) method. The advantage of using a NACA type inlet was observed to be highly related to the <b>ramp</b> <b>angle.</b> Vortices are originated and develop along the edges of the intake ramp walls. These two vortices help to transport higher energy flow from the free stream into the inlet and therefore reduce the boundary layer thickness in the inlet region. For lower mass flows (0. 10 - 0. 20 kg/s) a <b>ramp</b> <b>angle</b> of 7 degrees was seen to be prefered in view of ram pressure efficiency. At a higher mass flow (0. 25 kg/s) the 10 degrees <b>ramp</b> <b>angle</b> was prefered, followed by the 15 degrees <b>ramp</b> <b>angle</b> at the highest investigated mass flows (0. 30 - 0. 35 kg/s). In view of drag, the lowest <b>ramp</b> <b>angle</b> possible for a given mass flow was seen to be most advantagous. Future work on this subject will include simulation of an inlet in combination with a heat exchanger and a ram air outlet. This arrengement will be the same as in the investigation at the TWG test campaign and therefore comparable. The difference in outcome of the separate CFD analysis was discussed within this investigation but could not be completely cleared...|$|E
