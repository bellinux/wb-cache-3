40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} an {{acoustic}} direction-ofarrival (DOA) tracking system to track multiple maneuvering targets using a state space approach. The system {{consists of three}} blocks: beamformer, <b>random</b> <b>sampling,</b> and particle filter. The beamformer block processes the received acoustic data to output bearing batches as point statistics. The <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> block determines temporal clustering of the bearings in a batch to determine region-of-interests (ROIs). Based on the track-before-detect approach, each ROI indicates {{the presence of a}} possible target. We describe three <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> algorithms called RANSAC, MSAC, and NAPSAC to use in the <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> block.

40|$|<b>Random</b> <b>sampling</b> is a {{technique}} for signal acquisition which is gaining popularity in practical signal processing systems. Nowadays, event-driven analog-to-digital converters make <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> feasible in practical applications. A process of <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> is defined by a sampling pattern, which indicates signal sampling points in time. Practical <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> patterns are constrained by ADC characteristics and application requirements. In this paper authors introduce statistical methods which evaluate <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> pattern generators with emphasis on practical applications. Furthermore, the authors propose a new random pattern generator which copes with strict practical limitations imposed on patterns, with possibly minimal loss in randomness of sampling. The proposed generator is compared with existing sampling pattern generators using the introduced statistical methods. It is shown that the proposed algorithm generates <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> patterns dedicated for event-driven-ADCs better than existed sampling pattern generators. Finally, implementation issues of <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> patterns are discussed. Comment: 29 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Circuits, Systems and Signal Processing journa...|$|R

The main property of a <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> is that in many cases its properties are representativeofa much larger population.

25|$|Cluster {{sampling}} {{is commonly}} implemented as multistage sampling. This {{is a complex}} form of cluster sampling in which two or more levels of units are embedded one in the other. The first stage consists of constructing the clusters {{that will be used}} to sample from. In the second stage, a sample of primary units is randomly selected from each cluster (rather than using all units contained in all selected clusters). In following stages, in each of those selected clusters, additional samples of units are selected, and so on. All ultimate units (individuals, for instance) selected at the last step of this procedure are then surveyed. This technique, thus, is essentially the process of taking random subsamples of preceding <b>random</b> <b>samples.</b>|$|E
