40|$|Aim: The {{redistribution}} of species with {{climate change is}} well documented. Even so, the relative contribution of species detectability to the variation in measured <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> rates among species is poorly understood. How can true <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> be discerned from sampling artefacts? Location: Australia. Methods: We simulate <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> for species which differ in their abundance for comparison to patterns derived from empirical <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> data from two regional-scale (100 s km) empirical studies. We demonstrate the use of spatial occupancy data in a distance-to-edge (DTE) model to assess changes in geographical range edges of fish species within a temperate reef fish community. Results: Simulations identified how sampling design can produce relatively larger error in <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> estimates in less abundant species, patterns that correspond with those observed in real data. Application of the DTE model allowed us to estimate {{the location of the}} true range edge with high accuracy in common species. In addition, upper confidence bounds for range edge estimates identified species with range edges that have likely shifted in location. Conclusions: Simulation and modelling approaches used to quantify the level of confidence that can be placed in observed <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> are particularly valuable for studies of marine species, where observations are typically few and patchy. Given the observed variability in <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> estimates, the inclusion of confidence bounds on estimates of geographical range edges will advance our capacity to disentangle true distributional change from artefacts of sampling design...|$|R

These strategies were implemented on a landscape typical of fragmentation in the United Kingdom using spatial rules to differentiate between the allocation of strategies adjacent to or away from existing habitat patches. The total area being managed in the landscape was set at realistic levels based on recent habitat management trends. Eight species were parameterised to broadly represent different stage structure, population densities and modes of dispersal. Simulations were initialised with the species occupying 20 % of the landscape and run for 100 years. As would be expected for a range of real taxa, <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> abilities were dramatically different. This translated into large differences in their responses to the adaptation strategies. With conservative (0. 5 %) estimates of the area prescribed for climate change adaptation, few species display noticeable improvements in their <b>range</b> <b>shifting,</b> demonstrating the need for greater investment in future adaptation. With a larger (1 %) prescribed area, greater <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> improvements were found, although results were still species-specific.

In this paper we utilise a spatially explicit cellular lattice, colonisation-extinction model to investigate the effect of habitat loss, fragmentation and species characteristics on <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> in response to climate change. Contrary to the predictions of patch occupancy in static climate models we show that fragmentation can {{have a positive effect on}} species survival when species have high colonisation rates. For species with low colonisation rates aggregative behaviours prevent success on fragmented landscapes at high levels of habitat loss, and <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> is more successfully achieved where habitat is correlated. At levels of habitat loss near the extinction threshold, less fragmented landscapes can facilitate <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> even for the best colonisers. We discuss how imposing a climate window may reduce percolation routes and have implications for the area of usable habitat at any given level of habitat availability. We demonstrate the importance of landscape structure for <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> dynamics and argue that management of reserve networks needs to consider the requirements of species with different life history characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Organisms can {{cope with}} {{changing}} temperature under climate change by either {{adapting to the}} temperature at which they perform best and/or by dispersing to more benign locations. The evolution of a new thermal niche during <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> is, however, expected to be strongly constrained by genetic load because spatial sorting is known to induce fast evolution of dispersal. To broaden our understanding of this interaction, we studied the joint evolution of dispersal and thermal performance curves (TPCs) of a population during <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> by applying an individual-based spatially explicit model. Always, TPCs adapted to the local thermal conditions. Remarkably, this adaptation coincided with an evolution of dispersal at the shifting range front being equally high or lower than at the trailing edge.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of global climate-driven changes, marine ecosystems are experiencing polewards redistributions of species â€“ or <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> â€“ across taxa and throughout latitudes worldwide. Research on these <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> largely focuses on understanding and predicting changes {{in the distribution of}} individual species. The ecological effects of marine <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> on ecosystem structure and functioning, as well as human coastal communities, can be large, yet remain difficult to anticipate and manage. Here, we use qualitative modelling of system feedback to understand the cumulative impacts of multiple species shifts in south-eastern Australia, a global hotspot for ocean warming. We identify range-shifting species that can induce trophic cascades and affect ecosystem dynamics and productivity, and evaluate the potential effectiveness of alternative management interventions to mitigate these impacts. Our results suggest that the negative ecological impacts of multiple simultaneous <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> generally add up. Thus, implementing whole-of-ecosystem management strategies and regular monitoring of range-shifting species of ecological concern are necessary to effectively intervene against undesirable consequences of marine <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> at the regional scale.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{transforming}} {{the structure of}} biological communities through the geographic extension and contraction of speciesâ€™ ranges. Range edges are naturally dynamic, and shifts in the location of range edges occur at different rates and are driven by different mechanisms. This leads to challenges when seeking to generalize responses among taxa and across systems. We focus on warming-related <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> in marine systems to describe extensions and contractions as stages. Range extensions occur as a sequence of (1) arrival, (2) population increase, and (3) persistence. By contrast, range contractions occur progressively as (1) performance decline, (2) population decrease and (3) local extinction. This stage-based framework can be broadly applied to geographic shifts in any species, life-history stage, or population subset. Ideally the probability of transitioning through progressive <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> stages could be estimated from empirical understanding of the various factors influencing <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> rates. Nevertheless, abundance and occupancy data at the spatial resolution required to quantify <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> are often unavailable and we suggest the pragmatic solution of considering observations of <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> within a confidence framework incorporating the type, amount and quality of data. We use case studies to illustrate how diverse evidence sources {{can be used to}} stage range extensions and contractions and assign confidence that an observed <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> stage has been reached. We then evaluate the utility of trait-based risk (invasion) and vulnerability (extinction) frameworks for application in a <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> context and find inadequacies, indicating an important area for development. We further consider factors that influence rates of extension and contraction of range edges in marine habitats.

Large-scale <b>shifts</b> in the <b>ranges</b> of marine species will likely have dramatic socio-economic and management implications.

A simulation model is developed which incorporates three key features that have been largely overlooked in studies of <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> dynamics: the form of intraspecific competition, density dependent dispersal and the transient dynamics of habitat patches. The results show that the exact shape of the response depends critically on both local and patch dynamics. Species whose intraspecific competition is contest based are more vulnerable than those whose competition is scramble based. Contesters are especially sensitive when combined with density dependent dispersal. Species living in patches whose carrying capacity grows slowly are also susceptible to rapid shifts of environmental conditions.

During cur- rent range shifts, species are simultaneously confronted with a second major anthropogenic disturbance, landscape fragmentation. Using individual-based models with a shifting climate window, we examine the effect of different rates of climate change on the evolution of dispersal distances through changes in the genetically determined dispersal kernel. Our results demonstrate that the rate of climate change is positively correlated to the evolved dispersal distances although too fast climate change causes the population to crash. When faced with realistic rates of climate change, greater dispersal distances evolve than those required for the population {{to keep track of the}} climate, thereby maximizing population size. Importantly, the greater dispersal distances that evolve when climate change is more rapid, induce evolutionary rescue by facilitating the population in crossing large gaps in the landscape. This could ensure population persistence in case of <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> in fragmented landscapes.

Our process-based modelled migration rates generally exceeded the postglacial <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> rates indicating that the process-based models we used are capable of predicting migration rates that are in accordance with realized past migration.

These challenge marine resource users' capacity to adapt to a changing climate and managers' ability to implement adaptation plans. In particular, a reluctance to attribute marine <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> to climate change can undermine the effectiveness of climate change communications and pose a potential barrier to successful adaptation.

An examination of the attribution by marine resource users of three types of <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> experienced in a marine climate change hotspot in southeast Australia to various climate and non-climate drivers indicates the existence of at least three contributing cognitions.

40|$|Resurvey of {{historical}} plant distribution data can provide valuable {{information about how}} plant communities have changed, a topic which is of great interest due to recent decades of climate and land use change. <b>Range</b> <b>shifts</b> towards higher elevations have been observed for alpine vegetation in mountainous areas {{all over the world}} during the recent decades. A correlation in time between the observed <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> and climatic changes has led to an expectation of climate as the driving factor, while other factors and their interactions with climate have received less attention. One factor which might affect species distribution, both directly and in interaction with climate, is dynamics in the species communities induced by two key factors of disturbance: large herbivores and hikers. Intensity of these factors has changed dramatically over the past century. I investigated the effect of large herbivore grazing and hiking on upward plant species <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> and dynamics in the summit flora species composition, through a resurvey study in three areas along the south-north axis of the Scandes.

Globally we used rigorous selection criteria to investigate studies describing <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> in marine organisms, including exclusion of single-species studies and those that inferred <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> through shifting abundance. For each species meeting these criteria (311 species from 13 studies), the distance in kilometres moved per year was calculated, and life history characteristics such as mobility, habitat, dispersal potential and trophic level were recorded to assess if these were linked to the shifts. We also examined the potential correlation between changing sea surface temperatures and <b>range</b> <b>shifts.</b> Regionally we analysed the intertidal mollusc collection of the Australian Museum and Museum of Victoria and consulted with mollusc experts to determine if museum records {{could be used to}} detect <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> in marine invertebrates. The global meta-analysis showed that individual species shifted on average 8. 9 km polewards per year. <b>Range</b> <b>shifts</b> were not significantly related to temperature change or life history characteristics with the exception of intertidal and nearshore subtidal fauna showing poleward shifts (6. 8 and 14. 3 km per decade, respectively) and shelf fauna showing a slight equatorial shift (2. 7 km per decade). Our regional analysis showed that 54 of the 634 mollusc species examined <b>shifted</b> their <b>range</b> into or out of the well-surveyed Sydney region.

40|$|Species â€™ range {{expansions}} {{in response}} to climate change, and the invasion of exotic organisms, {{are two of the}} most pressing issues in ecology. Range expansions have already been documented in several taxa, including butterflies, grasshoppers and crickets, and birds, and as climate continues to change we can expect the ranges of many species to alter. Invasion of exotic organisms is of great interest currently because of the damage caused by many invasive species. Within a model, we find that during range expansion, selection generally favours individuals with a higher propensity for dispersal. This character change results in a more rapid spread than expected assuming evolutionary stasis. We show that Allee effects can slow invasion by reducing both selection for increased dispersal and chance of survival for propagules beyond the current range. Understanding how dispersal and other characters might evolve at expanding range margins is important not only for the prediction of range shifts {{in response to}} anthropogenic climate change, but also for understanding <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> during previous natural climate change and for assessing the likely invasion dynamics of an introduced species...|$|E

Interestingly, the nonrange expander T. pratensis experienced a net negative soil effect throughout this entire range.

We examined relationships among traits and <b>range</b> <b>shift</b> metrics either singly using univariate linear modeling or combined with multivariate redundancy analysis. We found that trophic and dispersal traits were associated with shifts at the leading and trailing edges, respectively, although projected <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> were largely unexplained by traits.

Fishes that were more mobile shifted upslope most at the trailing edge, defying predictions. No traits explained changes in range center or size. Finally, current preference explained multivariate <b>range</b> <b>shifts,</b> as fishes with faster current preferences exhibited smaller multivariate changes. Although <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> were largely unexplained by traits, more specialized invertivorous fishes with lower dispersal propensity or greater current preference may require the greatest conservation efforts because of their limited capacity to <b>shift</b> <b>ranges</b> under climate change...|$|R
40|$|Differences in the {{trophic ecology}} of several {{littoral}} fish species along thermal gradients at the Western European shoreline were investigated {{as part of}} the EU/BMBF funded ERANET project MarinERA Marine phylogeographic structuring during climate change: the signature of leading and rear edge of <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> populations. The aim was {{to assess the impact of}} climate change on the adaptability and changes in the feeding behaviour of specific littoral fish populations at their northern and southern distribution limits (cold- and warm-adapted species). During a first sampling campaign in 2009 the target fish species Pomatoschistus minutus, Ctenolabrus rupestris and Symphodus melops as well as herbivores (Littorina littorea and Mytilus edulis) from different populations were sampled along a gradient from 36 Â°N to 58 Â°N thus experiencing different thermal conditions. Fatty acid profiles and stable isotope signatures (&# 948; 13 C, &# 948; 15 N) as indicators for the trophic ecology of target fish species and herbivores were analysed and variations along latitudinal gradients assessed. Furthermore, issues such as the degree of trophic overlap between target fish species, their niche widths and their adaptive potential will be addressed in the light of ongoing climate change...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic species' ranges, {{those that}} are either {{invasive}} or shifting in response to environmental change, {{are the focus of}} much recent interest in ecology, evolution, and genetics. Understanding how range expansions can shape evolutionary trajectories requires the consideration of nonneutral variability and genetic architecture, yet the majority of empirical and theoretical work to date has explored patterns of neutral variability. Here we use forward computer simulations of population growth, dispersal, and mutation to explore how range-shifting dynamics can influence evolution on rugged fitness landscapes. We employ a two-locus model, incorporating sign epistasis, and find that there is an increased likelihood of fitness peak shifts during a period of range expansion. Maladapted valley genotypes can accumulate at an expanding range front through a phenomenon called mutation surfing, which increases the likelihood that a mutation leading to a higher peak will occur. Our results indicate that most peak shifts occur close to the expanding front. We also demonstrate that periods of <b>range</b> <b>shifting</b> are especially important for peak shifting in species with narrow geographic distributions. Our results imply that trajectories on rugged fitness landscapes can be modified substantially when ranges are dynamic...|$|E
40|$|Dispersal {{is a key}} {{component}} of a species's ecology and will be under different selection pressures {{in different parts of the}} range. For example, a long-distance dispersal strategy suitable for continuous habitat at the range core might not be favoured at the margin, where the habitat is sparse. Using a spatially explicit, individual-based, evolutionary simulation model, the dispersal strategies of an organism that has only one dispersal event in its lifetime, such as a plant or sessile animal, are considered. Within the model, removing habitat, increasing habitat turnover, increasing the cost of dispersal, reducing habitat quality or altering vital rates imposes range limits. In most cases, there is a clear change in the dispersal strategies across the range, although increasing death rate towards the margin has little impact on evolved dispersal strategy across the range. Habitat turnover, reduced birth rate and reduced habitat quality all increase evolved dispersal distances at the margin, while increased cost of dispersal and reduced habitat density lead to lower evolved dispersal distances at the margins. As climate change shifts suitable habitat poleward, species ranges will also start to shift, and it will be the dispersal capabilities of marginal populations, rather than core populations, that will influence the rate of <b>range</b> <b>shifting...</b>|$|E

40|$|Copyright Â© 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRSForecasts {{of species}} endangerment under climate change usually ignore the {{processes}} by which species <b>ranges</b> <b>shift.</b> By analysing the 'climate paths' that <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> might follow, and two key range-shift processes [...] dispersal and population persistence [...] we show that short-term climatic and population characteristics have dramatic effects on range-shift forecasts. By employing this approach with 15 amphibian species in the western USA, we make unexpected predictions. First, inter-decadal variability in climate change can prevent <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> by causing gaps in climate paths, {{even in the absence}} of geographic barriers. Second, the hitherto unappreciated trait of persistence during unfavourable climatic conditions is critical to species <b>range</b> <b>shifts.</b> Third, climatic fluctuations and low persistence could lead to endangerment even if the future potential range size is large. These considerations may render habitat corridors ineffectual for some species, and conservationists may need to consider managed relocation and augmentation of in situ populations.

40|$|Climate {{change will}} cause <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> of many {{species in the}} future. Galliformes might be {{particularly}} vulnerable to climate change, as they have low dispersal ability. Little is known about their possible responses to the future climate. We used a generalized additive model to predict the current and future ranges of all 63 Galliformes in China, based on a comprehensive species occurrence database and a combination of climate variables. Other environmental variables (e. g. elevation and human footprint index) were also considered, {{as well as the}} latitude and longitude of the occurrences. Principal component analysis was conducted to illustrate the association between environmental variables and Galliformes distributions. Using the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A 2 climate change scenario for 2071 - 2100, we projected that 29 species would have <b>range</b> <b>shifts</b> over 50 %, including 13 endemic species. Galliformes at higher elevation face greater <b>range</b> <b>shifts.</b> Northward shifts are greater than those in other directions. We suggest conservationists pay special attention to the 29 Galliformes that face extensive <b>range</b> <b>shifts,</b> especially the endemic species among them...|$|R
