5|$|In product-focused companies, design {{management}} focuses mainly on product {{design management}}, including strong interactions with product design, product marketing, <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> <b>and</b> new product development.

5|$|Lilly's {{greatest}} {{contributions to}} the industry were his standardized and methodical production of drugs, his dedication to <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> <b>and</b> the therapeutic value of the drugs he created. As {{a pioneer in the}} modern pharmaceutical industry, many of his innovations later became standard practice. Lilly's ethical reforms, in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines, began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs. During his lifetime, Lilly had advocated for federal regulation on medicines; his son, Josiah, continued that advocacy following his father's death.|$|E

5|$|Not {{everyone}} served aboard ships {{during the}} war. Some men like Jose R. Zaragoza served on missions on some lonely atolls. When 19-year-old Zaragoza, {{a native of}} Los Angeles, California, joined the Coast Guard, he was sent on patrols in the Pacific coast of the United States to defend against sabotage and invasion from the Japanese. Later he received instructions in the then-emerging and secretive field of LORAN navigation and was sent to Ulithi atoll, located between Guam and the Philippines.

5|$|The {{final cost}} of Apollo was {{reported}} to Congress as $25.4 billion in 1973, It took {{up the majority of}} NASA's budget while it was being developed. For example, in 1966 it accounted for about 60 percent of NASA's total $5.2 billion budget. That {{was one of the biggest}} investment of the US in science, <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> <b>and</b> employed thousands of American scientists.

5|$|Groves {{hoped that}} a new, {{permanent}} agency {{would be created}} {{to take over the}} responsibilities of the wartime Manhattan Project in 1945, but passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 through Congress took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The act that was signed by President Harry S. Truman on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project, but the commissioners were not appointed until October, and AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, the Military Appropriation Act of 1946 gave the Manhattan Project $72.4 million for <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> <b>and</b> $19 million for housing and utilities at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Ohio is {{considered}} a center of science and industry, with museums dedicated to such in Columbus, COSI, the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland, the Imagination Station in Toledo, and the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery in Dayton. The state includes many historically strong industries, such as banking and insurance, which accounts for 8% of the gross state product, motor vehicle manufacturing, <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> <b>and</b> steel production, accounting for 14-17% of the nation's raw output. More traditional industries include agriculture, employing one out of seven Ohioans, and new and developing sectors include bioscience, green, information, and food processing industries. Ohio is the biggest manufacturer of plastics and rubber in the country, has the largest bioscience sector in the Midwest, and ranked fourth {{in the country for}} green economic growth through 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> <b>and</b> government support.|$|E
