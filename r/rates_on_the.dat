5|$|DAB {{technically}} provides low {{audio quality}} in the UK due to 98% of stereo stations using a bit rate level of 128 kbit/s. with the MP2 audio codec, which provides poorer sound quality than FM-quality (assuming good reception on both DAB and FM). In addition, DAB+ stations broadcast in the UK use a bitrate between 24 and 48kbit/s. A bit rate of 256 kbit/s has been judged to provide a high quality stereo broadcast signal. Also, a large and growing number of music stations are only transmitting in mono. Indeed, the bit rates used by the radio stations on other digital platforms, such as cable, terrestrial and satellite are usually higher than on DAB, so the audio quality is also higher. For example, all of the BBC stations use higher bit <b>rates</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> digital TV platforms than on DAB apart from the BBC World Service on Freeview. On the other hand, an Ofcom survey, which was undertaken due to many consultation responses citing poor DAB quality, found that 94% of DAB listeners thought DAB was at least as good as FM.|$|E

40|$|Herrnstein's {{hyperbola}} {{describes the}} relation between response rate and reinforcer <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> variable-interval (VI) schedules. According to Herrnstein's (1970) interpretation, the parameter re represents the reinforcer rate extraneous to the alternative to which the equation is fitted (the target alternative). The hyperbola {{is based on an}} assumption that extraneous reinforcer rate remains constant with changes in reinforcer <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target alternative (the constant-re assumption) and that matching with no bias and perfect sensitivity occurs between response and reinforcer ratios. In the present experiment, 12 rats pressed levers for food on a series of 10 VI schedules arranged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target alternative. Across conditions, six VI values and extinction were arranged on a second alternative. Reinforcer <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second alternative, r 2, negatively covaried with reinforcer <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target alternative for five of the six VI values <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second alternative, and significant degrees of bias and undermatching occurred in response ratios. Given covariation of reinforcer <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second and target alternatives, the constant-re assumption can be maintained only by assuming that reinforcer rate from unmeasured background sources, rb, covaries with reinforcer <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second alternative such that their sum, re, remains constant. In a single-schedule arrangement, however, re equals rb and thus rb is assumed to remain constant, forcing a conceptual inconsistency between single- and concurrent-schedule arrangements. Furthermore, although an alternative formulation of the hyperbola can account for variations in bias and sensitivity, the modified equation also is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> constant-re assumption and therefore suffers from the same logical problem as the hyperbola when reinforcer <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second alternative covaries with reinforcer <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target alternative...|$|R

In the initial calculations they had assumed similar sortie rates as commercial aircraft like the Boeing 747, flying long multi-hour flights from the oil fields in Alaska to California.

25|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and {{its impact}} on the {{alternative}} minimum tax (AMT) reduced nominal <b>rates</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wealthy and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals. The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced bracket creep from inflation. The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received a tax break, restoring a flatter tax system. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as a problem with the tax code. Through 2007, the revised AMT had brought in more tax revenue than the former tax code, which has made it difficult for Congress to reform.|$|E
