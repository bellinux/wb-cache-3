25|$|On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo {{killed and}} {{mutilated}} a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. While leaving the crime scene, he was observed by an undercover officer. The policeman observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash {{his hands and}} face. When he approached the station, the undercover officer noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek. To the officer, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near the station {{at that time of}} year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. The policeman stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When the policeman returned to his office, he filed a <b>routine</b> <b>report,</b> containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station.|$|E

According to Finnish National Archive researcher Kauko Rumpunen, Franklin Roosevelt warned Procopé about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its contents on August 28, 1939. Prior to this Procopé had received information about the pact from other sources and he informed Finland with a telegram on August 23, 1939, the day the pact was signed. Roosevelt’s warning officially arrived in Finland a month after the meeting between Roosevelt and Procopé as part of a <b>routine</b> <b>report.</b> This report was not taken entirely seriously by the government of Finland, partly {{due to the fact that}} Roosevelt never revealed the original source of the tip, a subordinate of Joachim von Ribbentrop.|$|E

In the circumstances Peter and Lesley decide to write off a kid's party 'fairy light' as a Lighter Fluid Trick that went wrong, at least so far as the official 'mundane' Metropolitan Police record goes. Returning to the Folly they discuss their main concern (the Faceless Man plus associates) with Nightingale who surmises if his master's master (Wheatcroft) hadn't learned the art of magical blacksmithing (the Way of the Sons of Wayland) which he hadn't, confirmed by the advanced stage of brain damage suffered by his student, Albert Woodville-Gentle.|$|E
