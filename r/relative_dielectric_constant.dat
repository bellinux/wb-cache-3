Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water; water may be also soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials aren't too susceptible, with absorption of only 0.15%. Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%.

50|$|At {{these new}} multigigabit/s bit rates, the bit period is {{shorter than the}} flight time; echoes of {{previous}} pulses can arrive at the receiver {{on top of the}} main pulse and corrupt it. In communication engineering this is called intersymbol interference (ISI). In signal integrity engineering it is usually called eye closure (a reference to the clutter {{in the center of a}} type of oscilloscope trace called an eye diagram). When the bit period is shorter than the flight time, elimination of reflections using classic microwave techniques like matching the electrical impedance of the transmitter to the interconnect, the sections of interconnect to each other, and the interconnect to the receiver, is crucial. Termination with a source or load is a synonym for matching at the two ends. The interconnect impedance that can be selected is constrained by the impedance of free space (~377 Ω), a geometric form factor and by the square root of the <b>relative</b> <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> of the stripline filler (typically FR-4, with a <b>relative</b> <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> of ~4).
