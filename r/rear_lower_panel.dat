2500|$|In 1958 the Roadmaster {{could only}} be ordered as the well {{equipped}} Roadmaster 75, and its body was adorned with bulkier more heavily chromed styling. A new [...] "drawer pull" [...] grille was used, made up of rectangular chrome squares. For {{the first time since}} 1948 there were no distinguishing VentiPorts on the front fenders. On the rear deck the Roadmaster name was spelled out in block lettering beneath a Buick emblem housing the trunk lock keyway. Wheelhouses had bright moldings, rocker panels had an ebbed molding and a large rear fender bright flash with ribbed inserts replaced the previous year's chromed <b>rear</b> fender <b>lower</b> <b>panel.</b> Four headlamps were standard. New brakes, with cast iron liners in aluminum drums, proved to be the best in the industry. But sales fell further to about 14,000.|$|R
5000|$|Presented as a saloon at the London Motor Show in October 1958, the A40 Farina was {{intended}} to replace the Austin A35, from which it inherited much of its running gear, and was a capacious thoroughly modern small car, with a brand new distinctive [...] "two box" [...] shape and headroom in the back seat. It was a saloon, the <b>lower</b> <b>rear</b> <b>panel</b> dropped like a then conventional bootlid, the rear window remaining fixed.|$|R
2500|$|A {{lower body}} graced the 1957 Roadmaster {{with an even}} more {{panoramic}} windshield equipped with reverse slanted pillars. A red-filled Sweepspear lined the bodysides and a chromed <b>rear</b> fender <b>lower</b> <b>panel</b> filled the area between the wheelhouse and the bumper end, continuing to offer [...] "Dagmar bumpers" [...] at the front. A new centered fuel filler {{was found in the}} rear bumper, the ends of which the single or optional dual exhaust passed through. Roadmaster script was found within the deck and grille emblems. Two door models had a trio of chevrons on the rear quarters but the four door models had a Roadmaster emblem nestled within the Sweepspear dip. Interiors featured a padded dashboard and were broadcloth and nylon in 4-doors, nylon in 2-doors and leather in convertibles. There was a new 364-cubic-inch engine, developing 300 horsepower. A new ball-joint suspension system improved handling. Evidently the 4-door Riviera hardtop proved so popular on its introduction the previous year that the pillared sedan was dropped entirely from the model lineup. Also, new was a mid-year production ( [...] March 1957) Roadmaster designated as Model 75 which was distinguished by standard power seats and windows, carpeted lower doors, a one piece rear window (instead of a three piece which were a steadfast design feature found only on the smaller Jr model lines of the Special and Century), Deluxe hubcaps and a Series 75 script found on the rear quarter [...] body panel of the R.M. Coupes and the rear door panels on the R.M. 4-door sedans, thus replacing the standard 3 chevrons found in the same location on the standard full model year Roadmaster model lines. [...] Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales plunged to about 33,000. However, this [...] "sales plunge" [...] was not an isolated occurrence found only at GM but was one shared by all manufacturers to one extent or another due to a capital market recession which effected the overall economy starting in late 1956 and extending into 1958.|$|R
