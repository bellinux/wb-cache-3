40|$|In several visual tasks, {{participants}} {{report that}} they feel confident about discrimination responses {{at a level of}} stimulation at which they would report not seeing the stimulus. How general and reliable is this effect? We compared subjective <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> discrimination confidence and subjective <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> visibility in an orientation discrimination task with varying stimulus contrast. Participants applied more liberal criteria for subjective <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> discrimination confidence than for visibility. While <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> discrimination confidence were more efficient in predicting trial accuracy than <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> visibility, only <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> visibility but not confidence were associated with stimulus contrast in incorrect trials. It is argued that the distinction between discrimination confidence and visibility can be reconciled with both the partial awareness hypothesis and higher order thought theory. We suggest that consciousness research would benefit from differentiating between subjective <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> visibility and confidence...|$|R

5|$|In 1843, John C. Fremont led {{the first}} {{scientific}} {{expedition to the}} lake, but with winter coming on, {{he did not take}} the time to survey the entire lake.

John Fremont's overly glowing reports of the area were published shortly after his expedition. Stansbury also published a formal <b>report</b> <b>of</b> his survey work which became very popular.

Modelling and reinforcement for true <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> each behavior increased both reporting and actual behavior. Experiment II showed that both reported and actual sharing and praising may be increased by modelling and reinforcement for true <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> the target behavior, without previous reinforcement for any (true or untrue) <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> those behaviors. Sharing, but not praising, generalized to a second setting. Experiment III replicated the results of Experiment II for sharing and praising, and demonstrated similar success in increasing a third behavior, specific praising. In general, these experiments show that developing correspondence between children's <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> behavior and actual behavior may be an efficient means of increasing prosocial responses...|$|R
