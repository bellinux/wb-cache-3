5|$|In the four-armed form, a <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> holds a parashu (axe) {{and another}} makes an abhaya mudra (gesture of reassurance), {{or one of}} the right arms is {{slightly}} bent and rests on the head of Shiva's bull mount, Nandi, while the other is held in the abhaya mudra gesture. Another configuration suggests that a <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> holds a trishula (trident) and another makes a varada mudra (gesture of blessing). Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and akshamala (rosary) are held in the two right hands. In the two-armed form, the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> holds a kapala (skull cup) or gestures in a varada mudra. He may also hold a skull. In the Badami relief, the four-armed Ardhanarishvara plays a veena (lute), using a left and a right arm, while other male arm holds a parashu and the female one a lotus.|$|E

40|$|Freedom {{from global}} {{anomalies}} {{in the presence}} of a local $SU(2) _H$ horizontal symmetry under which <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> charged leptons transform nontrivially requires that there be at least two <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrinos with masses of order of the horizontal symmetry breaking scale. If a third <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrino is introduced to satisfy quark lepton symmetry, it is unprotected by the horizontal symmetry, becomes superheavy with a Planck scale mass and decouples from lower energy physics. The resulting seesaw mechanism with two <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrinos in combination with the horizontal symmetry leads naturally to a near bimaximal pattern for the neutrino mixing with an inverted mass hierarchy and is compatible with all data. It predicts a correlation between the solar mixing angle and $U_{e 3 }$, that can be testable in the proposed long baseline experiments...|$|R

5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> {{to the head}} that caused Mayweather to retreat to the ropes and cover up.

Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{observation}} of high energy neutrino in IceCube experiment suggests existence of superheavy dark matter beyond PeV. We identify the parent particles of neutrino as two degenerated <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrinos, assuming {{the dark matter}} is the heaviest <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrino. The O(V_cb) ∼ O(10 ^- 2) flavor symmetry breaking accounts for the O(10 ^- 4) mass degeneracy of <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrinos which is a sizable scale to explain the successful resonant leptogenesis at the PeV scale. At the same time, non-thermal production of the heaviest <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrino gives {{the right amount of}} dark matter for T_RH∼ 10 PeV. The footprint of flavor symmetry is left in degenerated mass spectra of extra Higgs multiplet and colored Higgs multiplet which may be testable for LHC or future colliders.

40|$|We {{implement}} soft leptogenesis in a warped five dimensional scenario {{with two}} branes on the orbifold boundaries coming from an S 1 /Z 2 symmetry, and supersymmetry broken on the IR brane. The SM hypermultiplet fields (fermions and Higgs) {{live in the}} UV brane and we allow the vector supermultiplets corresponding to the gauge bosons and a hypermultiplet corresponding to the <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrino {{to live in the}} bulk. We assume that there are Majorana mass terms for the <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrino superfield fixed on each brane {{and that there is a}} Yukawa term involving the <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> neutrino, the left handed neutrino and the Higgs fixed on the UV brane. Supersymmetry is broken by a constant “superpotential ” on the IR brane, which induces an F-term for the radion hypermultiplet. This F-term leads to a B-term for the <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> sneutrinos as well as a soft SUSY breaking gaugino mass in the 4 D theory for the zero modes. The gaugino mass naturally induces an A-term for the <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> sneutrino, left handed sneutrino and the Higgs to be formed through gaugino mediation with a non-trivial CP violating phase. Moreover, we show that within the context o...|$|R

5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory.

The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak.

40|$|Left or <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> alpha {{helicity}} can {{be induced}} in a pentapeptide (ANGYG) by appending left or <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> helical cycles as chiral templates.
