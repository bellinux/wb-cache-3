40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{experimental work}} undertaken to investigate interference criteria on high frequency (HF) radio link terminal equipment when operated {{in close proximity}} to wireline systems and in particular with reference to close proximity in-building powerline telecommunication (PLT) systems. The application of radio frequency signals to electricity distribution networks, particularly in-building networks, might enable <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> sections of the electromagnetic spectrum which would otherwise not be possible. Due to the characteristics of electricity networks the application of HF signals for PLT purposes offers a good compromise in terms of reach per watt per Hz. The high data rates, required by modem applications, can only be achieved using higher frequencies, and are of necessity outside the CELNEC standards. Hence, in the present research the focus is to develop technically feasible solutions, which are not covered by these existing standards. However, in the area of commercial and residential electronics, it becomes necessary for products in the European market place to meet European EMC regulations. This research was aimed at bridging this gap. In this paper, some basic results of studies regarding the egress and ingress from potential in-building power infrastructure is considered...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{incidence}} of contamination and current practice of decontamination of nebulisers after use within a ventilator circuit, in public- and private sector intensive care units (ICUs) in Johannesburg; to assess the presence of and adherence to a decontamination protocol in these ICUs and to identify which practices were associated with lower or no bacterial growth. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used which included a semi-structured interview with the ICU manager and an audit of current nebuliser practice. Nebulisers that were identified in the interview were swabbed and streaked on blood agar plates (BAPs). BAPs were incubated and assessed for bacterial colonisation, number of colony forming units (CFUs) and number of different species of CFUs present. Results: Two hundred and sixty-nine ICU beds were surveyed over a two-month period resulting in 45 nebulisers used within a ventilator circuit that could be tested. The majority (93 %) were single-use jet nebulisers, all were being re-used and 52 % presented with contamination. None of the ICUs had a nebuliser decontamination protocol in place. Contaminated nebulisers that were stored in a sterile drape had significantly higher concentrations of bacterial growth (p= 0. 03). Conclusion: The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> colonisation <b>of</b> <b>re-used</b> jet nebulisers is high. Nebuliser decontamination protocols are urgently needed...|$|R
50|$|The Chinese {{government}} has extensively studied the EU’s and Japan’s models of material flow analysis, {{where they have}} adapted it to fit their needs using the input of various actors and government agencies. The Chinese indicator system {{is based on the}} 3R principle, where two separate indicator systems are used for meso and macro level measurement. The only difference between the two indicator systems is that macro level measurement takes into account recycling at the regional level. Both indicator systems categorize quantitative data in the same four categories, being resource output, resource consumption, integrated resource utilization and reduction in waste generation. Resource output is the measure of GDP produced from consumption of land, energy and water, where higher ratios indicate resource efficiency. Resource consumption refers to the measurement of resources consumed per unit GDP level, where lower ratios indicate that less resources were used by the economic system. The implications for this measurement is that it demonstrates that there are fewer impacts on the natural environment, while having high economic returns. Integrated resource utilization measures the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>re-using</b> industrial water and recycling industrial waste, where high ratios indicate efficient resource recycling and regeneration of those material back into the economy. Having a high ratio on the integrated resource utilization indicator demonstrates a reduction in the use of natural resources and waste being sent to landfill sites. The reduction in waste generation indicator measures the total amount of waste disposal and emission of pollutants, where lower ratios indicate that there are low levels of waste needed to be disposed and low levels of toxic emissions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{reducing}} agricultural pollution caused by plastic film and increasing soil moisture and water use efficiency (WUE), the field experiments {{were conducted to}} investigate the effects <b>of</b> <b>re-used</b> plastic film mulching on soil moisture, sunflower’s yield and water use efficiency by compared with new plastic film mulching and bare field in Hetao area, China. The results showed that, soil water <b>of</b> <b>re-used</b> film mulching increased at different degree. Compared with bare field and new film mulching, soi 1 moisture <b>of</b> <b>re-used</b> film were higher significantly 1. 5 percentage points in 0 - 100 cm, and especially 1. 9 or 2. 6 percentage points in 0 - 10 cm during sunflower’s growth stage. Soil water <b>of</b> <b>re-used</b> film {{was more than that}} of bare field 24. 8 mm (in 2010) and 33. 0 mm (in 2011) before seeding, and 21. 6 mm (in 2010) and 24. 5 mm (in 2011) at harvest when soil water was replenished to same level for each treatment before sowing. Meanwhile, the grain yield <b>of</b> <b>re-used</b> film was higher significantly than that of bare field 11. 4 % (in 2010) and 16. 8 % (in 2011), and WUE <b>of</b> <b>re-used</b> film was higher significantly 15. 7 % (in 2010) and 22. 7 % (in 2011) respectively, no significant with new film. So it was worth to apply re-used film to agriculture production for improving the soil moisture, enhancing water use efficiency and increasing the yield of sunflower. We suggest that the application <b>of</b> <b>re-used</b> film mulching is a suitable soil management practice for increase water and WUE in Hetao area or other areas with similar conditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe chill-on-demand {{system is}} a new {{technology}} designed to provide cooled products on demand, thereby avoiding chilled storage. It uses the cooling effect provided by endothermic desorption of carbon dioxide previously adsorbed onto a bed of activated carbon and {{has the potential to}} be applied to any type of product that needs to be cold at the point of consumption. The principles of life cycle engineering have been utilized to evaluate the overall environmental performance of one possible application of this technology: a self-chilling beverage can, with a steel outer can to contain the beverage and an inner aluminium can to contain the adsorbent. An attributional life cycle assessment has been undertaken considering all the life cycle stages of a self-chilling can: manufacture of each part of the beverage container, its utilization, collection of the used can, and management of the waste by reuse, recycling and landfilling. Activated carbon production is included in detail, to assess its contribution to the overall life cycle. The results are compared with those for conventional aluminium and steel beverage cans stored in two types of retail chiller: a single door refrigerator and a large open-front cooler. A sensitivity analysis explores alternative scenarios for activated carbon production and for recovery of the can components post-use for reuse or recycling. The results highlight the importance of using activated carbon produced from biomass by a process with efficient use of low-carbon electrical energy, energy recovery from waste streams and appropriate air pollution control, and <b>of</b> achieving high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> recovery, <b>re-use</b> and recycling <b>of</b> the cans after use. The results suggest limited markets into which the product might be introduced, particularly where it would displace inefficient chilled storage in an electricity system with a high proportion of coal-fired generation...|$|R
