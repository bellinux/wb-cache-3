25|$|Radiation {{oncology}} is {{the medical}} specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and {{is distinct from}} radiology, the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis. Radiation may be prescribed by a <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologist</b> with intent to cure ("curative") or for adjuvant therapy. It may {{also be used as}} palliative treatment (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way.|$|E

40|$|There is no {{consensus}} on optimal use of radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe opinions of urologists and <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> regarding adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy. Methods: Urologists and genitourinary <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> were solicited to participate in an online survey. Respondent characteristics included demographics, training, practice setting, patient volume/experience, and access to radiotherapy. Participant practice patterns and attitudes towards use of adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy in standardized clinical scenarios were assessed. Results: One hundred and forty-six staff physicians participated in the survey (104 urologists and 42 genitourinary <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists).</b> Overall, high Gleason score (Gleason 7 vs. 6, RR 1. 37 95 % CI 1. 19 - 1. 56, p< 0. 0001 and Gleason 8 - 10 vs. 6, RR 1. 56 95 % CI 1. 37 - 1. 78, p< 0. 0001), positive surgical margin (RR 1. 43 95 % CI 1. 26 - 1. 62, p< 0. 0001), and extraprostatic tumour extension (RR 1. 16 95 % CI 1. 05 - 1. 28, p< 0. 002) conferred an increased probability of recommending adjuvant radiotherapy. <b>Radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> were more likely to recommend adjuvant radiotherapy across all clinical scenarios (RR 1. 48, 95 % CI 1. 39, 1. 60, p < 0. 001). Major differences were found for patients with Gleason 6 and isolated positive surgical margin (radiotherapy selected by 21 % of urologists vs. 70 % of <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists),</b> and patients with extraprostatic extension and negative surgical margins (radiotherapy selected by 18 % of urologist vs. 57 % of <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists).</b> Conclusions: Urologists and <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> frequently disagree about recommendation for post- prostatectomy adjuvant radiotherapy. Since clinical equipoise exists between adjuvant versus early salvage post- operative radiotherapy, support of clinical trials comparing these approaches is strongly encouraged...|$|R

50|$|Radiation Oncology {{training}} in Canada {{is very similar}} to the United States. <b>Radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> directly enter <b>radiation</b> oncology residencies of 5 years duration, with the first year as an internship year. During the next four years, residents complete intensive {{training in}} clinical oncology, in radiophysics and radiobiology, and in the treatment planning and delivery of radiotherapy. Most <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> also pursue a fellowship after their residency, examples of which include brachytherapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), gynecologic radiation oncology, and many others. <b>Radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> in Canada commonly treat two or three different anatomic sites, such as head and neck, breast, genitourinary, hematologic, gynecologic, central nervous system, or lung cancer.|$|R

40|$|Research on <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> has {{indicated}} {{that there is a}} shortage in supply of specialist workers in this field internationally, and also within Australia. However, there are no current estimates as to what the future Australian radiotherapy workforce will look like. This paper aims to review the current status and capacity of the three main disciplines that make up the radiation oncology workforce in Australia and project the workforce supply and demand for 2014 and 2019. Using data on the workforce from a survey of all radiotherapy facilities operating in Australia in 2008 a workforce model was constructed. This study found {{that there will be a}} future shortfall of <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists,</b> <b>radiation</b> therapists and radiation oncology medical physicists working in radiation oncology treatment. By 2014 there will be 109 fewer <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> than what will be demanded, and by 2019 this figure will increase to a shortfall of 155 <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists.</b> There was a projected shortfall of 612 radiation therapists by 2014, with this figure slightly decreasing to a shortfall of 593 radiation therapists in 2019. In 2014, there was projected to be a deficit of 104 radiation oncology medical physicists with a persisting shortfall of 78 in 2019.

40|$|Background. Our study aims to {{investigate}} whether information given by <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> to their patients is tailored to the patient's desired level of information and, if so, what the effect of tailoring is on patient-reported outcomes, i. e. satisfaction, health, anxiety and self-efficacy. Material and methods. Consecutive radiotherapy patients (n = 150) completed a baseline questionnaire one week before their initial consultation, immediately following this consultation, and again one week prior to their first follow-up visit. The initial consultation was videotaped and 10 radiation oncologists' information giving behavior (content and duration) analyzed. Results. The overall amount of {{information provided by the}} <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> matched with patients' information needs in 50. 8 % (k = 0. 07) of the consultations. No significant associations between tailored information giving and patient-reported outcomes were found, except for tailoring of information on procedures, and patients' anxiety and global health. These associations were no longer significant when correcting for patients' background characteristics. Conclusion. This study shows that <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> poorly tailor their information to the needs of their patients. However, lack of tailoring is not associated with worse patient-reported outcomes. Until more evidence is available, <b>radiation</b> <b>oncologists</b> may explicitly ask patients about their information preferences and tailor the information provided accordingl...|$|R
