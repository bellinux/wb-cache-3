5|$|Samarium is a <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metal</b> {{having a}} {{hardness}} and density {{similar to those}} of zinc. With the boiling point of 1794°C, samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore. At ambient conditions, samarium normally assumes a rhombohedral structure (α form). Upon heating to 731°C, its crystal symmetry changes into hexagonally close-packed (hcp), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922°C transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase. Heating to 300°C combined with compression to 40kbar results in a double-hexagonally close-packed structure (dhcp). Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900kbar. In one study, the dhcp phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700°C, confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Also, thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the hcp or dhcp phases at ambient conditions.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{for wind}} turbine parts {{other than the}} rotor blades (including the rotor hub, gearbox, frame, and tower) are largely {{composed}} of steel. Modern turbines uses a couple of tonnes of copper for generators, cables and such. Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components {{in an effort to}} make the turbines more lightweight and efficient, and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved. Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still, requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine. Additionally, step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines., In particular, this would require an increased supply of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metal</b> neodymium. Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials. In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.|$|E
500|$|Lanthanum is the third-most {{abundant}} {{of all the}} lanthanides, {{making up}} 39mg/kg of the Earth's crust, behind neodymium at 41.5mg/kg and cerium at 66.5mg/kg. It is almost three times as abundant as lead in the Earth's crust. Despite being among the so-called [...] "rare earth metals", lanthanum is thus not rare at all, but it is historically so named because it is rarer than [...] "common earths" [...] such as lime and magnesia, and historically only a few deposits were known. Lanthanum is considered a <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metal</b> because the process to mine it is difficult, time-consuming and expensive.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{will address}} the topic of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> and their product chain from early mining processes, through {{refining}} to final products and recycling. The analysis will cover the global product chain and its different actors. <b>Rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> consist of 17 elements of the periodic table; the 15 lanthanides, scandium and yttrium. Despite their name, these elements are not rare, but quite abundant all over the earth’s crust. Nevertheless, their concentration in the deposits is often very low and they are difficult to extract and refine. The <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> are similar in their characteristics {{and can be used}} for many different applications. <b>Rare</b> <b>earths</b> are commonly used in green technology since their unique properties can save weight and increase efficiency in products such as light bulbs, generators in wind power plants, and in different parts of hybrid and electric vehicles. The focus in this report will be on the product chains of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> used in permanent magnets and batteries used in hybrid and electric vehicles, these are: neodymium, praseodymium, lanthanum, dysprosium, cerium and terbium. In nature these elements do not occur as metals and many complicated processes are needed to convert them into metals. The product chain starts with the mining and separation processes, next comes further refining and separation processes, and then production of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> and alloys before they can be shaped into parts in a final product. In total China has more than 95 % of the global market for mining and separation processes for <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals,</b> also the production of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> and alloys occur to a large extent in China. The production of most permanent magnets also takes place in China, but there is also production in Japan, Finland and Germany. Japanese car manufacturers have most of their parts produced within Japanese borders, which means that most permanent magnets used in hybrid and electric vehicles are produced in Japan. The same is true for the NiHM batteries, about 95 % of those that are inside these vehicles today are produced in Japan by Japanese manufacturers. The markets for green technology seem to expand, creating an increasing demand for <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals.</b> To meet the demand with a larger supply there is need for solutions such as new mining projects, reopening of closed mines, or recycling and recovering of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> from scrap products and mine tailings. The urge for more supply of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> and also rising prices presents a good incentive for recycling and recovering different <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>metals</b> from discarded products. These recycling and recovering processes are technically and often economically very demanding. Today there are processes that could recover <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> {{with a high level of}} purity, but the problem is often the huge costs for the processes as well as handling of waste chemicals and materials that might be toxic. New processes will have to be developed. There has been research for new processes, and recycling/recovering plants are planned to be constructed in Japan as well as other countries. This report will also look at the potential for having parts of the <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> product chain in Sweden, since the country has both the physical resources and also metallurgical knowledge. With this in mind we discussed the possibilities of eventually operating the processes in the product chain in Sweden, and aspects of this scenario...|$|R
