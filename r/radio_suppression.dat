40|$|Abstract—Radio {{frequency}} interference (RFI) from anthropogenic {{sources in}} microwave radiometers detecting geophysical parameters is both common and insidious. As this RFI is always additive to the brightness, {{the presence of}} undetected RFI can bias the geophysical parameter retrieval. As radiometers have the most sensitive receivers operating in their band, low levels of RFI are both significant and difficult to identify. The kurtosis statistic is a tool being explored {{as a means of}} detecting low level RFI in microwave receivers. The performance of the kurtosis statistic as a detector of RFI is introduced.

5000|$|In the 1950s, {{two factors}} changed the {{provision}} of vehicle radio within the British Army. The first of these was a change of philosophy for battlefield radio communication {{as a result of}} wartime experiences and the political and military situation in Europe after 1945 which was addressed by the [...] "New Range" [...] of sealed, primarily VHF/FM Combat Net Radio introduced from 1954. This would later become known as the Larkspur series of equipment after the 1962 project to equip the whole army with the new radio system. This modern design of equipment, although still using valves, was lightweight and where possible avoided the motor-generator/ rotary converter power supplies of earlier generation equipment such as the No. 19 set, {{in order to reduce the}} sets' power requirements. [...] The second factor was the development of the 'CT' (a contraction of CombaT) range of soft-skin combat vehicles, as a purpose-designed and more rugged alternative to the General Service vehicles based on modified commercial (CL) vehicles. These CT vehicles, particularly the FV1801 Austin Champ ¼ ton and the FV1600 series Humber 1 ton, were powered by the new Rolls-Royce B range engines. Drawing on wartime experience, these engines were designed with built-in <b>radio</b> <b>suppression,</b> especially their ignition system, and they were also available with purpose-designed high-output generators, and were based on 24v systems in accordance with agreements reached with the US and Canadian armies in 1948. These 25A generators were initially thought sufficiently powerful to supply and charge the radio batteries directly, no longer needing the separate charging set. The generator had an internal two-speed automatic gearbox, which increased the charging rate when the engine was running at near-idling speed. However it soon became clear that this was insufficient to meet the demands of the new sets and higher output systems based on alternators were later introduced.|$|E

The L-band RFI Detection and Mitigation Testbed (DetMit Testbed) will not be optimized for radiometric observation {{as much as it}} is optimized for flexibility in the presence of RFI. While the DetMit Testbed will be a fully functional polarimetric L-band radiometer, the ultimate application of this instrument is not so much brightness measurements as it will be validation of RFI mitigation strategies for employment in future L-band (and other frequency) radiometers. The design approaches for the L-band RFI Detection and Mitigation Testbed are expected to apply to C-band and X-band, and presumably also to other frequencies of interest that experience RFI.

40|$|Relativistic jets in Galactic superluminals and extragalactic AGN may be {{surrounded}} by a wind near to the central engine. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation reveal considerable stabilization of relativistic jet flow by a wind to helical and higher order asymmetric modes of jet distortion. When velocities are measured in the source (inlet) frame, reduction in the absolute velocity difference between jet and wind, ∆v = vjet − vwnd, provides stabilization in addition to stabilization provided by a high jet Lorentz factor, but a high Lorentz factor wind is not needed to stabilize a high Lorentz factor jet. However, the fundamental pinch mode is not similarly affected and knots with spacing a few times the jet radius are anticipated to develop in such flows. Thus, we identify a mechanism that can suppress large scale asymmetric structures while allowing axisymmetric structures to develop. Relativistic jets surrounded by outflowing winds will be more stable than if surrounded by a stationary or backflowing external medium. Knotty structures along a straight jet like that in 3 C 175 could be triggered by pinching of an initially low Mach number jet surrounded by a suitable wind. As the jet enters the <b>radio</b> lobe, <b>suppression</b> of any surrounding outflow or backflow associated with the high pressure lobe triggers exponential growth of helical twisting.

40|$|In {{the field}} of mobile {{satellite}} communications, a system based on low-earth-orbit satellites (LEO-SAT's) such as the Iridium system has been proposed. The LEO-SAT system is able to offer mobile telecommunication services in high-latitude areas. Rain degradation, fading and shadowing are also expected to be decreased when the system is operated at a high elevation angle. Furthermore, the propagation delay generated in the LEO-SAT system is less pronounced than that in the geostationary orbit satellite (GEO-SAT) system and, in voice services, {{the effect of the}} delay is almost negligible. We proposed a concept of a broad-band mobile satellite communication system with LEO-SAT's and Optical ISL. In that system, a fixed L-band (1. 6 / 1. 5 GHz) multibeam is used to offer narrow band service to the mobile terminals in the entire area covered by a LEO-SAT and steerable Ka-band (30 / 20 GHz) spot beams are used for the wide band service. In this paper, we present results of a study of LEO-SAT microwave link between a satellite and a mobile terminal for a broad-band mobile satellite communication system. First, the results of link budget calculations are presented and the antennas mounted on satellites are shown.

40|$|Abstract—Future {{radio telescopes}} are envisioned to be beam-forming arrays {{containing}} hundreds {{to millions of}} elements distributed over thousands of km 2, with bandwidths that are 10 % {{or more of the}} RF center frequency. It is awkward to analyze such systems using traditional narrowband beamforming theory. This paper presents a frequency-domain model that includes relevant features such as true time delay, distributed doppler effects, and nonideal instrumental frequency response. Conventional beam-forming—i. e., maximizing the gain in a certain direction subject to no other constraints—is analyzed {{in the context of the}} model. A simple method for suppressing interference in the beamformer output is also analyzed. In this method, a second beam is formed in the direction of the interference and subtracted from the output of the desired beam. Although the concept is sound, two problems are identified. First is the potential for partial or complete canceling of the desired source, along with the interference. The second problem is coloring of the noise spectrum, which may thwart the detection of weak spectral features. These problems are shown to be closely related to the array geometry, and some work-arounds are suggested. Index Terms—Antenna arrays, interference <b>suppression,</b> <b>radio</b> astronomy.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a cost {{effective}} method to generate a high-quality quadruple frequency optical millimeter-wave (MMW) signal using an integrated dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator (IDP-MZM). Not only does the method minimize the complication of the central station (CS) and its frequency demand for the devices, but the generated optical MMW signal as well has good transmission performance. By properly adjusting the direct current (DC) bias, modulation index, and using two radio frequency (RF) driving signals with 135 ◦ phase delay, a high quality dual tone optical MMW at 60 GHz is generated from a 15 GHz RF local oscillator (LO) with optical sideband suppression ratio (OSSR) as high as 32 dB and <b>radio</b> frequency spurious <b>suppression</b> ratio (RFSSR) exceeding 33 dB without optical filter when an IDP-MZM with 30 dB extinction ratio is utilized.

Among the numerous properties of this approach, the most important is that a filterless optical mm-wave at 60 GHz with an optical sideband suppression ratio (OSSR) as high as 40 dB can be obtained when the extinction ratio of the MZM is 25 dB. Simplicity and cost-effectiveness have made this approach a compelling candidate for future wave-division-multiplexing RoF systems. Theoretical analysis is conducted to suppress the undesired optical sidebands for the high-quality generation of frequency quadrupling mm-wave signal.

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of the skin conductance response (SCR) during {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (f MRI) raises significant safety issues, as well as practical ones, which need to be addressed in order for these experiments to be conducted safely and successfully. Metallic and conductive wires in the presence of time-varying gradient magnetic fields such as those present in f MRI experiments may induce heating, as well as electric fields, in these components and, if in contact with the subject, could produce severe burns and electric shocks. Moreover, these metallic and conductive components can significantly distort the magnetic field, resulting in image artifacts. A system for recording the SCR in humans simultaneously with fMRI is presented.

40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} issue of {{computing}} power spectral density (PSD) estimates at the output of a beamforming sensor array in the presence of strong moving interference. It is shown that the time-varying spatial response of an adaptive beamformer (“pattern rumble”) causes estimation bias in the PSD of both the signal of interest (SOI) and noise. In applications such as radio astronomy with stringent sensitivity requirements, even small pattern variations can be problematic because the resulting higher variance noise spectrum estimates make it impossible to detect signals of interest which are many decibels below the noise floor. Distortion in beam mainlobe shape also introduces errors in SOI direction estimates. To overcome this problem, an extension of the method described in Leshem et al., 2000, is developed which eliminates pattern-distortion-induced PSD bias and spatial response errors over the long-term PSD averaging window. Both simulated and real data experiments demonstrate algorithm effectiveness in realizing an undistorted effective (average) beam spatial response while maintaining a low noise floor level. This algorithm will enable PSD estimation using multi-antenna sensors and adaptive interference cancellation for radio astronomy, remote sensing, and other sensitive radiometry applications where cancellation has not been feasible.
