40|$|Many planet {{candidates}} {{have been detected}} by radial velocity variations of the primary star; they are planet candidates, because of the unknown orbit inclination. Detection of the wobble in the two other dimensions, to be measured by astrometry, would yield the inclination and, hence, true mass of the companions. We aim to show that planets can be confirmed or discovered in a close visual stellar binary system by measuring the astrometric wobble of the exoplanet host star as periodic variation of the separation, even from the ground. We test the feasibility with HD 19994, a visual binary with one radial velocity planet candidate. We use the adaptive optics camera NACO at the VLT with its smallest pixel scale (13 mas) for high precision astrometric measurements. The separations measured in single 120 images taken within one night are shown to follow white noise, so that the standard deviation can be devided by the square root {{of the number of}} images to obtain the precision. In this paper we present the first results and investigate the achievable <b>precision</b> in <b>relative</b> astrometry with adaptive optics.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{procedure for}} precise and accurate measurements of isotope abundances by a miniature laser ablation mass spectrometer for space research is described. The measurements {{were conducted on}} different untreated NIST standards and galena samples by applying pulsed UV laser radiation (266 nm, 3 ns and 20 Hz) for ablation, atomisation, and ionisation of the sample material. Mass spectra of released ions are measured by a reflectron-type time-of-flight mass analyser. A computer controlled performance optimiser was used to operate the system at maximum ion transmission and mass resolution. At optimal experimental conditions, the best <b>relative</b> accuracy and <b>precision</b> achieved for Pb isotope compositions are at the per mill level and were obtained {{in a range of}} applied laser irradiances and a defined number of accumulated spectra.
