40|$|Extant {{institutional}} {{research has}} failed {{to make a distinction}} between the effects of institutional profile and institutional distance on MNEs. The problem stems from the fact that, due to the use of a single <b>reference</b> <b>country,</b> variation in institutional distance between the <b>reference</b> <b>country</b> and partner countries is essentially equal to variation in the institutional profiles of these partner countries, making institutional distance and institutional profile effects indistinguishable. This research begins by demonstrating that the problem of profile - distance conflation is relevant for virtually all possible countries as reference points, and then showing how this problem is mitigated by using more than one country as reference points from which to calculate institutional distance. We conclude that current institutional research in international business is unable to explain how institutions matter for MNEs and that a more careful theoretical and empirical distinction between the effects of institutions and institutional distance on cross-border business activities is essential for pushing the institutional perspective in international business studies forward. Multiple reference point research designs are required to achieve this...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{time series}} cross-country output convergence in eleven counties of East Asia and the Pacific. Specifically, we model the cross-country output differences as a Stochastic Unit Root (STUR) processes. Using the output-differences between Japan (<b>reference</b> <b>country)</b> {{and the other}} ten sampled countries, we find output convergence only for the Japan–Australia, Japan–New Zealand, Japan–Taiwan and Japan–Thailand country-pairs. Alternatively, using the output-differences between Australia (<b>reference</b> <b>country)</b> and the other ten sampled countries, we fail to find any evidence of convergence in seven country pairs of the sampled countries except for Australia–Japan, Australia–Hong Kong and Australia–New Zealand country pairs. Overall, our results do not support output convergence in a broader perspective but support the notion of “club convergence ” among a small subset (30 – 40 per cent) of similar fast-growing economies. The causes for non-convergence of per capita real GDP {{for a majority of}} country pairs are an empirical issue that involves country-specific factors that render output gaps highly persistent, but we can broadly outline a few reasons for non-convergence and these include, low and unequal economic growth, lack of economic and financial integration among the sampled countries...|$|E

This paper summarises Harmony's work {{in the areas of}} Environmental Legislation and Guidelines, Project Appraisal, and Procurement Practices. The project mainly focuses on practices in the eight <b>reference</b> <b>countries</b> of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Hungary, Austria, Sweden and Denmark. A review of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) is carried out. As part of this review, a database of over 80 Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) and Appropriate Assessment reports is analysed to identify the similarities and differences between countries in the implementation of the duties required by EU Environmental Legislation. It is found that the degree of implementation under the headings considered varies greatly between countries. It is concluded that increased monitoring is required in all countries. Project appraisal guidelines are also examined in the <b>reference</b> <b>countries.</b> The project appraisal process needs a set of tools to enable rational and sensible route choice decisions to be made that strike a balance between the requirement to protect wildlife and other factors such as economy, safety and societal objectives. The project appraisal methodologies used in the <b>reference</b> <b>countries</b> are compared and the approach used in the UK is recommended for adoption by all member states. This paper then examines existing approaches to the procurement of road constructions in the <b>reference</b> <b>countries.</b> The different types of contracts used for procurement are described and the benefits and disadvantages of different contract types are discussed.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: General Directorate of Pharmaceuticals and Pharmacy (IEGM) is {{responsible}} for setting all prices for human medicinal products. The reference pricing system is used for setting these prices. Reference countries are reviewed annually and {{may be subject to}} certain alterations. There were 5 reference countries in 2009 : Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Greece. The aim {{of this study is to}} show the distribution of reference countries which were used for reference pricing. METHODS: The price list of pharmaceuticals which was published by IEGM on 15. 04. 2011 was used for analysis. Distribution of reference countries and prices were evaluated. RESULTS: Prices of 6, 251 generic and 3, 703 original products were set according to the price list. 5, 283 of generics and 3, 306 of originals were in the positive list for reimbursement. Reference pricing was used for 2, 352 generics and 2, 281 originals. Prices of the remaining were set outside of reference pricing. 32 different countries were used for reference pricing. Italy was the most popular country for reference pricing. Even if it was not a <b>reference</b> <b>country,</b> Germany was used in some of the pharmaceuticals. The average reimbursement discount rate and price were 24. 43 % and 249 TL, respectively. There were no colerations between price and reimbursement discount rate, or <b>reference</b> <b>country</b> and reimbursement rate. CONCLUSION: It has been shown that Italy has the highest impact on the pricing of all pharmaceuticals in Turkey. Even if it was not a <b>reference</b> <b>country,</b> Germany showed to affect pharmaceuticals more than other countries which were also not used for reference pricing. Even if reimbursement discount rates are stated by the Social Security Institution (SGK), there are different discount rates for pharmaceuticals. The analysis stated that there were correlation between price, country and discount rates. This analysis is first for the literature. Further analysis is necessary in the light of price changes and newly launched pharmaceuticals. [URL] </p...|$|E

It is concluded that the important underlying factor is a similarity between the German and Swiss central banks, rather than institutional arrangements like the EMS. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{survival in}} patients in whom uveal melanoma was diagnosed between January 1, 1983, and December 31, 1994, in Europe. METHODS: Survival {{analysis of data}} from 32 cancer registries in 16 European countries adhering to the European Cancer Registry for 5788 patients with uveal melanoma diagnosed between January 1, 1983, and December 31, 1994, with follow-up to 1999. RESULTS: Five-year relative survival was 68. 9 % overall and remained stable with the period of diagnosis. Relative excess risk of death was 2. 45 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 10 - 2. 86) in patients aged 75 years or older compared with patients aged 54 years or younger and was slightly higher in male patients (relative excess risk, 1. 10; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 19) than in female patients. Survival was similar in Nordic countries (relative excess risk, 1. 03; 95 % CI, 0. 87 - 1. 21) compared with the United Kingdom (<b>reference</b> <b>country)</b> and was lower in eastern and western European countries (1. 26; 1. 05 - 1. 52, and 1. 25; 0. 90 - 1. 60, respectively) compared with the <b>reference</b> <b>country.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In this large series of patients with uveal melanoma, 5 -year relative survival remained stable {{with the introduction of}} conservative treatment in individuals in whom uveal melanoma was diagnosed between 1983 and 1994.
