Suppliers are legally required to follow <b>reliability</b> standards. In 2006, Québec's transmission system {{was recognized by}} the North American Electric <b>Reliability</b> Corporation (NERC) as a full interconnection because it is asynchronous with neighboring systems.

Besides the Quebec Interconnection, there are three other interconnections in North America: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection, and the Electric <b>Reliability</b> Council of Texas.|$|E

40|$|Reliability-based design {{criteria}} are usually calibrated to existing structures (of the same class) having {{a history of}} successful service. However, as the o!shore industry continues to witness innovations, some novel structures clearly exceed the scope of existing design standards. A reliability-based design is attractive in such cases, but the calibration exercise is not feasible and target <b>reliabilities</b> need {{to be derived from}} more fundamental considerations. This paper describes a general risk-based methodology for identifying signi"cant limit states and deriving corresponding target <b>reliabilities</b> for such novel structures. <b>Reliabilities</b> of various existing structures and available analytical methods for determining target <b>reliabilities</b> are reviewed. Careful consideration is given to failure consequences, both tangible and intangible, and <b>reliabilities</b> of intact as well as damaged structures are considered.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we study {{the impact of}} the {{processing}} order of nodes of a bipartite graph, on the performance of an iterative message-passing decoding. To this end, we introduce the concept of neighborhood <b>reliabilities</b> of graph’s nodes. Nodes <b>reliabilities</b> are calculated at each iteration and then are used to obtain a processing order within a serial or serial/parallel scheduling. The basic idea is that by processing first the most reliable data, the decoder is reinforced before processing the less reliable one. Using neighborhood <b>reliabilities,</b> the Min-Sum decoder of LDPC codes approaches the performance of the Sum-Product decoder. I...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -Max r, {{which is}} the maximum of all {{possible}} split-half reliabihties, has recently been used to reanalyze {{the psychometric properties of}} various psychologi-cal scales. It is recommended that these revised estimates be interprered cautiously for two reasons, (1) scale homogeneity is not always [he best indicator of reliab~lity and (2) the coefficients cannot be interpreted as equivalent to published <b>reliabilities,</b> which are often based on estimates of the mean split-half <b>reliabilities</b> (e. g., Cronbach's alpha or KuderrRichardson 20).

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} first how estimated Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) {{measurement error}} variances are actually estimates of score <b>reliabilities.</b> The major advantage of SEM over other analytic methods {{is that it}} accounts for measurement error. Score <b>reliabilities</b> are estimated as part of structural modeling, so that structural models test both substantive hypothesis and measurement models. The paper also demonstrates how changing the estimated <b>reliabilities</b> of the SEM observed variables not only changes estimated <b>reliabilities,</b> but can also change all the other parameters throughout the analysis. A heuristic data set is used to illustrate these changes.
