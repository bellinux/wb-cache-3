5000|$|Guidelines for the {{creation}} of [...] "hammocks" [...] were first published in the late 1970s (Gann 1979). This article included an extensive table of native trees and shrubs which could be used to create hammocks, including growth patterns, soils, cultural tolerances, uses, special attractions, and drawbacks. Unfortunately, concepts of natural communities, species nativity and natural ranges were not well developed at the time, and this publication has limitations. In the early 1990s, The Association of Florida Native Nurseries published a [...] "common-sense" [...] guide to xeric landscaping with Florida native plants which included a preliminary list of <b>recommended</b> <b>species</b> for rockland hammock creation (Jameson and Moyroud 1991). More recently G. Gann (1995) created guidelines for {{the creation}} of rockland hammocks in Dade County, including a list of <b>recommended</b> <b>species,</b> planting techniques, watering requirements, and long-term maintenance. Dade County has recently published [...] "The Landscape Manual" [...] (Dade County Department of Planning, Development, and Regulation 1996), which includes a brief community description, a list of recommended plants for rockland hammock creation, and a table including cultural requirements and tolerances. These types of guidelines should be expanded to include tropical hardwood hammock creation in the Florida Keys and Big Cypress regions, and refined to provide specific guidelines for distinct floristic subregions (e.g. lower, middle, and upper Keys).|$|E

Here, we tested the effects of a chemical stressor on the regenerative ability of L. variegatus and investigated the potential of regenerative ability as an additional new parameter in standard toxicity tests. The worms were cut into two equal segments, and exposed to various concentrations of lead. Two assays were performed: one with sediment spiked with lead and the other with water spiked with lead. The endpoints were segmental regeneration, survival and behaviour. Regenerative ability was clearly affected by exposure to lead-contaminated sediment and lead-contaminated water. Organisms exposed to lead grew more slowly than those not exposed; worms exposed to contaminated water showed higher mortalities than those exposed to contaminated sediment. Results showed that L. variegatus' regenerative ability, as a developmental test parameter, is more sensitive than mortality. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Eucalypts {{are among}} the most widely planted species {{worldwide}} for wood fibre. In Australia they have traditionally been used for solid wood or pulp production but use as a source of woody biomass for bioenergy, and especially liquid biofuels, is emerging as a further major potential end use. A review of species testing underway and planned has identified 38 eucalypts as prospective biomass species for Northern Australia. Although testing of tree species has been extensive in the subtropics, there will likely be a need for further species tests for as yet untested species, inadequately tested species, or to fill gaps in species-environment combinations. Development of standardised sets of assessment criteria for comparing species in trials is <b>recommended.</b> <b>Species</b> choice is dependent on the growing environment, the technology used to convert wood fibre to a liquid fuel, and the cropping system, improved understanding of each of these factors must be progressed alongside our understanding of the appropriate species to plant...|$|E
40|$|Miconia ligustroides (DC.) Naudim, {{popularly known}} as “vassoura-preta” or “jacatirão-do-brejo” is widely {{distributed}} in Brazil. It is a <b>recommended</b> <b>species</b> for restoration of riparian areas and its fruits are attractive to wildlife. However, {{little is known about}} the morphology of its fruits and diaspores. Such morphological characterization studies are important for species identification, corroborating future studies of phenology and germination. Therefore, the fruits, diaspores and germination of M. ligustroides were morphologically characterized by observations through naked eye, stereoscopic microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Analyses of chemical composition of seeds were also performed. The fruits are spherical and uniform within the analyzed sample, having a large number of tiny obtriangular yellowish-brown diaspores. The diaspores are considered ananfitropos, and have crystals in their external envelope. Concerning chemical composition, they are proteins. Germination is of phanerocotylar type and starts at 12 Days After Sowing (DAS); at 17 DAS each diaspore may produce up to three seedlings. The morphological characterization performed in this work was efficient to describe the fruits, seeds and germination of this species, thus providing the basis for future studies.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Metals are {{naturally}} occurring constituents {{of the environment}} and although many are essential nutrients for living organisms, at higher concentrations they can be toxic. Some aquatic species can help understand and even predict the impact of those contaminants. Lumbriculus variegatus is a <b>recommended</b> <b>species</b> for use in sediment toxicity tests and is known to have a remarkable ability of segmental regeneration. Short- (10 -day) and long-term (28 -day) toxicity tests were used to test the effects of a metal on the survival, growth, and behavior of L. variegatus. This work aims to investigate and validate the use of behavior as a new parameter in standard toxicity tests. Worms were exposed to sediments contaminated with different levels of lead and the results indicated a positive relation between lead concentrations and mortality and growth: higher lead concentrations resulted in higher mortalities and strong inhibition of growth. An inhibition of behavior was observed and results suggested that although behavior could not be used in sediment toxicity tests, it proved useful as an addition to short-term tests and helps select sediments. Thus, exposure to sediments contaminated with lead affects the presence of this species in nature, because it interferes with growth and survival...|$|E

30|$|Short-term fish {{toxicity}} was ascertained from the 96 -h {{median lethal concentration}} (LC 50) of tests performed according to OECD 203 or comparable design [16]. For long-term tests on fish, the fish early-life stage test (FELS) according or equivalent to OECD 210 or life-cycle tests was used [21] considering the no-observed effect concentration (NOEC) with the endpoints hatching and survival, length, weight or abnormal behaviour as recommended in the OECD 210 guideline. In addition, the embryo and sac-fry stages according to OECD 212 (for substances with a log Kow < 4) {{as well as the}} fish juvenile growth test according to OECD 215 (for substances with a log Kow < 5) were used to evaluate chronic toxicity [18, 19]. Non-guideline studies were considered only if a documented study met the criteria for guideline requirements of the respective guideline.

40|$|Many {{countries}} are currently looking at growing high-yielding crops {{for the production}} of biofuels as alternatives to traditional fuels (petrol and diesel) to address imminent energy shortages and reduce impacts of climate change. This usually involves the importation of foreign (i. e., alien) species of plants that are known for their fast and productive growth. If these initiatives are not carefully assessed, however, promoting the cultivation of some popular species for biofuel production will increase two of the major causes of biodiversity loss on the planet: clearing and conversion of yet more natural areas for monocultures, and invasion by non-native species. 1 Habitat conversion is already the leading cause of biodiversity loss worldwide, and limiting the enthusiastic cultivation of new crops to areas already converted is not an easy task. The issue addressed here, though, {{is that some of the}} most commonly <b>recommended</b> <b>species</b> for biofuel production, particularly for biodiesel, are also major invasive alien species in many parts of the world. Thus, their likelihood of becoming invasive needs to be assessed before being cultivated on a large-scale for biofuel production in new areas. Some of these species are spread by birds, small mammals and other animals, making their control difficult or impossible, with impacts increasing over time and long-term production prone to greater financial losses than gains. This note provides basic information and recommendations for proposals on biofuel developments using species that may have a history of invasion and so require careful management if they are to be used on a large scale and not contribute to natural habitat and biodiversity loss...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{fires and}} forest {{biodiversity}} are related issues of major concern in Mediterranean countries and require an integrated approach to landscape planning. The {{aim of this}} study was to develop a GIS approach for regulating forest production while promoting landscape diversity and mitigating fire hazard. A study area located in the centre of Portugal was chosen. The area was primarily occupied by maritime pine and had a high fire hazard, low tree species diversity and an extensive protection area. The classical area control method was used to assist in forest production regulation. Species suitability maps were produced for 21 <b>recommended</b> <b>species</b> for afforestation in the study area. Maritime pine management compartments were defined, and a 50 -year harvesting plan was proposed. In each harvested compartment, protection areas were identified for species conversion (e. g., native oaks and/or broadleaves). Afforestation species were proposed according to the species suitability maps produced earlier. Low flammability species that produce high-quality wood, non-wood products and landscape enhancement were preferred. A comparison of the land cover in the study area in 2007 to that anticipated in 2064 via the proposed plan showed that a more fragmented landscape structure could be achieved by introducing 16 species of lower flammability than maritime pine into the study area. This study proved the usefulness of this methodological approach for guiding sustainable changes in homogeneous, unmanaged forest landscapes prone to fire. Further research is needed regarding integrated planning approaches that incorporate environmental, economic and social dimensions (e. g., human desertification of rural areas).

40|$|The {{potential}} {{of developing a}} biomarker for androgens in the three-spined stickleback (via the kidney glue protein that breeding males use to construct a nest) was recognised 10 years ago. As a consequence, under the UK EDMAR programme an ELISA for the only known so far androgen-regulated protein in fish, the stickleback glue spiggin, was developed and validated. More recently the stickleback assay was modified in two different ways to detect anti-androgens, a group of EDCs that poses an increasing risk to the aquatic environment as the in vitro data obtained from two nationwide surveys of final sewage effluents suggest. Importantly, the stickleback is present in Europe (and across all of the North hemisphere) and can bring together lab and field studies providing a sound basis for environmental risk assessment. To this end, the UK (Defra CN) has financed three research programmes that underpinned the background and validation data requirements {{that could lead to}} the inclusion of the stickleback as a <b>recommended</b> <b>species</b> for EDCs screening.

40|$|Considerable {{potential}} {{exists in}} the UK for utilising woody biomass, grown under short rotation forestry management systems, to produce electricity or heat. There are benefits to using biomass in generating heat and power the main environmental benefit being from substituting for fossil fuel combustion and consequent carbon emissions. Woody biomass production in short rotation forestry involves growing single stemmed trees rather than coppice over rotations of between 10 and 15 years. Eucalypts are particularly suited to such biomass production as they exhibit relatively high wood density, have suitable chemical characteristics, exhibit low moisture content and can be easily harvested all year around using conventional machinery if single-stemmed growth form is maintained. The UK has a climate that is not well suited {{to the majority of}} eucalypts. However, there is a small number of eucalypt species that can withstand the stresses caused by frozen ground and desiccating winds or sub-zero temperatures that can occur. These species are from more southern latitudes and high altitude areas of Australia. However, even the most cold resistant species can be damaged by UK winter climate extremes and therefore careful matching of species to site environmental constraints is critical. Informed decision making is made problematic by the small area and limited distribution of current planting, although it is clear that particularly cold areas and for most species, sites with poor drainage should be generally avoided. This article provides a discussion of the potential of, and constraints to, using eucalypts for biomass in the UK and provides a tentative list of <b>recommended</b> <b>species,</b> their potential growth rates and their advantages and disadvantages. Highlights: Eucalyptus in plantations has potential in the UK as a source of woody biomass. Fast early growth enables high productivity over short rotations. Unseasonal frosts and unusually cold winters pose a risk. It is not clear whether climate change will benefit or hinder use of eucalypts for biomass in the UK...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of ecosystem services provided by green spaces in Bangkok, Thailand, as a potential tool to address urban and environmental problems there. The analyses are divided into two parts for achieving two objectives, 1) estimating the magnitude of ecosystem services provided by public street trees, and 2) examining the relationship between stable isotopic data of tree leaves and the environmental quality of Bangkok's streets. The findings {{could be used to}} identify tree management issues and tree species with high potential to mitigate environmental problems through enhancement of the ecosystem service provision. A combination of field inventories, interviews with related stakeholders, stable isotopic analyses, remote sensing, geographic information, and computational models were used in this dissertation. For objective 1, the results indicate that citywide public street trees can provide environmental services, including reducing about sixty-five tons of air pollutants per year; reducing 2. 11 million m 3 of storm water runoff per year; reducing 13, 000 tons of CO 2 per year; saving 8. 29 million kWh of electricity per year; and storing 70, 000 tons of carbon throughout the trees' lifetime. The total annual monetary benefit of these services is about $ 4. 34 million. Interviews with public officials indicate that they have a moderate understanding of the ecosystem services provided by street trees. Major challenges in tree management are lack of personnel, conflicts with street vendors, sidewalk damage, and overhead wire problems. According to the opinions of street vendors, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) should increase tree maintenance to reduce damage risks, and to improve tree health conditions. Regarding the objective 2, the findings from studying the relationship of stable isotopic compositions of nitrogen in tree leaves, and factors such as air quality parameters could be useful in tracing air pollution levels, as well as determining which tree species can absorb high amounts of air pollutants. Tree species recommendations based on the two objective findings are: for reduced planting spaces (minimum width 1. 2 m), trees in the genus Lagerstroemia are highly recommended.

40|$|The {{nation of}} The Bahamas is an {{archipelago}} vulnerable to plant invasion. Small island nations share {{characteristics such as}} isolation and high endemism, which make them the most susceptible to loss of biodiversity resulting from invasions of non-native plants. Biological invasion is particularly prominent on islands because of reduced numbers of, and in some cases, extinction of, native plants. Because The Bahamas is overrun by alien invasive plants, it is critically important to address this problem.

40|$|Species {{selection}} {{can make}} the difference between successful revegetation projects and costly failures. Candidate native species for revegetating burned arid lands in the southwestern United States must meet at least two criteria. These species must: (1) be competitive in postfire environments typically dominated by exotic grasses, and (2) be able to become established reliably by seeding or planting. In response to Manager’s Request Task 3 (reestablishment of native vegetation after fires on arid lands) in the 2006 JFS announcement for proposals, this research tackled the problem of selecting native species with the greatest chance of revegetation success by conducting synergistic experiments and studies in the Mojave Desert. In {{the first part of the}} project, we established experimental native plant communities and monocultures of 12 native species ranging from native early successional forbs to late-successional shrubs. We introduced seeds of the invasive, exotic annual grasses Bromus rubens (red brome) and Schismus spp. (Mediterranean grass) and also manipulated soil nitrogen. We found that an early successional forb community reduced biomass of the exotic grasses by 8 - to 33 -fold compared to controls (no native vegetation) and below the biomass fire threshold for Mojave Desert ecosystems. Some of these early successional forbs, such as Sphaeralcea ambigua (desert globemallow) also performed best in planting trials in the second part of the project, and are <b>recommended</b> <b>species</b> for revegetating desert wildfires. Further work is needed, however, to increase seeding success. In a mensurational field study as the third part of the project, we found that cover of exotic grasses was generally lowest below native perennial species that do not readily form fertile islands, consistent with parts 1 and 2 of the project. In three-value added supplemental parts to the project, we (1) conducted a greenhouse competition experiment of target native species with Bromus rubens, (2) conducted a seed fate study with the native species of the project to determine post-seeding seed fates since establishment through seeding on the burn was poor, and (3) a literature synthesis of post-fire responses of native species in the Mojave-Sonoran Deserts, which included the species of this experiment. Collectively, this project’s findings have helped identify which native species (e. g., Sphaeralcea ambigua) are expected to be most successful for post-fire revegetation efforts and suggest that there is high potential for identifying native species that compete with, and reduce, the exotic annual grasses that fuel fires. These findings are unique, as previous research has focused on the effects of the exotic grasses on native species, and not vice versa...|$|E
