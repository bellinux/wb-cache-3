5|$|Belichick, {{who came}} to the Browns after 12 years mostly with the Giants under Bill Parcells, quickly made his mark by restricting media access to the team. He acted gruff or bored at press conferences, shrugging, <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> eyes and often giving short answers to long questions. This bred the {{perception}} that the new coach was not a good communicator and lacked a vision for the team. Behind the scenes, however, he was trying to remake the Browns. He reformed Cleveland's scouting methods and, in conjunction with player personnel director Mike Lombardi, tried to form a coherent identity: a big and strong cold-weather team. Belichick's new way forward, however, did not immediately translate to on-field success. Cleveland's record only improved slightly in 1991 to 6–10 as the offense struggled to produce scoring drives and the defense was plagued by injuries. Kosar was a rare bright spot, passing for almost 3,500yards and 18 touchdowns. Bridging the end of the 1990 season and the beginning of 1991, the quarterback threw a then-record 307 straight passes without an interception. Kosar broke his ankle twice and sat out for most of the 1992 season, leaving quarterback Mike Tomczak under center. The team finished with a 7–9 record and did not make the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|Chesterfield F.C.'s final league fixture at Saltergate {{ended in}} a {{dramatic}} 2-1 win against AFC Bournemouth following an injury time goal from Derek Niven, the club's longest serving player. The goal prompted a brief and good-natured pitch invasion, which later attracted national media attention after footage of a disabled man <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> wheelchair into the Bournemouth half attracted over 100,000 hits on YouTube.|$|E
25|$|As seen on Hart's documentary, Hart {{proceeded}} to the dressing rooms and questioned Michaels, who pleaded {{that he knew}} nothing about what had taken place and was equally outraged. McMahon locked himself in his office with Pat Patterson and other agents. Mark Calaway, known as The Undertaker, furious with McMahon, banged on the door. McMahon opened and was told he had to apologize to Hart. As recounted in Michaels' autobiography, he was told by McMahon not to say anything about the screwjob to anybody, because McMahon needed to have everyone think that it was only him involved. Michaels offered his assurance that he would not carry the title belt out the next day on Raw and would refuse to say anything derogatory about Hart. Hart {{proceeded to}} the dressing room to shower and change after discovering that McMahon, Brisco, and Remus had locked themselves in McMahon's office. When McMahon went to Hart's dressing room and tried to explain himself, Hart angrily rebuffed him and warned him to leave immediately or risk being punched. An altercation ensued, with Hart giving McMahon a single punch, dropping him to the floor. Although Vince's son, Shane McMahon, and Brisco struggled briefly with Hart and Davey Boy Smith, Hart told them to take McMahon and leave or risk similar consequences. Hart angrily asked McMahon {{if he was going to}} screw him on the pay he was still owed, to which a groggy McMahon replied in the negative. In the hallway outside the dressing rooms, Hart's then-wife Julie angrily confronted Triple H and others about the finish, but was escorted away by Owen Hart. McMahon had a black eye and a sprained ankle, which according to Bret Hart, was a result of his punch lifting Vince off the floor and Vince <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> ankle once he landed. However, McMahon and Brisco have since stated on WWE Confidential that Brisco accidentally stepped on Vince's foot, which as he tried to get back to his feet immediately sprained his ankle and sent him back to the floor, from which he suffered a concussion, and referred to Brisco's action as a 'comedy.' Michaels and Triple H were later confronted and assailed by angry fans outside the Molson Centre and in the lobby of their hotel.|$|E

While he became an atheist during his time at Marlborough College, {{it is not known}} exactly when he embraced socialism. He placed a strong emphasis on personal self-sufficiency, and openly expressed contempt for those who required social interaction for their own happiness. His adult life was a solitary one, with no family and no human dependents. His sexual orientation remains unknown, with Bowden noting that Crawford's interactions with women were [...] "cordial but not significant". He was fond of cats, and kept several as pets, also rearing pigs for food as well as growing vegetables in his garden at Nursing.

500|$|Don Pullen, who bridged {{free and}} {{mainstream}} jazz, [...] "had a technique of <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> wrists as he improvised—the outside {{edges of his}} hands became scarred from it—to create moving tone clusters," [...] writes critic Ben Ratliff. [...] "Building up from arpeggios, he could create eddies of noise on the keyboard...like concise Cecil Taylor outbursts." [...] In the description of Joachim Berendt, Pullen [...] "uniquely melodized cluster playing and made it tonal. He phrases impulsively raw clusters {{with his right hand}} and yet embeds them in clear, harmonically functional tonal chords simultaneously played with the left hand." [...] John Medeski employs tone clusters as keyboardist for Medeski, Martin, and Wood, which mixes free jazz elements into its soul jazz/jam band style.|$|E
500|$|In Baylor's {{first three}} games, Miller scored 17, 17 and 20 points against [...] on November 11, [...] on November 13 and San Diego State on November 15, respectively.

In the fifth game on November 23 against Texas-Arlington, Miller posted his first double-double with 17 points and 11 rebounds. After <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> ankle in practice, Miller sat out the sixth game. After those first six games with a 15.2 point per game average, Miller was mentioned in discussions about National Freshman of the Year candidates. However, , he had not scored 17 points in a game since Jones' return to the lineup and his own return from injury.|$|E
500|$|According to women's {{swimming}} captain Lisa Forrest, Tonelli adopted populist {{tactics in}} championing the athletes' cause. He said that Fraser was sending [...] "wheat {{to feed the}} Russian army, wool to clothe the army and Australian metal to make Russian guns", claiming that this contradicted the proposed protest against the invasion and Russian military aggression. Tonelli's anti-authoritarian and individualistic style manifested itself during media appearances, including a news interview in which he debated with Reverend Lance Shilton, who had called the athletes traitors. Shilton expressed sympathy for the athletes, which Tonelli interpreted as condescension. He responded by <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> eyes and twirling his finger, a gaffe that was shown on national television; Tonelli mistakenly thought that only his voice was being broadcast {{at the time and}} that the images were showing something else.

500|$|Because of his {{aggressive}} style-of-play, Selwood {{has gathered}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "head–over–the–ball specialist" [...] and for consistently putting himself in positions to break tackles and win free kicks. His ability to [...] "buckle his knees, (get) down and pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck" [...] has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as [...] "almost impossible to stop at times" [...] and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood—Carlton’s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to [...] "get in low" [...] because [...] "he’s such a master at lifting the elbows, which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there’s no doubt it’s a skill". Selwood has declared the technique as a [...] "benefit and an advantage I’m getting at the moment on someone else because I see a weakness in what they are doing ... the majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right. It’s just that five per cent where I can use my upper body strength, I can dip at the knees slightly". Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees, stating [...] "all he’s doing is keeping his feet, dropping his legs and he’s got a fantastic tenchique in <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> shoulder ... Selwood shouldn’t be penalised because he’s stronger than the tackler. If I was playing today and I could develop that technique, I’d be looking at it".|$|E
500|$|Tonelli graduated, {{returned}} to Australia, {{and won the}} 100m freestyle, butterfly and backstroke events at the 1979 Australian Championships. The following year, he repeated the freestyle and butterfly victories in times of 51.80s and 56.64s to gain selection for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow; he was also chosen for the 100m and 200m backstroke after finishing second to Kerry. However, another obstacle arose with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in a}} boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western world, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli however, knew that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the Australian athletes to fight for their right to compete. According to women's captain Lisa Forrest, Tonelli adopted populist tactics in championing the athletes' cause. He said that Fraser was sending [...] "wheat to feed the Russian army, wool to clothe the army and Australian metal to make Russian guns", saying that this contradicted the proposed boycott in protest against Soviet military policy. Tonelli's anti-authoritarian and individualistic style manifested itself during media appearances, including a news interview in which he debated with Reverend Lance Shilton, who had referred to the athletes as traitors. Shilton expressed sympathy to the athletes, which Tonelli interpreted as condescension. Unaware that the camera was broadcasting images of him, Tonelli responded by <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> eyes and twirling his finger, a gaffe that was shown on national television.

[...] Cowell was caught <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> eyes on camera as a contestant was expressing sympathy for Tech victims. At first, this was misinterpreted as his showing his disrespect.

On the results show the next day, Cowell stated: [...] "I may not be the nicest person in the world, but I would never, ever, ever, disrespect those families or those victims, and I felt it was important to set the record straight." [...] To clear Cowell's name, a video was shown on the result show which showed Cowell and Abdul talking with an inset of Chris and Seacrest discussing the shooting. Also, Seacrest began the performance show by acknowledging what had happened the day before.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the regular}} season, Rondo {{finished}} in the top five for the NBA Most Improved Player voting. Rondo made his playoff debut on April 20, 2008 against the Atlanta Hawks and finished the game with 15 points, 9 assists and 2 steals. The Celtics closed out the series in seven games, went on to defeat Cleveland in the next round, and then defeated the Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In the NBA Finals, facing the Los Angeles Lakers, Rondo recorded two strong performances, including a career-high 16 assists in Game 2. In Game 3, however, Rondo left the court in the third quarter after <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> ankle. The ankle injury was considered a [...] "non-factor", and Rondo eventually made his return in Game 4.

[...] Presley complained bitterly in a June 27, 1956, interview about being singled out as “obscene”. Because of his controversial style of song and stage performances, municipal politicians began denying permits for Presley appearances. This caused teens to pile into cars and travel elsewhere to see him perform. Adult programmers announced they would not play Presley's music on their radio stations due to religious convictions that his music was [...] "devil music" [...] and to racist beliefs that it was [...] "nigger music." [...] Many of Presley's records were condemned as wicked by Pentecostal preachers, warning congregations to keep [...] rock and roll music out of their homes and away from their children's ears (especially the music of [...] "that backslidden Pentecostal pup.") However, the economic power of Presley's fans became evident when they tuned in alternative radio stations playing his records. In an era when radio stations were shifting to an all-music format, in reaction to competition from television, profit-conscious radio station owners learned quickly when sponsors bought more advertising time on new all [...] "rock and roll" [...] stations, some of which reached enormous markets at night with clear channel signals from AM broadcasts.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, Weber was {{a popular}} banquet speaker renowned for his [...] "polysyllabic fluency," [...] "mind--boggling after-dinner speeches," [...] and his often humorous talks {{about the history of}} Michigan football. It was noted that he would [...] "regale with dubious rhetoric" [...] audiences before whom he would thunderously and whimsically [...] "expatiate upon" [...] Michigan's storied history. Another {{described}} Weber's unusual speaking style this way: [...] "He still sounds like an educated foghorn, and still flips that king's English around in a manner to amaze and apall old Noah Webster." [...] Praising a piledriver spotted among a current crop of Wolverines, the coach would exclaim, [...] "When he hits 'em, generations yet unborn feel the shock of the impact!" [...] Jim Brandstatter wrote in his book Tales from Michigan Stadium that Weber was still a regular visitor at the football offices when he enrolled in 1968. He recalled Weber as a master story teller and a favorite among the students at pep rallies: “Who can forget Wally Weber <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> pant legs up to his knees as the student body roared before he spoke so eloquently about his beloved Michigan?” Weber also held positions in the 1960s and early 1970s in alumni relations and the physical education department. Weber also provided color commentary on WPAG radio's broadcasts of Michigan football games with Bob Ufer for several years. He retired in 1972 {{at the same time as}} Oosterbaan. With the exception of four years at Benton Harbor, Weber had been a student or employee of U-M for 48 years at the time of his retirement.|$|E
2500|$|To Malone and ABC executives' surprise, Todd {{became an}} [...] "immensely popular" [...] {{character}} during the storyline. As his popularity grew, {{and as a}} solution {{not to have to}} kill off what had become a perceived monster, Malone and executive producer Susan Bedsow Horgan chose a controversial option [...] the decision to complicate Todd by ensuring that he was not a one-dimensional rapist. Malone and Horgan started Todd's transition into a more well-rounded character with their second transition of Powell. They had Powell attempt suicide and soon confess to raping Marty. He is publicly forgiven by Marty herself, which enrages Todd when he and fellow rapist Zach receive eight-year sentences behind prison compared to Powell's three months of jail time. Todd makes a vow that he will be out of prison in three months as well. To carry out this vow, Todd was written to escape by [...] "drugging himself, waking from a coma to leap from a speeding ambulance, and then reviving himself again by stabbing a knife through his hand while <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> eyes heavenward" [...] and saying the pain felt good. The scary determination of the character had become characteristic of him by then, and he often seemed superhuman. Within the story, he wants revenge on the person he feels is most responsible for his prison time, Nora. With his escape from prison, he sets out to attack the currently blind Nora. Todd stalks and torments her, but she is spared from his attack by her then-husband Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods) showing up before Todd can finish the assault and rape her.|$|E
