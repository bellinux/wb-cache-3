25|$|Artists {{often use}} backmasking of sounds or {{instrumental}} audio to produce interesting sound effects. One such sound effect is the reverse echo. When done on tape, such use of backmasking {{is known as}} reverse tape effects. One example is Matthew Sweet's 1999 album In Reverse, which includes reversed guitar parts which were played directly onto a tape <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>reverse.</b> For live concerts, the guitar parts were played live on stage using a backward emulator.|$|E
25|$|The first 5700 locomotive, No. 7711, {{underwent}} trials from January to April 1956, first running between Finchley Road and Baker Street. Modifications {{were needed}} to the cab for clearance and the tripcock brake valves after problems were found when <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>reverse.</b> Curtains were also fitted to the cab to reduce smoke and fumes in tunnels. In May, the 5700s became the standard for engineering trains on London Transport when they bought No. 7711 (for £3,160), decided to buy another (No. 5752), and planned to buy more over the coming years.|$|E
500|$|The climactic scene {{depicting}} the mysterious beach near the galactic core where Arroway makes contact, in particular, called for major visual innovations. The goal was an idyllic seashore with a sky blazing with stars that might exist near {{the core of}} the galaxy. Ralston said that [...] "the thought was that this beach would have a heightened reality. One that might make the everyday world seem like a vague daydream." [...] To keep the question alive whether any of it was real in Arroway's mind, elements such as ocean waves <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>reverse</b> and palm tree shadows swaying with sped-up motion were applied.|$|E
50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{suspending}} a (modern) running vehicle and <b>running</b> it <b>in</b> <b>reverse</b> will not reduce the odometer count. Late-model used vehicles {{such as those}} in lease and rental fleets that accumulate mileage very rapidly are generally thought to be more prone to odometer fraud than new vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The Talwars {{features}} the Zorya designed and Mashproekt (Ukraine) manufactured M7N.1E gas turbine plant which comprises two DS-71 cruise turbines and two DT-59 boost turbines in two engine rooms.

A boost component with two DT-59.1 gas-turbine engines, each rated at [...] forward <b>running,</b> [...] <b>in</b> <b>reverse</b> and two RO58 single-speed reduction gearboxes. The four gas turbines are mounted on isolated cradles which minimize their contact with the hull and thereby considerably reduce the transmission of her vibration and sound.|$|R
40|$|We connect {{classical}} chain {{ladder to}} granular reserving. This {{is done by}} defining explicitly how the classical run-off triangles are generated from individual iid observations in continuous time. One important {{result is that the}} development factors have a one to one correspondence to a histogram estimator of a hazard <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>reversed</b> development time. A second result is that chain ladder has a systematic bias if the row effect has not the same distribution when conditioned on any of the aggregated periods. This means that the chain ladder assumptions on one level of aggregation, say yearly, are different from the chain ladder assumptions when aggregated in quarters and the optimal level of aggregation is a classical bias variance trade-off depending on the data-set. We introduce smooth development factors arising from non-parametric hazard kernel smoother improving the estimation significantly...|$|R

2500|$|The B-36 was {{too large}} to fit in most hangars. Since even an {{aircraft}} with {{the range of the}} B-36 needed to be stationed as close to enemy targets as possible, this meant the plane was largely based in the extreme weather locations of the northern continental United States, Alaska and the Arctic. Since the maintenance had to be performed outdoors, the crews were largely exposed to the elements, with temperatures of [...] in winters and [...] in summers, depending on the airbase location. Special shelters were built so that the maintenance crews could be given a modicum of protection. Ground crews were at risk of slipping and falling from icy wings, or being blown off the wings by propeller wash <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>reverse</b> pitch. The wing roots were thick enough, at 7ft (2.1m), to enable a flight engineer to access the engines and landing gear during flight by crawling through the wings. This was possible only at altitudes not requiring pressurization.|$|E

50|$|A classic reverse {{typically}} {{begins as}} a bootleg, sweep or end reverse, but before the ball-carrier crosses {{the line of scrimmage}} he hands the ball off to a teammate, usually a wide receiver, <b>running</b> <b>in</b> the <b>reverse</b> (opposite) direction. Because many of the defensive players will have gravitated {{in the direction of the}} original rusher, if the second ball-carrier can outrun the defenders to the other side of the field, he has a very good chance to make a big gain.|$|R

5000|$|The Needham Line is {{a branch}} of the MBTA Commuter Rail system, running west from {{downtown}} Boston, Massachusetts through Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, Roslindale, West Roxbury, and the town of Needham. The second-shortest line of the system at just 13.7 miles long, it carries 8,218 daily riders. [...] Unlike the MBTA's eleven other commuter rail lines, the Needham Line is not a former intercity mainline; instead, it is composed of a former branch line, a short segment of one intercity line (<b>running</b> <b>in</b> the <b>reverse</b> of its original direction), and a 1906-built connector.|$|R
50|$|In 1925, Smith {{was hired}} {{as the head of}} {{publicity}} for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by Louis B. Mayer. He was later recruited to overdub the actions of trained dogs in the studio's Dogville Comedies.

2500|$|Well known {{were the}} Southern Pacific's unique [...] "cab-forward" [...] steam {{locomotives}}. These were 2-8-8-4 locomotives {{set up to}} run <b>in</b> <b>reverse,</b> with the tender attached to the smokebox end of the locomotive. Southern Pacific {{had a number of}} snow sheds in mountain terrain, and locomotive crews nearly asphyxiated from smoke in the cab. After a number of engineers began <b>running</b> their engines <b>in</b> <b>reverse</b> (pushing the tender), Southern Pacific asked Baldwin Locomotive Works to produce cab-forward designs. No other North American railroad ordered cab-forward locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{counterintuitive}} because, from a macroscopic {{point of}} view, it would describe complex processes <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>reverse.</b> For example, a jet engine <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>reverse,</b> taking in ambient heat and exhaust fumes to generate kerosene and oxygen. Nevertheless {{the size of}} such a system makes this observation almost impossible to occur. Such a process is possible to be observed microscopically because, {{as it has been}} stated above, the probability of observing a [...] "reverse" [...] trajectory depends on system size and is significant for molecular machines if an appropriate measurement instrument is available. This is the case with the development of new biophysical instruments such as the optical tweezers or the atomic force microscope. An example of verification of the Crook's theorem through RNA folding experiments can be found here.|$|E
50|$|Backward running, {{also known}} as {{backwards}} running, running backwards, reverse running, retro running, or retro locomotion is the act of <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>reverse,</b> so that one travels in the direction one's back is facing rather than one's front. It is classed as a retro movement, the reverse of any normal movement.|$|E
50|$|One {{of the key}} {{disadvantages}} of the eddy current speedometer is that it cannot show the vehicle speed when <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>reverse</b> gear since the cup would turn {{in the opposite direction}} - in this scenario the needle would be driven against its mechanical stop pin on the zero position.|$|E

50|$|The {{group from}} {{positions}} 10-33 began qualifying first at 2:45 p.m., <b>running</b> <b>in</b> the <b>reverse</b> order of how drivers qualified {{in the previous}} day's session. Zach Veach, having made no attempt on Saturday, was first on course. The day saw, for most drivers, faster speeds thanks to lower temperatures and more rubber on the track than the previous day. Ryan Hunter-Reay was fastest of the session with a four-lap average of 231.442 mph; nearly a full mph faster {{than anyone else in}} the first group. Alongside him in the 4th row were Ed Jones and Oriol Servià. Team Penske once again struggled, with Juan Pablo Montoya in 18th being their highest qualifier in the group. No major incidents occurred during the session, though a few drivers, including Jack Harvey and Charlie Kimball, scraped the wall in turn 2 during their runs.|$|R

Each of the ten fastest drivers in Friday {{qualifying}} were given one lap to set record a final qualifying time <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>reverse</b> order - so that the tenth-placed driver from Friday would go first, followed by the ninth-placed driver, {{all the way down}} to the fastest driver on Friday, who would be the last driver out - which would then decide the starting order to the top ten places on the grid.|$|E
50|$|The race marked {{yet another}} {{change in the}} {{qualifying}} system, with the aggregate system being discarded for a single session on Saturday, with cars in full race set-up (including fuel), and <b>running</b> <b>in</b> <b>reverse</b> order to the classification from the previous Grand Prix. This disadvantaged the BAR team significantly, as {{they were required to}} be the first two cars on the track. German Williams driver Nick Heidfeld took his first career pole position in front of his home fans, ahead of McLaren's Kimi Räikkönen and Heidfeld's teammate Mark Webber.|$|E
5000|$|On the 19th of September 1997 Anne Skinner was {{involved}} in a serious accident that changed her life forever. Skinner was distracted as she got out of her car to unhitch her horse float, accidentally leaving her car <b>running</b> and <b>in</b> <b>reverse,</b> and as Skinner unhooked the trailer, the car engaged and reversed approximately seven to eight meters backwards, crushing her within the eight inches between the ground and the car. Skinner was trapped for approximately 2 hours before her husband Rex and 17-year-old son Tim returned home and came to her aid. Skinner was flown to The Alfred Hospital [...] in Melbourne where she underwent emergency surgery and was placed in an induced coma for seven weeks. With spinal and pelvic injuries so complex, a team of orthopedic surgeons had to reconnect them during a surgery that took 9 weeks of planning. Skinner's spinal cord hadn’t been severed during the accident, only damaged, leaving her without feeling from waist down up until her surgery. After surgery all feeling had returned in her right leg, however she was still without feeling in her left and some nerve damage.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War and the {{division}} of Germany and Berlin, Berlin-Lichtenberg station {{became one of the}} main stations in Berlin for passengers, especially after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. In the late 1950s, the Berlin outer ring emerged and the main responsibility for passenger service was transferred to Lichtenberg. Because, on the one hand, the outer ring often reached its capacity limits and, on the other hand, some through trains <b>running</b> <b>in</b> north-south direction <b>reversed</b> <b>in</b> Lichtenberg, a few express trains ran from Lichtenberg on the Ringbahn and therefore used a section of this link. The Frankfurter Allee container terminal was especially important for freight transport. Some freight trains ran via the link and Lichtenberg to the outer ring. Some trains terminating in Berlin-Lichtenberg ran over the link to carriage yards in this area. After the Second World War, there was a wagon washing facility at the central slaughterhouse and empty freight wagons were transferred from Rummelsburg three times a day for washing.|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to compare {{coordination}} and coordination variability in backward and forward running and to investigate the effects of speed on coordination variability in both backward and forward running. Fifteen healthy male participants took part in this study to run forwards and backwards on a treadmill at 80 %, 100 % and 120 % of their preferred running speeds. The coordinate data of passive reflective markers attached to body segments were recorded using motion capture systems. Coordination of shank-foot and thigh-shank couplings in sagittal plane was quantified using the continuous relative phase method. Coordination variability was calculated as the standard deviation of a coordination pattern over 50 strides. Cross-correlation coefficients and associated phase shifts were determined to quantify similarity in coordination patterns between forward and backward running. Our results demonstrated that the coordination pattern in a gait cycle of backward <b>running</b> was <b>in</b> <b>reverse</b> to that of forward running at all speeds implying that the same neural circuitry is responsible for regulating both forward and backward <b>running</b> gaits. <b>In</b> addition, results demonstrated that there was an average of approximately 11 % phase shift between the coordination patterns of backward and forward running which indicates that a single underlying mechanism might be responsible for generating motor patterns in both forward and backward running. Finally, backward running had significantly higher magnitude of coordination variability compared to forward running, signifying that more degrees of freedom were involved <b>in</b> backward <b>running.</b> Speed however, did not affect coordination variability in either task...|$|R
