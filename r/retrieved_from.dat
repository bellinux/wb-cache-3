5|$|In October 1998, three {{bodies were}} <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> a well in Erdut. Days later, more bodies were <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> a well in Daljski Atar, where {{a total of}} 23 victims were found. A total of 32 sets of human remains were {{recovered}} {{in the village of}} Ćelije by 2012. The mass grave in Ćelije is toured annually by a procession commemorating the victims buried there and in several other locations in eastern Slavonia, while the site in Daljski Atar is marked by a monument to the civilian victims since 2013.|$|E

5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can be transformed into a wire cutting tool.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists dug up the garden, while {{surveyors}} used infra-red beams {{to create}} a three-dimensional map of the area. A machete was found and sent for forensic tests. Police also searched the garden for Blakelock's truncheon and helmet. In October 2004 his overalls were <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> Scotland Yard's Crime Museum for DNA tests. Nothing was found {{that could be used}} as evidence.|$|E
5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large volcanic eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint. The late Holocene eruption of the Mount Aniakchak, a volcano in Alaska, is now {{believed to be the}} source of the minute shards of volcanic glass in the Greenland ice core.|$|E
5|$|Hela was {{the first}} German ship sunk by a British {{submarine}} in the war.

5|$|A {{significant}} and growing {{proportion of the}} collection is now made available to readers as surrogate facsimiles, either on microfilm, or, more recently, in digitised form. In 2010 a ten-year programme of digitisation of the newspaper archives with commercial partner DC Thomson subsidiary Brightsolid began, and the British Newspaper Archive was launched in November 2011. A dedicated newspaper reading room opened at St Pancras in April 2014, including facilities for consulting microfilmed and digital materials, and, where no surrogate exists, hard-copy material <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> Boston Spa.|$|E
5|$|After the Croatian Serb forces, the JNA and the paramilitaries {{established}} their {{control in the}} village, the Croat population was required to wear white armbands and mark their houses using white sheets. The church in Lovas was torched and 261 houses were looted and destroyed, while 1,341 civilians were forced to leave their homes. The bodies {{of the victims were}} <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> a mass grave and ten individual graves in 1997. Lovas was rebuilt after the war, but its population size shrunk by one third compared to its pre-war level.|$|E

5|$|Early Classic ceramic finds {{are scarce}} at Motul de San José {{and those that}} have been found were a minor {{component}} in mixed fill deposits. This suggests that Motul de San José was largely abandoned in the Early Classic. The best examples of Early Classic pottery come from outside of Motul de San José itself, with several complete ceramic vessels being recovered during the construction of a modern language school in Trinidad de Nosotros and some fragments of Early Classic pottery being <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> a looted chultun at Wakutal.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, {{one week}} before any discs with the updated {{processing}} key had reached retail, claims were reported of the new keys having been <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> a preview disc of The Matrix Trilogy. On May 23, the key 45 5F E1 04 22 CA 29 C4 93 3F 95 05 2B 79 2A B2 was posted on Edward Felten's Freedom to Tinker Blog and confirmed a week later by arnezami on Doom9 as the new processing key (MKB v3).|$|E
5|$|Players use melee attacks, {{firearms}} and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons {{such as the}} Micro Uzi, an M16 rifle and a flamethrower. The game's three-dimension environment allows a first-person view while aiming with the sniper rifle, rocket launcher and the M16 rifle. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit drive-by shootings by facing sideways in a vehicle. The game gives players {{a wide variety of}} weapon options—they can be purchased from local firearms dealers, found on the ground, <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> dead enemies, or found around the city.|$|E
40|$|Fusing {{the results}} of a {{distributed}} Information Retrieval system has often been viewed as two separate problems: metasearch, where several search engines are <b>retrieving</b> <b>from</b> one document collection, and federation, where one search engine is <b>retrieving</b> <b>from</b> several document collections. In this work we present a unified framework for fusion based on predicting query difficulty. We validate our approach using a rigorous, quantitative, experimental procedure, which uses Desktop Search Engines and a standard document collection. We show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than previously-proposed algorithms for both metasearch and federation...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that where a visual stimulus is located and what it is are represented and processed through different neural pathways. This paper reports on an experiment that investigated how the where pathway and the what pathway interact by evaluating and comparing the relative efficiency of retrieval in two directions: from what to where and from where to what. Our results show that <b>retrieving</b> <b>from</b> what to where is faster than <b>retrieving</b> <b>from</b> where to what, quite contradictory to previous results. The implications of our findings are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Windows Mobile 6.5, Windows RT {{and core}} edition of Windows 8.1 include device encryption, a feature-limited version of BitLocker that encrypts the whole system. Logging {{in with a}} Microsoft account with {{administrative}} privileges automatically begins the encryption process. The recovery key is stored to either the Microsoft account or Active Directory, allowing it to be <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> any computer. While device encryption is offered on all versions of 8.1, unlike BitLocker, device encryption requires that the device meet the InstantGo (formerly Connected Standby) specifications, which requires solid-state drives, non-removable RAM (to protect against cold boot attacks) and a TPM 2.0 chip.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, military authorities began {{to press for}} Tarrare {{to be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.|$|E
5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|In September, President Arthur carried Irish {{republicans}} Muriel MacSwiney, {{widow of}} the recently deceased Lord Mayor of Cork Terence MacSwiney, and Linda Mary Kearns, who had been jailed for murder under the Black and Tans, to New York. Wearing buttons with pictures of Harry Boland, an anti-treaty Irish nationalist {{who had been killed}} the previous month, the two women were there to raise funds for orphans of Anti-Treaty IRA forces, who were then fighting in southern Ireland. In October, a Hoboken man, after securing a last-minute court order, was able to halt the deportation of his German niece on President Arthur; she was <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> the ship ten minutes before sailing time.|$|E
