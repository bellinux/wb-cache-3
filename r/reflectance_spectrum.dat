25|$|Orcus {{straddles}} the edge for trans-Neptunian objects massive enough to retain volatiles such as methane on the surface. The <b>reflectance</b> <b>spectrum</b> of Orcus shows the deepest water-ice absorption bands of any Kuiper belt object (KBO) {{that is not}} associated with the Haumea collisional family. The large icy satellites of Uranus have infrared spectra quite {{similar to that of}} Orcus. Among other trans-Neptunian objects Pluto's moon Charon appears to be most similar to Orcus. It has a higher albedo but very similar visible and near-infrared spectra. Their densities are also similar and both have water ice rich surfaces. Quaoar—a trans-Neptunian object of similar size—has strong water ice absorption features in its spectra but also has a very red color in the visible line implying the presence of ultrared matter on its surface. Dwarf planet Haumea and objects from its collisional family have much higher albedos and much deeper water absorption bands than Orcus. Finally, —another large object in 2:3 resonance with Neptune—has spectral properties very similar to Orcus.|$|E

Observations of it made in 2004 by Cassini suggest that Titan is a [...] "super rotator", like Venus, with an atmosphere that rotates much faster than its surface. Observations from the Voyager space probes have shown that Titan's atmosphere is denser than Earth's, with a surface pressure about 1.45 atm. It is also about 1.19 times as massive as Earth's overall, or about 7.3 times more massive on a per surface area basis. Opaque haze layers block most visible light from the Sun and other sources and obscures Titan's surface features. Titan's lower gravity means that its atmosphere is far more extended than Earth's. The atmosphere of Titan is opaque at many wavelengths and as a result, a complete <b>reflectance</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the surface is impossible to acquire from orbit.

40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>Reflectance</b> <b>spectra</b> are {{physical}} properties of materials, {{which can be}} utilized as cues to identify different objects. However, the light reaching a visual system is the combination of <b>reflectance</b> and illumination <b>spectra</b> (defined as color signals in the present study). For a long time, color vision has been recognized as having the ability to recover reflectance under various illuminants {{in order to achieve}} color constancy. 1 [...] 4 Most computational models of color constancy involve the assumption that <b>reflectance</b> <b>spectra</b> of objects can be described by a few basis functions (for a review see Ref. 5). In turn, visual systems with two or more different photoreceptor types are able to estimate the weights of these basis functions and thereby to recover <b>reflectance</b> <b>spectra</b> of objects. 3 [...] 6 Therefore the characterization of <b>reflectance</b> <b>spectra</b> is an important step to understanding color vision.

2500|$|Observations {{from the}} Voyager space probes {{have shown that}} the Titanean {{atmosphere}} is denser than Earth's, with a surface pressure about 1.45 times that of Earth's. Titan's atmosphere is about 1.19 times as massive as Earth's overall, or about 7.3 times more massive on a per surface area basis. It supports opaque haze layers that block most visible light from the Sun and other sources and renders Titan's surface features obscure. The atmosphere is so thick and the gravity so low that humans could fly through it by flapping [...] "wings" [...] attached to their arms. Titan's lower gravity means that its atmosphere is far more extended than Earth's; even at a distance of 975km, the Cassini spacecraft had to make adjustments to maintain a stable orbit against atmospheric drag. The atmosphere of Titan is opaque at many wavelengths and a complete <b>reflectance</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the surface is impossible to acquire from the outside. It was not until the arrival of Cassini–Huygens in 2004 that the first direct images of Titan's surface were obtained. The Huygens probe was unable to detect the direction of the Sun during its descent, and although it was able to take images from the surface, the Huygens team likened the process to [...] "taking pictures of an asphalt parking lot at dusk".|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Soil {{samples were}} {{collected}} on a 0. 4 –ha (1. 0 –ac) grid from two agricultural fields in northeastern Mississippi. The samples were measured for soil nutrient composition, soil texture, and diffuse reflectance between 250 and 2500 nm. The data were examined for two purposes: (1) to understand the relationships between soil properties and <b>reflectance</b> <b>spectra,</b> and (2) to understand the sources of variability in the <b>reflectance</b> <b>spectra.</b> From the raw <b>reflectance</b> <b>spectra,</b> 50 –nm–band averages were calculated. There were significant correlations between groups of the averaged spectra and soil properties, but no single 50 –nm band was highly correlated to any soil property. Soil nutrients were better correlated with spectra in one field, but texture was better correlated with spectra in the other. Only Ca and Mg in one field and clay and pH in the other had multiple–regressor model correlations with R 2 values greater than 0. 50. The relationships between soil properties and <b>reflectance</b> <b>spectra</b> were not consistent between fields.
