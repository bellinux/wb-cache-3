[...] Since the Australian Terrier was also bred for companionship, they tend to be very people friendly, and enjoy interacting with people.|$|E
2500|$|It is now {{thought that}} the Viking {{settlement}} was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical settlement known as Duibhlinn, from which Dyflin took its name. Beginning in the 9th and 10th century, there were two settlements which later became the modern Dublin. The subsequent Scandinavian settlement centred on the River Poddle, {{a tributary of the}} Liffey in an area now known as Wood Quay. The Dubhlinn was a small lake used to moor ships; the Poddle connected the lake with the Liffey. This lake was covered during the early 18th century as the city grew. The Dubhlinn lay where the Castle Garden is now located, opposite the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin Castle. Táin Bó Cuailgne ("The Cattle Raid of Cooley") refers to Dublind rissa <b>ratter</b> Áth Cliath, meaning [...] "Dublin, which is called Ath Cliath".|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the breed is rather unclear, {{although}} {{its relationship with the}} Gos Rater Valencià is obvious, when taking on count the geographical proximity and historical references. In the early 20th century, Valencians migrated to the island of Mallorca and they might have brought <b>ratters</b> with them. Their purpose was to keep stables free from rodents.|$|R
50|$|In the 1880s, British sportsmen {{developed}} a working terrier of East Anglia in eastern England. The Norwich Terrier {{and later the}} drop-eared variety {{now known as the}} Norfolk Terrier, were believed to have been developed by crossing local terrier-like dogs, small, short-legged Irish Terrier breeds and the small red terriers used by the Gypsy <b>ratters</b> of Norfolk (the county in which Norwich the city exists).|$|R
5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, they can be trained to be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or <b>ratters.</b> They can also be taught as a puppy to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the middle}} of the 19th century, regular {{sporting}} events took place along the River Aire in which terriers pursued the large river rats that inhabited the area. A terrier was judged on its ability to locate a [...] "live" [...] hole in the riverbank and then, after the rat was driven from its hole by a ferret brought along for that purpose, the terrier would pursue the rat through water until it could make a kill. As these events became more popular, demand arose for a terrier that could excel in this activity. One such terrier was developed through judicious crossings of the Black-and-Tan Terrier and Bull and Terrier dogs popular at the time with the Otter Hound. The result was a long-legged fellow that would soon develop into the dog we recognize today as the Airedale Terrier. This character was too big to [...] "go to ground" [...] in the manner of the smaller working terriers; however, it was good at everything else expected of a sporting terrier, and it was particularly adept at water work. This big terrier had other talents in addition to its skill as a <b>ratter.</b> Because of its hound heritage it was well equipped to pick up the scent of game and due to its size, able to tackle larger animals. It became more of a multipurpose terrier that could pursue game by powerful scenting ability, be broken to gun, and taught to retrieve. Its size and temperament made it an able guardian of farm and home. One of the colorful, but less-than legal, uses of the early Airedale Terrier was to assist its master in poaching game on the large estates that were off-limits to commoners. Rabbits, hare, and fowl were plentiful, and the Airedale could be taught to retrieve game killed by its master, or to pursue, kill, and bring it back itself.|$|E

My friend, as I am an honest man, the street out here is full of people, and others are roosting on the fences, waiting {{to get a glimpse of}} you, because they think you are crazy. And well they might after reading your editorials. They are a disgrace to journalism. Why, what put it into your head that you could edit a paper of this nature? You do not seem to know the first rudiments of agriculture.

Nothing disturbs clams. Clams always lie quiet. Clams care nothing whatever about music. Ah, heavens and earth, friend! if you had made the acquiring of ignorance the study of your life, you could not have graduated with higher honor than you could to-day. I never saw anything like it.

50|$|The Wire Haired and Smooth Haired Pinschers, as the Standard Schnauzer and German Pinscher were {{originally}} called, were shown in dog books {{as early as}} 1884.

5000|$|For {{thousands}} of years, cats {{have been known}} {{for their ability to}} hunt mice and rats and keep their populations under control. This ability is understood as the reason cats became domesticated. [...] The relationship was more of convenience (or mutualistic) than dependence: [...] "Cats killed mice and rats, and humans provided lots of mice and rats to kill since mice and rats lived in human settlements." [...] A 2014 study examining 5,300 years of cat remains in an agricultural village of Quanhucun, China, provides early evidence of this dynamic, where cats protected grain stores by eating rodents. [...] If they are well-fed, farm cats are more dependable as effective <b>ratters,</b> as {{they are less likely to}} stray or hunt further afield. Cats are wary of adult rats, given their size, but are particularly adept at hunting young rats.|$|R
50|$|Harlequin Pinschers {{are small}} dogs that weigh {{anywhere}} from {{eight to ten}} pounds. They have short hair that can be blue or red merle. The ears can be cropped or left natural. Natural ears should be held erect {{with half of the}} ear dropping forward. These are known as rose prick ears. Their tails can be docked or left long. Personality: Harlequin Pinschers are known for their alert and inquisitive expressions. These little dogs are fearless despite their small size. In fact, many Min Pin fanciers state that the Min Pin is a large dog trapped in a small body. They can also be quite vocal and rambunctious. Harlequin Pinschers originated in Germany and were created by crossing traditional Miniature Pinschers with various toy-sized short-haired terriers. While these tiny dogs were once used as <b>ratters,</b> today they are lovable lap dogs. Furthermore, due to their small size, Harlequin Pinschers are great for people who live in apartments or small homes.|$|R
5000|$|Schnauzers have {{distinctive}} beards and long, feathery eyebrows. They {{are generally}} either a {{salt and pepper}} color, black, or white, {{but they can be}} brown also. Some owners shave their Schnauzers down the back while the hairs on their legs are kept long and curly, but this changes the coat colour, so show schnauzers especially will have their back coat [...] "stripped" [...] by hand, to encourage the salt and pepper pattern to emerge. It was traditional to have the tails docked and the ears cropped to give an alert appearance. It was common to crop the ears and dock the tails on working dogs. As these are <b>ratters,</b> these procedures don't give the rat anything to grab on to when being attacked and therefore cannot fight back. Cropping and docking are now illegal in the European Union, Australia and New Zealand, and are becoming less common elsewhere. The schnauzer's beard and leg hair should be brushed often to prevent mats from forming.|$|R
