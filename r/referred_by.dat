5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German.

Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E

5|$|In his 1988 book Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, the {{freelance}} dinosaurologist Gregory Paul {{proposed that}} A. fragilis had tall pointed horns and a slender build {{compared to a}} postulated second species A. atrox, and was not a different gender due to rarity.
