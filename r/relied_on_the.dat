5|$|A few {{physicists}} {{persisted in}} developing semiclassical models in which electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears {{to obey the}} laws of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments {{for the existence of}} photons was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as absolutely definitive; since it <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments. Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.|$|E

5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing {{prosperity}} in Scotland {{led to a}} spate of new building, both public and private. The threat of Jacobite insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period. Military structures <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strength of inclined and angled engineered masonry and earthen toppings to deflect and absorb artillery fire. This spate of military building culminated {{in the construction of}} Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> support of those below him, as {{without the support of}} his more powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could expect to find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E

5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{appear in}} popular culture in {{concepts}} such as fly-on-the-wall documentary-making in film and television production.

5|$|Industrial {{production}} {{in the twentieth century}} relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps.

This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E

The ZNG were short of uniforms; 20 percent of those drafted in Zagreb during this period received uniforms, while the remainder fought in civilian clothes.
