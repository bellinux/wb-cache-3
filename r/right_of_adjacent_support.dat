40|$|A {{transmission}} {{tower is}} submitted to wind loads {{acting on the}} tower body and the conductors. A vertical difference <b>of</b> <b>adjacent</b> <b>supports</b> <b>of</b> conductors {{as well as a}} different distance between adjacent towers generates non-balanced tension of conductors, which acts on the tower as ‘non-balanced tension load’. We studied the static and dynamic properties of non-balanced tension of conductors which are running along supports of different height under strong winds. We concluded as follows; (1) Conductor’s non-balanced tensions acting on a transmission tower increased with vertical difference <b>of</b> <b>adjacent</b> <b>supports.</b> (2) The gusty wind response of a tower was bigger than an estimated value based on Design Standard on Structures for Transmission, JEC- 127 (1979) ...|$|R

40|$|As {{buildings}} inevitably {{increase in}} height, vertical support elements (e. g. columns and shear walls) in tall buildings {{are required to}} carry vertical load increments {{from a number of}} floors. Therefore, axial shortening of vertical elements due to long term creep and shrinkage effects is inevitable in reinforced concrete buildings. However, the calculation of reliable values for axial shortening is not a straight forward task. All parameters may be uncertain or may not be available at the design stage. Recently, engineers have also become concerned with differential shortening <b>of</b> <b>adjacent</b> vertical elements, particularly in the lower and basement levels of super high rise structures. Largely varied values and rates for axial shortening <b>of</b> <b>adjacent</b> <b>support</b> elements is not only a concern for vertical deformation, but can critically impact on the performance of horizontal structural elements such as beams and slabs. This research aims to develop a robust possibility-based differential shortening prediction framework, and associated risk distribution profiles, which overcomes the deficiencies in the current models for predicting axial column shortening in reinforced concrete high rise buildings.

40|$|AbstractA {{macrophage}} cell line (J 774), activated with interferon-γ and endotoxin {{to express the}} inducible form of NO synthase (iNOS), immediately inhibited the cellular respiration of co-incubated L- 929 fibroblasts or non-activated J 774 macrophages. The inhibition was potent, rapid and reversible when the NO was removed by adding oxyhaemoglobin or by inhibiting iNOS. Exogenously added NO also rapidly and reversibly inhibited cellular respiration over the same range of NO concentrations. This inhibition was competitive with oxygen and due to direct inhibition of cytochrome oxidase. Thus, NO generated by one cell can regulate the respiration <b>of</b> <b>adjacent</b> cells, <b>supporting</b> the hypothesis that NO may be a physiological and/or pathological regulator of cellular respiration, via its inhibition of cytochrome oxidase...|$|R

40|$|In mammals, {{cochlear}} {{sensory hair}} {{cells that are}} responsible for hearing are postmitotic and are not replaced after loss. One of the most promising strategies to regenerate hair cells is to identify and inhibit the factors preventing the conversion <b>of</b> <b>adjacent</b> non-sensory <b>supporting</b> cells into hair cells. Here we demonstrate that mammalian hair cells can be directly generated from supporting cells by inhibition of ephrin-B 2 signalling. Using either ephrin-B 2 conditional knockout mice, shRNA-mediated gene silencing or soluble inhibitors, we found that downregulation of ephrin-B 2 signalling at embryonic stages results in supporting cell translocation into hair cell layers and subsequent switch in cell identity from supporting cell to hair cell fate. As transdifferentiation is here a result of displacement across boundary, this original finding presents the interest that newly generated hair cells directly integrate either hair cell layer, then would be likely more rapidly able to fit into functional circuitry.

40|$|The {{rational}} use of IS 6110 fingerprinting {{for studies}} of the molecular epidemiology and evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires understanding {{of the dynamics of}} transposition.

Stimulation of transposition by activation <b>of</b> an <b>adjacent</b> promoter <b>supports</b> the hypothesis that transposition occurs more readily from transcriptionally active locations. In addition, it has been shown that transposition can be enhanced by the expression of the transposase in trans. These findings imply that the frequency of transposition will vary substantially between different strains of M. tuberculosis, and furthermore that a hitherto stable strain may develop more rapid variation due to transposition into an active site. The use of IS 6110 fingerprinting for the analysis of longer-range relationships between M. tuberculosis isolates therefore needs to be interpreted with care...|$|R
40|$|Chamber {{endplates}} {{in which}} {{the inner and outer}} radii are at the same z coordinate (such as both endplates of the BaBar drift chamber) suffer large deflections under the wire load if they are only supported at the outer radius. By making the inner cylinder load bearing the deflections of the endplates would be reduced by a factor of ≈ 30. This would permit the use of thinner endplates, or simplify the prestressing operation, or both. Of course, both the inner and outer cylinders must be stable against buckling under the wire load. Calculations indicate that a 540 -µm-thick carbon-fiber inner cylinder would be just at the buckling limit, while a 1. 5 -mm-thick cylinder would buckle only at 10 times nominal load. A recent destructive test at Princeton supports these calculations. A 1. 5 -mm-thick inner cylinder would present 0. 7 % radiation lengths to particles, a modest increment to that <b>of</b> the <b>adjacent</b> PEP-II <b>support</b> tube (presently spec’ed to be 1. 2 % of a radiation length, not counting aluminum needed for an rf shield) ...|$|R

40|$|Genome-wide {{measurements}} of transcriptional activity in bacteria {{indicate that the}} transcription of successive genes is strongly correlated beyond the scale of operons. Here, we analyze hundreds of bacterial genomes to identify supra-operonic segments of genes that are proximal in {{a large number of}} genomes. We show that these synteny segments correspond to genomic units of strong transcriptional co-expression. Structurally, the segments contain operons with specific relative orientations (co-directional or divergent) and nucleoid-associated proteins are found to bind at their boundaries. Functionally, operons inside a same segment are highly co-expressed even in the apparent absence of regulatory factors at their promoter regions. Remote operons along DNA can also be co-expressed if their corresponding segments share a transcriptional or sigma factor, without requiring these factors to bind directly to the promoters of the operons. As evidence that these results apply across the bacterial kingdom, we demonstrate them both in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The underlying process that we propose involves only RNA-polymerases and DNA: it implies that the transcription of an operon mechanically enhances the transcription <b>of</b> <b>adjacent</b> operons. In <b>support</b> <b>of</b> a primary role of this regulation by facilitated co-transcription, we show that the transcription en bloc of successive operons as a result of transcriptional read-through is strongly and specifically enhanced in synteny segments.
