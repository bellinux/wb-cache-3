5|$|In 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was {{purchased}} by Wizards of the Coast. Following three years of development, Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition was released in 2000. The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the D <b>rules</b> <b>to</b> date, and served {{as the basis for}} a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System. The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core <b>rules</b> <b>to</b> encourage further customization of characters. The new rules standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. In 2003, Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5 was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the ACC {{experienced}} {{a season of}} unusual parity and fielded an NCAA-record number of ten bowl-eligible teams. Six of those possessed identical 4–4 conference records, and the remaining four had 5–3 conference records. Among the eligible teams, N.C. State (6–6) possessed the only non-winning overall record and was therefore forced by NCAA <b>rules</b> <b>to</b> find an at-large berth outside of the ACC tie-in games.|$|E

5|$|A {{live action}} {{role-playing}} game (LARP) {{is a form}} of role-playing game where the participants physically act out their characters' actions. The players pursue goals within a fictional setting represented by the real world while interacting with each other in character.

Currently, commuters are charged a second time when they make such transfers. He added that the Public Transport Council (PTC) will review distance-based fare transfer <b>rules</b> <b>to</b> ensure they continue to facilitate “fast, seamless” public transport journeys.

5|$|Andriamasinavalona {{established}} new <b>rules</b> <b>to</b> {{strengthen the}} authority of the tompo-menakely over their subjects. Inhabitants of the fief paid taxes (isam-pangady) to the local lord, and offered him the hindquarters of all slaughtered zebu as tribute. Parents who adopted or disowned a child paid a fee of one silver piastre to the lord, and the property of those who died without children would revert to the king, who would share it with him. The inhabitants of a fief were bound to execute any work or task ordered by the tompo-menakely. The authority of the lord was highly independent and interference of the king was infrequent, in part due to the close kinship ties uniting the king to the Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona sub-castes.|$|E

5|$|Association football, {{the modern}} game, also has {{documented}} early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too. In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised <b>rules</b> <b>to</b> prohibit {{violence on the}} pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play. The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Classical thinkers {{employed}} classification {{as a way}} {{to define}} and assess the quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's Poetics describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop <b>rules</b> <b>to</b> distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre. Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic poetry, lyric poetry, and dramatic poetry, treating comedy and tragedy as subgenres of dramatic poetry.|$|E
5|$|Edgar was {{concerned}} about different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom, and wanted to impose uniform <b>rules</b> <b>to</b> be followed by all. The rules were {{set out in the}} key document of the English reform, the Regularis Concordia, which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970. The Concordia was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys. A major aim of the Concordia was the regularisation of the form of church services, and Æthelwold tried to synthesise what he regarded as the best Continental and English practice.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, the Hungarian {{theoretical}} biologist Aristid Lindenmayer (1925–1989) {{developed the}} L-system, a formal grammar {{which can be}} used to model plant growth patterns in the style of fractals. L-systems have an alphabet of symbols that can be combined using production <b>rules</b> <b>to</b> build larger strings of symbols, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by Gottfried Leibniz, Georg Cantor, Helge von Koch, Wacław Sierpiński and others, Benoît Mandelbrot wrote a famous paper, How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension, crystallising mathematical thought into the concept of the fractal.|$|E

Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E
