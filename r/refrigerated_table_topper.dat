50|$|Ten of {{the twelve}} teams {{took part in the}} first ever round of Championship {{fixtures}} on Saturday, 8 September 1888 and although no league table was published in any of the newspapers of the time West Bromwich Albion would have been the very first <b>table</b> <b>toppers.</b> By modern-day calculations, Derby County would have been the first ever <b>table</b> <b>toppers</b> because of their superior goal difference which was +3 after the first game. Albion won 2-0 at Stoke in front of 4,500 spectators and would have headed Preston North End, Derby County and Everton by virtue of an infinite goal average as they kept a clean sheet. Goal Average was the number of goals scored divided by the number of goals conceded. Goal Average was used to separate teams who were tied on points at that time. Preston defeated Burnley 5-2, Derby were 6-3 winners at Bolton and Everton secured the points in a 2-1 victory over Accrington. Aston Villa defender Gershom Cox was thought to have earned the distinction of scoring the first ever league goal with an unfortunate own goal in a 1-1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Fred Dewhurst opening the scoring minutes later at Preston with the first intentional goal. However the post-match reports of relative kick-off times show most games were delayed allowing for crowds to assemble. A goal by England and Bolton winger Kenny Davenport 2 minutes into the match against Derby County was scored comfortably before any other and is now regarded as the first ever football league goal.|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the temperature variability {{that existed in}} <b>refrigerated</b> <b>table</b> grape consignments over a two-day journey from two suppliers in southern Spain, to client managed facilities in England. In order to inhibit senescence, perishable foods are transported in temperature-controlled transport to maximize shelf life. However, thermal dynamics suggests that uniform spatial temperature is not necessarily achieved despite a constant set point. As fruit exposed to suboptimal temperatures {{is more likely to}} exhibit undesirable quality issues, knowledge of spatial temperature can direct quality control team members to these potentially problematic pallets within an inbound shipment. Warmer temperatures were identified on the passenger side of both trailers, at the rear of both trailers, and in lower pallet layers. Furthermore, heightened temperature was recorded in lower pallet layers in close proximity to the refrigeration return unit. The Supplier 2 shipment, set at 4 oC, exhibited more spatially uniform temperatures compared to the Supplier 1 shipment set at 1 oC. This implies that an operational compromise may exist: a higher but more uniform temperature or a lower but more variable temperature. In addition, analysis of airflow distribution suggested that airflow could be improved specifically in lower pallet layers and towards the rear of the trailer. Improved circulation will promote improved temperature uniformity for quality maintenance...|$|R
25|$|Bengaluru {{began the}} defense of the I-League title on 17 January 2015 against Dempo. Bengaluru had the chance to take the lead when they were awarded a penalty in 44th minute but Sunil Chhetri could not convert to chance. The match {{eventually}} ended in a goal-less draw. The next match for Bengaluru FC was worse as they went down to Pune 1–3 in their next home game. Pune took an early 0–2 lead through Darko Nikac and Luciano Sabrosa. Pune furthered their advantage in the 82nd minute when Thongkhosiem Haokip connected well with Yumnam Raju's cross for the ball to bounce beyond the goal-line after rattling the crossbar. In the closing minutes, Bengaluru pulled one back when Eugeneson Lyngdoh scored a goal with the assist from Sean Rooney. In their next game against East Bengal, Bengaluru could not find the back of the net, in spite of dominating {{in the first half and}} creating multiple chances. In the second half, Abhinas Ruidas scored a goal for East Bengal against the run of play while Bengaluru continued to miss chances and thus game ended 1–0 in favour of East Bengal and Bengaluru's winless streak was extended to three games. However, Bengaluru finally secured the first win of the season in the away game against newly promoted, and then <b>table</b> <b>toppers,</b> Royal Wahingdoh with a dominant 4–0 win.

Bengaluru looked to be heading for another defeat when DSK Shivajians were leading 2-0 {{in the second half}} with a brace from Holicharan Narzary, but a goal from Sunil Chhetri and a last gasp header from the defender Salam Ranjan Singh ensured a point for the visitors. Bengaluru's winless run {{continued}} against the debutant Minerva Punjab F.C. when in spite of taking the lead in the second half with Sunil Chhetri's goal, Sandesh Jhingan's own goal meant 1-1 draw for Bengaluru. The game extended Bengaluru FC's winless run to five games across all competitions, their worst run since team's inception in 2013. Facing Aizawl F.C. next, Bengaluru FC had to endure another draw when they had to settle for 1-1. After conceding the lead, Sunil Chhetri equalized but missed the penalty in the second half and subsequently could not find a winner. With his goal, Chhetri also became the highest Indian goal scorer in National Football League and I-League combined, surpassing Bhaichung Bhutia, who scored 89 goals. Bengaluru further failed to win against Mumbai F.C. in the away game, when they failed to break the deadlock against defensive home team.

Before the next game against Mumbai, Bengaluru were trailing by 3 points to the <b>table</b> <b>topper</b> Mohun Bagan, in spite of having played 2 more games, {{so it was a}} crucial match for Bengaluru to stay in the title hunt, but the game turned out to be 4th consecutive draw between the two sides. In spite of continuous attack by Bengaluru, the first half remained goalless. In the second half, against the run of the play, Rahul Bheke scored the goal for visitors {{to take the lead in}} 67th minute. Bengaluru intensified the attack and Robin Singh equalized in the closing minutes before he was sent-off. The next game for Bengaluru was another top of the table clash with Pune F.C.. Bengaluru quickly got ahead when Shankar Sampingiraj scored the fastest goal of the season and the second fastest I-League goal of all time, in 15 seconds. Bengaluru doubled the lead just before half-time when C.K. Vineeth scored a goal from Beikhokhei Beingaichho's pass and Bengaluru scored their first ever win against Pune team. In three days, Bengaluru faced another Pune based team Bharat FC. Facing the depleted time, Bengaluru easily won the game 2–0 with goals from Eugeneson Lyngdoh and C.K.

The {{platforms}} for both successes against Roscommon, Longford and Carlow were excellent first half displays where big scoring returns were racked up. The second half display against Clare {{was probably the best}} of the season so far. Next up was an away trip to London which Monaghan easily won by 0-16 to 1-05. The game against Offaly in the penultimate round in Clones could well be called the defining match in the group. As it turned out it was and a last gasp Paul Meegan point in injury time was enough to give Monaghan a 0-13 to 0-12 win, guaranteeing them a semi final place as <b>table</b> <b>toppers</b> and an all important position in the revamped Division 2 in 2008. This was achieved with a game in hand against Leitrim which was scheduled for April 15 and won by Monaghan on a 1-14 to 2-10 score. The league semi-final against Meath was played in Croke Park and it was a disaster for the Farney men as two early Meath goals gave them a cushion that they built a winning platform on. Despite the early concession of 2 goals within the first 3 minutes Monaghan dominated and could have been in front at half time but instead went in 2-04 to 0-05 in arrears. The concession of a third goal early in the second half settled matters and despite a late Monaghan rally Meath emerged winners on a 3-10 to 0-12 score. This game asked more questions than it answered and it was obvious from this game that Monaghan's full back line and team in general needed a major overhaul prior to the Ulster championship meeting against Down in Newry on June 10.|$|R

After taking the lead towards the end of the first half through Sean Rooney's goal, Bengaluru could not hold on to the lead and conceded a penalty in 65th minute and the game ended in 1–1 draw. After facing defeat against Persipura Jayapura in the AFC cup, Bengaluru returned to form against Salgaocar when they registered 3–1 win. After leading in the first half by 26th-minute goal from Thoi Singh, Bengaluru faced equalizer from Darryl Duffy, but Eugeneson Lyngdoh quickly restored the lead. Man of the match Curtis Osano scored his first goal ever for the team in 80th minute and got on the scoresheet for the victory. In the last away game of the season, Bengaluru played against Dempo. Bengaluru took the lead through Robin Singh's goal, but could not hold on to the lead as Uttam Rai scored one back and the match ended at 1–1 with Bengaluru trailing the <b>table</b> <b>toppers,</b> Mohun Bagan by 2 points.

Bengaluru looked on course to defend the title when John Johnson scored his first goal of the season with a header, from Rino Anto's cross, but Mohun Bagan defender Bello Razaq scored the equalizer in 87th minute. Bengaluru's subsequent attack could not find the winner and they conceded the title to Mohun Bagan, though Bengaluru ended the season with the longest unbeaten run of 13 games, equalizing the record set by East Bengal in 2010–11 season.|$|R

Revenge was gained the following season when the same two sides met in the final again this time though it was victory for the <b>table</b> <b>toppers</b> 30-16. That victory was the start of a hat-trick of triumphs as they beat Portobello Playboys 46-24 in 2002 and Fife Lions in 2003. It would be three more years before they won the title again, after losing to Fife Lions in the 2004 final they failed to reach the next two finals. There was also three first round exits in the Challenge Cup against Leigh East, Oulton Raiders and Heworth A.R.L.F.C.. Another hat-trick of titles from 2007 was next as they saw off Fife Lions twice and Carluke Tigers in 2009, 18-10 in a game that went to extra-time. In the challenge Cup history was made by the club, when on 25 January 2009 Edinburgh became the first Scottish side to win a game in the historic competition, beating the RAF 18-16. In the second round they lost to Leeds Met University. They would later repeat this feat in 2010 when after knocking out Gloustershire Warriors 36-32 they lost out to Blackwood Bulldogs in the second round. Back in the league Carluke gained revenge by defeating the Eagles in the 2010 final 10-14. 2011 and 2012 would bring the title count up to 9 with victories over Ayrshire Storm 26-10 and Aberdeen Warriors 36-10. Since then they have reached just one final in 2014.|$|R

50|$|The {{international}} trade in table grapes has significantly benefitted from the increased availability of cold storage and <b>refrigerated</b> container technology. <b>Table</b> grapes are a labour-intensive agricultural product that require harvesting by hand at peak ripeness. In order to maintain product quality at point of sale, harvested grapes must be sorted, packaged and cooled to near 0 °C as quickly as possible. Transportation in ventilated and temperature controlled environments requires significant investment in processing facilities, shipping and logistics. As the production cycle for table grapes is relatively long compared with other fruit, with new plantations taking 2-3 years to become productive, export production and promotion is often concentrated {{in the hands of}} large vertically integrated commercial enterprises or producer-exporter associations such as the Fruit Exporters Association of Chile (ASOEX).|$|R
