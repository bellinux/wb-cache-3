50|$|Concerns {{about the}} work {{environment}} quality of nail salons can be discussed in conversations about Occupational safety and health, as {{there is some evidence}} that suggest nail salon workers are subjected to potentially unjust, hazardous working conditions. Occupational safety and health concerns is a component of environmental justice. In surveys conducted of Vietnamese-American nail salon workers, many responses suggest that the work environment may be setting the space for negative health consequences. According to Standard 62-1989: Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Quality of the American Society for Heating, <b>Refrigeration,</b> Air Condiitoning <b>Engineers,</b> adequate supply of outdoor air should be about 20 cubic feet per minute per occupant. This necessitates multiple pathways for air to enter and exit the room. Such pathways include, but are not limited to windows and doors. However, the study showed that one-third of the surveyed shops had only one single door for ventilation with no secondary air pathway.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a number of studies that investigated the effects of noise from building mechanical systems on human task performance and perception. Three phases of research were conducted, each of which utilized a different set of noise signals produced by building mechanical systems: (1) broadband noise at different levels and spectral qualities; (2) tonal noise conditions; and (3) noise conditions with time-varying fluctuations. In each phase, at least six different noise signals (many based on in-situ measurements) were reproduced in an office-like setting. Thirty participants completed tasks (e. g. typing, grammatical reasoning, math) plus subjective questionnaires, while exposed to each noise condition for up to one hour. In general, no statistically significant differences were found in task performance across the various noise signals tested. However, higher annoyance/distraction responses from the test subjects were often significantly correlated with reduced typing performance. These higher annoyance/distraction responses were also closely correlated to higher subjective ratings of loudness, followed by roar, rumble, and tones or fluctuations. Of particular interest is that a greater perception of low frequency rumble was significantly linked to reduced performance on both the routine and cognitively demanding tasks.

50|$|With all of {{this power}} being {{dissipated}} in such a small space, cooling was a major design issue. Cray's <b>refrigeration</b> <b>engineer,</b> Dean Roush, formerly of Amana, placed a sheet of copper inside each of the circuit boards, removing the heat to a copper block on one end where it was cooled by a freon system.

40|$|The {{moisture}} {{tolerance of}} building assemblies {{is becoming a}} major durability issue worldwide because {{it is almost impossible}} to create perfectly tight building assemblies. Alerted by numerous cases of severe moisture damage caused by rain water penetration through stucco clad walls in North-America, the American Society of Heat <b>Refrigeration</b> and Air-conditioning <b>Engineers</b> (ASHRAE) has recently put out a standard on moisture design criteria for public review. This new standard forms the basis for hygrothermal performance evaluations by numerical simulation that should ultimately lead to better moisture control in buildings. In this paper the moisture behaviour of stud walls with leaks in the exterior thermal insulation system (EIFS or ETICS) is simulated by applying the procedure described in the ASHRAE standard. In a parametric study the different assembly modifications and outdoor climate conditions in North America and Europe are considered. The results show severe problems dealing with exterior insulation systems based on polystyrene insulation. Only in some cases increasing the drying potential toward the interior by replacing the vapour barrier by a smart retarder helps to solve the problem. However, when the polystyrene insulation is exchanged by mineral wool the penetrating rainwater rapidly dries out through the exterior insulation system and the humidity conditions in the wall always remain below the critical threshold...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} no manual blind control {{guideline}} used consistently throughout the energy modeling community. This paper identifies and compares five manual blind control algorithms with unique control patterns and reports blind occlusion, rate of change data, and annual building energy consumption. The blind control schemes detailed here represent five reasonable candidates for use in lighting and energy simulation based on difference driving factors. This study was performed on a medium-sized office building using EnergyPlus with the internal daylight harvesting engine. Results show that applying manual blind control algorithms affects the total annual consumption of the building {{by as much as}} 12. 5 % and 11. 5 % for interior and exterior blinds respectively, compared to the Always Retracted blinds algorithm. Peak demand was also compared showing blind algorithms affected zone load sizing by as much as 9. 8 %. The alternate algorithms were tested for their impact on American Society of Heating, <b>Refrigeration</b> and Air-Conditioning <b>Engineers</b> (ASHRAE) Guideline 14 calibration metrics and all models were found to differ from the original calibrated baseline by more than the recommended ± 15 % for coefficient of variance of the mean square error (CVRMSE) and ± 5 % for normalized mean bias error (NMBE).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical simulation of air velocity and air temperature distribution {{in an office}} room of Computer Engineering Department of University of Maiduguri which is naturally ventilated. The office room under investigation with the dimension 5 m × 5 m × 4 m has a door in the East direction, and two windows, one in the East direction {{and the other in}} the South direction. For cost effectiveness, numerical solutions of steady-state airflow and heat transfer were done using a complete two-dimensional model. The results showed that the windows and the door could not undertake indoor heat load that can make the occupants to be thermally comfortable. In activity area where people sit and stand, the air velocity is moderate, this is about 0. 98 m/s on the average. In addition, the temperature in this area is relatively high of about 302 K (29 °C) on the average.

40|$|Three main {{requirements}} {{influence the}} control of the temperatures of operating suites: (1) avoid humidities which contribute to the risks of anaesthetic explosions; (2) promote the comfort and working efficiency of the staff; and (3) conserve the patient's resources. In the United States, an air temperature of 70 to 75 °F. (21 to 240 C.) with 50 to 60 % relative humidity provides a compromise between the requirements of the patients and those of the operators. In Britain, a temperature of 65 to 70 °F. (18 to 21 °C.) and a relative humidity of 50 % is "well tolerated for many hours". In the U. S. S. R., air-conditioning should provide in summer an air temperature of 68 to 72 * 50 F. (20 to 220 C.) and in winter 66 to 68 °F. (19 to 200 C.) with a relative humidity of 55 %. According to the American Society of Heating, <b>Refrigeration</b> and Air-conditioning <b>Engineers</b> (1961) Guide "little is known about optimum air conditions for maintaining normal body tem-peratures during anaesthesia and the immediate post-operative period". Clarke and his colleagues' observation in New York City that the patient's temperature begins to rise when the wet-bulb temperature exceeds 750 F. (23 80 C.) fills one important gap.

40|$|Cooling towers, {{because of}} their seeming simplicity, are usually orphans of the {{facilities}} operation. We are all aware that cooling towers are the step-children of the chemical process plant, electric power generating station, and <b>refrigeration</b> system. While <b>engineers</b> are pretty well convinced {{of the importance of}} their sophisticated equipment, and rightly so, they take the cooling towers and the cold water returning from them for granted. Design Conditions are specified for the particular requirements before a cooling tower is purchased. This relates to the volume of circulating water, hot water temperature on the tower, cold water discharge, and wet bulb temperature (consisting of ambient temperature and relative humidity). After the tower is put on the line and the cold water temperature or volume becomes inadequate, engineers look to solutions other than the obvious. While all cooling towers are purchased to function at 100 % of capability in accordance with the required Design Conditions, in actual on-stream employment, the level of operation many times is lower, downwards to as much as 50 % due to a variety of reasons: 1. The present service needed is now greater than the original requirements which the tower was purchased for. 2. ?Slippage? due to usage and perhaps deficient maintenance has reduced the performance of the tower over years of operation. 3. The installation could have been originally undersized due to the low bidder syndrome. 4. New plant expansion needs additional water volume and possibly colder temperatures off the tower...|$|R
40|$|Residential {{two-stage}} gas furnaces {{account for}} {{almost a quarter of}} the total number of models listed in the March 2005 GAMA directory of equipment certified for sale in the United States. Two-stage furnaces are expanding their presence in the market mostly because they meet consumer expectations for improved comfort. Currently, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure serves as the method for reporting furnace total fuel and electricity consumption under laboratory conditions. In 2006, American Society of Heating <b>Refrigeration</b> and Air-conditioning <b>Engineers</b> (ASHRAE) proposed an update to its test procedure which corrects some of the discrepancies found in the DOE test procedure and provides an improved methodology for calculating the energy consumption of two-stage furnaces. The objectives of this paper are to explore the differences in the methods for calculating two-stage residential gas furnace energy consumption in the DOE test procedure and in the 2006 ASHRAE test procedure and to compare test results to research results from field tests. Overall, the DOE test procedure shows a reduction in the total site energy consumption of about 3 percent for two-stage compared to single-stage furnaces at the same efficiency level. In contrast, the 2006 ASHRAE test procedure shows almost no difference in the total site energy consumption. The 2006 ASHRAE test procedure appears to provide a better methodology for calculating the energy consumption of two-stage furnaces. The results indicate that, although two-stage technology by itself does not save site energy, the combination of two-stage furnaces with BPM motors provides electricity savings, which are confirmed by field studies...|$|R
