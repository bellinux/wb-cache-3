40|$|PURPOSE: Research {{experimentally}} {{evaluated the}} impacts of a mechanical macrophyte removal device on changes in sediment bed elevation and water quality in the littoral zone of a shallow embayment located in Eau Galle Reservoir, Wisconsin. BACKGROUND: Mechanical macrophyte removal devices are an attractive, low-cost means of removing macrophytes in specific areas without herbicides or repeated mechanical harvesting. However, commercially available mechanical macrophyte removal devices that employ a submerged <b>roller</b> <b>arm</b> and paddle design to entangle and uproot macrophytes may have indirect negative impacts to littoral habitat by resuspending and scouring sediment and associated nutrients. Excavation and alteration of sediment substrate (see James et al. (2004)) {{can have an impact}} on invertebrate and fish habitat and lead to enhanced nutrient recycling, depending on the density of use in relation to lake shoreline size. The objective {{of this study was to}} experimentally quantify sediment displacement and changes in water quality associated with resuspension during operation of mechanical macrophyte removal devices employing a submerged <b>roller</b> <b>arm</b> and paddle design.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the impacts of a mechanical macrophyte removal device on changes in littoral sediment substrate. BACKGROUND: Commercially available mechanical macrophyte removal devices have become a popular tool for controlling localized aquatic plant growth near docks and swimming areas. Some use a floating pivot arm with attached dangling underwater rakes to entangle and sweep macrophytes from an area. Others consist of an underwater <b>roller</b> <b>arm</b> located on or immediately above the sediment surface that is attached to a pivot arm and motor mounted on a boat dock or nearshore structure. Paddles are often attached to the <b>roller</b> <b>arm</b> to dig into sediments and uproot macrophytes. Mechanical removal devices can be run continuously for several weeks to clear the area of macrophytes, then run intermittently throughout the growing season (up to 10 hr or more per week) to maintain macrophyte control. Advantages of this type of macrophyte control technique include macrophyte removal in a specific area, low operational costs, and mechanical rather than herbicidal control. One negative impact of mechanical macrophyte removal devices that use an underwater arm with paddles is disturbance and scouring of silty sediment and associated nutrients and contaminants in shallow littoral regions.

30|$|If {{the rotor}} of the pump stalls, a {{two-tone}} emergency alarm will sound. After interrogation with the device programmer, the device display indicates a ‘Motor Stall’. When no motor stall is indicated {{and this is}} not derived from the pump logs, a roller study should be performed in case failure is suspected (Fig. 12). In this procedure, the pump is programmed in the continuous infusion mode, using a preset, without activation and with a priming bolus of 10  μl with a duration of 1  min. With fluoroscopy, the rotor is visualised, thereby reducing the aperture. A plain radiographic image is made and the preset bolus delivery is activated. After 2  min, a new plain radiographic image is made and the two images are compared. In a normal pump function, the rollers have moved approximately 60 ° from their original position.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Intrathecal drug {{delivery}} systems (intrathecal pumps) {{are used to}} treat patients with chronic refractory pain syndromes and spasticity. The objective of our case report was to demonstrate that intrathecal pump malfunction can lead to intrathecal overdosing of drugs. CASE REPORT: We present 2 cases of intrathecal pump malfunction leading to overinfusion. The first case concerns a patient with an intrathecal pump that was implanted almost 5 years before the reported incident. During a refill procedure, 12. 5 mL was aspirated instead of the expected 21. 8 mL. Analysis of the pump revealed that the pump was overinfusing. The second case concerns a patient with an intrathecal pump that was implanted more than 5 years before the reported incident. Ten hours after a regular refill of the pump, she {{was found in a}} comatose state, and when the intrathecal pump was emptied, only 16 mL was aspirated instead of the 19. 6 mL expected. Analysis of the pump revealed that the inner tubing was not running smoothly over the <b>roller</b> <b>arms,</b> possibly causing spurts, which could have caused an overinfusion. CONCLUSIONS: We present 2 cases of intrathecal pump malfunction, which most likely led to overinfusion of fentanyl intrathecally. To reduce the risk of this complication, particular attention should be paid to drug reservoir volume discrepancies and overdose symptoms reported by patients.

50|$|Toyota {{introduced}} its Valvematic technology in 2008. Valvematic employs an intermediate shaft to achieve continuous variable valve lift. The intermediate shaft has an actuating member for each cylinder. Each actuating member {{is made of}} two finger followers {{on either side of}} a roller bearing member. The followers can rotate in relation to the roller member by means of internal gear threads and an electric motor attached {{to the end of the}} intermediate shaft. The gear threads of the roller member and finger followers are in opposing directions. This means when the shaft swivels, the roller member and finger followers will move in opposing directions, moving either apart or closer together. In this way, the axle angle between them can be varied infinitely by the electric motor. The intake valve is actuated by camshaft via the intermediate shaft. Specifically, the camshaft acts on the roller member of intermediate shaft, transferring the movement to both finger followers, then towards the <b>roller</b> rocker <b>arms</b> and ultimately to the intake valves. When the angle of the finger followers is narrow with respect to the roller member, valve lift is low. As the angle increases, so does valve lift. In this way, Valvematic can vary valve lift by adjusting the angle of the finger followers in relation to the roller bearing member.|$|R

5000|$|The Bigsby vibrato unit is {{installed}} {{on the top of}} the guitar and works in conjunction with a <b>roller</b> bridge. The <b>arm</b> of the Bigsby is spring-loaded and attached to a pivoting metal bar, around which the strings of the guitar are installed. In the neutral or unused position, the pressure of the spring counterbalances the pull of the strings, resulting in constant pitch when the strings are played. When the arm of the Bigsby is pushed down towards the top of the guitar, the bridge rocks forward causing the strings to loosen, lowering their pitch. When the arm is released, the strings return to normal pitch. The arm may also be lifted to raise the pitch of the strings. The Bigsby is highly controllable within its range of motion and usually requires little force to operate. It is ideally suited to musicians who use slow, subtle, or extended bends. It has limited range compared to vibrato units using longer springs contained internally. Competing units, like the Floyd Rose and the Fender synchronized tremolo (or strat-style) are therefore preferred by some players.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} VTEC-E implementation is {{a variation}} of SOHC VTEC {{which is used to}} increase combustion efficiency at low RPM while maintaining the mid range performance of non-vtec engines. VTEC-E is the first version of VTEC to employ the use of <b>roller</b> rocker <b>arms</b> and because of that, it forgoes the need for having 3 intake lobes for actuating the two valves—two lobes for non-VTEC operation(one small and one medium-sized lobe) and one lobe for VTEC operation(the biggest lobe). Instead, there are two different intake cam profiles per cylinder—a very mild cam lobe with little lift and a normal cam lobe with moderate lift. Because of this, at low RPM, when VTEC is not engaged, one of the two intake valves is allowed to open only a very small amount due to the mild cam lobe, forcing most of the intake charge through the other open intake valve with the normal cam lobe. This induces swirl of the intake charge which improves air/fuel atomization in the cylinder and allows for a leaner fuel mixture to be used. As the engine's speed and load increase, both valves are needed to supply a sufficient mixture. When engaging VTEC mode, a pre-defined threshold for MPH (must be moving), RPM and load must be met before the computer actuates a solenoid which directs pressurized oil into a sliding pin, just like with the original VTEC. This sliding pin connects the intake rocker arm followers together so that, now, both intake valves are following the [...] "normal" [...] camshaft lobe instead of just one of them. When in VTEC, since the [...] "normal" [...] cam lobe has the same timing and lift as the intake cam lobes of the SOHC non-VTEC engines, both engines have identical performance in the upper powerband assuming everything else is the same.|$|R

Another popular service-parts-only component used on the 302 was the magnetic-pulse Delco transistor-ignition ball-bearing distributor. Introduced in 1963 on Pontiac's 389 and 421 drag racing engines, General Motors fitted it to the 1966? Z/28 before they used it on the L88 [...] Corvette. It eliminated the production breaker-point ignition allowing greater spark energy and more stable ignition timing at all engine speeds including idle. This was one of the least talked about yet most transformative and comprehensive performance and durability upgrades of its time.
