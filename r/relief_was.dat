5|$|Unfortunately, its {{original}} provenance remains unknown. The <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> not archaeologically excavated, and thus {{we have no}} further information where it came from, or in which context it was discovered. An interpretation of the relief thus relies on stylistic comparisons with other objects for which the date and place of origin have been established, on {{an analysis of the}} iconography, and on the interpretation of textual sources from Mesopotamian mythology and religion.|$|E

30|$|Basin <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> an {{essential}} parameter {{to understand the}} geomorphic process and landform characteristics. The basin <b>relief</b> has <b>been</b> calculated as vertical distance between the lowest and highest points of the basin (Sreedevi et al. 2009). The influence of <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> inextricably bound up with other basin characteristics and is of greater significance to some indices of basin response particularly peak run-off rates and sediment delivery than others. Basin <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> an index of the potential energy available in the drainage basin, and of course, the greater <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> the greater erosional forces acting on the basin. In the present study, lower relief (166  m) and higher <b>relief</b> (1635  m) <b>are</b> noticed. Therefore, <b>relief</b> of the watershed is 1469  m. It is indicating that the erosional forces and the mean denudational rates are higher in the study area.|$|R
5|$|A {{category}} of ticket packages {{was created to}} be sold by an auction process at prices estimated at up to $1,000. All proceeds were donated to Music for Relief, a non-profit organization founded by Linkin Park to support disaster relief and programs to protect and restore the environment. Additionally, one dollar per concert ticket sold was contributed to the charity. A tent of Music for <b>Relief</b> <b>was</b> staffed by local volunteers at each concert. The tent featured a photo booth which enabled fans to document their concert experience and express their support to take action on climate change, {{leading up to the}} United Nations Climate Summit that took place on September 23, 2014 in New York City. Various clean energy tools were also showcased.|$|E
5|$|A small Swedish {{reinforcement}} force {{arrived in}} Trondheim, but both food and ammunition were in short supply. On October 4, the Norwegian forces {{arrived at the}} city reinforced by 1,000 peasants from the surrounding countryside who had taken up arms. When hearing that aid was near, {{the population of the}} city revolted, but the uprising within Trondheim was quickly suppressed. Charles X ordered Lieutenant Colonel Erik Drakenberg to assemble a force in Jämtland and march towards Trondheim, but the <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> stopped by Norwegian peasants that had taken to the hills and defended the mountain passages.|$|E
5|$|After the Iron Age {{occupation}} {{may have}} {{continued into the}} Roman era indicated by the discovery of pottery fragments, a small stone statue of Mars possibly from a Roman temple and coins of Claudius Gothicus and Valentinian II. The site may still have been occupied into the Anglo-Saxon period. Several of the finds were uncovered during excavations by Harold St George Gray in 1922, although the coin dating from around 370 was discovered in 1945 and a Romano-British relief in the inner defensive ditch in 1974. The <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> given to North Somerset Museum, and loaned to Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|Part of Johnson's {{campaign}} for <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> {{the abolition of}} the practice of debt imprisonment nationwide. It would take him nearly ten years to see this goal accomplished. He first spoke to the issue in the Senate on December 14, 1822, introducing a bill to end the practice, and pointing to the positive effects its cessation had effected in his home state. The bill failed, but Johnson persisted in re-introducing it every year. In 1824, it passed the Senate, but was too late to be acted upon by the House. It passed the Senate a second time in 1828, but again, the House failed to act on it, and the measure died for some years, owing to Johnson's exit from the Senate the next year.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} 4 March saw {{the arrival of}} the 2ndSquadron, 7thCavalry, which {{relieved}} the 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry. The next day Major General Innis P. Swift, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, arrived aboard Bush and assumed command. He ordered the 2ndSquadron, 7thCavalry to attack across the native skidway. The 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry therefore went back into the line to relieve them. While the <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> taking place, the Japanese launched a daylight attack. This was repulsed by the cavalrymen, with the help of artillery and mortar fire, but the American attack was delayed until late afternoon. It then ran into a Japanese minefield and by dawn the advance had only reached as far as the skidway.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Reliefs</b> <b>are</b> common {{throughout}} {{the world on the}} walls of buildings and a variety of smaller settings, and a sequence of several panels or sections of relief may represent an extended narrative. <b>Relief</b> <b>is</b> more suitable for depicting complicated subjects with many figures and very active poses, such as battles, than free-standing [...] "sculpture in the round". Most ancient architectural <b>reliefs</b> <b>were</b> originally painted, which helped to define forms in low relief. The subject of <b>reliefs</b> <b>is</b> for convenient reference assumed in this article to be usually figures, but sculpture in relief often depicts decorative geometrical or foliage patterns, as in the arabesques of Islamic art, and may be of any subject.|$|R

50|$|The {{most obvious}} way to depict <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> to imitate it at scale, as in molded or sculpted solid terrain models and molded-plastic raised-relief maps. Because of the {{disparity}} between the horizontal and vertical scales of maps, raised <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> typically exaggerated.|$|R
5|$|The relève (<b>relief)</b> <b>was</b> {{a policy}} championed by Pierre Laval in which, in {{exchange}} for French workers volunteering to work in Germany, a proportional number of prisoners would be released. The policy was announced in June 1942 and soon became extremely unpopular and divisive across French society, and among the prisoners themselves. The Vichy government had originally hoped that a much greater number of prisoners would be released under the scheme, but the Germans refused to repatriate prisoners in the proportions which Vichy had suggested. In the end, around 100,000 prisoners were repatriated under the scheme. Many, however, were old or sick prisoners who technically should have been released under earlier quotas rather than peasant soldiers portrayed by Vichy propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} fertile {{crescent}} civilizations {{are considered the}} oldest in history, {{at the time the}} Burney <b>Relief</b> <b>was</b> made other late bronze age civilizations were equally in full bloom. Travel and cultural exchange were not commonplace, but nevertheless possible. To the east, Elam with its capital Susa was in frequent military conflict with Isin, Larsa and later Babylon. Even further, the Indus Valley Civilization was already past its peak, and in China, the Erlitou culture blossomed. To the southwest, Egypt was ruled by the 12th dynasty, further to the west the Minoan civilization, centred on Crete with the Old Palace in Knossos, dominated the Mediterranean. To the north of Mesopotamia, the Anatolian Hittites were establishing their Old Kingdom over the Hattians; they brought an end to Babylon's empire with the sack of the city in 1531BCE. Indeed, Collon mentions this raid as possibly being the reason for the damage to the right-hand side of the relief.|$|E
5|$|Jacobsen quotes textual {{evidence}} that the Akkadian word eššebu (owl) corresponds to the Sumerian word ninna, and that the Sumerian Dnin-ninna (Divine lady ninna) corresponds to the Akkadian Ishtar. The Sumerian ninna can also be translated as the Akkadian kilili, {{which is also a}} name or epithet for Ishtar. Inanna/Ishtar as harlot or goddess of harlots was a well known theme in Mesopotamian mythology and in one text, Inanna is called kar-kid (harlot) and ab-ba--šú, which in Akkadian would be rendered kilili. Thus {{there appears to be a}} cluster of metaphors linking prostitute and owl and the goddess Inanna/Ishtar; this could match the most enigmatic component of the relief to a well known aspect of Ishtar. Jacobsen concludes that this link would be sufficient to explain talons and wings, and adds that nudity could indicate the <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> originally the house-altar of a bordello.|$|E

5|$|Lion's {{share of}} Ireland has with most likehood been {{above sea level}} during the last 60 million years. As such its landscapes have been shaped by erosion and {{weathering}} on land. Protracted erosion does also means most of the Paleogene and Neogene sediments have been eroded away or, as known in a few cases, buried by Quaternary deposits. Before the Quaternary glaciations affected Ireland the landscape had developed thick weathered regolith on the uplands and karst in the lowlands. There have been some controversy regarding {{the origin of the}} planation surfaces found on Ireland. While some have argued for an origin in marine planation others regard these surfaces as peneplains formed by weathering and fluvial erosion. Not only is their origin disputed but also their actual extent and the relative role of sea-level change and tectonics in their shaping. Most river systems in Ireland formed in the Cenozoic before the Quaternary glaciations. Rivers follow for most of their course structural features of the geology of Ireland. Marine erosion since the Miocene might have made Ireland's western coast retreat more than 100 km. Pre-Quaternary <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> more dramatic than today's glacier-smoothened landscapes.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamian {{religion}} recognizes {{literally thousands}} of deities, and distinct iconographies have been identified for about a dozen. Less frequently, gods are identified by a written label or dedication; such labels would only have been intended for the literate elites. In creating a religious object, the sculptor was not free to create novel images: the representation of deities, their attributes and context were as much part of the religion as the rituals and the mythology. Indeed, innovation and deviation from an accepted canon {{could be considered a}} cultic offense. The large degree of similarity that is found in plaques and seals suggests that detailed iconographies could have been based on famous cult statues; they established the visual tradition for such derivative works but have now been lost. It appears, though, that the Burney <b>Relief</b> <b>was</b> the product of such a tradition, not its source, since its composition is unique.|$|E
5|$|On September 26, President Gerald Ford {{approved}} the declaration for Florida, and later issued a separate declaration for 30 counties in Pennsylvania as the storm's flooding rains progressed northward. Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Ernest Kline assigned 600 National Guardsmen {{to assist in}} the evacuation of flood victims and maintain security in storm-ravaged areas. Over $430 million in federal disaster <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> spent overall in 1975 and distributed to 92,000 families; the bulk of the funds went to recovery for areas affected by Hurricane Eloise along its entire course. In Maryland, Governor Marvin Mandel placed 10 of the state's 23 counties under a state of emergency. Following the severe damage caused by Hurricane Eloise, its name was retired {{at the end of the}} 1975 season. As such, the name was removed from the rotating lists of names used in the Atlantic hurricane basin. However, Eloise was not replaced by any particular name due to the addition of male names into the lists in 1979.|$|E
