The roof—which was previously made of timber—was replaced with a concrete one in 1952 due to damage from termites. The <b>reordering</b> of the sanctuary took place in 1969 after the Second Vatican Council, in which the main altar was moved to the cathedral's crossing. In 1988, air conditioning was installed and the roof underwent reparation.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves <b>reordering</b> the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E
5|$|For most of history, {{humanity}} did {{not recognize}} or {{understand the concept of}} the Solar System. Most people up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric <b>reordering</b> of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth. The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons. Improvements in the telescope and the use of unmanned spacecraft have enabled the investigation of geological phenomena, such as mountains, craters, seasonal meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, dust storms and ice caps on the other planets.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} earlier {{renovation}} attempts, authorities were considering the complete demolition of the 130-year-old Christchurch Cathedral. The building had become structurally compromised {{due to the}} collapse of its western wall, and the strong vibration had shattered its stained glass rose window. Similar damage was inflicted to the Christchurch Arts Centre, although it had been in a precarious state prior to the event. A three-month reconstruction project was scheduled to take place starting in October 2011, with associated costs estimated at NZ$30 million (US$24 million). The tower of the historic Lyttelton Timeball Station, which sustained damage from the February 2011 earthquake, collapsed after plans to dismantle the building had been initiated. Lyttelton Port, a major harbour in the region, suffered additional damage from the tremors and opted to initiate full engineering assessments. The multi-story HSBC Tower shook considerably during the quake, though damage was limited to cracks and broken roof tiles. Artifacts from the Canterbury Museum collection were thrown into disorder by the aftershocks, several days after <b>reordering</b> work had been completed since the February 2011 earthquake. In all, experts believed the earthquake would increase reconstruction costs in Christchurch by approximately NZ$6 billion (US$4.83 billion).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the very common {{situation in which}} a single-period 'newsboy' type product may be ordered or produced twice during a season/period. We show that the explicit consideration of this <b>reorder</b> opportunity makes the newsboy problem very much richer. The specific version considered in this paper allows a <b>reorder</b> during mid-season after the early-season demand has been observed, and this <b>reorder</b> arrives after a given lead time. The demand distributions during the various portions of the season may have very general distribution forms; also, the late-season and early-season demands may be dependent. Solution procedures are developed {{to find the best}} way to exploit this <b>reorder</b> opportunity, and our numerical solutions indicate that this <b>reorder</b> opportunity can improve profits considerably as long as the product's profit margin is not very high. Other real-world variations of this two-order newsboy problem are briefly discussed. © 1997 Elsevier Science B. V. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|In mathematics, {{the notion}} of {{permutation}} relates to the act of arranging {{all the members of}} a set into some sequence or order, or if the set is already ordered, rearranging (<b>reordering)</b> its elements, a process called permuting. These differ from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set where order is disregarded. For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three element set. As another example, an anagram of a word, all of whose letters are different, is a permutation of its letters. In this example, the letters are already ordered in the original word and the anagram is a <b>reordering</b> of the letters. The study of permutations of finite sets is a topic in the field of combinatorics.|$|E

An edge from node x to node y in this DAG represents the fact that value x is one of the inputs to operation y. A topological ordering of the vertices of this DAG represents a valid <b>reordering</b> of the code, and the number of registers needed to evaluate the code in a given ordering is given by the vertex separation number of the ordering.|$|E
