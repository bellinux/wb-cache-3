5|$|In 1996 NSB Gardermoen {{stated that}} they {{expected}} to charge commuter and intercity trains 100 million Norwegian krone per year {{to use the new}} line. County politicians in Akershus stated that it was not <b>reasonable</b> <b>for</b> commuters to {{have to pay for the}} new railway. Early estimates showed that this would almost double to price from Oslo to Eidsvoll, and that passengers would have different prices, depending on which route they followed. Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk, which was responsible for buses in Akershus, {{stated that they}} had no way to influence NSB's prices, but that they would consider starting a coach service along the route, which would not charge the surcharge.|$|E
5|$|Some bioethicists deem it <b>reasonable</b> <b>for</b> {{parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being. One {{criticism}} of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement {{does not have a}} position on screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 mothers in the United States who have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|In the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled {{over the}} terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most <b>reasonable</b> <b>for</b> George III's eldest son and heir apparent, the Prince of Wales, to act as regent, to Pitt’s consternation Fox {{suggested}} that it was the Prince of Wales's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered.|$|E

5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is <b>reasonable</b> <b>for</b> the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items.

25|$|The Court {{said that}} the {{statutory}} language incorporates all the refinements associated with the language, is a shorthand description of the worker's legal rights. The Court explained that if the petitioner's logic was used, {{there would be no}} stopping point because all contracts would have to spell out every intricacy of every term in the contract. Contracts would thus become massive, and yet there would be no real benefit from the increase in mass.

25|$|New {{management}} came to {{both the}} lime plant and the railroad in 1976. The plant was bought by Domtar, while the Bellefonte Central was sold to Kyle Railways. Prospects still appeared <b>reasonable</b> <b>for</b> the railroad, as the plant at Chemical (bought by Domtar in 1976) had an extensive customer base. Most of the lime produced there went to steel mills in Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio. Ground lime was also shipped to glass manufacturers, and to chemical and paper companies. However, the Pennsylvania steel industry soon began to falter {{under the pressure of}} foreign competition and its own inefficiencies. As the steel industry fell, the lime market also collapsed, and Domtar shut down the plant at Chemical on July 1, 1982. The Bellefonte Central shut down the same day. The Chemical plant was sold in April 1983 to Confer Trucking, a local firm, which operated it at reduced capacity and had no need for rail service. Accordingly, the Bellefonte Central filed for abandonment in 1984. The 4.1miles (6.6km) from Chemical to Coleville were removed in spring 1985. However, the last mile of track from Bellefonte to Coleville was bought by the SEDA-COG Joint Rail Authority, in order {{to make use of the}} enginehouse at Coleville. This track is now part of the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad, and the old Bellefonte Central enginehouse is now used for their locomotives. About a mile of the right-of-way on the grounds of The Arboretum at Penn State has been converted to a rail trail, which was opened on May 22, 2006.|$|E
25|$|Although {{workers could}} be redundant, the {{employer}} {{may still be}} liable for unfair dismissal by following an unfair procedure. The procedure the employer follows to select employees to make redundant must be procedurally fair. In Williams v Compair Maxam Ltd Browne-Wilkinson J held that the proper steps should be to (1) give all warning possible (2) consult the union (3) agree objective criteria (4) follow those criteria, and (5) always check there if there is alternative employment rather than dismissal. This meant that the managers, who had selected workers {{to lose their jobs}} based on personal preferences, had unfairly dismissed the workforce. The criteria that the employer uses must be observable, and reviewable. However, employers do not need to disclose to employees all the details of their reasoning when they select people for redundancy unless there is a specific complaint of unfairness. A last in, first out policy, as used in many collective agreements will be regarded as fair. For example, in Rolls Royce plc v Unite the Union, Rolls Royce plc challenged a collective agreement which gave extra points in a selection procedure for years of service as being unlawful discrimination against younger workers (who it wished to retain). The Court of Appeal agreed with the union that this represented a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of rewarding seniority, particularly since older workers might find alternative employment much harder to secure. If possible, employers should attempt to redeploy redundant staff within their firm. Under ERA 1996 section 141 an employee should accept a suitable offer for redeployment, and will lose entitlement to redundancy if he or she declines it. 'Suitable' means substantially similar in terms of status, wages and types of duties. For example, in Thomas Wragg & Sons Ltd v Wood the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was <b>reasonable</b> <b>for</b> Mr Wood to refuse an alternative job offer the day before his termination took effect. He was therefore redundant. There is also, under section 138, a right to refuse an alternative job to which an employee is redeployed after a four-week trial period if it would be reasonable. However, redeployment remains an option for the employer that gives it greater scope to avoid redundancy payments. A right for the employee to be redeployed does not yet exist, except {{to the extent that the}} employer must consult about redeployment possibilities when more than 20 employees could be redundant.|$|E

Though highly controversial, the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 43 for and 25 against. The consensus was that since Hetch Hetchy lay on public land, it was <b>reasonable</b> <b>for</b> its natural resources to be developed for the public benefit.|$|E

500|$|The main cricket {{event of}} 1902 was the Australian tour of England. Rhodes played in all five Tests and was England's leading wicket-taker with 22 wickets {{at an average}} of 15.27. He took seven for 17 in the first innings of the first Test, out of an Australian total of 36, in {{conditions}} that the umpires considered <b>reasonable</b> <b>for</b> batting; Wisden noted that Rhodes and Hirst bowled very well. However, C. B. Fry believed that Hirst was more difficult to play and that while Rhodes bowled well, the Australian batsmen got themselves out as they [...] "hurried to the other end and tried to hit Rhodes, without success". Rain meant the game was drawn and washed out most of the second match. In the third Test, which England lost, Rhodes took five for 63, including a spell of four wickets in nineteen balls. In the fourth Test, Rhodes took seven wickets in the match, taking three quick wickets in the first innings, but receiving some heavy punishment. He was batting {{at the end of the}} match, but was unable to prevent Australia from snatching victory to win by three runs and take the series. The final Test, at The Oval, was dominated by Gilbert Jessop and Hirst, but when England needed 263 to win in the final innings, Rhodes came into bat after the ninth wicket fell with 15 needed for England to win. It has been claimed that Hirst said to Rhodes, [...] "We'll get 'em in singles", but neither batsman could remember those words being said and not all the runs came in singles. The two Yorkshiremen were not dismissed and England won by one wicket.|$|E
