5|$|The {{series was}} renewed in 2008 {{following}} {{the release of}} the first book in the Goosebumps HorrorLand series, <b>Revenge</b> <b>of</b> the Living Dummy, that was published on April 1, 2008. Before the 2008 release of <b>Revenge</b> <b>of</b> the Living Dummy, there had not been a Goosebumps book published in almost 10 years. Stine decided to start writing Goosebumps books again after receiving mail asking him to write new books in the series. Nineteen Goosebumps HorrorLand books were published, and books in the series mainly featured two stories. The series continued in 2012 with new stories featuring some of the series' most memorable villains, including Slappy the Dummy, the Lawn Gnomes and others. The first book of the spin-off series Goosebumps Most Wanted, Planet of the Lawn Gnomes, was released in October 2012.|$|E

40|$|Individuals with {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) are often said to experience strong feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge.</b> However, {{there is a need}} for confirmatory empirical studies. Therefore, in a study of 174 victims of violent crimes, the relation between feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> and {{posttraumatic stress}} reactions was investigated. Feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> were correlated with intrusion and hyperarousal but not with avoidance. Feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> explained incremental variance of intrusion and hyperarousal when the variance explained by victimological variables was controlled. The retaliation motive implied in feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> did not account for the relation between feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> and posttraumatic stress reactions. However, the relation was moderated by the time since victimization. Therefore, feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> must presumably be regarded as a maladaptive coping reaction to experienced injustice, but not in the first period after victimization...|$|R
5|$|McDiarmid {{noticed that}} the script for <b>Revenge</b> <b>of</b> the Sith demanded more action from his {{character}} than in previous films. Lightsaber combat was {{a challenge to the}} 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took fencing lessons. The close-up shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid.

40|$|Criminal victimization often provokes strong {{feelings}} <b>of</b> <b>revenge.</b> Two studies {{were conducted to}} investigate whether legal punishment of the perpetrator reduces victims’ feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge.</b> A cross-sectional study of 174 crime victims revealed that punishment severity does not predict feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> at a time several years after the trial. A longitudinal study of 31 crime victims revealed that, for the time interval from {{a few weeks before}} the trial to a few weeks after the trial, punishment severity significantly predicts a decrease in feelings of revenge; nevertheless intraindividual and interindividual stability of these feelings was high. Taken together, results of the two studies suggest that perpetrator punishment only partially, and moreover only transitorily, satisfies victims’ feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge.</b> Therefore, satisfaction <b>of</b> victims’ feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> cannot be taken as empirical justification for tightening of sentencing norms...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{situational}} factors that turn feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> into actual acts <b>of</b> <b>revenge.</b> Addressing this gap in the literature, this study selected a representative sample of people who acted on their feelings <b>of</b> <b>revenge</b> (avengers) and <b>of</b> people who did not (nonavengers), obtaining a reflection of typical antecedents <b>of</b> <b>revenge.</b> Results revealed that avengers did not report more severe offenses. Neither did avengers report less closeness to offenders nor a larger number of audience members toward whom they might want to prove something. Results did reveal that revenge was more prevalent (a) among young, male friends and acquaintances; (b) in contexts involving social exclusion; and (c) if there was a possibility to take revenge...|$|R

5|$|A {{series of}} flashbacks reveals that an oracle had foretold that {{the demise of}} Olympus would come not by the <b>revenge</b> <b>of</b> the Titans, who had been imprisoned after the Great War, but by a marked warrior. The Olympians Zeus and Ares {{believed}} this warrior to be Deimos, the brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand, and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but was swept aside and subsequently scarred across his right eye by the Olympian. Athena stopped Ares from killing Kratos, knowing his eventual destiny. Taken to Death's Domain, Deimos was imprisoned and tortured by Thanatos. In honor of his sibling, Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo, identical to his brother's birthmark.|$|E
