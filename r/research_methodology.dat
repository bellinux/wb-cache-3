5|$|Goffman's {{early works}} consist of his {{graduate}} writings of 1949–53. His master's thesis was {{a survey of}} audience responses to a radio soap opera, Big Sister. One of its most important elements was a critique of his <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> – of experimental logic and of variable analysis. Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His doctoral dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, and focused on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E
5|$|Some {{academic}} researchers {{argue that}} the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor <b>research</b> <b>methodology.</b> Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror verdicts may not hold true across all kinds of cases. For example, men convict more frequently than women in some types of criminal trials but less frequently in others. Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E

Training and supervision in <b>research</b> <b>methodology,</b> especially for postgraduate students, is reinforced by several research centers, such as the Queen Rania Center for Environmental Science and Technology, Consultative Center for Science and Technology, Energy Center, Pharmaceutical Research Center, Princess Haya Biotechnology Center, and the Agricultural Center for Research & Production.|$|E

One of its main strategies is multidisciplinary research, involving the efforts of medical anthropologists, psychologists, epidemiologists, behavioral pharmacologists, and physicians.|$|E
25|$|The MBA {{dissertation}} (or thesis in some universities) will, in general, {{comprise the}} following in some combination: {{a discussion of}} the literature, providing a critical review and structuring of what is known on a given topic, with a view to addressing a specific problem; a case study that goes beyond simple description, containing the analysis of hitherto unpublished material; a test of the application or limitations of some known principle or technique in a particular situation, and / or suggested modifications. As an alternative to the dissertation, some programs instead allow for a major project. Here (part-time) students will address a problem current in their organization; particularly in programs with an action learning orientation, these may be practically oriented. Most MBA programs require additional course work in <b>research</b> <b>methodology,</b> preceding the dissertation or project. Some programs allow that the research component as a whole may be substituted with additional elective coursework.|$|E

Meanwhile, {{the extent of}} Viet Cong casualties were difficult to assess, as most {{had been removed from}} the battlefield by the communists as they had during previous battles. A sweep of the area by the Australians subsequently resulted in the recovery of a further five dead Viet Cong, however drag marks and extensive blood trails indicated that they had suffered heavily, with perhaps another 33 killed or wounded in the contact. A further 200 casualties were estimated to have occurred from artillery and mortar fire, {{as well as a number}} of airstrikes. Terry Burstall, in his controversial book Vietnam– The Australian Dilemma, lists these casualties as [...] "possibles" [...] only, questioning the efficacy of the Australian reporting. However Burstall's agenda and <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> have been widely criticised, and official records make it clear that five bodies were indeed counted, while a further five bodies were observed but not recovered. Among the dead were one officer, believed to have been the platoon commander, and two non-commissioned officers. Also recovered were a light machine-gun, a 40mm recoilless rifle and three AK-47 assault rifles, while other weapons, a quantity of rice and a battalion-sized bunker system were subsequently also captured.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of information technology}} and information systems (IS/IT) has included the {{evolution of}} <b>research</b> <b>methodologies</b> to support the field. This has fueled the battle of <b>research</b> <b>methodologies</b> among researchers, predominantly caused by the foundations of social sciences and computer technology, which combine to form the business and technology application of information systems and information technology. The questions about appropriate <b>research</b> <b>methodologies</b> {{in the study of}} the IS/IT field are continually debated by researchers. The quantitative researchers, founded in technology such as computer science, lean toward the quantitative research method. While the qualitative researchers, founded in the behavioral sciences and organizational behavioral, lean toward the qualitative research method. In the syntheses of IS/IT and the supporting research, mixed method research has illustrated that combining computer science and human behavior requires use of both methodologies practically to advance the knowledge of IS/IT.

2500|$|An {{innovator}} in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, <b>research</b> <b>methodology,</b> {{and various}} sciences, Peirce considered himself, [...] first and foremost, a logician. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed {{much of that}} which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics, {{of which he is}} a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th century Western philosophy; additionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulated mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. As early as 1886 he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits; the same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers.|$|E

Due to problems in the <b>research</b> <b>methodology</b> and lack of governmental statutes that explain these variations, the study on the linguistics landscape in Singapore remain as a controversial field. These problems include non-linearity, where the large numbers of variations seen in Singapore prevents the application of any trends to understand the landscape; and also the lack of any standard legislation that determines any fixed rules on usage of languages on signs.|$|E
