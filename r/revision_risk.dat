40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Population-based {{registry}} {{data from the}} Nordic Arthroplasty Register Association (NARA) and from the National Joint Register of England and Wales have revealed that the outcome after hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) is inferior to that of conventional total hip arthroplasty (THA). We analyzed the short-term survival of 4, 401 HRAs in the Finnish Arthroplasty Register. Methods We compared the <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> of the 4, 401 HRAs from the Register to that of 48, 409 THAs performed {{during the same time}} period. The median follow-up time was 3. 5 (0 - 9) years for HRAs and 3. 9 (0 - 9) years for THAs. Results There was no statistically significant difference in <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> between HRAs and THAs (RR = 0. 93, 95 % CI: 0. 78 - 1. 10). Female patients had about double the <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> of male patients (RR = 2. 0, CI: 1. 4 - 2. 7). Hospitals that had performed 100 or more HRA procedures had a lower <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> than those with less than 100 HRAs (RR = 0. 6, CI: 0. 4 - 0. 9). Articular Surface Replacement (ASR, DePuy) had inferior outcome with higher <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> than the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing implant (BHR, Smith & Nephew), the reference implant (RR = 1. 8, CI: 1. 2 - 2. 7). Interpretation We found that HRA had comparable short-term survivorship to THA at a nationwide level. Implant design had an influence on revision rates. ASR had higher <b>revision</b> <b>risk.</b> Low hospital procedure volume worsened the outcome of HRA. Female patients had twice the <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> of male patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{reasons why}} {{surgeons}} prefer a particular total knee replacement (TKR) to other viable options with lower cost or lower <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> remain uncertain. This {{study examined the}} concept of surgeon's preference in TKR; including the self-assigned utility of their preferred prosthesis, reasons to alter usual preference and barriers to permanently changing preference. Methods: Using a multinational electronic survey, 347 TKR performing orthopedic surgeons were studied using anonymous mandatory responses, mutually exclusive closed options, multiple responses blocking, automatic stem randomization, Likert scale weighting, and an absence of neutral options. Results: The highest rated of the 17 attributes were “reproducibility of outcome,” “best functional outcome,” and “better kinematics. ” The lowest rated were a “key-opinion leader or mentor uses it” and “new or innovative. ” “Lowest revision risk” ranked 10 th, with 19. 9 % of surgeons stating it did not in- fluence their preference. Cost did not influence 52. 1 % of surgeons and 33. 7 % agreed that their institution or system limited their preference. Surgeon's demographics and preferred prosthesis or technique altered some attribute ratings including surgical volume, country of practice, type of preferred implant; however, <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> rating was not altered by any factor. Cost considerations altered rating of barriers to technique change. Conclusion: Understanding why surgeons prefer certain TKR prostheses or techniques to other viable alternatives is vital to reduce unwarranted variation. This study suggests that the self-assigned reasons driving surgeon's preferences, reasons for preference alteration, and barriers to change are multifactorial, diverse, and complex, with <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> not being the highest rated attribute.

40|$|Background Most metal-on-metal hip {{resurfacing}} (MoMHR) designs {{have experienced}} high short-term failure rates because of pseudotumors. The {{impact of this}} complication into the second decade after the procedure is unknown. We investigated (1) the prevalence of, and risk factors for, all-cause and pseudotumor-related revision at up to 15 years following MoMHR and (2) whether risk factors were sex-specific. Methods This single-center prospective cohort study included 1, 429 MoMHRs (1216 patients; 40 % female) implanted between 1999 and 2009. Patients were contacted in 2010 and 2012 as per national recommendations. Patients with symptoms related to the hip and/or suboptimal Oxford Hip Scores (£ 41 of 48 points) underwent cross-sectional imaging and blood metal-ion sampling. Revision diagnoses were established using operative and histopathologicalfindings. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models {{were used to assess}} the association of predictor variables with the time to all-cause and pseudotumor-related revisions. Results One hundred and eighty MoMHRs (12. 6 %) were revised for all causes, and 111 (7. 8 % of the series and 61. 7 % of all revisions) were revised because of pseudotumor. Survival analysis showed the 15 -year cumulative revision rate for all causes to be 19. 5 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]= 16. 2 % to 23. 2 %) and the 15 -year rate of revision due to pseudotumor to be 14. 0 % (95 % CI= 11. 0 % to 17. 7 %). Small femoral head size (hazard ratio [HR] per 2 mm= 0. 92, 95 % CI= 0. 88 to 0. 97; p= 0. 003) and certain implant designs (HR= 1. 55 to 3. 01; p£ 0. 029) significantly increased the all-cause <b>revision</b> <b>risk.</b> Female sex (HR= 2. 03, 95 % CI= 1. 19 to 3. 44; p= 0. 009) and young age (HR per year= 0. 98, 95 % CI= 0. 96 to 1. 00; p= 0. 020) significantly increased the pseudotumor-related <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> but not the all-cause <b>revision</b> <b>risk.</b> Risk factors for allcause and pseudotumor-related revision were sex-specific. In females, small femoral head size (p= 0. 014) increased the allcause <b>revision</b> <b>risk,</b> and young age was the only predictor of pseudotumor-related revision (p= 0. 019). In males, implant design was the only predictor of all-cause revision (p£ 0. 015) and pseudotumor-related revision (p= 0. 001). Conclusions The prevalence and rates of revision for all causes and pseudotumor were high at up to 15 years following MoMHR. Predictors of revision differed between all-cause and pseudotumor-related revisions and were sex-specific. These factors must be appropriately weighted when risk-stratifying patients with MoMHRs for surveillance...|$|E

40|$|Background: Oxidized {{zirconium}} (Oxinium) {{was introduced}} {{as an alternative}} bearing surface to cobalt-chromium (CoCr) {{in an attempt to}} reduce polyethylene wear and decrease aseptic mechanical failure of total knee replacements. While noncomparative reports have been described as promising, we were aware of no short or long-term clinical studies showing the superiority of Oxinium on polyethylene as a bearing surface. Using data from a comprehensive national joint replacement registry, we compared the long-term outcomes after cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with an Oxinium femoral component and those with the same prosthetic design but with a CoCr femoral component. Methods: The cohorts consisted of 17, 577 cemented Genesis-II cruciate-retaining total knee replacements using non-cross-linked polyethylene, which included 11, 608 with CoCr femoral components and 5, 969 with Oxinium femoral components. The cumulative percent revision and hazard ratio (HR) for <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> were estimated for the cemented Genesis-II Oxinium and CoCr cruciate-retaining TKAs performed in Australia from September 1, 1999, to December 31, 2013. In addition, the revision diagnoses and the effects of age and patellar resurfacing were examined. Results: No difference in the HR for <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> was found between the Oxinium and CoCr cohorts for any age category for all causes of revision (HR = 0. 92 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 78 to 1. 08]; p = 0. 329), loosening or lysis, or aseptic causes, except for loosening or lysis in the group of patients who were ≥ 75 years old (p = 0. 033). In these patients, TKA with Oxinium femoral components had a higher rate of revision. Younger patients preferentially received Oxinium femoral components. The <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> was not affected by patellar resurfacing or nonresurfacing. At 12 years, the cumulative percent revision was 4. 8 % (95 % CI, 4. 2 % to 5. 4 %) for the CoCr Genesis-II prosthesis compared with 7. 7 % (95 % CI, 6. 2 % to 9. 5 %) for the Oxinium Genesis-II prosthesis. Conclusions: In this cohort study involving the same prosthetic design, Oxinium femoral components did not reduce revision rates for all causes, loosening or lysis, or when infection as a cause of revision was removed compared with the same CoCr femoral component across all age groups including patients who were < 55 years old. The cumulative percent revision was greater for the Oxinium components than for the CoCr components. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level III.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} An earlier Nordic Arthroplasty Register Association (NARA) report on 280, 201 total hip {{replacements}} (THRs) {{based on data}} from 1995 - 2006, from Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, was published in 2009. The present study assessed THR survival according to country, based on the NARA database with the Finnish data included. Material and methods 438, 733 THRs performed during the period 1995 - 2011 in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland were included. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to calculate survival probabilities with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Cox multiple regression, with adjustment for age, sex, and diagnosis, was used to analyze implant survival with revision for any reason as endpoint. Results The 15 -year survival, with any revision as an endpoint, for all THRs was 86 % (CI: 85. 7 - 86. 9) in Denmark, 88 % (CI: 87. 6 - 88. 3) in Sweden, 87 % (CI: 86. 4 - 87. 4) in Norway, and 84 % (CI: 82. 9 - 84. 1) in Finland. <b>Revision</b> <b>risk</b> for all THRs was less in Sweden than in the 3 other countries during the first 5 years. However, <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> for uncemented THR was less in Denmark than in Sweden during the sixth (HR = 0. 53, CI: 0. 34 - 0. 82), seventh (HR = 0. 60, CI: 0. 37 - 0. 97), and ninth (HR = 0. 59, CI: 0. 36 - 0. 98) year of follow-up.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} — The optimal hip {{replacement}} for young patients remains unknown. We compared patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), <b>revision</b> <b>risk,</b> and implant costs over {{a range of}} hip replacements. Methods — We included hip replacements for osteoarthritis in patients under 60 years of age performed between 2003 and 2010 using the commonest brand of cemented, cementless, hybrid, or resurfacing prosthesis (11, 622 women and 13, 087 men). The reference implant comprised a cemented stem with a conventional polyethylene cemented cup and a standard-sized head (28 - or 32 -mm). Differences in implant survival were assessed using competing-risks models, adjusted for known prognostic influences. Analysis of covariance {{was used to assess}} improvement in PROMs (Oxford hip score (OHS) and EQ 5 D index) in 2014 linked procedures. Results — In males, PROMs and implant survival were similar across all types of implants. In females, revision was statistically significantly higher in hard-bearing and/or small-stem cementless implants (hazard ratio (HR) = 4) and resurfacings (small head sizes (< 48 mm) : HR = 6; large head sizes (≥ 48 mm) : HR = 5) when compared to the reference cemented implant. In component combinations with equivalent survival, women reported significantly greater improvements in OHS with hybrid implants (22, p = 0. 006) and cementless implants (21, p = 0. 03) (reference, 18), but similar EQ 5 D index. For men and women, National Health Service (NHS) costs were lowest with the reference implant and highest with a hard-bearing cementless replacement. Interpretation — In young women, hybrids offer a balance of good early functional improvement and low <b>revision</b> <b>risk.</b> Fully cementless and resurfacing components are more costly and do not provide any additional benefit for younger patients...|$|E
40|$|Organizational project {{knowledge}} {{is not being}} captured, consolidated, and organized, {{making it difficult to}} learn from past projects, expose the knowledge of the most experienced people, or share experience across geographic project locations. The lack of an ontology for representing this comprehensive project store inhibits its creation and the development of tools to operate on it. Process-orientation links organizational resources or artifacts with process phases and workflow. A process-orientation in knowledge management can be used to add contextual metadata to knowledge artifacts. Context can be used to improve information retrieval precision. Therefore, the study proposed a process-oriented ontology to improve the transfer of software engineering project knowledge. Four questions guided the research: What knowledge about projects should be captured? Are all project artifacts necessary and are they all equally valuable? How can process-orientation be applied to a software engineering project knowledge ontology? Are current knowledge representation languages appropriate for the task? Can software development project knowledge, as represented by this ontology, be captured and retrieved effectively in a KMS? Literature research and an empirical laboratory study answered all of the questions: Four areas of project knowledge are particularly valuable in terms of their impact on project success; requirements, <b>revisions,</b> <b>risks,</b> and resolutions. These areas also cover a meaningful breadth of software engineering project knowledge. A process abstraction was created that breaks a project down into eleven phases. These phases were the basis for a class definition that was added as a peer class to the knowledge artifacts. Using Protégé, the Process-Oriented Ontology for Software Engineering (POSE) was successfully implemented in OWL-DL. Project knowledge from a software organization was used to construct two knowledgebases: one using Google Desktop and the other using Protégé and POSE. Results demonstrated that software engineering project knowledge, as represented by POSE, can be effectively captured and retrieved. POSE-enhanced search was superior to keyword search. Google was comparable in broad text search. But the benefits of metadata and semantics proved to have significant advantages for ontologies.

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} possible predictors of {{early and late}} pacemaker infections in children. Methods: A review was performed of all pacemakers implanted in children at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between 1982 and 2001. Infections were classified as superficial cellulitus, deep pacemaker pocket infection necessitating removal, or positive blood culture without an identifiable source. Results: A total of 385 pacemakers (224 epicardial and 161 endocardial) were implanted in 267 patients at 8. 4 ± 6. 2 years. All 2141 outpatient visits were reviewed (median follow-up, 29. 4 months; range, 2 - 232 months). There were 30 (7. 8 %) pacemaker infections: 19 (4. 9 %) superficial infections; 9 (2. 3 %) pocket infections; and 2 (0. 5 %) isolated positive blood cultures. All superficial infections resolved with intravenous antibiotics. The median time from implantation to infection was 16 days (range, 2 days- 5 years). Only 1 deep infection occurred after primary pacemaker implantation. Six patients with deep infections were pacemaker dependent and were successfully managed with intravenous antibiotics, followed by lead-generator removal and implantation of a new pacemaker in a remote location. In univariate analyses trisomy 21 (relative risk, 3. 9; P <. 01), pacemaker <b>revisions</b> (relative <b>risk,</b> 2. 5; P <. 01), and single-chamber devices (relative risk, 2. 4; P <. 05) were identified as predictors of infection. However, in multivariate analyses only trisomy 21 and pacemaker revisions were predictors. Conclusions: The incidences of superficial and deep pacemaker infections were 4. 9 % and 2. 3 %, respectively. Trisomy 21 and pacemaker <b>revisions</b> were significant <b>risk</b> factors {{in the development of}} infection after pacemaker implantation.

This study aimed to quantify the annual hospital volume effect on <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> in Oxfordu? nicompartmental knee arthroplasty in the Nordic countries. Methods: 14, 496 cases of cemented medial Oxford III UKA were identified in 126 hospitals in the four countries included in the Nordic Arthroplasty Register Association (NARA) database from 2000 to 2012. Hospitals were divided by quartiles into 4 annual procedure volume groups (≤ 11, 12 - 23, 24 - 43 and ≥ 44). The outcome was <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> after 2 and 10 years calculated using Kaplan Meier method. Multivariate Cox regression {{analysis was used to}} assess the Hazard Ratio (HR) of any revision due to specific reasons with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Results: The implant survival was 80 % at 10 years in the volume group ≤ 11 procedures per year compared to 83 % in other volume groups. The HR adjusted for age category, sex, year of surgery and nation was 0. 87 (95 % CI: 0. 76 - 0. 99, p = 0. 036) for the group 12 - 23 procedures per year, 0. 78 (95 % CI: 0. 68 - 0. 91, p = 0. 002) for the group 24 - 43 procedures per year and 0. 82 (95 % CI: 0. 70 - 0. 94, p = 0. 006) for the group ≥ 44 procedures per year compared to the low volume group. Log-rank test was p = 0. 003. The risk of revision for unexplained pain was 40 - 50 % higher in the low compared with other volume groups.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} In a {{previous}} registry report, short-term implant survival of hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) in Finland {{was found to}} be comparable to that of total hip arthroplasty (THA). Since then, it has become evident that adverse reactions to metal debris (ARMDs) may also be associated with HRA, not only with large-diameter head metal-on-metal THA. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess medium- to long-term survivorship of HRA based on the Finnish Arthroplasty Register (FAR). Patients and methods 5, 068 HRAs performed during the period 2001 - 2013 in Finland were included. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to calculate survival probabilities and their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Cox multiple regression, with adjustment for age, sex, diagnosis, femoral head size, and hospital volume was used to analyze implant survival of HRA devices with revision for any reason as endpoint. The reference group consisted of 6, 485 uncemented Vision/Bimetric and ABG II THAs performed in Finland over the same time period. Results The 8 -year survival, with any revision as an endpoint, was 93 % (CI: 92 - 94) for Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR), 86 % (CI: 78 - 94) for Corin, 91 % (CI: 89 - 94) for ReCap, 92 % (CI: 89 - 96) for Durom, and was 72 % (CI: 69 - 76) for the Articular Surface Replacement (ASR). The 10 -year survival, with any revision as an endpoint, for reference THAs was 92 % (CI: 91 - 92) and for all HRAs it was 86 % (CI: 84 - 87 %). Female HRA patients had about twice the <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> of male patients. ASR had an inferior outcome: the <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> was 4 -fold higher than for BHR, the reference implant. Interpretation The 10 -year implant survival of HRAs is 86 % in Finland.

It is of utter importance to define the concept of risk, to study how risk can be measured and in which ways risk can be analyzed. In doing so, a literary study has be done and fourteen respondents has been interviewed. Risk is to be seen more as a concept than a quantity. Risk management demands time and money. It takes some effort to perform the initial brainstorm and the constant <b>revision.</b> However, <b>risk</b> management can lead to saved costs and the avoidance of accidents. To keep a list of risks is not a waterproof method, nevertheless {{it is better to}} create an awareness of risk than ignore a method for its flaws. Risk management can create a discussion about problems and difficulties, a discussion that might otherwise not have a forum...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hip {{replacement}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide; hundreds of implant configurations provide options for femoral head size, joint surface material and fixation method with dramatically varying costs. Robust comparative evidence to inform the choice of implant is needed. This retrospective cohort study uses linked national databases from England and Wales to determine the optimal type of replacement for patients over 60 years undergoing hip replacement for osteoarthritis. Methods and Findings: Implants included were the commonest brand from each of the four types of replacement (cemented, cementless, hybrid and resurfacing); the reference prosthesis was the cemented hip procedure. Patient reported outcome scores (PROMs), costs and risk of repeat (revision) surgery were examined. Multivariable analyses included analysis of covariance to assess improvement in PROMs (Oxford hip score, OHS, and EQ 5 D index) (9159 linked episodes) and competing risks modelling of implant survival (79, 775 procedures). Cost of implants and ancillary equipment were obtained from National Health Service procurement data. Results: EQ 5 D score improvements (at 6 months) were similar for all hip replacement types. In females, <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> was significantly higher in cementless hip prostheses (hazard ratio, HR = 2. 22, p< 0. 001), when compared to the reference hip. Although improvement in OHS was statistically higher (22. 1 versus 20. 5, p< 0. 001) for cementless implants, this small difference is unlikely to be clinically important. In males, <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> was significantly higher in cementless (HR = 1. 95, p = 0. 003) and resurfacing implants, HR = 3. 46, p< 0. 001), with no differences in OHS. Material costs were lowest with the reference implant (cemented, range £ 1103 to £ 1524) and highest with cementless implants (£ 1928 to £ 4285). Limitations include the design of the study, which is intrinsically vulnerable to omitted variables, a paucity of long-term implant survival data (reflecting the duration of data collection), the possibility of revision under-reporting, response bias within PROMs data, and issues associated with current outcome scoring systems, which may not accurately reflect level of improvement in some patients. Conclusions: Cement fixation, using a polyethylene cup and a standard sized head offers good outcomes, with the lowest risks and at the lowest costs. The most commonly used cementless and resurfacing implants were associated with higher risk of revision and were more costly, while perceptions of improved function and longevity were unsupported...|$|E
40|$|Background: Controversy {{still exists}} {{as to the}} optimum {{management}} of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in total knee arthroplasty. Surgeons can choose to kinematically substitute the PCL with a posterior-stabilized total knee replacement or alternatively to utilize a cruciate-retaining, also known as minimally stabilized, total knee replacement. Proponents of posterior-stabilized total knee replacement propose that the reported lower survivorship in registries when directly compared with minimally stabilized total knee replacement is due to confounders such as selection bias because of the preferential usage of posterior-stabilized total knee replacement in more complex or severe cases. In this study, we aimed to eliminate these possible confounders by performing an instrumental variable analysis based on surgeon preference to choose either posterior-stabilized or minimally stabilized total knee replacement, rather than the actual prosthesis received. Methods: Cumulative percent revision, hazard ratio (HR), and revision diagnosis data {{were obtained from the}} Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry from September 1, 1999, to December 31, 2014, for 2 cohorts of patients, those treated by high-volume surgeons who preferred minimally stabilized replacements and those treated by high-volume surgeons who preferred posterior-stabilized replacements. All patients had a diagnosis of osteoarthritis and underwent fixed-bearing total knee replacement with patellar resurfacing. Results: At 13 years, the cumulative percent revision was 5. 0 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 4. 0 % to 6. 2 %) for the surgeons who preferred the minimally stabilized replacements compared with 6. 0 % (95 % CI, 4. 2 % to 8. 5 %) for the surgeons who preferred the posterior-stabilized replacements. The <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> for the surgeons who preferred posterior-stabilized replacements was significantly higher for all causes (HR = 1. 45 [95 % CI, 1. 30 to 1. 63]; p < 0. 001), for loosening or lysis (HR = 1. 93 [95 % CI, 1. 58 to 2. 37]; p < 0. 001), and for infection (HR = 1. 51 [95 % CI, 1. 25 to 1. 82]; p < 0. 001). This finding was irrespective of patient age and was evident with cemented fixation and with both cross-linked polyethylene and non-cross-linked polyethylene. However, the higher <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> was only evident in male patients. Conclusions: There was a 45 % higher risk of revision for the patients of surgeons who preferred a posterior-stabilized total knee replacement compared with the patients of surgeons who preferred a minimally stabilized total knee replacement.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether selected demographic (age and sex) and clinical (body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, surgery duration, length of hospital stay, cemented versus uncemented prosthesis, and fast-track procedures) factors were associated with higher <b>risk</b> of <b>revision</b> surgery due to deep infection following THA.

40|$|This study investigates empirically the {{relationship}} between the risk-neutral measure Q and the real-world measure P. We study the ratio between the risk-neutral and actual default intensities, which we call the coverage ratio or the relative credit risk premium. Actual default intensities are derived from rating agencies’ annual transition matrices, while risk-neutral default intensities are bootstrapped from CDS quotes of European corporates. We quantify the average risk premium and its changes of time. Compared to related literature, special attention is given to the effects of the recent financial and European sovereign crises. We find that average credit risk premia rose substantially and that post-crisis levels are still higher than those observed before the financial crisis. This observation is especially true for high quality debt and if it persists, it {{will have an impact on}} corporates’ funding costs. The quantification and <b>revision</b> of <b>risk</b> premia contributes to the discussion of the credit spread puzzle and could give extra insights in valuation models that start from real-world estimates.

40|$|Abstract Background The current {{practice}} of the Swedish Knee Register is not {{to take into consideration}} if one or both knees in a patient are subject to surgery when evaluating risk of revision after arthroplasty. Risk calculations are typically done by statistical methods, such as Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox's proportional hazards models, that are {{based on the assumption that}} observed events are independent, and this is rarely appreciated. The purpose of this study was to investigate if ignoring bilateral operations when using these methods biases the results. Methods The bias of not taking bilateral operations into account was investigated by statistically analysing 55 298 prostheses in 44 590 patients, undergoing knee arthroplasty surgery in Sweden during 1985 – 1999, using traditional proportional hazards analysis, which assumes that all observations are independent, and a shared gamma frailty model, which allows patients to contribute repeated observations. Results The effect of neglecting bilateral prostheses is minute, possibly because bilateral prosthesis failure is a rare event. Conclusion We conclude that the <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> of knee prostheses in general can be analysed without consideration for subject dependency, at least in study populations with a relatively low proportion of subjects having experienced bilateral revisions. </p...|$|E

Our aim was to draw researchers&# 39; attention to the DKR and its potential use in clinical epidemiological research. Patients and methods: The DKR has collected data on all knee replacement procedures performed in Denmark since 1997. The validity of the register was compared with the Danish National Registry of Patients (DNRP). Incidence rate was calculated per 100, 000 inhabitants. Implant survival was estimated by Kaplan&ndash;Meier method. Cox regression analyses were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) for revision with a 95 % confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 62, 586 primary knee arthroplasties and 6, 683 revisions were registered in the DKR between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2010. More than 90 % of the private and public hospitals performing knee replacement surgery in Denmark have entered data to the DKR. Registration completeness of primary procedures and revisions has increased since the DKR initiation and was 88 % in 2010 for both procedures, compared with registration in the DNRP. For primary knee arthroplasties, the annual incidence rate increased from 35. 8 in 1997 to 155. 2 in 2010 per 100, 000 inhabitants. Incidence was higher in females than in males during the entire study period, and increased with age for both sexes. The overall implant survival after 14 years was 89 % irrespective of diagnosis for surgery. Male patients had higher <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> than females, and <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> decreased with increasing age. Risk for any revision was higher for uncemented implants (RR = 1. 48; 95 % CI: 1. 32 &ndash; 1. 66), and lower for hybrid implants (RR = 0. 84; 95 % CI: 0. 75 &ndash; 0. 95) compared to cemented implants. Implant survival did not improve but remained the same throughout the study period when comparing patients operated in the periods 1997 &ndash; 2000 versus 2001 &ndash; 2003, 2004 &ndash; 2006, and 2007 &ndash; 2010. Conclusion: The DKR is a valuable tool for quality monitoring and research in knee arthroplasty surgery due to the high quality and completeness of prospective, routinely collected data. Large population-based epidemiological studies can be performed in order to study trends as well as risk factors for poor clinical outcome following knee arthroplasty surgery.

40|$|Periprosthetic {{fracture}} (PF) after primary total {{hip replacement}} (THR) is an uncommon but potentially devastating complication. We analysed data on 257, 202 primary THRs with cemented stems and 390 linked first revisions for PF {{recorded in the}} National Joint Registry (NJR) of England and Wales to determine if cemented femoral stem brand {{was associated with the}} risk of having revision for a PF after primary THR. All cemented femoral stem brands with more than 10, 000 primary operations recorded in the NJR were identified. The four most commonly used cemented femoral stems were: Exeter V 40 (n= 146, 409), CPT (n= 24, 300), C-Stem (n= 15, 113) and Charnley (n= 20, 182). We compared the <b>revision</b> <b>risk</b> ratios due to PF amongst the stems using a Poisson regression model adjusting for patient factors. Compared to the Exeter V 40, the age, gender and ASA grade adjusted revision rate ratio for the cemented CPT stem was 3. 89 (95 %CI 3. 07, 4. 93), for the C-Stem 0. 89 (95 %CI 0. 57, 1. 41) and for the Charnley stem 0. 41 (95 %CI 0. 24, 0. 70). Limitations of the study include incomplete data capture, analysis of only PF requiring revision and that observation does not imply causality. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that the choice of a cemented stem is associated with the risk of revision for PF. </p...|$|E
