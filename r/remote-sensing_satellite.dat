However, satellite detection is prone to offset errors, anywhere from 2 to 3 km for MODIS and AVHRR data and up to 12 km for GOES data.

The report will be updated annually before each Plenary meeting, and as developments in the Working Groups warrant. The committee on Earth Observations Satellites (originally named the International Earth Observations Satellite committee, IEOS) was treated in 1984, {{in response to a}} recommendation from the Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations Working Group on Growth, Technology, and Employment's Panel of Experts on Satellite Remote Sensing. This group recognized the multidisciplinary nature of satellite Earth observations, and the value of coordinating across all proposed missions. Thus, CEOS combined the previously existing groups for coordination on Ocean <b>Remote-Sensing</b> <b>Satellites</b> (CORSS) and coordination on Land <b>Remote-Sensing</b> <b>Satellites</b> (CLRSS), and established a broad framework for coordination across all spaceborne Earth observations missions. The first three LEOS Plenary meetings focused on treating and guiding the Working Groups deemed necessary to carry out the objectives of the CEOS members. After the third meeting, it was agreed that a more active orientation was required by the Plenary, and additional issues were brought before the group at the fourth meeting. At the fifth Plenary, international scientific programs and relevant intergovernmental organizations accepted invitations and participated as affiliate members of CEOS. This enabled progress toward integrating satellite data users' requirements into the CEOS process. Data exchange principles for global change research were also adopted. An interim CEOS Plenary meeting was held in April 1992, in preparation for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). Brief encapsulations of the Plenary sessions immediately follow the Terms of Reference that govern the activities of CEOS as a whole; Terms of Reference for the individual Working Groups are included as Appendix A.

50|$|AATSR is {{the third}} {{in a series of}} {{instruments}} started by ATSR-1, which was launched in 1991 on the European <b>Remote-Sensing</b> <b>Satellite,</b> ERS-1.

The original ATSR-1 instrument lacked the three shortest wavelength channels provided by AATSR, whereas ATSR-2 was functionally identical. This has led to a near-continuous SST dataset extending from 1991 to the present day. Looking to the future, a successor instrument is being developed to fly on ESA’s Sentinel 3 satellite, {{which is part of the}} space segment of the European Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme.

50|$|Several {{generations of}} wind scatterometers have been flown in space by NASA, ESA, and NASDA. The first {{operational}} wind scatterometer {{was known as}} the Seasat Scatterometer (SASS) and was launched in 1978. It was a fan-beam system operating at Ku-band (14 GHz). In 1991 ESA launched the European <b>Remote-Sensing</b> <b>Satellite</b> ERS-1 Advanced Microwave Instrument (AMI) scatterometer, followed by the ERS-2 AMI scatterometer in 1995. Both AMI fan-beam systems operated at C-band (5.6 GHz). In 1996 NASA launched the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), a Ku-band fan-beam system. NASA launched the first scanning scatterometer, known as ''''SeaWinds'''', on QuikSCAT in 1999. It operated at Ku-band. A second SeaWinds instrument was flown on the NASDA ADEOS-2 in 2002. The Indian Space Research Organisation launched a Ku-band scatterometer on their Oceansat-2 platform in 2009. ESA and EUMETSAT launched the first C-band ASCAT in 2006 onboard Metop-A.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Saratoga is a {{protocol}} for fast file transfers across dedicated links in private networks, using {{small amounts of}} feedback for loss recovery. It is in use to download large amounts of imaging data from <b>remote-sensing</b> <b>satellites,</b> where the link environment is highly asymmetric and uplinks are constrained. However, Saratoga lacks a rate-control mechanism to allow fair share with co-existing flows for simultaneous competing transfers, or for across the congested Internet where it must coexist fairly with TCP. TFRC, a selfand TCP-Friendly Rate Control mechanism, can be adopted for Saratoga and leverage its existing protocol information. Use of TFRC normally requires significant changes in protocol operation, including additional data in feedback. We design a sender-based TFRC for Saratoga, needing only simple modifications within the sender and using only existin...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of the Global Positioning System (GPS) for precise earth observation is evaluated. It is projected that soon GPS will be utilized to track <b>remote-sensing</b> <b>satellites</b> with subdecimeter accuracy. The first will be Topex/Poseidon, a US/French ocean altimetry mission to be launched in 1991. In addition, {{it is suggested that}} developments planned for future platforms may push orbit accuracy near 1 cm within a decade. GPS receivers on some platforms will track the signals down to the earth limb to observe occultation by intervening media. This will provide comprehensive information on global temperature and climate and help detect the possible onset of a greenhouse effect. It is also projected that dual-frequency observations will be used to trace the flow of energy across earth systems through detection of ionospheric gravity waves, and to map the structure of the ionosphere by computer tomography...|$|R
25|$|Mining {{operations}} can {{be grouped}} into five major categories {{in terms of}} their respective resources. These are oil and gas extraction, coal mining, metal ore mining, nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying, and mining support activities.

Prospecting potential mining sites, a vital area of concern for the mining industry, is now done using sophisticated new technologies such as seismic prospecting and <b>remote-sensing</b> <b>satellites.</b> Mining is heavily affected by the prices of the commodity minerals, which are often volatile. The 2000s commodities boom ("commodities supercycle") increased the prices of commodities, driving aggressive mining. In addition, the price of gold increased dramatically in the 2000s, which increased gold mining; for example, one study found that conversion of forest in the Amazon increased six-fold from the period 2003–2006 (292 ha/yr) to the period 2006–2009 (1,915 ha/yr), largely due to artisanal mining.|$|R

An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. Of the known 1876 cyclones, both Hurricane One and Hurricane Four were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz. They also proposed large changes to the known tracks of Hurricane Two and of Hurricane Five. The track and start position of Hurricane Five was further amended in 2003.|$|E

We investigate whether the interferometric data are quantitatively consistent with terrestrial velocity measurements along two transverse profiles and two longitudinal profiles. Interferometric and terrestrial velocity are in agreement if a (terrestrially measured) surface-normal velocity component is properly accounted for. This suggest that both the interferometric velocities and the conversions of terrestrial data to the winter period are reliable. Finally we show that the application of repeat-pass SAR interferometry to the glaciers enable precise mapping of ice flow dynamics at a much higher level than usually obtained...|$|R
