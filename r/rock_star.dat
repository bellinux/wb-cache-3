5|$|After {{years of}} {{supporting}} roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in Ridley Scott's 1991 road film Thelma & Louise. He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis {{has been cited}} as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol. After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede, a low-budget picture about an aspiring <b>rock</b> <b>star,</b> and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film Cool World, although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.|$|E

5|$|In this episode, Piz (Chris Lowell) {{gets the}} chance to {{interview}} {{one of the members}} of his favorite band, a washed-up <b>rock</b> <b>star</b> named Desmond Fellows (Paul Rudd). However, when Desmond's backing tapes that he needs for the show the next night disappear, Veronica is called in to find them.

5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did a spread called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.” The unkempt fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become a <b>rock</b> <b>star</b> one day.|$|E

5|$|Psychedelic rock, {{with its}} {{distorted}} guitar sound, extended solos and adventurous compositions, {{has been seen}} as an important bridge between blues-oriented rock and later heavy metal. American bands whose loud, repetitive psychedelic rock emerged as early heavy metal included the Amboy Dukes and Steppenwolf. From England, two former guitarists with the Yardbirds, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, moved on to form key acts in the genre, The Jeff Beck Group and Led Zeppelin respectively. Other major pioneers of the genre had begun as blues-based psychedelic bands, including Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Judas Priest and UFO. Psychedelic music also contributed to the origins of glam rock, with Marc Bolan changing his psychedelic folk duo into rock band T. Rex and becoming the first glam <b>rock</b> <b>star</b> from 1970. From 1971 David Bowie moved on from his early psychedelic work to develop his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional make up, mime and performance into his act.|$|E
5|$|The Buzz on Maggie follows Maggie Pesky (Jessica DiCicco), an {{expressive}} tween fly and her family; parents Chauncey (Brian Doyle-Murray) and Frieda (Susan Tolsky); brothers Aldrin (David Kaufman) and Pupert (Thom Adcox); {{and sister}} Bella (Tara Strong), {{who is still}} a maggot. The family resides in an old milk carton in a suburban fly metropolis called Stickyfeet, which {{is located in a}} dump. Maggie has an ambitious and adventurous personality and aspires to become a <b>rock</b> <b>star.</b> Her approach to life often suffers unexpected consequences that puts herself in jeopardy, as she often follows her own impulses although they go against the rules or her parents' wishes. However, she ultimately learns her lesson, {{which was one of the}} core themes for the show's conception.|$|E
5|$|When Néstor Kirchner {{refused to}} run for {{re-election}} in 2007 and proposed Cristina Kirchner instead, it was rumored that the couple might attempt {{to run for}} the presidency in alternate elections, to circumvent the constitutional limit of a single re-election. The death of Néstor Kirchner in 2010 derailed such a plan. She had a low positive image, below 30%. On 21 June 2011, Cristina Kirchner announced she would run for a second term as president. A few days later, she announced that her economic minister Amado Boudou would run for vice-president on her ticket. This selection was an unexpected one, as Boudou usually acted like a <b>rock</b> <b>star</b> instead of a politician. She personally chose most of the candidates for deputy in the Congress, favoring members of the Cámpora.|$|E

5|$|Veronica and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) watch a {{movie at}} her house. She {{questions}} him about Piz’s mood, while Keith enters and says he is currently unopposed in the Sheriff election. Piz runs up to Veronica and states {{that he has been}} chosen to be a guide for a <b>rock</b> <b>star</b> named Desmond Fellows. However, his show depends on some tapes Desmond is carrying with him, but when Piz checks him into his hotel room, they are missing. Piz calls Veronica for the case and runs into Logan in the elevator. Desmond points to several potential suspects. Logan asks Mac for study help, and he agrees. Piz starts his show with Desmond, and it goes terribly, as Desmond makes racial epithets and sexual advances. Veronica and Piz track down a teacher, who denies involvement, but the pair find a flyer for a group that threatened to boycott Desmond’s show. Piz and Desmond talk about his past and start to make progress, but he ends up going to a party with Dick (Ryan Hansen) instead of playing guitar with Piz.|$|E
