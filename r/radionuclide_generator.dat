William Briner started the NIH Radiopharmacy in 1958. John Christian and William Briner were both active on key national committees responsible for the development, regulation and utilization of radiopharmaceuticals.

40|$|Methods of {{increasing}} the performance of <b>radionuclide</b> <b>generators</b> used in nuclear medicine radiotherapy and SPECT/PET imaging were developed and detailed for 99 Mo/ 99 mTc and 68 Ge/ 68 Ga <b>radionuclide</b> <b>generators</b> as the cases. Optimisation methods of the daughter nuclide build-up versus stand-by time and/or specific activity using mean progress functions were developed for increasing the performance of <b>radionuclide</b> <b>generators.</b> As {{a result of this}} optimisation, the separation of the daughter nuclide from its parent one should be performed at a defined optimal time to avoid the deterioration in specific activity of the daughter nuclide and wasting stand-by time of the generator, while the daughter nuclide yield is maintained to a reasonably high extent. A new characteristic parameter of the formation-decay kinetics of parent/daughter nuclide system was found and effectively used in the practice of the generator production and utilisation. A method of “early elution schedule” was also developed for increasing the daughter nuclide production yield and specific radioactivity, thus saving the cost of the generator and improving the quality of the daughter radionuclide solution. These newly developed optimisation methods in combination with an integrated elution-purification-concentration system of <b>radionuclide</b> <b>generators</b> recently developed is the most suitable way to operate the generator effectively on the basis of economic use and improvement of purposely suitable quality and specific activity of the produced daughter radionuclides. All these features benefit the economic use of the generator, the improved quality of labelling/scan, and the lowered cost of nuclear medicine procedure. Besides, a new method of quality control protocol set-up for post-delivery test of radionuclidic purity has been developed based on the relationship between gamma ray spectrometric detection limit, required limit of impure radionuclide activity and its measurement certainty with respect to optimising decay/measurement time and product sample activity used for QC quality control. The optimisation ensures a certainty of measurement of the specific impure radionuclide and avoids wasting the useful amount of valuable purified/concentrated daughter nuclide product. This process is important for the spectrometric measurement of very low activity of impure radionuclide contamination in the radioisotope products of much higher activity used in medical imaging and targeted radiotherapy...|$|R

The practical yield of Nd- 140 at EOB in the former reaction over the energy range of E- 3 He = 33. 5 -> 0 MeV amounted to 3. 5 MBq/mu A It and in the latter reaction over the energy range of E-p = 18. 6 -> 16. 2 MeV to 15. 5 MBq/mu A h. These values correspond to about 41 % and 60 % of the respective theoretical values. Successful separations of the radionuclide were performed by means of cation-exchange chromatography resulting in decontamination factors of >= 10 (8) and >= 7 x 10 (5) for the cerium and praseodymium target materials, respectively. With the no-carrier-added Nd- 140 obtained, an efficient Nd- 140 /Pr- 140 <b>radionuclide</b> <b>generator</b> system was developed and evaluated. The principle of the radiochemical separation is based on physico-chemical transitions (hot-atom effects) of the daughter Pr- 140 following the electron decay process of Nd- 140.

30|$|A {{cytotoxic}} dose {{within the}} tumour cells {{is required to}} cause a therapeutic effect of TAT, when using a receptor-mediated process as dose delivery method. In the clinical situation using β−-emitters, this cytotoxic dose is {{in the order of}} 200  Gy for neuroendocrine tumours (Ilan et al. 2015; Pauwels et al. 2005) and in the preclinical situation this dose is in the order of 70  Gy for cure of CA 20948 (rat pancreatic) tumour (Verwijnen et al. 2004). The limited number of receptors available on the cell membrane and relative short half-life of 213 Bi however, require radioligands with high SA to obtain a curative tumour dose. The optimal characteristics of radioligands for TAT applications in a preclinical setting include a low injection volume, physiologic osmolarity, high SA, and suitable stability.

40|$|A current {{emphasis}} in nuclear medicine is to better match the physical lifetime of the radionuclides used in vivo for {{diagnosis and treatment}} to the biological lifetime of the diagnostic procedure or to minimize radiation dose to areas other than those to be treated. In many cases the biological lifetime is {{on the order of}} minutes. Since the direct production of radionuclides with half lives of minutes requires the user to be near a suitable reactor or accelerator, this study was undertaken to produce short-lived radionuclides indirectly. If a long-lived radionuclide decays into a short-lived radionuclide, quick separation of the daughter activity from the parent enables the user to have a short-lived daughter while freeing him from the constraint of proximity to a cyclotron. Systems where a short-lived daughter is separated from a long-lived parent are called <b>radionuclide</b> <b>generators.</b> Two generator systems were developed for use in nuclear medicine, one in diagnostic work and the other for therapeutic work.

This involved examination of the bombardment parameters and the procedure utilized to dissolve the irradiated copper target. Additionally, the feasibility in automating the different processes of the production methods through a modular system was examined to aid in streamlining the routine production of the generator systems. The analysis showed that, between proton entry energies of 18 and 30 MeV, a target thickness of 1. 0 mm was optimal for producing 62 Zn. With a 1. 0 mm thick target, the optimal proton entry energy for maximizing the production yield of 62 Zn was 29 MeV. The theoretical 62 Zn yield at 29 MeV directly prior to generator loading was calculated to be between 160 and 180 GBq??A- 1 ?h- 1. An alternative target processing method based on 30 % hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and 2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) at a temperature of 75 ?C successfully dissolved the copper foil within 12 minutes.

40|$|This article {{continues}} {{from the earlier}} article "An Introduction to Nuclear Medicine" where the general principles of nuclear medicine were discussed. Radionuclides are required in both diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures. Naturally occurring radionuclides are generally not suitable for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures due to their typically long half-lives or less than ideal physical or chemical characteristics; therefore appropriate radionuclides need to be produced. The common methods of radionuclide production for nuclear medicine include: fission, neutron activation, cyclotron and generator. Fission occurs in a nuclear reactor where neutrons are used to bombard fission nuclides such as uranium- 235 (235 U) or plutonium- 239 (239 Pu). Fission results in the splitting of the large nucleus into smaller fission fragments along {{with the release of}} gamma radiation and high energy neutrons. Neutron activation also takes place in a nuclear reactor. The neutrons are used to bombard stable nuclides to form other radionuclides. There are disadvantages with this process so other production means are oft en preferred. Cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles such as protons (p), deuterons (d), triton (t) and alpha (alpha) particles to high velocities to penetrate the orbital electrons of the target atom and interact with the nucleus. Generators produce the most commonly used radionuclide in nuclear medicine, technetium- 99 m (99 mTc). The <b>radionuclide</b> <b>generator</b> sees the decay of a long half-life parent radionuclide to a short half-life daughter radionuclide. The daughter is the radionuclide used in nuclear medicine. An understanding of radionuclide production will assist in the understanding of both diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The works {{submitted}} in {{this thesis}} cover the development of methods for the production in a cyclotron {{of a variety of}} radionuclides and their incorporation in radio-labelled compounds for use in biomedical research. In addition, papers are included which describe biomedical applications of such radio-tracers. My co-authorship of these publications reflects my interest in the design and execution of experiments in the realm of interdisciplinary research. The original contributions to science embodied in the publications submitted include examples of novel radiochemistry applied in the areas of cyclotron production of short half-life radionuclides and their radiochemical purification. In many cases the use of these radionuclides in biomedical research has added new information to the body of medical scientific Toiowledge. Novel radiolabelling strategies using very short half-life radionuclides are included. These have necessitated the development of rapid radio-organic syntheses, several of which have been achieved using automated microchemical engineering process plants of my design. I have also developed novel systems for the administration of radionuclies and radio-labelled compounds of pharmaceutical quality, widely acknowledged to be "World Firsts. " My invention of the (^ 81) Kr(^m) <b>radionuclide</b> <b>generator</b> resulted in publications covering a wide range of medical applications. These are included with the thesis. The device is now produced in many countries around the world for use both in routine clinical diagnosis and in research, particularly in lung disease. More recently, I have created an automated bedside infuser of H(_ 2) (^ 15) O, which has revolutionised measurements of regional cerebral blood flow using the technique of Positron Emission Tomography for in vivo regional mapping of brain activity...|$|E
40|$|Technetium- 99 m is a low-energy, short {{half-life}} iostope {{that has}} been recently introduced into clinical use. It is available {{as the daughter of}} Â° 9 Mowhich is re covered as a fission product or produced by neutron bombardement of molyb denum- 98. The aim of the present work is to study the fate of sodium pertechnetate 9 OmTc and to find out any difference in its distribution that might be caused by variation in the method of preparation of the parent nuclide, molybdenum- 99. MATERIALS & METHODS The distribution of radioactive sodium pertechnetate milked from 99 Mo that was obtained as a fission product (supplied by Isocommerz, D. D. R.) was studied in 36 white mice, weighing between 150 and 250 gm each. Normal isotonic saline was used for elution of the pertechnetate from the <b>radionuclide</b> <b>generator.</b> The experimental animals were divided into four equal groups depending on the route of administration of the radioactive material, whether intraperitoneal, in tramuscular, subcutaneous or oral. Every group was further subdivided into three equal subgroups, in order to study the effect of time on the distribution of the pertechnetate. Thus, the duration between administration of the radio-pharma ceutical and sacrificing the animals was fixed at 30, 60 and 120 minutes for the three subgroups respectively. Then the animals were dissected and the different organstaken out. Radioactivityin an accuratelyweighed specimen from each organ was estimated in a scintillation well detector equipped with one-inch sodium iodide thallium activated crystal. This was compared with activity in an accurately measured sample from the administered pertechnetate to permit cal culation of percentage of administered dose per gram of each organ. The whole procedure was repeated on another group of nine mice, after pr...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MSc 68 Ge/ 68 Ga {{generators}} rely {{on metal}} oxide, inorganic and organic sorbents {{in order to}} prepare radionuclides useful for clinical applications. The requirements for 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generators are that the 68 Ga obtained from the 68 Ge loaded column should be optimally suited for the routine synthesis of 68 Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals, that {{the separation of the}} 68 Ga daughter from the 68 Ge parent should happen easily, with a high yield of separation, a low specific volume of 68 Ga and should not contain trace elements owing to the solubility of the metal oxide sorbent. Beginning with a metal oxide preparation and continuing through recent developments, several approaches for processing generator derived 68 Ga have altered the production of 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generators. Still, the effects of sorbent modification on the properties of 68 Ge/ 68 Ga <b>radionuclide</b> <b>generator</b> systems are not necessarily optimally designed for direct application in a medical context. The objective of this research was to analyze and document characteristics of Titanium Oxide (TiO 2) sorbents relevant to processing of a 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator that is able to produce 68 Ga eluates that are adequate for clinical requirements. Interest was shown in TiO 2 based 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generators by a number of overseas companies for tumour imaging using 68 Ga-labelled 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane- 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraacetic acid (DOTA) -conjugated peptides. While a method involving production of the 68 Ga radionuclide using TiO 2 metal oxide had been published, problems with the production persisted. A method, using TiO 2 metal oxide for ion exchange chromatography, was devised in this study to produce the 68 Ga radionuclide, with the aim of being adopted for production purposes. The study focuses on the development of a dedicated procedure for the achievement of sufficient 68 Ga yield along with low 68 Ge breakthrough and low metallic impurities. Literature from 1970 to 2011 was reviewed to assess the radiochemical aspects of the 68 Ga production and processing thereof. Various commercially available TiO 2 metal oxides were characterized by subjecting the materials to x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for quantitative and qualitative analysis...|$|E
