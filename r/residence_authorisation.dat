30|$|In this study, more {{differences}} than similarities {{are observed}} {{between the two}} migration systems {{in terms of the}} causes, processes, and composition of migration flows, as well as the ways in which migrants and their families engage transnationally. The data suggest that migration began in different ways in Gondar and Hadiya and Kembata regions, indicating that a single theory of migration is unlikely to account for migration from a given country, given that most exhibit some level of distinct regional histories. Much of the differences that are currently evident is associated not only with the “maturity” or temporal depth of migration from these regions, but also with the legal status of migrants during travel, and upon reaching the destination. While migration from the Gondar region has evolved from being a mainly refugee migration system (with that legal status in the US) to one where sponsorship and permanent residence (green cards) predominate. However, there was no way for unskilled, rural migrants from the southern regions of Ethiopia to acquire permanent <b>residence</b> or <b>authorisation</b> in South Africa. In other words, the majority of these migrant workers remain undocumented for a significant period of time. The legal status and associated mobility and immobility factors are increasingly affecting the migration outcome of these migrants. It is likely that the occupations and earnings of US-based diasporas are different compared to those departing to South Africa and Arab countries.|$|R
