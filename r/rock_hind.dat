2500|$|Lionfish have {{successfully}} pioneered the coastal {{waters of the}} Atlantic {{in less than a}} decade and pose a major threat to reef ecological systems in these areas. A study comparing their abundance from Florida to North Carolina with several species of groupers found [...] they were second only to the native scamp grouper and equally abundant to the graysby, gag, and <b>rock</b> <b>hind.</b> This could be due to a surplus of resource availability resulting from the overfishing of lionfish predators like grouper. Although the lionfish has not expanded to a population size [...] currently causing major ecological problems, their invasion in the United States coastal waters could lead to serious problems in the future. One likely ecological impact caused by Pterois could be their impact on prey population numbers by directly affecting food web relationships. This could ultimately lead to reef deterioration and could negatively influence Atlantic trophic cascade. Lionfish have already been shown to overpopulate reef areas and display aggressive tendencies, forcing native species to move to waters where conditions might be less than desirable.|$|E

Baxter, who fought with the Union Army during the war, would be selected to serve on to the Arkansas Supreme Court by the newly established government and was later governor of Arkansas. In October 1867, Hinds was elected to be a delegate at Arkansas's 1868 Constitution Convention. He was made chairman of the Committee on the Elective Franchise. The new constitution that emerged that February, ratified in March, provided voting rights for black males {{over the age of}} twenty-one and for the creation of public schools for both black and white children. Elected to Congress early that year, Hinds went to Washington D.C. in April, 1868, where he arranged for Arkansas to be the first state to rejoin the union under the 1867 Reconstruction Acts. In May 1868, Hinds was a delegate at the 1868 Republican National Convention held in Chicago. Returning to Arkansas in August, he campaigned vigorously for Republican presidential candidate Grant, and for civil rights for former slaves.|$|R

5000|$|Crack the Skye {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} many major reviewing sites. Total Guitars Nick Cracknell awarded the album a 5/5 rating, describing it as [...] "even more ambitious {{in scope and}} sound than 2006’s Blood Mountain. Embracing elements of prog and country, but above all classic <b>rock,</b> <b>Hinds</b> and Kelliher literally add new dimensions to the band’s ever-expanding sound." [...] Decibel, who named Blood Mountain as their number 1 album of 2006, gave Crack the Skye a 7/10 rating as reviewer Joe Gross responded that [...] "Crack is clearly designed as a grower, not a shower, {{the sound of a}} band that grew tired of people not responding to their ground game, so they put the ball in the air. Who knows when it will come down?" [...] Clashs review was particularly glowing in its praise for the album, saying [...] "no metal release of 2009 is likely to be as important as ‘Crack The Skye." [...] The review praised the albums expansive sound and emotion, and finished by claiming that the album is [...] "surely destined to become the stuff of legend." [...] Reviewer Nate Chinen of the New York Times noted the albums [...] "ambitious vision and vivid execution." [...] The New Yorker pop music critic Sasha Frere-Jones lists it as one of his favorite albums of the year on his personal blog and in an article for The New Yorker called the Crack the Skye a [...] "deeply entertaining album." ...|$|R
40|$|The Topsails Intrusive Suite (TIS) and Springdale Group {{comprise}} widespread, Silurian, post-orogenic A-type intrusive and volcanic rocks m west-central Newfoundland. Magmatic-hydrothermal Cu-Mo-Ag-Au and intrusion related U-rare earth element (REE) mineralization occur locally {{in these}} <b>rocks</b> near <b>Hinds</b> Lake. A peralkaline, amphibole-clinopyroxene granite and hydrothermal-volcanic breccia host chalcopyrite, bornite, covellite, pyrite, molybdenite and chalcocite. Magmatic-hydrothermal quartz, copper sulfides, magnetite, Fe-Ti oxides and calcic clinopyroxene replace primary amphibole and pyroxene. Common accessory minerals are hematite, zircon, fluorite and monazite. Uranium-Pb zircon ages of host amphibole-clinopyroxene granite and rhyolite yield ages of 430 ± 1. 4 Ma and 428 ± 1. 6 Ma, respectively, suggesting that Cu-Mo-Ag-Au mineralization {{is associated with}} early TIS peralkaline granite magmatism and equivalent volcanic rocks of the Springdale Group. Uranium and REE are hosted in late stage felsic dykes, present in accessory monazite- (Ce, La), zircon, allanite- (Ce), pyrochlore, and thorite. Felsic dykes are among the youngest and most fractionated rocks of the TIS (likely younger than - 427 Ma) ...|$|R

40|$|Hermaphroditism, {{associated}} with territoriality and dominance behavior, {{is common in}} the marine environment. While male sex-specific coloration patterns have been documented in groupers, particularly during the spawning season, few data regarding social structure and the context for these color displays are available. In the present study, we define the social structure and male typical behavior of <b>rock</b> <b>hind</b> (Epinephelus adscensionis) in the wild. In addition, we detail the captive conditions and time period necessary to induce {{the onset of the}} sex-specific coloration and sexual change. At six oil production platform locations in the Gulf of Mexico, <b>rock</b> <b>hind</b> social group size and typical male <b>rock</b> <b>hind</b> social behavior were documented. We observed a rapid temporary color display in <b>rock</b> <b>hind</b> that could be turned on and off within three seconds and was used for confronting territory intruders and displays of aggression towards females. The male-specific "tuxedo" pattern consists of a bright yellow tail, a body with alternating dark brown and white patches and a dark bar extending from the upper mandible to the operculum. Identification and size ranges of male, female and intersex fish collected from oil platforms were determined in conjunction with gonadal histology. <b>Rock</b> <b>hind</b> social order is haremic with one dominant male defending a territory and a linear dominance hierarchy among individuals. In five captive experiments, the largest remaining female <b>rock</b> <b>hind</b> displayed the male specific color pattern within 32 d after dominant male removal from the social group. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence in a grouper species of color patterning used to display territoriality and dominance outside of spawning aggregations. The behavioral paradigm described here is a key advance that will enable mechanistic studies of this complex sex change process...|$|E

40|$|A {{new species}} of {{parasitic}} nematode, Philometra mexicana sp. nov.

The new species is characterized mainly by very small males (body length 1. 63 – 1. 86 mm) with equally long, needlelike spicules (length 90 – 120 μm) and the gubernaculum (57 – 66 μm) without the usual dorsal barb on the distal end, the body length of gravid females (178 – 230 mm), the presence of a well-developed anterior bulbous inflation on the female oesophagus, and by the length of the first-stage larvae (420 – 435 μm). A comparison with other congeners parasitizing the gonads of marine fishes is provided. The cephalic end of the gravid female of Philometra margolisi Moravec, Vidal-Martínez et Aguirre-Macedo, 1995, another related species from the gonads of Epinephelus [E. morio (Valenciennes) ] in Mexico, has been studied by SEM for the first time; it confirms the arrangement of the cephalic papillae as reported in the original species description.
