Regardless of their identities, it is thought that they contribute to the increase in dendritic spine number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression.

Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of synaptotagmin and an increase in synaptic vesicle number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well.

There are very few experimental models which elucidate the role of astrocyte over Long-term Potentiation (LTP).

Our results show that endocannabinoids are released during locomotor activity and participate in setting the baseline burst rate. They are released in response to mGluR 1 activation and act as <b>retrograde</b> <b>messengers.</b> This conditional release of endocannabinoids can transform motoneurons and crossing interneurons into modulatory neurons by enabling them to regulate their inhibitory synaptic inputs and thus contribute to the modulation of the locomotor burst frequency.

40|$|AbstractEndocannabinoids are <b>retrograde</b> <b>messengers</b> {{released}} by neurons to modulate {{the strength of}} their synaptic inputs. Endocannabinoids are thought to mediate the suppression of GABA release that follows depolarization of a hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal neuron—termed “depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition” (DSI). Here, we report that DSI is absent in mice which lack cannabinoid receptor- 1 (CB 1). Pharmacological and kinetic evidence suggests that CB 1 activation inhibits presynaptic Ca 2 + channels through direct G protein inhibition. Paired recordings show that endocannabinoids selectively inhibit a subclass of synapses distinguished by their fast kinetics and large unitary conductance. Furthermore, cannabinoid-sensitive inputs are unusual among central nervous system synapses in that they use N- but not P/Q-type Ca 2 + channels for neurotransmitter release.

We examined LTP following intra- or extracellular application of an NO scavanger, an inhibitor of NO synthase, and a membrane-impermeant NO donor that releases NO only upon photolysis with UV light.

50|$|Endocannabinoids affect {{long-lasting}} plasticity {{processes in}} various parts of the brain, serving both as regulators of pathways and necessary <b>retrograde</b> <b>messengers</b> in specific forms of LTD. In regard to retrograde signaling, cannabinoid receptors function widely throughout the brain in presynaptic inhibition. Endocannabinoid retrograde signaling has been shown to effect LTD at corticostriatal synapses and glutamatergic synapses in the prelimbic cortex of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and it is also involved in spike-timing-dependent LTD in the visual cortex. Endocannabinoids are implicated in LTD of inhibitory inputs (LTDi) within the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) as well as in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampus. Additionally, endocannabinoids play an important role in regulating various forms of synaptic plasticity. They are involved in inhibition of LTD at parallel fiber Purkinje neuron synapses in the cerebellum and NMDA receptor-dependent LTD in the hippocampus.|$|R
40|$|AbstractEndocannabinoids {{serve as}} <b>retrograde</b> <b>messengers</b> in many brain regions. These diffusible {{lipophilic}} molecules are released by postsynaptic cells and regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Here we describe an additional mechanism that mediates {{the spread of}} endocannabinoid signaling to distant inhibitory synapses. Depolarization of cerebellar Purkinje cells reduced the firing rate of nearby interneurons, and this reduction in firing was blocked by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM 251. The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55, 212 - 2 also reduced firing rates in interneurons, and this inhibition arose from the activation of a small potassium conductance. Thus, endocannabinoids released from the dendrites of depolarized neurons can lead to inhibition of firing in nearby cells. Because interneurons can project over several hundred micrometers, this inhibition of firing allows cells to regulate synaptic inputs at distances well {{beyond the limits of}} endocannabinoid diffusion...|$|R
40|$|Endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) {{serve as}} <b>retrograde</b> <b>messengers</b> at synapses in various {{regions of the}} brain. They are {{released}} from postsynaptic neurons and cause transient and long-lasting reduction of neurotransmitter release through activation of presynaptic cannabinoid receptors. Endocannabinoid release is induced either by increased postsynaptic Ca 2 + levels or by activation of Gq/ 11 -coupled receptors. When these two stimuli coincide, endocannabinoid release is markedly enhanced, which is attributed to the Ca 2 + dependency of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ). This Ca 2 +-assisted receptor-driven endocannabinoid release is suggested to participate in various forms of synaptic plasticity, including short-term associative plasticity in the cerebellum and spike-timing-dependent long-term depression in the somatosensory cortex.

40|$|Although {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) in the CA 1 {{region of the}} hippocampus is initiated postsynaptically by the influx of Ca 2 + through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels, the maintenance of LTP {{seems to be at}} least in part presynaptic. This suggests that the postsynaptic cell releases a <b>retrograde</b> <b>messenger</b> to activate the presynaptic terminals. It is likely that this messenger is membrane-permeant and reaches the presynaptic neuron by diffusion. We therefore have investigated two major membrane-permeant candidate retrograde messengers, arachidonic acid and nitric oxide (NO). Consistent with arachidonic acid or a lipoxygenase metabolite being a <b>retrograde</b> <b>messenger,</b> the phospholipase A 2 and lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid blocked LTP in the guinea pig CA 1 region in vitro. However, arachidonic acid (up to 100 microM) did not reliably produce activity-independent LTP, and activity-dependent potentiation by arachidonic acid was blocked by DL-aminophosphonovaleric acid. Since nordihydroguaiaretic acid also interferes with signal transduction involving NO, we next examined whether inhibitors of NO synthase block LTP. NG-Nitro-L-arginine blocked LTP when given in the bath, and this inhibition was partially overcome by high concentrations of L-arginine, suggesting that the inhibitor is specific to NO synthase. NG-Nitro-L-arginine and NG-methyl-L-arginine (but not NG-methyl-D-arginine) also blocked LTP when injected intracellularly, indicating that NO synthase is located in the postsynaptic cell. The NO, in turn, seems to be released into the extracellular space, since bathing the slice with hemoglobin, a protein that binds NO and is not taken up by cells, also blocked LTP. Moreover, NO enhances spontaneous presynaptic release of transmitter from hippocampal neurons in dissociated cell culture. These data favor the idea that NO might be a <b>retrograde</b> <b>messenger</b> in LTP...|$|E

Hebbian learning describe a strengthening of a synapse between a presynaptic input onto a postsynaptic neuron when both pre- and postsynaptic neurons are coactive. In this work, a theory of homeostatic regulation of neurotransmitter release by <b>retrograde</b> <b>messenger</b> and Hebbian plasticity in neuronal encoding is presented. Encoding efficiency was measured for different synaptic conditions. In order to gain high encoding efficiency, the spiking pattern of a neuron should be dependent on {{the intensity of the}} input and show low levels of noise. In this work, we represent spiking trains as zeros and ones (corresponding to non-spike or spike in a time bin, respectively) as words with length equal to three. Then the frequency of each word (here eight words) is measured using spiking trains. These frequencies are used to measure neuronal efficiency in different conditions and for different parameter values. Results show that neurons that have synapses acting as band-pass filters show the highest efficiency to encode their input when both Hebbian mechanism and homeostatic regulation of neurotransmitter release exist in synapses. Specifically, the integration of homeostatic regulation of feedback inhibition with Hebbian mechanism and homeostatic regulation of neurotransmitter release in the synapses leads to even higher efficiency when high stimulus intensity is presented to the neurons. However, neurons with synapses acting as high-pass filters show no remarkable increase in encoding efficiency for all simulated synaptic plasticity mechanisms...|$|E
