50|$|The oldest known radiolarites {{come from}} the Upper Cambrian of Kazakhstan. <b>Radiolarian</b> <b>ooze</b> was sedimented here over a time span of 15 million years into the Lower Ordovician. The deep water sediments were {{deposited}} near the paleoequator and are associated with remnants of oceanic crust. The dating has been done with conodonts. In more lime-rich sections four radiolarian faunal associations were identified. The oldest, rather impoverished fauna dates back well into {{the second stage of}} the Ordovician (Arenigian). The youngest fauna consists already of 15 different taxa and belongs to the fifth stage (Lower Caradocian).|$|E

50|$|The gradual {{replacement}} of the <b>radiolarian</b> <b>oozes</b> of the Ruhpolding Formation by coccolith oozes of the overlying Aptychen Beds {{can be explained by}} further deepening of the basin and/or by blooming calcareous nannoplankton.|$|R
50|$|A {{good example}} for Cenozoic radiolarites are radiolarian clays from Barbados found within the Oceanic Group. The group was {{deposited}} in the time range Early Eocene till Middle Miocene on oceanic crust which is subducting now under the island arc of the Lesser Antilles. Younger radiolarites are not known - probably because younger <b>radiolarian</b> <b>oozes</b> didn't have sufficient time to consolidate.|$|R
50|$|Lithologically the up to 50 meter thick Ruhpolding Formation {{consists}} of black-green to red radiolarites grading into cherty limestones, cherty marls and cherty shales. It has formed from <b>radiolarian</b> <b>ooze.</b> The ooze consolidated diagenetically to thinly layered and regularly banded cherts. The chert layers are usually separated by very thin claystone layers creating a cyclic appearance. This cyclicity might correlate with Milankovic cycles. A plausible diagenetic cause can be excluded due to slump structures that incorporate several individual cycles. The cherts are mainly earthy red, but show greenish-blackish hues in places. The red coloration due to hematite {{is caused by}} the complete oxidation of iron compounds in oxygen-rich bottom waters. The red layers show Fe3+/Fe2+ > 1, whereas in the greenish layers the ratio is < 1, the coloration in the latter being tied to sericite, chlorite and maybe pyrite.|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} diatoms and other silica-utilizing organisms are found, as opal sediments within pelagic deep-sea deposits. Pelagic sediments, {{containing}} significant quantities of siliceous biogenic remains, are {{commonly referred to}} as siliceous ooze. Siliceous ooze are particularly abundant in the modern ocean at high latitudes in the northern and southern hemispheres. A striking feature of siliceous ooze distribution is a ca. 200 km wide belt stretching across the Southern Ocean. Some equatorial regions of upwelling, where nutrients are abundant and productivity is high, are also characterized by local siliceous ooze. Siliceous oozes are composed primarily of the remains of diatoms and radiolarians, but may also include other siliceous organisms, such as silicoflagellates and sponge spicules. Diatom ooze occurs mainly in high-latitude areas and along some continental margins, whereas <b>radiolarian</b> <b>ooze</b> are more characteristic of equatorial areas. Siliceous ooze are modified and transformed during burial into bedded cherts.|$|E

In structure and composition, the lower nodule is similar to the Pleistocene surface nodules associated with <b>radiolarian</b> <b>ooze</b> from the Clarion-Clipperton Nodule Province. The upper nodule resembles those occurring on pelagic clay from the northern margin of that province...|$|E
50|$|Radiolarite is a siliceous, {{comparatively}} hard, fine-grained, chert-like, and homogeneous {{sedimentary rock}} that is composed predominantly of the microscopic remains of radiolarians. This term {{is also used}} for indurated <b>radiolarian</b> <b>oozes</b> and sometimes as a synonym of radiolarian earth. However, radiolarian earth is typically regarded by Earth scientists to be the unconsolidated equivalent of a radiolarite. A radiolarian chert is well-bedded, microcrystalline radiolarite that has a well-developed siliceous cement or groundmass.|$|R
50|$|In case {{of marine}} sediments, ooze does {{not refer to}} a sediment's consistency, but to its composition, which {{directly}} reflects its origin. Ooze is pelagic sediment that consists of at least 30% of microscopic remains of either calcareous or siliceous planktonic debris organisms. The remainder typically consists almost entirely of clay minerals. As a result, the grain size of oozes is often bimodal with a well-defined biogenic silt- to sand-size fraction and siliciclastic clay-size fraction. Oozes can be defined by and classified according to the predominate organism that compose them. For example, there are diatom, coccolith, foraminifera, globigerina, pteropod, and <b>radiolarian</b> <b>oozes.</b> Oozes are also classified and named according to their mineralogy, i.e. calcareous or siliceous oozes. Whatever their composition, all oozes accumulate extremely slowly, at {{no more than a}} few centimeters per millennium.|$|R
50|$|The fully marine Ruhpolding Formation was {{deposited}} in the pelagic domain at {{the northern edge of}} the Neotethys ocean, as indicated by rare ammonite finds like Hibolites semisulcatus. The water depth of deposition is still disputed. Today <b>radiolarian</b> <b>oozes</b> form below the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) at 4000 to 5000 meter water depth. In the Upper Jurassic the CCD was probably much higher and ranged somewhere between 2000 and 3000 meter depth due to a greatly diminished calcareous nannoplankton at that time.|$|R
40|$|The {{radioactivity}} of bottom sediments {{has been}} but little investigated. Data published by Joly, Pettersson, Piggot and Iimori refer to determinations of radium, contained mainly in oceanic deep-water sediments in red clays, radiolarian, globigerina oozes, blue muds and manganese concretions. The determinations {{have shown the}} manganese concretions to be richest as regards content of radium (up to 10 - 8 per cent); red clays and <b>radiolarian</b> <b>ooze</b> also possess a rather high content of radium. Other types of sediments are less rich in radium...|$|E
40|$|In surface {{sediment}} at {{the three}} DOMES sites in the equatorial North Pacific, the percentage of reworked fauna and {{the thickness of the}} acoustically transparent uppermost layer increases from east to west (Sites C to B to A) and the percentage of volcanogenic products decreases. On the basis of lithology and acoustic signature (3. 5 kHz) this sediment can be correlated with surface sediment recovered in Deep Sea Drilling Project cores from this same area. It has been assigned to the <b>radiolarian</b> <b>ooze</b> unit of the Clipperton Ocean Formation. The underlying Marquesas Oceanic Formation, well documented in DSDP cores, was not observed in DOMES cores but was identified in the acoustic records as an acoustically transparent to weakly reflective unit.

40|$|An acoustically very {{transparent}} {{layer is}} present {{over much of}} the deep basin-here termed the Central Basin-between the Gilbert and Marshall Islands on the west and the Line Islands on the east. The Pacific Panel recommended drilling in this region to sample at least the upper transparent layer, and the first opaque layer beneath. Several possible sites were considered by the panel and by the shipboard party. Of paramount importance in choosing a particular site was a concern that sufficient sediments be present to bury the bottom-hole assembly (the drill collars and bumper subs) before the bit struck hard rock. A set of nearly continuous cores of an apparently uninterrupted section of <b>radiolarian</b> <b>ooze</b> ranging in age from middle Eocene to Recent was obtained, but the bit did not reach the deepest seismic reflector.

50|$|It {{is in fact}} {{astonishing}} {{that any}} radiolarian tests survive at all. It is estimated that only as little as {{one percent of the}} original skeletal material is preserved in <b>radiolarian</b> <b>oozes.</b> According to Dunbar & Berger (1981) even this minimal preservation of one percent is merely {{due to the fact that}} radiolarians form colonies and that they are occasionally embedded in fecal pellets and other organic aggregates. The organic wrappings act as a protection for the tests (Casey et al. 1979) and spare them from dissolution, but of course speed up the sinking time by a factor of 10.|$|R

According to enrichment factors these elements have the following order: Mo> Mn> Cu> Ni> Co> Pb> W. Enrichment of pelagic sediments from the Indian Ocean is mainly determined by the mechanism of the sedimentation process. Enrichment factors of Cu, Ni, Co, W, Mo, and Mn in pelagic sediments of the North Indian Ocean are intermediate between ones in pelagic sediments of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans...|$|R

40|$|During Leg 27 five {{sites were}} drilled {{in the eastern}} Indian Ocean, four in abyssal plains near the western margin of Australia {{and one in the}} Timor Trough. Abyssal plain sediments are divided into two major units: (1) a lower, acoustically {{transparent}} layer of relatively uniform thickness draped over basaltic basement and (2) a horizontally layered sequence of highly variable thickness filling low areas {{on the surface of the}} transparent layer. The transparent layer, ranging in age from Upper Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous, consists chiefly of dark gray, siliceous clays and claystones with minor zeolitic clay and nannofossil ooze. Sedimentation rates are between 5 and 30 m/m. y. being highest in the Lower Cretaceous. Upper Cretaceous sediment are sparse or absent. The relatively high sedimentation rates for pelagic clay are probably due to the proximity of the Australian continent.

50|$|The {{view that}} radiolarites are mainly {{deposited}} under pelagic, deep water conditions cannot be asserted any longer. Layers enriched in radiolarians do even occur {{in shallow water}} limestones like the Solnhofen limestone and the Werkkalk Formation of Bavaria. What seems to be important {{for the preservation of}} <b>radiolarian</b> <b>oozes</b> is that they are deposited well below the storm wave base and below the jets of erosive surface currents. Radiolarites without any carbonates have most likely been sedimented below the calcite compensation depth (CCD).

At present, the CCD reaches a maximum depth of about 5000 meters near the equator.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of drilling at Site 1179 was to search for microbes or biochemical evidence of microbial activity {{as part of the}} ongoing exploration of the depth and extent of the deep biosphere. The existence of living microbes has not been confirmed, but the chemistry of pore waters from the site, such as sulfate and ammonium profiles, is consistent with sulfate reduction and nitrification by anaerobic bacteria. However, chemical profiles are affected by the movement of molecules and ions through porous sediments by diffusion and advection. Permeability is thus an important consideration in the interpretation of pore water chemistry profiles. Moreover, diatomaceous sediments have some unique and, as yet, poorly understood physical properties. The purpose of this research is to measure hydraulic conductivity (permeability) in a suite of sediment samples from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1179 by the transient-pulse method. The sample set consists of four diatom ooze samples from Unit I, one <b>radiolarian</b> <b>ooze</b> sample from Unit II, and one pelagic clay sample from Unit III. The permeability of the clay is 1. 92 µd, whereas the permeabilities of the overlying radiolarian and diatom oozes range from 289 to 1604 µd. Among these samples, permeability increases with porosity and grain size, in keeping with the results of previous studies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThree {{distinct}} radiolarian assemblages {{were obtained}} in this study; {{two of them}} were extracted from large blocks of radiolarites included in a mélange NW of Lake Sevan (Dzknaget). The latest Tithonian-Late Valanginian assemblage comes from a coherent sequence of 6 - 7 m-thick radiolarites with intercalations of lavas and rounded blocks of shallow-water limestones. The Late Barremian-Early Aptian assemblage found in the second block allows correlation with radiolarites dated recently in Karabagh. A third radiolarian assemblage comes from Vedi and establishes that <b>radiolarian</b> <b>ooze</b> was accumulated in the Tethyan realm of the Lesser Caucasus until at least the middle Albian. A synthesis of all available micropaleontological (radiolarian) and geochronological ages for the ophiolites present in Armenia and Karabagh points to the following scenario for their geological evolution: the initial phase of oceanic floor spreading was under way during the Late Triassic (Carnian) or even slightly before; the bulk of oceanic lithosphere preserved today in the Lesser Caucasus was formed during the Jurassic; evidence for subaerial volcanic activity is recorded in tuffite intercalations in the Middle-Upper Jurassic radiolarian cherts; an oceanic volcanic plateau was formed during the Late Barremian-Aptian (or possibly even before) while the obduction of ophiolites took place during the Coniacian-Santonian. The geological history of ophiolites in the Lesser Caucasus shares a number of similarities with the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture zone (i. e. initiation of ocean spreading during the Carnian, obduction after the Cenomanian), but there are also some differences especially with respect to the timing of the oceanic plateau emplacement...|$|E
40|$|Siliceous {{deposits}} drilled on Ocean Drilling Program Leg 129 accumulated {{within a}} few degrees of the equator during the Jurassic through early Tertiary, as constrained by paleomagnetic data. During the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, <b>radiolarian</b> <b>ooze,</b> mixed with a minor amount of pelagic clay, was deposited near the equator, and overall accumulation rates were moderate to low. At a smaller scale, in more detail, periods of relatively higher accumulation rates alternated with periods of very low accumulation rates. Higher rates are represented by radiolarite and limestone; lower rates are represented by radiolarian claystone. Our limited data from Leg 129 suggests that accumulation of biogenic deposits was not symmetrical about the equator or consistent over time. In the Jurassic, sedimentation was siliceous; in the Cretaceous there was significant calcareous deposition; in the Tertiary claystone indicates significantly lower accumulation rates at least {{the northern part of}} the equatorial zone. Accumulation rates for Leg 129 deposits in the Cretaceous were higher in the southern part of the equatorial zone than in the northern part, and the southern side of this high productivity zone extended to approximately 15 °S, while the northern side extended only to about 5 °N. Accumulation rates are influenced by relative contributions from various sediment sources. Several elements and element ratios are useful for discriminating sedimentary sources for the equatorial depositional environments. Silica partitioning calculations indicate that silica is dominantly of biogenic origin, with a detrital component in the volcaniclastic turbidite units, and a small hydrothermal component in the basal sediments on spreading ridge basement of Jurassic age at Site 801.

40|$|The broad {{mound of}} sediments {{found in the}} {{equatorial}} Pacific contains a detailed and complex record {{of the history of}} equatorial divergence, trade wind strength, biogeochemical fluxes, and biologic evolution. To extract this history from the biogenic sediments of this region the recovery of undisturbed and complete sections is required. Also required is the development of a detailed chronostratigraphy with which we can determine both the times and rates of paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic change. As this mound of sediment has ridden northward on the Pacific crust the most biogenic parts of the lower Cenozoic sediments have gradually moved from under the region of high flux rates at the divergence center. Now they lie within the reach of APC coring on the JOIDES Resolution. The sections recovered on Leg 199 form a paleolatitude transect from about 4. 5 $°S to 18. 5 $°N. Study of these sections has given us a well documented magnetic stratigraphy back into the Eocene, good calcareous nannofossil stratigraphy for the lower Miocene, Oligocene, and early Eocene, and excellent radiolarian stratigraphy from the lower Miocene through the middle Eocene. In addition we recovered good the Miocene/Oligocene and Eocene/Oligocene boundaries in an equatorial setting and LPTM sections near basement at three different sites. These results have allowed a more certain assignment of ages of biostratigraphic events and an opportunity to develop orbitally tuned time scales in sections from the lower Miocene down through the Oligocene. The initial estimates of sediment accumulation rates in the <b>radiolarian</b> <b>oozes</b> indicate variation by a factor of three from upper to middle Eocene times.

Various sediments from DSDP and ODP drill cores {{in front of the}} Mariana, South Sandwich, Banda, East Sunda and Lesser Antilles island arcs have been analysed and show highly variable Li contents and d 7 Li values. The sediment piles in front of the Mariana and South Sandwich arcs largely consist of pelagic sediments (clays and oozes). The pelagic clays have high Li contents (up to 57. 3 ppm) and Li isotope compositions ranging from + 1. 3 ? to + 4. 1 ?. The oozes have lower Li contents (7. 3 - 16 ppm) with d 7 Li values of the diatom oozes from the South Sandwich lower (+ 2. 8 ? to + 3. 2 ?) than those of the <b>radiolarian</b> <b>oozes</b> from the Mariana arc (+ 8. 1 ? to + 14. 5 ?). Mariana sediment also contains a significant portion of volcanogenic material, which is characterised by a moderate Li content (14 ppm) and a relatively heavy isotope composition (+ 6. 4 ?). Sediments from the Banda and Lesser Antilles contain considerable amounts of continental detritus, and have high Li contents (up to 74. 3 ppm) and low d 7 Li values (around 0 ?), caused by weathering of continental bedrock. East Sunda sediments largely consist of calcareous oozes. These carbonate sediments display intermediate to high Li contents (2. 4 - 41. 9 ppm) and highly variable d 7 Li values (- 1. 6 ? to + 12. 8 ?). Basaltic oceanic crust samples from worldwide DSDP and ODP drill cores are characterised by enrichment of Li compared to fresh MORB (6. 6 - 33. 1 vs. 3. 6 - 7. 5 ppm, respectively), and show a large range in Li isotope compositions (+ 1. 7 ? to + 11. 8 ?). The elemental and isotopic enrichment of Li in altered basalts is due to the uptake of isotopically heavy seawater Li during weathering. However, old oceanic crust samples from Sites 417 / 418 exhibit lighter Li isotope compositions compared to young basaltic crust samples from Sites 332 B and 504 B. This lighter Li isotope signature in old crust is unexpected and {{further research is needed to}} explore this issue...|$|R

This part of the Pacific plate was formed during the Early Cretaceous, as shown by northeast-trending M-series magnetic lineations that become younger toward the northwest (Larson and Chase, 1972, doi: 10. 1130 / 0016 - 7606 (1972) 83 [3627 :LMEOTW] 2. 0.

40|$|ODP Leg 199 drilled a {{latitudinal}} transect {{of sites}} across {{the position of}} the early Eocene equator, designed to study the evolution of the equatorial Pacific current and wind system as the Earth went from maximum Cenozoic warmth to initial Antarctic glaciations. The cruise recovered a biogenic sedimentary record of equatorial processes from the early Miocene to the late Paleocene, roughly from 18 to 56 Ma. Above the biogenic sediments are 10 m or more of nonfossiliferous clay, representing most of the Neogene interval. We found that equatorial deposition patterns were stable for the Eocene but very {{different from those of the}} Neogene. The Eocene is marked by a very shallow carbonate compensation depth (CCD) and <b>radiolarian</b> <b>ooze</b> sediments. In contrast, Pleistocene equatorial sediments are carbonate and diatom rich. The Eocene equatorial sedimentation regime was also much wider than modern, expanding in the middle Eocene to about 10 degrees north of the paleoequator. We interpret the Eocene sedimentary environment to indicate significantly more diffuse upwelling than is found in the modern ocean and a deeper-than-modern eastern Pacific thermocline. Eocene deep waters appear to have been well-oxygenated despite being much warmer than modern deep waters. There is an abrupt sedimentological transition coincident with the first major glaciation of Antarctica in the early Oligocene from Eocene equatorial conditions to proto-modern conditions. Over a time period of about 120 kyr the CCD dropped by more than 1. 3 km and sedimentation focused into a narrow equatorial band similar to equatorial sedimentation in the Holocene equatorial Pacific. We interpret the change to mark the first Cenozoic appearance of the modern Pacific equatorial upwelling system. We also recovered examples of the Paleocene-Eocene boundary at 3 different drillsites from about 1 degree south of the 55 Ma paleoequator to 11 degrees north of it. The P-E boundary event, one of the largest carbon-isotope excursions of the Cenozoic, is represented by a carbonate-poor multi-colored sediment interval. Consistent banding between two sites more than 200 km apart suggest significant changes in deep ocean chemistry during this time interval...|$|E
40|$|ODP Leg 199 was {{designated}} to collect sediments along a latitudinal transect in the Pacific Ocean {{to better understand}} Paleogene sedimentation patterns and the system of equatorial currents. At ODP Sites 1218 through 1220, the magnetic record of the Paleogene Equatorial sediments extends back to Polarity Chron C 20 r (Middle Eocene), providing an unprecedented record of Paleogene magnetostratigraphy in Equatorial Pacific sediments. Paleomagnetic data were acquired on the JOIDES-Resolution pass-through cryogenic magnetometer from archive halves of core sections. Ongoing analysis on u-channels corroborates the polarity pattern obtained on the shipboard magnetometer. Natural Remanent Magnetization was measured at 5 -cm intervals for each core section, and was followed by four to five steps of alternating field demagnetization up {{to a maximum of}} 15 or 20 mT. In addition, shipboard and shore-based measurements of discrete samples were also carried out, including alternating field and thermal demagnetization. All measured lithologies, including an upper red clay, <b>radiolarian</b> <b>ooze</b> and nannofossil ooze/chalk yield reproducible results and have a moderate magnetization intensity, well above the noise level of the cryogenic magnetometer. Stepwise demagnetization of discrete samples indicates that the Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM) is stable and well defined for the most part of the sedimentary record. The obtained high-resolution magnetic stratigraphy allows to cross-calibrate magnetic reversal stratigraphy with biostratigraphy, including the placement of the Eocene-Oligocene and Oligocene-Miocene boundaries. Overall, results from Leg 199 provide the first complete magnetobiostratigraphic record for the Middle Eocene through the Pliocene in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean. A particularly important aspect of Leg 199 was to establish the latitudinal plate motion of the Equatorial Pacific, based on paleomagnetic data. ChRM directions for the demagnetized discrete samples are used to construct the paleolatitudinal evolution of Leg 199 sites. A progressive northward displacement of the Pacific Plate in the Paleogene, which places the equatorial mound of biogenic sediment in northern latitudes and moves sediments out of the high sediment flux area, is established from the analysis of paleomagnetic inclinations...|$|E
40|$|Site 1222 (13 ° 48. 98 ´N, 143 ° 53. 35 ´W; 4989 meters below {{sea level}} [mbsl]; Fig. F 1) forms a south-central {{component}} of the 56 -Ma transect drilled during Leg 199 and is situated ~ 2 ° south of the Clarion Fracture Zone in typical abyssal hill topography. On the basis of regional magnetic anomalies, we anticipated basement age at Site 1222 to be equivalent to Chron C 25 r or Chron C 25 n (~ 56 - 57 Ma) (Cande et al., 1989), which is slightly older than at Site 1219. At the outset of drilling at Site 1222, our estimate for total sediment thickness was ~ 115 m (Fig. F 2). Based upon a fixed hotspot model (Gripp and Gordon, 1990, for 0 - to 5 -Ma Pacific hotspot rotation pole; Engebretson et al., 1985, for older poles) Site 1222 should have been located ~ 1 ° north of the equator at 56 Ma and ~ 4 °N at 40 Ma. A nearby gravity core (EW 9709 - 17 GC), taken during the site survey cruise, recovered > 5 m of red clay with a late-middle Miocene age {{on the basis of}} radiolarian biostratigraphy (Lyle, 2000). Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 42 located ~ 4 ° east of Site 1222, was not drilled to basement but contains a thin sedimentary section (~ 100 m thick) of upper Oligocene nannofossil ooze through middle Eocene <b>radiolarian</b> nannofossil <b>ooze.</b> In turn, DSDP Site 162 lies ~ 1 ° north of DSDP Site 42 and is situated on young crust (49 Ma) that contains ~ 150 m of clayey <b>radiolarian</b> and nannofossil <b>oozes</b> of early Oligocene-middle Eocene age. Site 1222 will be used to study the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the late Eocene and Oligocene, to sample late Paleocene and early Eocene sediments in the central tropical Pacific Ocean, and to help determine whether or not there has been significant southward movement of the hotspots with respect to the spin axis prior to 40 Ma...|$|R
40|$|Silicoflagellates {{ranging from}} middle Eocene to middle Miocene in age {{are present in}} Ocean Drilling Program Hole 1219 A. The hole was drilled 250. 8 meters below {{seafloor}} of which an ~ 120 m section primarily composed of nannofossil <b>ooze</b> with variable <b>radiolarian</b> and clay content is early Miocene and Oligocene in age, and a 95 -m section is Eocene radiolarian and zeolithic clays, <b>radiolarian</b> and diatom <b>oozes,</b> and nannofossil oozes and chalks. A total of 150 samples were studied at a sample interval of one per section. Diversity of silicoflagellates is moderate, and the preservation is good. Abundance is generally low, with many samples barren of silicoflagellates, but 31 species and subspecies were identified. One new species, Naviculopsis trigeminus, is described...|$|R
40|$|At Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 462, from mudline to 447 meters {{below the}} sea floor, Cenozoic nannofossil oozes and chalks have {{acoustic}} anisotropies such that horizontal sonic velocities are 0 to 2. 5 % faster {{than those in}} the vertical direction. In laminated chalk, anisotropy of 5 % is typical, and in limestones, <b>radiolarian</b> <b>oozes,</b> porcellanites, and cherts, the anisotropies range from 4 to 13 %. Middle Maestrichtian volcaniclastics from 447 meters to 560 meters below the sea floor have an acoustic anisotropy of 2 to 32 %; 4 to 13 % is typical. Basalt flows and sills occur between 560 meters and 1068 meters, and have no apparent anisotropy, but minor interbedded volcaniclastics have anisotropies from 0 to 20 % (5 % is typical). These volcaniclastics frequently have very small anisotropies, however, compared with the volcaniclastic sequence above the basalt section. Data in cross-plots of the laboratory-measured compressional sound velocity versus wet-bulk density, wet-water content, and porosity of sediments and sedimentary rock typically lie between the equations derived by Wyllie et al. (1956) and Wood (1941); the Wyllie et al. (1956) equation has a fair fit with similar basalt velocity cross-plots. Crossplots of thermal conductivity and sound velocity indicate only a fair correlation. Cross-plots of thermal conductivity versus porosity, wet-water content, and wet-bulk density correlate well with equations derived by Maxwell (1904), Ratcliff (1960), Parasnis (1960), and Bullard and Day (1961). Electrical formation factor versus porosity for sediments and sedimentary rock agrees with the Archie (1942) equation, with m values of 2. 6; for basalt, an m of about 2. 1 is typical. Basalt pore-water resistivities {{do not appear to be}} greatly different from sea water. Formation factors are greater than those derived from equations in Maxwell (1904), Winsauer et al. (1952), Boyce (1968), and Kermabon et al. (1969). An "apparent interstitial water resistivity" (Rwa) curve was derived from the density and induction logs. This Rwa curve indicated an anomaly, at 393. 5 to 396. 5 meters, which could be interpreted as (1) 76 % hydrocarbons, (2) relatively fresh pore water (1. 8 per mil salinity), or (3) low-grain-density (2. 2 g/cm** 3) semi-lithified porcellanite-chert. Porcellanite-chert is the most plausible interpretation. In situ temperatures measured by the Uyeda temperature probe were about 2 to 5 °C (50 %) higher than the equilibrium temperature (Lachenbruch and Brewer, 1959) extrapolated from two Gearhart-Owen continuous temperature logs; this discrepancy probably arises because the hole was washed out in this depth interval, so these extrapolated temperatures are probably not reliable. If one ignores all precautions as to temperature artifacts, then the equilibrium temperatures of the Gearhart-Owen temperature logs suggest that hydrothermal circulation is occurring in at least the upper 40 meters of the basalt section and heat is transferred by convection and not conduction. Hydrothermal circulation is probably not indicated, however, and the temperature anomalies probably result from excessive artificial cooling of the fractured basalt zones by circulation of water during drilling...|$|R
