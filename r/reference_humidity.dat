40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} sources of {{uncertainty}} for two types of humidity sensors. The standard humidity environment was made by several saturated salt solutions. These uncertainty sources include predicted values of calibration equation, <b>reference</b> <b>humidity</b> source, temperature variation effect, nonlinear and repeatability, and resolution source. The study also dealt with the effect of calibration methods and calibration equations on the uncertainty. The polynomial calibration equation had better predictive performance than the linear equation for two types of humidity sensors. The uncertainty analysis shows that the predicted uncertainty is the main source for combined uncertainty. No significant difference of the uncertainty for resistive sensor was found between classical method and inverse method. However, the predicted uncertainty of inverse method is significantly {{lower than that of}} classical method for capacitive humidity sensor. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Relative {{humidity}} (RH) measurements, as {{derived from}} wet-bulb and dry-bulb thermometers operated as a psychrometer within a thermometer screen, have limited accuracy because of natural ventilation variations. Standard RH calculations generally assume a fixed screen psychrometer coefficient, {{but this is}} too small during poor ventilation. By comparing a <b>reference</b> <b>humidity</b> probe—exposed within a screen containing a psychrometer—with wind-speed measurements under controlled conditions, a wind-speed correction for the screen psychrometer coefficient has been derived and applicable when 2 -metre wind speeds fall below 3 ms– 1. Applying this to hourly-averaged data reduced the mean moist RH bias of the psychrometer (over the reference probe) from 1. 2 % to 0. 4 %, and reduced the inter-quartile range of the RH differences from 2. 0 % to 0. 8 %. This correction is particularly amenable to automatic measurement systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} modelling of {{the observed}} precipitation, a very important variable {{for a wide range}} of climate applications, continues to be one of the major challenges that climate scientists face today. When the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to dynamically downscale the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) over the Indo-Pacific region, with analysis (grid-point) nudging, it is found that the cumulus scheme used, Betts–Miller–Janjić (BMJ), produces excessive rainfall suggesting that it has to be modified for this region. Experimentation has shown that the cumulus precipitation is not very sensitive to changes in the cloud efficiency but varies greatly in response to modifications of the temperature and <b>humidity</b> <b>reference</b> profiles. A new version of the scheme, denoted "modified BMJ" scheme, where the <b>humidity</b> <b>reference</b> profile is more moist, was developed. In tropical belt simulations it was found to give a better estimate {{of the observed}} precipitation as given by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3 B 42 data set than the default BMJ scheme for the whole tropics and both monsoon seasons. In fact, in some regions the model even outperforms CFSR. The advantage of modifying the BMJ scheme to produce better rainfall estimates lies in the final dynamical consistency of the rainfall with other dynamical and thermodynamical variables of the atmosphere...|$|R

The reported instrument measures the transmitted output power depending up on the medium refractive index in the light path of a fiber-to-fiber design. A liquid cell is located between the fibers in the light path and power variations for different cold and hot water levels in the cell are measured. By using a <b>reference</b> <b>humidity</b> meter the calibration curve representing the relative humidity (%RH) {{as a function of}} the transmitted output power is obtained. For the hot water with the final temperature of T = 32. 7 C the output power range of 255. 0 - 313. 0 nW is measured for a relative humidity change of 32. 76 - 41. 26 %. A power variation of 58 nW is noted for the 8. 5 % RH variation which shows the high sensitivity for the reported sensor. For the light transmitted in dry air path the output power is 516. 7 nW while for the water path such power is 784. 6 nW. Thus, the reported device can check the presence of the water vapor, water, or any other transparent liquid in the gap between the two axially aligned fibers.

40|$|The novel Hygrometer for Atmospheric Investigation (HAI) realizes {{a unique}} concept for {{simultaneous}} gas-phase and total (gas-phase + evaporated cloud particles) water measurements. It {{has been developed}} and successfully deployed {{for the first time}} on the German HALO research aircraft. This new instrument combines direct tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (dTDLAS) with a first-principle evaluation method to allow absolute water vapor measurements without any initial or repetitive sensor calibration using a reference gas or a <b>reference</b> <b>humidity</b> generator. HAI contains two completely independent dual-channel (closed-path, open-path) spectrometers, one at 1. 4 and one at 2. 6  µm, which together allow us to cover the entire atmospheric H 2 O range from 1 to 40   000  ppmv with a single instrument. Both spectrometers each comprise a separate, wavelength-individual extractive, closed-path cell for total water (ice and gas-phase) measurements. Additionally, both spectrometers couple light into a common open-path cell outside of the aircraft fuselage for a direct, sampling-free, and contactless determination of the gas-phase water content. This novel twin dual-channel setup allows for the first time multiple self-validation functions, in particular a reliable, direct, in-flight validation of the open-path channels. During the first field campaigns, the in-flight deviations between the independent and calibration-free channels (i. e., closed-path to closed-path and open-path to closed-path) were on average in the 2  % range. Further, the fully autonomous HAI hygrometer allows measurements up to 240  Hz with a minimal integration time of 1. 4  ms. The best precision is achieved by the 1. 4  µm closed-path cell at 3. 8  Hz (0. 18  ppmv) and by the 2. 6  µm closed-path cell at 13  Hz (0. 055  ppmv).

The goal is to achieve absolute accuracy better than 3 % on the column integrated water vapour (IWV). An intensive observing period was conducted in September-October 2011 at Observatoire de Haute Provence (OHP), France, {{with the aim of}} intercomparing several different techniques and instruments. It involved two Raman lidars, four radiosonde measurement systems, five GPS stations, a stellar spectrometer, and several ground-based capacitive and dew-point sensors. Observations were collected over 17 nights during which 26 balloons were released which carried a total of 79 radiosondes. Most of the balloons carried 3 or 4 different sonde types simultaneously (Vaisala RS 92, MODEM M 2 K 2 -DC and M 10, and Meteolabor Snow-White). The comparison of IWV measurements from the four radiosonde types to GPS reveals biases of - 11 % to + 7 %. Comparison of water vapour profiles from the radiosondes to the IGN scanning Raman lidar profiles reveals mostly dry and wet biases in the radiosondes data in dry layers in the middle and upper troposphere. Several Raman lidar calibration methods are evaluated which adjust the lidar measurements either on ground-based capacitive or dew-point sensors measurements, on radiosonde data or on GPS PWV data. Another method adjusts the lidar calibration constant as an extra parameter during GPS processing. All these methods show a good degree of consistency and yield a repeatability of 2 to 5 % during the first 3 -week period of the experiment. A drift in the calibration constant is observed throughout the full time of the experiment which is partly explained by a temperature-dependent bias in the lidar measurements induced by the progressive cooling of the atmosphere. Modelling and correcting this effect or modifying the Raman lidar detection system should allow achieving a 3 % level of accuracy into the long term and make the Raman lidar technique suitable to detect biases or to calibrate data from other techniques (e. g., radiosondes, visible spectrometers and microwave radiometers) ...|$|E

In high humidity (approximately 96. 7 %), concentrations of total ammonia (NH 3 +NH 4 +) in haemolymph display pronounced episodic changes, ranging from less than 1 mmoll 21 to more than 50 mmoll 21. Elevated concentrations (> 5 mmoll 21) occur in discrete bouts lasting from 40 min to more than 2 h. Concomitant changes in total ammonia levels are seen in pleon fluid and maxillary urine. Overall, mean ammonia concentrations in pleon fluid, but not maxillary urine, are significantly {{higher than in the}} haemolymph, which may indicate active secretion of NH 4 + in the pleon. Elevated ammonia concentrations are not observed in reduced ambient humidities (85 % and 30 %). Evidence supports a physiological coupling between pleon NH 3 volatilization and active water vapour absorption. Pleon fluid and haemolymph pH values are similar, discounting a role of alkalization in NH 3 volatilization. Published rates of ammonia excretion are compatible with intermittent volatilization from pleon fluid and with measured NH 3 levels during elevations in ammonia concentration...|$|R
40|$|Wine quality {{depends on}} many factors, {{such as the}} choice of variety, stock, {{training}} system, pruning as well as environmental parameters and cultivation techniques performed in the vineyard. Monitoring the micro-climate of grapevine allows to conveniently perform the most important cultivation techniques (soil management, pesticide treatments, green pruning, harvest) thus reducing the operating costs of the vineyard, and increasing {{the overall quality of}} the grapes. The aim of the present study is to monitor the micro-climate of grapevine in order to control spring period hazards, to reduce the operating costs of the vineyard and to increase the quality of grapes.

40|$|Automatic FAG 62 I-N beta-dust {{monitors}} {{have been}} used in the National Air Quality Monitoring Network to measure PM 10 (particles smaller than 10 um aerodynamic diameter) in the Netherlands. In comparing the 5 -method with the European reference method (EN 12341) for PM 10, this automatic beta-method was found to underestimate the PM 10 levels observed using the reference method by about 25 %. Laboratory research was then carried out to explore the causes. These laboratory experiments focussed on the influence of moisture on the response of the monitor, and on the influence of the inlet heating on both the volatile ammonium nitrate aerosol and the less volatile ammonium sulphate aerosol. Humidity will only slightly increase the concentrations measured by the beta-dust monitor. At very high humidities (RH over 80 %), positive offsetting (overestimation) of the dust concentration of up to about 3 - 4 ug/m 3 was observed when compared to the <b>reference</b> method. Thus <b>humidity</b> can not explain the aforementioned difference of 25 % at commonly encountered PM 10 levels. The inlet heating of the beta-dust monitor definitively does evaporate volatile ammonium nitrate aerosol. At the maximum set temperature (80 degrees Celcius) of the inlet heating element of the FAG 62 I-N beta-dust monitor, ammonium nitrate will be completely evaporated, and so no ammonium nitrate is measured. At the standard setting of 50 degrees Celcius the ammonium nitrate will partly evaporate, i. e. only part of the ammonium nitrate is measured. In contrast, the TEOM (Tapered Element Oscillation Microbalance) evaporates all the ammonium nitrate. The heating efficiencies of the monitors are clearly different. For this reason they can not be compared when volatile aerosol is present. The less volatile ammonium sulphate aerosol does not experience any influence of inlet heating, so the methods of measurement are comparable in this case...|$|R

Regarding ambient humidity, the chromatographs were calibrated for benzene with dry gases and subjected to measure <b>reference</b> standards with <b>humidity</b> (20  and 80  % at 20  °C). When measuring a concentration of 0. 5  µg m − 3 benzene in air, the levels of humidity tested did not produce any significant interference in measurements taken {{with any of the}} analysers. However, when measuring a concentration of 40  µg m − 3, biases in measurements of 18  and 21  % for each respective analyser were obtained when the relative humidity of the sample was 80  % at 20  °C. Further tests were carried out to study the nature of this interference. Results show that humidity interference depends on both the amount fractions of water vapour and benzene. If benzene concentrations in an area are close to its annual limit value (5  µg m − 3), biases of 2. 2  % can be expected when the absolute humidity is 8. 6  g cm − 3 – corresponding to a relative humidity of 50  % at 20  °C. This can be accounted for in the uncertainty budget of measurements with no need for corrections. If benzene concentrations are above the annual limit value, biases become higher. Thus, in these cases, actions should be taken to reduce the humidity interference, as an underestimation of benzene concentrations may cause a mismanagement of air quality in these situations...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} a {{prototype}} water vapour DIfferential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) instrument with accurate and precise wavelength control of master diode lasers. This stabilization system design {{has a number of}} novel elements that work towards a robust and low-cost autonomous DIAL observatory. With two continuous wave optical wavelengths stabilized, a pulse is formed using an Acousto-Optic Modulator (AOM) to switch light out of each control system to form the transmitted pulse. The control systems employ synchronous reference signal detection that suppresses system perturbations due to the optical switching, facilitating the use of deep dither modulation that aids in accurate stabilization to weak absorption lines. Furthermore, ratiometric detection in the control loop suppresses interference caused by back reflections in optical fiber components, as well as amplitude modulation of the laser diode due to injection current. In our system, the first laser is stabilized to an absorption line of a water vapour cell, while the second is beat-frequency stabilized relative to the first using a passive 16 GHz bandpass filter. This technique can be expanded to stabilize any number of reference lasers with respect {{to each other and to}} an absolute optical standard. The prototype DIAL uses a Tapered optical Amplifier (TA) to form 1 μs 500 mW optical pulses with a repetition rate of > 3 kHz for atmospheric transmission. Fourteen observation experiments were conducted over two years, with water vapour measurements obtained using a calibrated humidity sensor, using three saturated salt solutions as <b>humidity</b> <b>references.</b> The measured pulse extinction was used to calculate the effective absorption cross-section of the transmitter, and therefore used to calculate quantitative water vapour measurements from the DIAL observation data.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} Phase 1 of the ''Air Force Hydrazine Detector Characterization and Calibration Project''. A method for calibrating model MDA 7100 hydrazine detectors in the United States Air Force (AF) inventory has been developed. The calibration system consists of a Kintek 491 reference gas generation system, a humidifier/mixer system which combines the dry reference hydrazine gas with humidified diluent or carrier gas to generate the required humidified reference for calibrations, and a gas sampling interface. The Kintek reference gas generation system itself is periodically calibrated using an ORNL-constructed coulometric titration system to verify the hydrazine concentration of the sample atmosphere in the interface module. The Kintek reference gas is then used to calibrate the hydrazine monitors. Thus, coulometric titration is only used to periodically assess {{the performance of the}} Kintek reference gas generation system, and is not required for hydrazine monitor calibrations. One advantage of using coulometric titration for verifying the concentration of the reference gas {{is that it is a}} primary standard (if used for simple solutions), thereby guaranteeing, in principle, that measurements will be traceable to SI units (i. e., to the mole). The effect of <b>humidity</b> of the <b>reference</b> gas was characterized by using the results of concentrations determined by coulometric titration to develop a humidity correction graph for the Kintek 491 reference gas generation system. Using this calibration method, calibration uncertainty has been reduced by 50 % compared to the current method used to calibrate hydrazine monitors in the Air Force inventory and calibration time has also been reduced by more than 20 %. Significant findings from studies documented in this report are the following: (1) The Kintek 491 reference gas generation system (generator, humidifier and interface module) can be used to calibrate hydrazine detectors. (2) The Kintek system output concentration is less than the calculated output of the generator alone but can be calibrated as a system by using coulometric titration of gas samples collected with impingers. (3) The calibrated Kintek system output concentration is reproducible even after having been disassembled and moved and reassembled. (4) The uncertainty of the reference gas concentration generated by the Kintek system is less than half the uncertainty of the Zellweger Analytics' (ZA) reference gas concentration and can be easily lowered to one third or less of the ZA method by using lower-uncertainty flow rate or total flow measuring instruments. (5) The largest sources of uncertainty in the current ORNL calibration system are the permeation rate of the permeation tubes and the flow rate of the impinger sampling pump used to collect gas samples for calibrating the Kintek system. Upgrading the measurement equipment, as stated in (4), can reduce both of these. (6) The coulometric titration technique can be used to periodically assess the performance of the Kintek system and determine a suitable recalibration interval. (7) The Kintek system has been used to calibrate two MDA 7100 s and an Interscan 4187 in less than one workday. The system can be upgraded (e. g., by automating it) to provide more calibrations per day. (8) The humidity of both the reference gas and the environment of the Chemcassette affect the MDA 7100 hydrazine detector's readings. However, ORNL believes that the environmental effect is less significant than the effect of the <b>reference</b> gas <b>humidity.</b> (9) The ORNL calibration method based on the Kintek 491 M-B gas standard can correct for the effect of the <b>humidity</b> of the <b>reference</b> gas to produce the same calibration as that of ZA's. Zellweger Analytics calibrations are typically performed at 45 %- 55 % relative humidity. (10) Tests using the Interscan 4187 showed that the instrument was not accurate in its lower (0 - 100 ppb) range. Subsequent discussions with Kennedy Space Center (KSC) personnel also indicated that the Interscan units were not reproducible when new sensors were used. KSC had discovered that the Interscan units read incorrectly on the low range because of the presence of carbon dioxide. ORNL did not test the carbon dioxide effect, but it was found that the units did not read zero when a test gas containing no hydrazine was sampled. According to the KSC personnel that ORNL had these discussions with, NASA is phasing out the use of these Interscan detectors...|$|R
