40|$|The Eurozone {{debt crisis}} is {{entering}} its third year. The original {{objective of the}} <b>official</b> <b>sector’s</b> response to the crisis [...] containment [...] has failed. All of the countries of peripheral Europe are now in play; three of them (Greece, Ireland and Portugal) operate under full <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> bailout programs. The prospect of the crisis engulfing the larger peripheral countries, Spain and Italy, has sparked {{a new round of}} <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> containment measures. These will involve active intervention by <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> players such as the European Central Bank in order to preserve market access for the affected countries. This article surveys the options now facing the sovereign debtors and their <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> sponsors. It concludes that there are no painless or riskless options. In the end, the question may come down to this [...] to what extent will the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> sponsors of peripheral Europe be prepared to take on their own shoulders (and off of the shoulders of private sector lenders) {{a significant portion of the}} debt stocks of these countries during this period of fiscal adjustment...|$|R

40|$|If Greece’s debt is unsustainable, {{and most}} {{observers}} (including the IMF) {{seem to think}} it is, the country’s only source of funding {{will continue to be}} <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> bailout loans. Languishing for a decade or more as a ward of the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> is undesirable from all perspectives. The Greeks bridle under what they see as foreign imposed austerity; the taxpayers who fund the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> loans to Greece balk at the prospect of shoveling good money after bad. The question then is how to facilitate Greece’s ability to tap the private capital markets at tolerable interest rates. The IMF’s answer? Write off {{a significant portion of the}} official European loans to Greece or, at the very least, stretch out the grace and repayment periods of those loans until the Crack of Doom. There may be an alternative [...] persuading the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> voluntarily to subordinate its credits, on a targeted basis, to new borrowings by Greece from the private markets. If the alternatives for the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> are to lend the money itself (with the risk that the funds may never be recovered), or to write off their existing Greek loans now as a means of rendering the country presentable to the markets, subordination may be a more politically palatable option...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} argued that low skilled workers have an {{incentive}} to escape to the unofficial sector, if welfare benefits come too close to the net wage in the <b>official</b> <b>sector.</b> Upper limits of welfare benefits often serve as an instrument to ensure a sufficiently high income differential between sectors. However, if unofficial sector income is insecure, and if a change of sectors is costly, an option value of working in the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> has to be taken into account. This option value reduces the incentive for low skilled workers to give up <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> jobs. Upper limits of welfare benefits might therefore be defined less restrictively.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{question}} of whether recent international policy initiatives to facilitate financial rescues in emerging market countries have influenced debtors' incentives to access <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> resources is examined. A country's systemic importance is highlighted as a key characteristic that drives access to <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> finance. The effect of these policy initiatives on IMF programme participation is estimated using a pooled probit model. The safety net implied by policy changes to permit exceptional access is shown to have a greater marginal impact on the use of <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> resources, the more systemically important the debtor country is. The paper's results can be interpreted as offering some support for the presence of debtor-country moral hazard. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{highlight}} some essential features of an approach to the resolution of international financial crises, based upon an assessment {{of what has been}} essential for restoring normal relations between debtors and creditors in recent crises. We focus on the nexus between the debtor and the private creditorsand on what they can do together to solve the collective action problems that bedevil the resolution of crises, recognizing that the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> has a catalytic role to play. This contrasts with the emphasis on the relationship between the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> and the debtor, and on the connection between the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> and the private sector. The essence of a lasting solution is finding practical ways to enable debtors and creditors to conclude and implement explicit and implicit agreements relating to the amount and timing of credit flows and debt repayments. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{role of the}} <b>Official</b> <b>Sector</b> {{institutions}} as lenders in crisis situations has evolved over time, and, particularly {{in the context of}} the current euro area debt crisis, into something akin to a lender of last resort. Institutions like the International Monetary Fund regularly provide distressed sovereigns with lending at affordable rates when private funding has dried up. To be able to provide this kind of emergency relief in a manner that does not result in large losses for their stakeholders, these <b>Official</b> <b>Sector</b> institutions often assert that their lending will have de facto priority over private lending. As a practical matter, since other creditors could not sue to interfere with the sovereign’s choices regarding whom to pay and in what order, de facto priority was all that was needed in the past for the system to function. All of this may have changed since October 2012 as a result of one case: NML Capital v. Republic of Argentina. This case has given private creditors, for the first time in history, a weapon with which they can go after payments made to any other creditor that has equal legal priority to them, potentially including any <b>Official</b> <b>Sector</b> institution without de jure priority. This leads to the question of whether <b>Official</b> <b>Sector</b> institutions’ half-century-old claim of de facto priority for their lending status can be said to have evolved, as a matter of customary international law, to a level of de jure priority...|$|R

40|$|Gentrification and {{neighborhood}} regeneration tends {{to occur in}} cities with tight housing markets, where the demand for housing by middle-income residents generates investments into older deteriorating neighborhood (2001, p. 1; Kirk & Laub, 2010, p. 461). This tight housing market is typical for growing cities (Glaeser e. a., 2006), not for declining cities. Structural decline provides a context where most neighborhoods are declining (unable to regenerate) and any new demand will re-concentrate into specific neighborhoods(Beauregard, 2013, p. 187). So if gentrification {{and neighborhood}} regeneration occur {{in a city that}} experiences severe decline, then the assumption can be made that these neighborhoods must have managed to alleviate the problems that constrain neighborhood regeneration. The aim of this research is to understand how regenerating neighborhoods in Detroit (a city experiencing severe structural decline) alleviate the problems posed by the structural decline. In order to understand how regenerating neighborhoods in Detroit alleviate the problems posed by severe structural decline, two questions require answering, namely: where does the neighborhood regeneration occur and how do the regenerating neighborhoods alleviate the constraining problems posed by the structural decline of the city? This study will use a mixed method, two-step analysis. A citywide analysis with spatial data at census tract level will be conducted with the goal of mapping neighborhood dynamics. Hereafter the focus is on how regenerating neighborhood alleviate the constraining problems that are associated with structural population decline. Data from official statistics will be used and data will be collected through interviews with <b>residents,</b> private <b>sector</b> <b>officials...</b>|$|R

40|$|As tar babies go, {{few have}} proven stickier for the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> than {{the plight of}} private sector lenders trying to recover their bad loans to foreign governments. Inevitably, these lenders have looked to their own governments for succor and {{protection}} against defaulting sovereign debtors. At several points and in several ways {{over the last two}} centuries, the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> has tried to detach itself from this problem, only to discover how relentlessly adhesive it can be. The motivations for the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> to involve itself in the affairs of private lenders have changed over this period. During the nineteenth century, the governments of countries in which the private lenders were located (2 ̆ 2 Creditor Governments 2 ̆ 2) would occasionally champion the cause of their citizen debtholders in response to domestic political pressure from those citizens. In some cases, the Creditor Governments 2 ̆ 7 motives were less benign.

40|$|Government {{expenditure}} can {{be highly}} variable, if used as a countercyclical instrument, or {{as a response to}} economic crises or as a means of rapidly altering other features of the economy. An alternative policy setting is to keep government expenditure changes gradual and modest. It is shown that whether a more discretionary or a more stable usage of government expenditures better attains <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> macroeconomic goals is difficult to determine theoretically, in part because of missed risk effects. But the detecting which policy better meets the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> macroeconomic goals from analysis of historical data or inter-country comparisons suffers from confounding events and institutions. This study offers a fresh insight from laboratory experiments. Our laboratory results favour gradualism in government expenditures, ie support the advocacy of more stable government expenditures offered in Friedman (1969), in Vernengo and Rochon (2000), and in the 2006 German tax change controversy, by that country?s local government sector...|$|R
40|$|This paper’s field {{evidence}} is: (1) many <b>official</b> <b>sectors</b> rapidly {{forget the}} damage of the 1982 - 85 exchange rate liquidity crisis and reverted to what caused that crisis, namely a closed economy clean floats perspective; and (2) the 2006 - 2008 / 9 exchange rate liquidity shock {{would have been}} more drastic but for central bank currency swaps. This evidence is bolstered by a laboratory experiment that incorporates more aspects of real world complexity and more different sorts of <b>official</b> and private <b>sector</b> agents than are feasible in econometric or algebraic investigations and employs a new central bank cooperation-conflict model of exchange rate determination, and is within an umbrella theory of Pope, namely SKAT, the Stages of Knowledge Ahead Theory. SKAT allows for risk effects from stages omitted in normal models, including those from (a) difficulties of agents in evaluating alternatives in a complex environment in which the assumed maximization of expected utility is impossible; and (b) preference for safety and reliability is not trivialized. Our joint field plus laboratory evidence indicates that <b>official</b> <b>sectors</b> should maintain an international exchange rate oriented perspective, or better yet, a single world currency as recommended by Zhou Xiaochuan, head of the People’s Bank of China. To avoid rapid forgetting of havoc from isolationist clean floats and the value of stable exchange rates, a new syllabus, as under the SKAT umbrella, is fundamental in the education of <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> members in order to furnish them with a coherent alternative intellectual framework to current university education that excludes liquidity crises. clean float, managed float, IMF imposed conditions, exchange rate regime, exchange rate volatility, experiment, SKAT the Stages of Knowledge Ahead Theory, monetary policy, transparent policy, exchange rate shocks, central bank cooperation, central bank conflict...|$|R

40|$|The Eurozone <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> has {{declared}} that the belated restructuring of Greek bonds held by private sector creditors in 2012 was a “unique and exceptional” event, never, ever to be repeated in any other Eurozone country. Maybe so. But if this assurance proves in time to be as fragile as the <b>official</b> <b>sector’s</b> prior pronouncements {{on the subject of}} “private sector involvement” in Eurozone sovereign debt problems, any future Eurozone debt restructuring will be surely plagued by the problem of non-participating creditors [...] - holdouts. Indeed, it is the undisguised fear of holdouts and the prospect of a messy, Argentine-style debt restructuring in the belly of Europe that {{has been one of the}} principal motivations for the <b>official</b> <b>sector’s</b> willingness to use its taxpayer money to repay, in full and on time, all of the private sector creditors of Eurozone countries receiving bailouts (the belated Greek restructuring being the sole exception). This article argues that a simple amendment of the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism (the Eurozone’s new bailout facility) could immunize within the confines of the Eurozone the assets of a Eurozone country receiving ESM bailout assistance from attachment by litigious holdout creditors. By thus increasing the difficulties that holdouts would face in enforcing court judgments against a debtor country, the objective of the amendment is to deflate creditor expectations that staying out of an ESM-supported sovereign debt restructuring will lead to a preferential recovery for the holdouts. This measure would also, when taken together with the other steps that the Eurozone has already implemented, substantially replicate the important features of the Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism proposed by the IMF in 2002...|$|R

40|$|The {{policy of}} Euro-area officialdom {{in the period}} 2010 - 2011 was to avoid, at all costs, a default and {{restructuring}} of the sovereign debt {{of a member of}} the monetary union. This policy was motivated principally, but not exclusively, by a fear that the international capital markets, if forcibly reminded of the precarious position of overindebted, growth-challenged members of a monetary union, might recoil generally from lending to European sovereigns. In short, they feared contagion. The only alternative to permitting a debt restructuring, of course, was an <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> bailout. The afflicted countries [...] Greece (until 2012), Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus [...] received loans from <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> sources sufficient to allow them to repay in full their maturing bond indebtedness. Whenever and wherever the crisis erupted, contagion was thus held in check by the blunt technique of smothering the outbreak [...] in money. The proponents of this policy argued at the time, and argue now, that many European sovereigns in 2010 were far too fragile to endure a bout of market contagion. They argued that an acute crisis needed to be averted in order to buy time for the implementation of a gradual but more durable remedy. Had the intervening eight years been used to reduce the debt vulnerabilities of the peripheral (and even some core) states, this argument would now be powerful, indeed invincible. Unfortunately, the opposite happened. Average state indebtedness in Europe today is about one-third larger than it was in 2008. Both the member states and the market saw the reprieve as spreading a reliable <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> safety net under their exposure. So they kept on borrowing and lending. Only the zero interest rate policies of the world’s major central banks during this period have kept debt servicing costs at tolerable levels...|$|R
