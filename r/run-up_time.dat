40|$|Abstract. Waves {{observed}} in the inner surf and swash zones of a fine grained, gently sloping beach are modeled accurately with the nonlinear shallow water equations. The model is initialized with observations from pressure and current sensors collocated about 50 m from the mean shoreline in about i m depth, and model predictions are compared to pressure fluctuations measured at five shoreward locations and to run-up. Run-up was measured with a vertical stack of five wires supported parallel to and above the beach face at elevations of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm. Each 60 -m-long <b>run-up</b> wire yields <b>time</b> series of the most shoreward location where the water depth exceeds the wire elevation. As noted previously, run-up measurements {{are sensitive to the}} wire elevation owing to thin run-up tongues not measured by the more elevated wires. As the wire elevation increases, the measured mean run-up location moves seaward, low-frequency (infragravity) energy decreases, and higher-frequency sea swell energy increases. These trends, as well as the variation of wave spectra and shapes (e. g., wave skewhess) across the inner surf zone, are well predicted by the numerical model. 1...|$|R
40|$|The saving {{potential}} of electrical energy for lighting in housing is very high. With {{the first phase}} of the European regulation on the production and sale of non-effective incandescent lamps having just come into effect, it appears that the use of compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) becomes an important topic. For that reason, this paper lists the major barriers to the spread of compact fluorescent lamps in housing and analyses four of them. 16 compact fluorescent lamps were measured in a laboratory in order to study their warm-up time, their colour shift during warm-up, the impact of their position on their luminous flux and their light output equivalent, in comparison to two incandescent lamps. Measurements show that information given on the lamp package is incomplete and inaccurate. The 1 : 5 rule, currently applied by European manufacturers in order to calculate the power of a CFL replacing an incandescent lamp, is inappropriate. A ratio of 1 : 4 would be better. While it has been observed that the position of the lamp base has an impact of the lamp efficacy, it was impossible to predict which position is best. The <b>run-up</b> <b>time</b> of compact fluorescent lamp can be long and depends on the shape of the lamp. The lamp colour modification during run-up is visible and can be a barrier to the use of compact fluorescent lamps. Tube CFLs should be favored as they have a higher luminous efficacy and take less time to reach their nominal flux. Finally, the measurements did not show any correlation between the lamp price and their quality. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE) is a {{propulsion}} {{device that}} {{takes advantage of}} the pressure rise inherent to the efficient burning of fuel-air mixtures via detonations. Detonation initiation is a critical process that occurs in the cycle of a PDE. A practical method of detonation initiation is Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition (DDT), which describes the transition of a subsonic deflagration, created using low initiation energies, to a supersonic detonation. This thesis presents the effects of obstacle spacing, blockage ratio, DDT section length, and airflow on DDT behavior in hydrogen-air and ethylene-air mixtures for a repeating PDE. These experiments were performed on a 2 diameter, 40 long, continuous-flow PDE located at the General Electric Global Research Center in Niskayuna, New York. A fundamental study of experiments performed on a modular orifice plate DDT geometry revealed that all three factors tested (obstacle blockage ratio, length of DDT section, and spacing between obstacles) have a statistically significant effect on flame acceleration. All of the interactions between the factors, except for the interaction of the blockage ratio with the spacing between obstacles, were also significant. To better capture the non-linearity of the DDT process, further studies were performed using a clear detonation chamber and a high-speed digital camera to track the flame chemiluminescence as it progressed through the PDE. Results show that the presence of excess obstacles, past what is minimally required to transition the flame to detonation, hinders the length and time to transition to detonation. Other key findings show that increasing the mass flow-rate of air through the PDE significantly reduces the <b>run-up</b> <b>time</b> of DDT, while having minimal effect on run-up distance. These experimental results provided validation runs for computational studies. In some cases as little as 20 % difference was seen. The minimum DDT length for 0. 15 lb/s hydrogen-air studies was 8 L/D from the spark location, while for ethylene it was 16 L/D. It was also observed that increasing the airflow rate through the tube from 0. 1 to 0. 3 lbs/sec decreased the time required for DDT by 26 %, from 3. 9 ms to 2. 9 ms. M. S.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was done to}} examine the effects of elevated initial tube pressure in the Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE). Measured parameters were the ignition time, deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) <b>run-up</b> distance, DDT <b>times,</b> and Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) velocity. Mixed with air, three fuels, i. e., aviation gasoline, ethylene, and hydrogen, were tested at various initial pressures and equivalence ratios. An aftermarket automotive ignition system was employed, along with two plasma ignition systems to quantify the benefits of each. Measured results show a reduction in the ignition time of roughly 50 % and in the DDT distance of roughly 30 %, for all three fuels at an initial tube pressure of 3 atmospheres. With atmospheric initial tube pressure, the transient plasma ignition system yielded the shortest ignition times, followed by the thermal plasma ignition system, and lastly the aftermarket automotive ignition system. At roughly 2 atmospheres of initial pressure the thermal plasma ignition system showed no benefit over the aftermarket automotive ignition system. C-J wave speeds have shown to increase with elevated initial pressure, and agree with numerical results.

40|$|Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper empirically {{examines}} {{whether there}} is pre-announcement movement of an acquirer's share price and trading volume prior to the announcement of acquisitions in ways consistent with insider trading. Prior papers focus on insider trading of a target's stock; our paper differs by examining for the first <b>time</b> <b>run-up</b> of acquirer's stock, and considers {{both public and private}} acquisitions, including private-equity backed acquisitions. Research Findings/Insights: Acquisition announcements generate predictable movements in the price of the acquirer's stock. Pre-announcement trading in acquirer's stock {{is more likely to be}} attributable to insider trading when the pre-announcement price changes match the expected post-announcement acquirer returns. Based on a sample of Canadian acquirers and public and private acquisition targets from Canada, the US and 31 other countries over the years 1991 - 2008, we find evidence consistent with insider trading of acquirer's stock. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The evidence consistent with insider trading in this paper is limited to specific situations and is far from generalizable to all types of acquisition announcements. Post-announcement returns are typically negative for high Tobin's q acquirers, stock transactions, and foreign targets, but positive for private equity-backed private targets. We find economically and statistically significant evidence that pre-announcement run-ups move in ways that match these expected post-announcement effects. Pre-announcement movement in acquirer's stock largely depends on the type of acquisition announcement. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings have significant policy implications for the allocation of surveillance efforts for initiating insider trading investigations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. preprin...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} experimental {{investigations of the}} flow on a beach, i. e., the swash, due to solitary waves {{with the objective of}} understanding the flow processes that govern complex coastal hydrodynamics. The bed shear stress is identified as an important quantity and consequently, a shear plate sensor is developed to make accurate measurements of the bed shear stress. Its size is designed to be small enough to give spatially local measurements and its bandwidth high enough to resolve time-varying forcing due to waves. Typically, shear plate sensors are restricted to zero pressure gradient flows because secondary forces {{on the edge of the}} shear plate caused by pressure gradients can introduce large errors. To address this issue, a theory is developed to analyze the pressure distribution at the edges of the shear plate and a new methodology is introduced for correcting for the pressure gradient force. Experimental results are presented that show that this methodology improves the accuracy of the sensor. The swash flow created by solitary waves beyond the stillwater shoreline on a plane, impermeable beach is studied. Measurements of the bed shear stress, flow velocities, water depths, bed pressure and shoreline motion are presented for a wide range of incident solitary waves that span different regimes of wave breaking. The flow evolution due to breaking solitary waves is found to be a gravity-driven flow that is scaled by the initial velocity of the shoreline, which, in turn, is shown to be predicted by measurements of wave height near the stillwater shoreline. Experimental results are presented that show how different wave breaking regimes influence the initial shoreline velocity, the swash flow evolution, the <b>run-up</b> and the <b>time</b> period of the swash. Time-histories of the bed shear stress are also presented, but a new normalization for the peak values of the bed shear stress using the initial shoreline velocity shows the crossshore variation of bed shear stress and the influence of different wave breaking regimes. The effects of bed friction are found to significantly alter the flow in the leading edge of the swash, near the moving shoreline. A theory is developed that considers the leading order dynamical balance in the swash tip, treating it in a bulk sense. Predictions of the shoreline motion from the theory compare very well to the measured shoreline motion. Experiments are also conducted to study the interaction between successive solitary waves incident on a beach. Two cases are examined: a strongly interacting case and a weakly interacting case. The parameters relevant to predicting the strength of interaction between the swash of successive solitary waves are given. Measurements of bed shear stress, bed pressure and velocity are also used to explain the complex boundary layer dynamics that occur in the interaction of the swash flows due to successive waves...|$|R
