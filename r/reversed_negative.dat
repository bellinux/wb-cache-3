Items from the LBDQ-XI 1 Initiating Structure and Consideration subscales were used to create a written description of a fictitious manager. One hundred-fifty subjects, all upper-division business undergrad-uates, were given the written managerial description and then asked to complete a questionnaire containing the twenty Initiating Structure and Consideration items. The managerial descriptions were in two forms (to portray high and low Initiating Structure), and the questionnaires contained items in three forms (all positive-ly worded, all negatively worded, and mixed). The data were evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance and post hoc t-tests. Significant differences in response accuracy were found between the item wording conditions. It was concluded that it may not be advisable to employ reversed (negatively-worded) items to control acquiescence response bias, as such changes may actually impair response accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Background: Methylphenidate (MPH) {{influences}} catecholaminergic signaling. Extant work {{examined the}} effects of MPH on the neural circuits of attention and cognitive control, but few studies have investigated the effect of MPH on the brain’s resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). Methods: In this observational study, we compared rsFC of a group of 24 healthy adults who were administered an oral 45 mg dose of MPH with a group of 24 age and gender matched controls who did not receive MPH. We focused on three seed regions: basal nucleus of Meynert (BNM), locus coeruleus (LC), and ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra, pars compacta (VTA/SNc), each providing cholinergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic inputs to the cerebral cortex. Images were pre-processed and analyzed as in our recent work [1 - 2]. We used one-sample t test to characterize group-specific rsFC of each seed region and two-sample t test to compare rsFC between groups. Results: MPH <b>reversed</b> <b>negative</b> connectivity between BNM and precentral gyri. MPH reduced positive connectivity between LC and cerebellum, and induced positive connectivity between LC and right hippocampus. MPH decreased positive VTA/SNc connectivity to the cerebellum, and reduced negative connectivity to left middle occipital gyrus. Conclusion: MPH had distinct effects on the rsFC of BNM, LC, and VTA/SNc in healthy adults. These new findings may further our understanding of the role of catecholaminergic signaling in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Parkinson’s disease and provide insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of MPH in the treatment of clinical conditions that implicate catecholaminergic dysfunction...|$|E
3000|$|... ‘Non-excludability’ {{of skills}} is {{suspected}} to {{give rise to}} poaching externalities and cause under-investment in training. To substantiate this hypothesis, the paper at hand investigates the relationship between labor turnover and firms’ dedication to continuing vocational training (CVT) exploiting novel survey data on firms in Germany (BIBB-FluCT data, N[*]=[*] 1.238). Regression analyses of these data point at a negative correlation between turnover and CVT incidence in firms with presumably low skill needs (i.e. firms employing workers with no formal vocational education). However, {{the scope of the}} relationship is of limited economic relevance. Merely a minority of firms states to actually forego CVT because of high turnover. Also, the direction of the relationship remains debatable; a <b>reversed</b> <b>negative</b> effect of training on turnover seems unlikely, but not impossible. Eventually, when exclusively focusing on firms providing some CVT (80.6 % of the sampled firms), no negative and significant relationship between turnover and CVT spending emerges in the analyses; this is regardless of whether training is rather specific, or rather general. Overall, these findings do not serve to reinforce the notion of a generally detrimental effect of turnover on CVT. Note however, that a poaching problem may not necessarily become manifest in the relationship between turnover and training. For instance, employers explicitly stating to pay attention to potential training externalities provide CVT with a slightly lower probability than other employers. They might fear a free-rider problem regardless of the actual dimension of turnover. Notwithstanding, even this effect is limited in scope suggesting that only few firms actually withdraw from CVT because of a perceived free-rider problem. Altogether, the evidence available to substantiate the hypothesis of prevalent under-investment in CVT is not very compelling. In fact, payback clauses may help employers turn ‘non-excludable’ skills into part-time private goods and mitigate potential poaching risks. The analyses indicate that payback clauses go along with considerably higher employer-spending on CVT.|$|E

In line with the occupational stressor-strain model, we integrated P-E fit literature with workplace bullying research; where this phenomenon is seen as a form of a social-behavioral strain. We hypothesized that a low fit between the employee and his/her job (P-J), his/her work unit (P-G) as well as her/her organization (P-O) increases workplace bullying over time (i. e. normal causation). Based on scholars’ findings of reversed strain-stress relationships, we also tested a reversed causation where workplace bullying predicts low fit. Finally, we compared these two causal relationships with a reciprocal model in which both misfit and bullying influence each other over time. In all, this study adds to the literature by (1) being among the first to explore the combination of both personal and environmental factors as antecedents of workplace bullying by integrating the P-E fit theoretical lens, (2) applying a cross-lagged design which may indicate causality and (3) extending previous research on P-E fit theory by focusing on misfit and exploring its relation with workplace bullying using the recent multidimensional approach of fit theory.

Research has also shown the importance people attach to talking about their experiential and material purchases, but, previous has not shown whether the particular person we choose to speak to about our purchases affects the level of happiness derived from doing so. Furthermore, research has not explored whether implicit measures, measures of non-conscious happiness, provide a more cohesive measure of happiness Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether participants in the experiential purchase group show higher levels of implicit happiness than participants in the material purchase condition and whether participants allocated to reciprocate a message to personal acquaintances will show a difference in implicit happiness levels as opposed to those allocated to speak to a non-personal acquaintances. Method: Participants (N= 56) at time 1 completed an online questionnaire, which included demographics and a measure of social economic status. At time 2 participants completed a word category judgment task, in which participants were presented with positive and negative affective target words. Participants were then asked to pull the joystick towards them if they were presented with a positive word and push the joystick away from them if they were presented with a negative word. This trial was then <b>reversed</b> <b>negative</b> words. Findings: For implicit happiness there was no main effect between effects of participant purchase allocation (experiential vs. material) however, for implicit happiness there was a statistically significant main effect of message recipient (acquaintance vs. non acquaintance) Results further revealed statistically significant interaction between participants purchase allocation (experiential vs. Material) and message recipient (acquaintance vs. non acquaintance) on implicit happiness scores.

The current study explores this question and examines the causal relationship between the different types of person-environment (P-E) misfit and both targets’ and perpetrators’ reports of workplace bullying. In line with the occupational stressor-strain model, we integrated P-E fit literature with workplace bullying research; where this phenomenon is seen as a form of a social-behavioral strain (Baillien, De Cuyper, & De Witte, 2011). We hypothesized that a low fit between the employee and his/her job (P-J), his/her work unit (P-G) as well as her/her organization (P-O) increases workplace bullying over time (i. e. normal causation). Based on scholars’ findings of reversed strain-stressor relationships (Tang, 2014), we also tested a reversed causation where workplace bullying predicts low fit. Finally, we compared these two causal relationships with a reciprocal model in which both misfit and bullying influence each other over time. In all, this study adds to the literature by (1) being among the first to explore the combination of both personal and environmental factors as antecedents of workplace bullying by integrating the P-E fit theoretical lens, (2) applying a cross-lagged design which may indicate causality and (3) extending previous research on P-E fit theory by focusing on misfit and exploring its relation with workplace bullying using the recent multidimensional approach of fit theory.

40|$|The {{potential}} difference across the protoplasm of impaled cells of Halicystis is {{not affected by}} increase of oxygen tension in equilibrium with the sea water, nor with decrease down to about 1 / 10 its {{tension in the air}} (2 per cent O 2 in N 2). When bubbling of 2 per cent O 2 is stopped, the P. D. drifts downward, to be restored on stirring the sea water, or rebubbling the gas. Bubbling 0. 2 per cent O 2 causes the P. D. to drop to 20 mv. or less; 1. 1 per cent O 2 to about 50 mv. Restoration of 2 per cent or higher O 2 causes recovery to 70 or 80 mv. often with a preliminary cusp which decreases the P. D. before it rises. Perfusion of aerated sea water through the vacuole is just as effective in restoring the P. D. as external aeration, indicating that the direction of the oxygen gradient is not significant. Low O 2 tension also inhibits the <b>reversed,</b> <b>negative</b> P. D. produced by adding NH 4 Cl to sea water, 0. 2 per cent O 2 bringing this P. D. back to the same low positive values found without ammonia. Restoration of 2 per cent O 2 or air, restores this latent negativity. At slightly below the threshold for ammonia reversal, low O 2 may induce a temporary negativity when first bubbled, and a negative cusp may occur on aeration before positive P. D. is regained. This may be due to a decreased consumption of ammonia, or to intermediate pH changes. The locus of the P. D. alteration was tested by applying increased KCl concentrations to the cell exterior; the large cusps produced in aerated solutions become greatly decreased when the P. D. has fallen in 0. 2 per cent O 2. This indicates that the originally high relative mobility or concentration of K+ ion has approached that of Na+ in the external protoplasmic surface under reduced O 2 tension. Results obtained with sulfate sea water indicate that Na+ mobility approaches that of SO 4 — in 0. 2 per cent O 2. P. D. measurements alone cannot tell whether this is due to an increase of the slower ion or a decrease of the faster ion. A decrease of all ionic permeability is indicated, however, by a greatly increased effective resistance to direct current during low O 2. Low resistance is regained on aeration. The resistance increase resembles that produced by weak acids, cresol, etc. Acids or other substances produced in anaerobiosis may be responsible for the alteration. Or a deficiency of some surface constituent may develop. In addition to the surface changes there may be alterations in gradients of inorganic or organic ions within the protoplasm, but there is at present no evidence on this point. The surface changes are probably sufficient to account for the phenomena...|$|E

40|$|Foi estudado o efeito de priming negativo associado à supressão do distrator palavra-cor de Stroop (Estudo 1), à supressão do local (Estudo 2) e à identidade do distrator (Estudos 3 e 4). No Estudo 1 constatou-se que a prática prévia em palavras-cor eliminou o efeito da ordem das condições experimentais sobre o índice de priming negativo. No Estudo 2, o efeito de priming negativo foi observado somente no hemicampo direito. A execução concorrente de uma tarefa verbal eliminou os efeitos de lateralidade, mas o efeito de priming negativo permaneceu significante. Estes achados são discutidos em termos de processamento interhemisférico sob condições que exigiriam maior controle da atenção. Os estudos 3 e 4 apresentam tarefas de comparação de pares de dígitos. A versão de papel e lápis da tarefa de comparação de dígitos permitiu avaliar de maneira simples e rápida o efeito de priming negativo. A versão computadorizada, revelou uma interação entre os componentes espacial e de identidade. Ambos os grupos de adultos jovens e idosos revelaram priming negativo nas tarefas de Stroop e de localização espacial. Nas tarefas de identificação do alvo somente os adultos jovens mostraram efeito de priming negativo. Os presentes achados são consistentes com a proposta de mecanismos inibitórios diferenciados na supressão da identidade e de localização espacial. The {{development}} of sensitive and simple tests {{for the assessment}} of the negative priming effect has theoretical relevance to the elucidation of selective attention models, and also practical and potential clinical implications. The negative priming effect has been regarded as an index of inhibitory attentional processing and was proposed for the detection of syndromes that involve cognitive impairment. Diminished negative priming was reported in studies of individual differences, developmental stage, and clinical populations. However, evidences suggest that tasks requiring responses to the color feature, location or object identity of the stimuli may comprise distinct types of negative priming tasks. The following studies presents data for computerized and paper-and-pencil tasks to examine negative priming for Stroop color-word, location and identity distractors. All four studies take into account aging effects across the tasks. For comparisons between age-groups, proportional performance scores (ratio) were used. A first study employed a reading-sheet Stroop-color-word task, in which the participant is asked to name the colors of the ink in which words with incongruent color names have been printed. Color-word interference is indicated by increased time to complete the conflicting color-word condition compared with a nonconflicting condition with patches of color or strings of Xs. The greater strength of the interference, when the target ink-color of the present stimulus is the distracting color name of the previous stimulus, is attributed to the negative priming effect. A pilot experiment showed that the order of the list conditions containing unrelated and related stimuli affected the negative priming index. The analysis of data demonstrated that a practice trial in color naming of conflicting color-words before the color-word conditions eliminated the effect of the order of the lists. In addition, there was a reliable Stroop reverse interference after practice in color naming, as indicated {{by the fact that the}} incongruent color-ink affected post-test word-reading, whereas it had no effect in the pretest word-reading. With practice procedure, older and younger subjects did not differ in their proportional interference scores, whereas the negative priming and reverse effects were increased for older adults. Study 2 examined the negative-priming effect in a spatial localization task under single- and dual-task conditions. The task required the subject to detect the location of a target letter, O, while ignoring a distractor letter, X, when it was present. Significant negative-priming effects were observed under both task conditions, with increased response times for trials in which target location had matched the location of the distractor on the preceding. The magnitude of the negative priming effect was not different for older and younger adults. The performance in the single-task condition showed laterality effects with a right visual field advantage for control and target-alone trials, but not for related trials. In consequence, in the single-task condition, negative priming was observed only for targets displayed in the right hemifield. However, a concurrent digit span task, with a load level that had shown no affect on the dual-task coordination capacity, eliminated the laterality effects, but the negative priming effect remained. These results are considered as neuropsychological evidence that interhemispheric processes may operate under more controlled conditions. Studies 3 and 4 examined negative priming by using an identity-based task that required participants to select the greater of two-digits display or the digit that was paired with an asterisk. Study 3 presents data for a computerized version of the task. Negative-priming was expressed as a slowing in the time to name the digit that had been ignored in the preceding trial, compared to control trials with consecutive targets and distractors always different. Analysis of data revealed that negative priming was reliable only for younger adults, and only when target probe and distractor prime appeared at the same location, suggesting that suppression for location of distractor was underpinning the negative priming effect. However, response latencies for the control trials were facilitated when the target probe and the distractor prime shared the same location. Thus, local suppression affected negative priming for attended distractors with a cost in the response latency for ignored-repetition trials and with a gain in response latency for control trials when the locus of target-probe and distractor-prime was the same. In contrast, older adults performance showed local suppression for both ignored-repetition and control trials. This may explain the lack of negative priming for older adults in the digit-comparison task. Study 4 presents data for a new paper-and-pencil version of the digit-comparison task to obtain a practical measure of negative priming that do not require cumbersome technical equipment. In that task, subjects were asked to circle digits that were paired with asterisks and the greater of two digits in a series of digit pairs listed on a sheet of paper. For younger participants, but not for older participants, the time to complete the sheet with related pairs was slower than for unrelated pairs. In addition, the reduced scores of negative priming in older adults were associated with the lowest sustained attention scores from Toulouse-Piéron test. These results suggest that older adults performance in the digit-comparison task were mainly related to flexibility and sustained attentional scores, and the lower sustained attentional coefficient seemed to be the best predictor of diminished or <b>reversed</b> <b>negative</b> priming in older adults. Younger adults showed reliable negative priming across all tasks. In contrast, older adults showed negative priming in Stroop and spatial tasks, when compared with younger subjects performance, but reduced negative priming in identity suppression tasks. The findings are consistent with neurophysiological and behavioural evidence that identity and location suppressing may rely on separate inhibitory mechanisms, and that not all of these processes are weakened by factors associated with age...|$|E
