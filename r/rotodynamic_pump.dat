50|$|A <b>rotodynamic</b> <b>pump</b> {{with one}} single shaft that {{requires}} two mechanical seals, this pump uses an open-type axial impeller. It's often called a Poseidon pump, {{and can be}} described as a cross between an axial compressor and a centrifugal pump.|$|E
50|$|A {{turbopump}} is a propellant pump {{with two}} main components: a <b>rotodynamic</b> <b>pump</b> and a driving gas turbine, usually both {{mounted on the}} same shaft, or sometimes geared together. The purpose of a turbopump is to produce a high-pressure fluid for feeding a combustion chamber or other use.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} pump-fed engines, the Rutherford uses a <b>rotodynamic</b> <b>pump</b> to {{increase}} the pressure from the tanks to that needed by the combustion chamber. The use of a pump avoids the need for heavy tanks capable of holding high pressures and the high amount of gas needed to pressurize them and replaces them with a pump.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rotodynamic</b> <b>pumps</b> (or dynamic pumps) are {{a type of}} {{velocity}} pump {{in which}} kinetic energy {{is added to the}} fluid by increasing the flow velocity. This increase in energy is converted to a gain in potential energy (pressure) when the velocity is reduced prior to or as the flow exits the pump into the discharge pipe. This conversion of kinetic energy to pressure is explained by the First law of thermodynamics, or more specifically by Bernoulli's principle.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{a liquid}} pump can't simply draw air. The feed {{line of the}} pump and the {{internal}} body surrounding the pumping mechanism must first be filled with the liquid that requires pumping: An operator must introduce liquid into the system to initiate the pumping. This is called priming the pump. Loss of prime is usually due to ingestion of air into the pump. The clearances and displacement ratios in pumps for liquids, whether thin or more viscous, usually cannot displace air due to its compressibility. This {{is the case with}} most velocity (<b>rotodynamic)</b> <b>pumps</b> — for example, centrifugal pumps.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>rotodynamic</b> <b>pump</b> is a kinetic {{machine in}} which energy is {{continuously}} imparted to the pumped fluid {{by means of}} a rotating impeller, propeller, or rotor, in contrast to a positive displacement pump in which a fluid is moved by trapping a fixed amount of fluid and forcing the trapped volume into the pump's discharge. [...] Examples of rotodynamic pumps include adding kinetic energy to a fluid such as by using a centrifugal pump to increase fluid velocity or pressure.|$|E

50|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, in 1915 the factory, along {{with most of the}} staff (roughly 2000 workers in 1914), was evacuated to Kremenchug by tsarist authorities. There the equipment of the factory was captured by the Reds {{in the course of the}} Russian Civil War and only a small part was brought back to Warsaw after the Polish-Bolshevist War and the Peace of Riga. The factory in Warsaw was nevertheless rebuilt and continued to prosper as one of principal industrial centres of the country. Between 1921 and 1931 the factory was modernised and further expanded, extending the line of products by addition of internal combustion engines. The Lilpop factory produced train engines, railway and tramway cars, bus bodies, lorry undercarriages (in cooperation with Hanomag), water turbines, industrial washing machines, <b>rotodynamic</b> <b>pumps</b> and many other products.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} demands placed on extravehicular activity (EVA) for the International Space Station (ISS) assembly and maintenance, along with planned lunar and Martian missions, {{the need for}} increased human productivity and capability becomes ever more critical. This is most readily achieved by reduction in space suit weight and volume, and increased hardware reliability, durability, and operating lifetime. Considerable {{progress has been made}} with each successive generation of space suit design; from the Apollo A 7 L suit, to the current Shuttle Extravehicular Mobile Unit (EMU) suit, and the next generation Constellation Space Suit Element (CSSE). However, one area of space suit design which has continued to lag is the fluid pump used to drive the water cooling loop of the Primary Life Support System (PLSS). The two main types of fluid pumps typically used in space applications are <b>rotodynamic</b> <b>pumps</b> (pumping is achieved through a rotary vaned impeller) and displacement pumps (which includes rotary and diaphragm pumps). The rotating and moving parts found in the pumps and electric motor add significantly to the susceptibility to wear and friction, thermal mismatch, and complexity of the pumps. Electric motor-driven pumps capable of achieving high operational reliability are necessarily large, heavy, and energy inefficient. This report describes a development effort conducted for NASA by Lynntech, Inc., who recently demonstrated the feasibility of an electrochemically-driven fluid cooling pump. With no electric motor and minimal lightweight components, an electrochemically-driven pump is expected to be significantly smaller, lighter and achieve a longer life time than conventional <b>rotodynamic</b> and displacement <b>pumps.</b> By employing sulfonated polystyrene-based proton exchange membranes, rather than conventional Nafion membranes, a significant reduction in the actuator power consumption was demonstrated. It was also demonstrated that these membranes possess the necessary mechanical strength, durability, and temperature range for long life space operation. The preliminary design for a Phase II prototype pump compares very favorably to the fluid cooling pumps currently used in space suit portable life support systems (PLSS). Characteristics of the electrochemically-driven pump are described and the benefits of the technology as a replacement for electric motor pumps in mechanically pumped single-phase fluid loops (MPFLs) is discussed...|$|R

40|$|To {{explore the}} effect of virtual mass force, the {{unsteady}} two-phase flow in a multiphase <b>rotodynamic</b> <b>pump</b> impeller was numerically simulated, where the inlet gas void fraction was 4. 9 %, 14. 9 %, and 25. 2 %, respectively. The drag force and the virtual mass force were accounted for and the cases with and without the latter one were both analyzed for comparison. The {{results show that the}} trajectories of the gas bubbles are influenced by the virtual mass force evidently in the inlet extended region. Due to {{the effect of}} virtual mass force, some gas will firstly move to the shroud before accumulating in the hub region of the impeller. The characteristic of the pump head was discussed and the results demonstrate that the virtual mass force can decrease the pump head and lead to its fluctuation. In addition, the comparison between the steady and unsteady simulation shows that the virtual mass effect can be found only by unsteady simulation...|$|E
40|$|Short CourseThis short course {{deals with}} {{cavitation}} {{in general and}} <b>rotodynamic</b> <b>pump</b> cavitation in particular. It gives {{an introduction to the}} subject matter and provides insights in particulars like cavitation inception, 3 % head drop, and 40, 000 hours impeller life, as well as NPSH scaling laws. It further devotes attention to the effect of dissolved gases, and thermal suppression (i. e. thermodynamic effect) when pumping hot water or hydrocarbons. For (hydrocarbon) mixtures it will also be outlined that cavitation intensity can be expected to be far less than with pure fluids. With regard to numerical prediction capabilities the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) shall be discussed, and empirical correlations will be presented. Furthermore, some guidance for cavitation damage diagnosis shall be given, including prediction of cavitation erosion rate, and assessment of impeller life expectancy. Also addressed are suction specific speed, and how this dimensionless group tends to cause bias and give rise to misunderstanding and misinterpretation. In this context also the corrected suction specific speed will be presented, and the concept of suction energy will be discussed. Furthermore, NPSHR criteria and establishing NPSHA margins will be outlined. As special modes of operation, the effect of fluid transients will be highlighted, demonstrating that such may yield excessive cavitation. Furthermore, a qualitative ?Cavitation Modes Map? will be presented, which reflects five decades of fundamental cavitation observations and experimental facts (laboratory research and field data) published in the years 1941 ? 1991. In particular, the typical shape of the erosion curve versus flow ? seemingly peculiar, but fully supported by cavitation physics for all types of rotodynamic pumps ? is discussed by highlighting an absolutely striking departure from the shape of conventional NPSHR 3 % curve (universally used for decades) at part flows. This deviation, which has been fully ignored in the past and is today still often neglected at various stages (pump specifications and selection, pump design, and field root cause analysis) is a primary reason of the majority of cavitation pump problems, as will be explained in this short course. The course further includes four Field Case Studies demonstrating the practical application of ?Cavitation Failure Analysis ? Methodology (Diagnosis and Solution Strategy) ?, covering low and high energy, single- and multistage, pumps...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 35 For {{the last}} 20 to 30 years rotordynamic tools with ever {{increasing}} simulation capabilities {{have been available}} {{for the design of}} multistage centrifugal pumps. Nevertheless, customers sometimes still specify criteria developed in times predating such tools. Rotordynamic criteria for static behavior, dynamic behavior, and stresses are discussed. A first set of criteria for the rotor design is based on static deflection. There are several methods used in the industry, typically static deflection related to annular seal clearance, which is of no relevance for the dynamic behavior of the rotor. The term ?stiff rotor design? is often used in conjunction with these static criteria. Bolleter and Frei (1993) have shown that only relatively small pumps with small relative bearing spans and thick rotors may be considered statically stiff. A second set of criteria is related to the dynamic behavior of the rotor. Unlike compressor shafts, the fluid forces in the annular seal gaps and balance piston have a great impact on the lateral rotordynamics of multistage centrifugal pumps. These interaction forces support the shaft at various locations between the journal bearings (Lomakin effect) and tend to increase the rotor?s natural frequencies while simultaneously providing modal damping. For this reason, the API Standard 610, Tenth Edition (2004) defines combined frequency versus damping acceptance criteria for lateral analyses. Acceptance criteria like the ones defined in API 610 (2004) should be applied for the design of multistage centrifugal pumps. As for the static deflection, only very short pumps with thick shafts and operating at low speed can be considered dynamically stiff. In general multistage centrifugal pumps are dynamically flexible. Stress criteria for the shaft are also of high importance. Various safety factors need to be fulfilled, ranging for fatigue and yielding in notches to gross yielding of the cross sections. Static and alternating forces have to be considered. Alternating bending stresses result from rotation around a static deflection line, taking into account the support provided by the annular seals. Using sample calculations, the significance of the design parameters of shaft diameter and number of stages with regards to lateral rotordynamics is discussed. A range of barrel type pumps (API: BB 5 type) has been designed applying dynamic criteria. <b>Rotodynamic</b> <b>pump</b> design limits, depending on rotor speed and fluid density, are presented in diagrams. The limits for a BB 5 -pump according to API 610 criteria depend on the number of stage and the density of the fluid. These diagrams also indicate the effectiveness of swirl brakes below a certain product density level in order to reduce destabilizing annular seal cross-coupled stiffness values and therefore increase the threshold of instability...|$|E
40|$|Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) are {{mechanical}} pumps used {{to off-load}} a deceased heart, primarily in late stage {{congestive heart failure}} patients. VAD employment may facilitate cardiac recovery, but most often provides time before a suitable heart transplant can be found. Lately, long term use VAD systems have been introduced {{as an alternative to}} a heart transplant. Traditionally, design of VADs has employed either displacement based pump technologies or radial-flow pumps, also known as <b>rotodynamic</b> <b>pumps.</b> A displacement pump induces a mechanical force on a fluid contained within a defined space, hence giving it motion. Radial-flow pumps impart momentum to a fluid, most often by placing a rotating device in the fluid. This thesis introduces a novel pumping concept, combining features from both displacement and radial-flow pumps. A first prototype, the VivicorTM pump, has been designed, fabricated and evaluated In Vitro, the results reported in this thesis. The In Vitro evaluation of the VivicorTM pump provides evidence of a pump with mechanical self-regulation based on pump pre-load level, much like a displacement pump. The VivicorTM pump also displays pulsating outflow in combination with an inflow both during pump systole and diastole. The latter provides potential advantages over traditional displacement pumps as smaller cannulae or catheters can be used, facilitating miniaturization. Continuos filling throughout the pumping cycle also require less pressure to be exerted on the fluid, compared to displacement pumps, limiting the risk of mechanical damage to the pumped fluid. The In Vitro evaluation has also provided further insights on necessary design modifications in the second-generation VivicorTM prototype, currently planned. The VivicorTM pumping technology is highly interesting for further development and evaluation for use in ventricular assist applications. QC 2010112...|$|R

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{importance of}} pulsatility is a recurring topic of debate in mechanical circulatory support. Lack of pulsatility {{has been identified}} as a possible factor responsible for adverse events and has also demonstrated a role in myocardial perfusion and cardiac recovery. A commonly used method for restoring pulsatility with <b>rotodynamic</b> blood <b>pumps</b> (RBPs) is to modulate the speed profile, synchronized to the cardiac cycle. This introduces additional parameters that influence the (un) loading of the heart, including the timing (phase shift) between the native cardiac cycle and the pump pulses, and the amplitude of speed modulation. In this study, the impact of these parameters upon the heart-RBP interaction was examined in terms of the pressure head-flow (HQ) diagram. The measurements were conducted using a rotodynamic Deltastream DP 2 pump in a validated hybrid mock circulation with baroreflex function. The pump was operated with a sinusoidal speed profile, synchronized to the native cardiac cycle. The simulated ventriculo-aortic cannulation showed that the level of (un) loading and the shape of the HQ loops strongly depend on the phase shift. The HQ loops displayed characteristic shapes depending on the phase shift. Increased contribution of native contraction (increased ventricular stroke work [WS]) resulted in a broadening of the loops. It was found that the previously described linear relationship between WS and the area of the HQ loop for constant pump speeds becomes a family of linear relationships, whose slope depends on the phase shift...|$|R
40|$|The Hydraulic Institute {{has just}} {{completed}} the task of developing a new ANSI/HI standard on <b>Rotodynamic</b> (Centrifugal) Slurry <b>Pumps</b> covering nomenclature, definitions, applications, and operation. The standard provides examples of all {{the different types of}} pumps available and has an extensive section on definitions. Slurries and their effect on performance and wear are covered. A slurry service class is established which then is used to limit velocities and head produced per pump to give acceptable wear. A special section deals with mechanical seals and a new method for determining flange loads is presented and guidelines are given for commissioning, start-up etc. The head limits and the performance derating are of special interest when centrifugal slurry pumps are applied to thickened tailings and paste-like slurries. For Newtonian liquids, the Hydraulic Institute's Viscosity Correction Method (ANSI/HI 2004) provides a procedure widely used for viscous effects on the performance. For the homogeneous flow of viscous slurries, the new slurry standard refers to an applicable viscosity to use with the method and to "consult the pump manufacturer for guidance regarding non-Newtonian slurry pump performance. "Experimental performance results are presented here and applied to the viscosity correction method for a simulated tailings product slurry characterized by a fully sheared yield stress of about 100 Pa, evaluated from pipeline data.

40|$|Industry {{has lately}} turned {{the focus on}} subsea {{processing}} {{as a tool to}} enable new developments where the technology needs are increasing. Multiphase pumping (boosting) {{plays a key role in}} the increase of production and in oil and gas recovery. In addition, the technology has shown to be more profitable and environmental friendly compared to conventional methods, due to longer tie-back distances and the potential of zero gas flaring. However, the presence of gas leads to unwanted flow regimes generating additional performance losses and system instabilities. Safe and reliable operation requires a deep understanding of the physical mechanisms causing the unstable behavior. The main objective of the thesis has been to explore the multiphase booster instability and surging mechanisms to give an improved insight of the main influencing flow mechanisms. A literature study has been performed, reviewing previous studies considering surging in multiphase pumps. In addition, phase slip and other related mechanisms have been studied through bubble tracking and available correlations. Data processing and direct flow visualization with a high-speed camera have been employed in experimental tests. Additionally, a data processing system have been utilized in order to relate pressure pulsations to flow mechanisms. An extensive test campaign has been conducted through the test facility in the Thermal Energy Department Laboratory at NTNU. The facility features a mixed-flow <b>rotodynamic</b> single-stage multiphase <b>pump,</b> reproducing the full scale, MultiBooster, by Aker Solutions at Tranby (Oslo). The transparent pump casing permits an excellent optical access of the hydraulic channels, which allows a visual study of the flow field behavior. All tests have been performed at atmospheric inlet pressure, where gas volume fractions, flow rates, and rotational speeds are the varying parameters. Characteristic multiphase flow phenomena have been analyzed through flow visualization, bubble tracking, and data processing. The phenomena have shown to affect the machine negatively, due to the increased pressure variations and channel obstructions. The experimental work indicates that, bubble coalescence, gas pockets, phase slip, empty-of-gas channels, and recirculation zones plays a major role during the unsteady machine operation. The phenomena show an intermittent behavior, dependent on the operating condition and the specific pump design. As the surging is approached, the overall flow field irregularities show to intensify, accompanied with strong pressure variations. Moreover, this correlation has formed a foundation for detecting the surging inception, and will be presented in this thesis...|$|R
