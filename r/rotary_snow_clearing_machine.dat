50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the maintenance of}} all locomotives, some Bahnbetriebswerke are also responsible for looking after special duty trains. The most important units are breakdown trains (for re-railing derailed rolling stock) and <b>rotary</b> <b>snow</b> ploughs. There are also fire fighting trains to enable fires in the area to be put out as quickly as possible. And for the smooth running of a Bahnbetriebswerk tractors and shunters are needed in order to move wagons and locomotives that are unable to move under their own power. Finally almost every Bahnbetriebswerk has a variety of special vehicles.|$|R

50|$|Ever {{since the}} Gem 4/4 electro-diesels were commissioned, their main area of {{operation}} has been the Bernina Railway, where they are often to be seen working in a multiple unit combination with railcars.

50|$|The {{jet engine}} both melts and blows the <b>snow,</b> <b>clearing</b> the tracks faster than other methods. While {{offering}} considerably greater {{power in a}} relatively lightweight machine, this method is much more expensive than traditional snow removing methods. In Russia, the high cost is partially negated by utilizing retired military jet engines, such as the Klimov VK-1.|$|R

50|$|The {{focus of}} the Neustadt/Weinstrasse Railway Museum is {{vehicles}} of the former state railways in southern Germany. For example, the two remaining examples of steam locomotives {{from the time of}} the Palatine Railways are preserved here still in their original state: the T 1 Schaidt and a Palatine T 5. In addition a replica of an express train locomotive from the early railway period, (Die Pfalz), a Crampton engine, is on display. Vehicles from the Deutsche Reichsbahn era are the E 17 and ET 11. In addition the museum still has a range of passenger train coaches and goods wagons of the former Baden and Royal Württemberg State Railways, as well as the later standard DRG wagons. There is also a 1942 steam-powered <b>rotary</b> <b>snow</b> plough in the fleet.|$|R
