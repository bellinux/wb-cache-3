40|$|Background: Stroke {{patients}} conventionally {{undergo a}} substantial part of their <b>rehabilitation</b> in <b>hospital.</b> <b>Services</b> have been developed that offer patients early discharge from <b>hospital</b> with <b>rehabilitation</b> at home (early supported discharge [ESD]). We have assessed the effects and costs of such services. Methods: We did a meta-analysis of data from individual patients who took part in randomised trials that recruited patients with stroke in hospital to receive either conventional care or any ESD service intervention that provided rehabilitation and support in a community setting with the aim of shortening the duration of hospital care. The primary outcome was death or dependency at the end of scheduled follow-up. Findings: Outcome data were available for 11 trials (1597 patients). ESD services were mostly provided by specialist multidisciplinary teams to a selected group (median 41...|$|R

40|$|Several {{reports have}} pointed to the {{unevenness}} in the UK of services for rehabilitation after head injury. A {{study was conducted in}} the Eastern Region of England to define the key stages in recovery and rehabilitation, by an iterative process of questionnaire, interview and consensus conference. Findings were translated into a draft set of maps showing current availability of services which were revised after feedback. Working groups then developed a set of definitions and classification codes for each stage of rehabilitation which were likewise disseminated for feedback. The maps were then redrafted to correspond with the definitions together with a flowchart of potential head injury rehabilitation services. The definitions were piloted at a regional neurosurgery unit and a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>hospital.</b> Core <b>services</b> for neurorehabilitation region-wide were found to be variable and uncoordinated with fragmented and inequitable allocation of resources. The definitions and mapping system that emerged from this study should facilitate the design of care pathways for patients and identify gaps in the services...|$|R

40|$|A {{retrospective}} chart review {{indicated that}} 56 % of patients admitted to an acute-care hospital {{for treatment of}} multiple sclerosis could have been managed in a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>hospital</b> setting. Using retrospective case matched analysis, {{it was found that}} the per diem cost of acute-hospital care was $ 625, compared with $ 364 for a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>hospital.</b> A significant reduction in hospital cost might be achieved depending on the length of stay in a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>hospital.</b> During the index <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>hospital</b> stay, no patient required transfer to an acute-care hospital.
