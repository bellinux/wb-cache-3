Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can <b>rotate</b> anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, {{in the same manner as}} the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to <b>rotate</b> around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth <b>rotate,</b> it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars <b>rotate</b> around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E

Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to <b>rotate</b> in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{extends the}} upright face {{detection}} framework proposed by Viola et al. 2001 to handle in-plane <b>rotated</b> faces. These haar-like features work inefficiently on <b>rotated</b> faces, so this paper pro-poses {{a new set}} of ± 26. 565 ◦ haar-like features which can be calculated quickly to represent the features of <b>rotated</b> faces. Unlike previous face detection techniques in training quantities of samples to build different <b>rotated</b> detectors, with these new features, we address to build different <b>rotated</b> detectors by <b>rotating</b> an upright face detector directly so as to achieve in-plane <b>rotated</b> face detection. This approach is selected because of its computational efficiency, simplicity and training time saving. This proposed method is tested on CMU-MIT <b>rotated</b> test data and yields good results in accuracy and maintains speed advantage. ...|$|R

40|$|To avoid {{resonance}} {{problems in}} <b>rotating</b> turbomachinery components such as impellers, {{it is of}} paramount importance to determine the natural frequencies of these parts when they are under operation. Nevertheless, most of these <b>rotating</b> structures are inaccessible and in some cases submerged and confined. To measure the natural frequencies of submerged impellers from the <b>rotating</b> frame is complicated, because sensors have to be well fixed, withstand with large pressure and centrifugal forces. Furthermore, the signals have to be transmitted to the stationary frame. For this reason it may be advantageous to measure the natural frequencies with sensors placed on the casing. In this paper, the analysis of <b>rotating</b> disk-like structures submerged and confined has been performed from the stationary frame. Previously, an analytical model to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the disk from the <b>rotating</b> frame is presented. Once natural frequencies and mode shapes are obtained in the <b>rotating</b> frame, the transmission to the stationary frame has been deduced. A <b>rotating</b> disk test rig has been used for the experimental study. It consist of a <b>rotating</b> disk that has been excited from the <b>rotating</b> frame with a piezoelectric patch and it response has been measured from both <b>rotating</b> and stationary frame. Results shows that for <b>rotating</b> submerged structures in heavy fluids such as water, not only the structural modes of the <b>rotating</b> part are different than for <b>rotating</b> structures in air, but also the transmission from the <b>rotating</b> to the stationary frame.
