50|$|With {{unemployment}} around 16% {{and many}} {{jobs in the}} informal sector, Georgia undertook a far-reaching reform of labour regulation. The new Labour Code was adopted on 17 December 2010. The new law eases restrictions on the duration of term contracts {{and the number of}} overtime hours and discards the premium required for overtime work. It also eliminates the requirement to notify and get permission from the labour union to fire a <b>redundant</b> <b>worker.</b> The new law provides for 1 month’s severance pay at least, replacing complex rules under which required notice periods depended on seniority and the manager had to write long explanations to labor unions and the relevant ministry. In general, new regulation makes Georgian labor market much more flexible.|$|E

Although Vietnam has made a significant progress in changing economic structure in which the share of agricultural contribution in GDP has dramatically decreased {{over the last two}} decades, the employment structure changed slowly. Consequently, majority of labour force is still in the agricultural sector. The economic reform has failed to shift <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> away from agricultural sector since most of the country’s investment has been allocated to capital-intensive industries. Therefore, policy adjustments are needed to absorb more <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> from agricultural sector and improve living standards for rural households. ...|$|R

The paper classifies total World Bank lending into three broader categories that consist of different forms of labor and income support. The findings show that {{the total number of}} such loans more than doubled from 1994 - 98, and most of Bank's labor assistance goes towards long-term capacity building to develop the institutional framework needed to support <b>redundant</b> <b>workers.</b> Training, labor market mobility and severance pay programs were the three major labor programs used most frequently. The paper examines regional differences in total amount of labor assistance and regional difference in using the particular type of labor assistance.

5000|$|During {{the early}} Eighties, the Socialists {{introduced}} the [...] "congé de conversion" [...] ("conversion leave"), which received widespread publicity in 1984 when redundancy measures were introduced for the shipbuilding and steel industries. These combined the traditional tool of early retirement for <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> {{over the age}} of fifty with a [...] "conversion leave" [...] for others. These leaves suspended (but did not break) the work contract for a period of up to two years, and during this time the individual received 70% of their previous wage together with retraining in a new occupation. After the retraining was over, workers were promised two job offers. In 1985, the Fabius Government universalised the congé. The revamped congé de conversion offered <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> offered <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> 65% of their previous salary (in line with the benefits for early retirement and unemployment compensation) and a training period of 4-10 months.

[...] A year earlier, in 1984, the Fabius government established the travaux d'utilite collective (TUC) programme to prepare school leavers for professional life. This scheme offered unemployed youth between the ages of 16 and 21 sixteen (extended to 25 in 1985) the opportunity to work half time in a public sector job.|$|R

30|$|The {{main idea}} of the top- 1 {{approximation}} algorithm utilizes the greedy strategy to choose the best worker w, who can bring the maximum gain to the current partial team g. Algorithm 2 illustrates the top- 1 approximation algorithm. We first initialize a empty team g in line 1. In lines 2 – 4, when g cannot satisfy the requirement of skills of the task t, denoted by E_t, the algorithm selects a worker w with the maximum ratio of the gain and price for the current team. The function MAXITEM(.) {{is used to calculate}} the number of skills in E_t that can be covered by a specific team. In line 5, since g may contain free-rider workers, we have to refine the team to eliminate <b>redundant</b> <b>workers.</b> Notice that we only need to scan all workers in the team g by the selected order when the these <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> are deleted.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{earnings}} and employment consequences of involuntary job loss {{during the crisis}} years of the 1990 s among assistant and auxiliary nurses, the two occupational groups that by far were those {{in the public sector}} that experienced the largest number of job losses. While public service employment traditionally has been perceived as secure and permanent, Sweden witnessed far-reaching restructuring of the public sector and job loss truly became a reality for public sector employees during these years. The estimates show an immediate annual earnings loss of on average about 15 000 SEK and long-term losses of 7 000 SEK. An analysis of the distributional effect shows that the job losses did not affect the whole earnings distribution but only the lower part. This suggests that a few bore the whole loss from downsizing but most went on unaffected at least considering earnings and employment. From a policy perspective this points to the importance to early identify these <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> and to develop targeted policies improving their situation instead of general policies to all <b>redundant</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

30|$|What about {{activation}} {{strategies in}} disability insurance (DI) programs? Since an important aim {{of these strategies}} is to raise the overall level of labor supply, it may be argued that such policies should be scaled down in periods of insufficient labor demand. Why make costly efforts to provide job opportunities for workers with disabilities when even persons without health problems cannot find work? There is an important caveat to this argument however, namely that the moral hazard problems in disability insurance programs probably become more severe in cyclical downturns. The reason is that they then serve as an alternative channel for downsizing (Rege et al. 2009), particularly in welfare states with strong employment protection legislation. It may of course be argued that it doesn’t really matter whether <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> receive unemployment or disability benefits. However, {{in the long term}} it may matter quite a lot, since disability insurance programs – in contrast to unemployment insurance programs – tend to be absorbing. Due to the lack of incentives and the almost complete lack of eligibility reconsiderations, very few workers return to the labor market after having claimed time-unlimited disability benefits. Hence, the adverse long-term effects of a cyclical downturn is likely to be larger the more <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> were channeled into disability insurance rather than unemployment insurance during the crisis.|$|R
40|$|The {{de-industrialisation}} of the UK economy {{caused by}} globalised international markets, advancements {{in technology and}} production with changing consumer demands have made much of what was ‘traditional’ manufacturing redundant; {{this has led to}} industrial restructuring or even collapse, resulting in mass job redundancies. Market and industrial pressures have intensified since the late 1990 s, culminating in the symbolic collapse of MG Rover in 2005 in addition to other key producers in the West Midlands, which represented the end of mass automotive production in the region (Donnelly et al. 2012). This came alongside various geographical, political and economic factors, including the restructuring of regional development agencies, prolonged industrial decline and a period of national economic recession, which presented challenges for any recovery. This thesis examines more precisely the closure of the commercial vehicle manufacturer LDV in 2009, once a part of the larger conglomerate British Leyland. The closure further reinforced the decline in UK automotive manufacturing until that point. The research involves the corporate collapse of LDV and the local government reaction to the closure and the following re-employment pathways of the redundant LDV workforce. The research continues the discussion of plant closures and the issues that <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> face when engaged in the labour market during economic recession. In particular, the thesis contribution employs a qualitative approach to examine the difficulties faced by the office tier, or ‘white collar’, workers who possess relatively high skills and who regarded as flexible and less vulnerable workers within the labour market. Yet this research exposes that highly skilled specialist workers are themselves also subject to unique issues when adjusting to the labour market. This topic is covered through the concept of worker trajectories: the research illustrates the unique employability issues and job precariousness that highly skilled workers can experience. The research concludes that the ability of highly skilled <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> to adapt effectively requires local job recovery strategies to implement short- and long-term policies with an emphasis on better job search and network development for individuals to sustain a resilient economy, and to mitigate the effects of plant closure upon <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> and maintain high skills within the region...|$|R
