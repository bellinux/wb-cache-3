5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might <b>respond,</b> <b>that</b> is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
5|$|With his {{contract}} set to expire after the 2007 season, Rivera sought an extension with the Yankees during spring training. Team management refused to negotiate near {{the start of}} the season, prompting him to <b>respond</b> <b>that</b> he would consider free agency {{at the end of the}} year. In April, Rivera blew his first two save opportunities, compiled two losses, and surrendered nine earned runs in innings pitched. Concerned sportswriters attributed his struggles to infrequent use, as the Yankees presented him with few situations to enter a game. Rivera saved 30 of his next 32opportunities and posted a 2.26ERA over the final five months of the season. In addition, he passed John Franco for third place on the all-time saves list with his 425th career save. Still, Rivera finished 2007 with closer career worsts in earned runs (25), hits (68), and ERA (3.15), and his 30saves in 34opportunities were his second-lowest total since 1997. After the Yankees were eliminated from the playoffs in the opening round, Rivera stated his intentions to test the free agent market. He initially indicated that his decision of where to sign would be influenced by whether long-time manager Joe Torre was re-signed. Although Torre did not return, Rivera remained with the Yankees by agreeing to a three-year, $45million contract, making him the highest-paid reliever in baseball history.|$|E

25|$|According to game theory, because {{starting}} {{a nuclear war}} was suicidal, no logical country would shoot first. However, if a country could launch a first strike that utterly destroyed the target country's ability to <b>respond,</b> <b>that</b> might give that country the confidence to initiate a nuclear war. The object of a country operating by the MAD doctrine is to deny the opposing country this first strike capability.|$|E
25|$|Senators face reelection {{every six}} years, and representatives every two. Reelections {{encourage}} candidates {{to focus their}} publicity efforts at their home states or districts. Running for reelection can be a grueling process of distant travel and fund-raising which distracts senators and representatives from paying attention to governing, according to some critics although others <b>respond</b> <b>that</b> the process is necessary to keep members of Congress in touch with voters.|$|E

25|$|The fanciers of {{designer}} dogs <b>respond</b> <b>that</b> all modern dog breeds were created from earlier breeds {{and types of}} dogs through {{the same kind of}} selective breeding that is used to create designer dogs. The Toy Poodle was bred down in size from larger poodles, most likely by crossing with various very small Bichon types, such as the Maltese and Havanese. Most of the modern breeds have ancestries that include various older dog types and breeds; see individual breed articles for details of the origin of each breed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} {{raised by}} union supporters is that unionized workers will spend their higher wages, driving {{economic growth and}} creating new jobs. Union opponents <b>respond</b> <b>that</b> {{this is an example}} of the broken window fallacy; union supporters assume that money is more valuable in the hands of unionized workers than in the hands of whoever else would obtain it in the union's absence. There is some evidence that this is not a fallacy, as greater wealth equality seems to be correlated with greater economic growth. Union supporters counter that unions, if organized without violence or government help, are part of the free market; if unions can win higher wages for their workers without coercion, those wages are legitimate.|$|E

25|$|Some critics view {{evolutionary}} psychology {{as a form}} of genetic reductionism and genetic determinism, a common critique being that {{evolutionary psychology}} does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases. Evolutionary psychologists <b>respond</b> <b>that</b> they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations). The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior.|$|E
25|$|It emerges {{that this}} {{messenger}} was formerly a shepherd on Mount Cithaeron, {{and that he}} was given a baby, which the childless Polybus then adopted. The baby, he says, was given to him by another shepherd from the Laius household, who had been told {{to get rid of the}} child. Oedipus asks the chorus if anyone knows who this man was, or where he might be now. They <b>respond</b> <b>that</b> he is the same shepherd who was witness to the murder of Laius, and whom Oedipus had already sent for. Jocasta, who has by now realized the truth, desperately begs Oedipus to stop asking questions, but he refuses and Jocasta runs into the palace.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of VSU {{note that}} not all {{economic}} benefits are maximised individually (i.e., there are beneficial externalities). For example, student unions have frequently subsidised food outlets on campus, arguing that people get utility from bars crowded with fun-seeking university students – an environment that might {{not exist in the}} absence of subsidy. Proponents <b>respond</b> <b>that</b> students who don't make use of the crowded outlet are paying for others' food and drink. Another more serious example relates to advocacy provided by students associations. Many students face difficult personal and financial problems whilst studying. Advocacy services are not used by 100% of students, yet all students pay for the service to be available. Some students argue that they are paying for other students to use the advocacy service even though they have not needed to use it.|$|E

25|$|Such {{a stance}} of {{dividing}} blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components {{to be poured}} out onto the ground has led to criticism from {{organizations such as the}} Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood. Witnesses <b>respond</b> <b>that</b> blood as the fluid per se is not the real issue. They say the real issue is respect and obedience regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the respect has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.|$|E
25|$|A {{frequent}} {{critique of}} the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now. While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert {{that it is not}} impossible. Part of the {{critique of the}} scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environments of Evolutionary Adaptation. Some critics have argued that researchers know so little about the environment in which Homo sapiens evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative. Evolutionary psychologists <b>respond</b> <b>that</b> they do know many things about this environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{opponents of}} VSU liken fees to council rates or taxes – an {{unpleasant}} but necessary payment for those services which by necessity must be communally provided. VSU proponents <b>respond</b> <b>that</b> student unions are fundamentally not governments {{and should not}} have the right to compel money from people; they also argue that most union services – food, childcare, second-hand bookshops, etc. – already operate in the private sector, sometimes at cheaper prices than the subsidised equivalents. Opponents note that facilities such as playing fields and emergency student loans would have to be taken up by universities since they would almost certainly not be available through the private sector. Opponents of VSU cite that the nature of advocacy and representation fall beyond what could be put to market forces, they further state that the nature of such services prevent them from effectively functioning from within the university, therefore Student Associations must be entrusted to carry out these services.|$|E
