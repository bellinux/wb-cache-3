(2008); the protein of pale yellow truffle T. subglobosum (10.96 %) was {{higher than that of}} black truffles T. melanosporum (7.5 – 8.7 %). Saltarelli et al. (2008) evidenced white truffle T. magnatum from Italy are rich source of proteins (20.5 – 24 %). With regard to desert truffle, Sawaya et al. (1985) compared the compositional difference amongst three Saudi Arabian truffles including two black desert truffles Gibaah and Kholeissi (both are Terfezia claveryi according to Hussain and Al-Ruqaie 1999) and one white truffle Tirmania nivea (Zubaidi). They found these truffles’ protein contents ranged from 19.59 to 27.18 %, and the white truffle T. nivea had the highest protein content. These remind us that white truffles probably contain more protein.|$|E
