40|$|Abstract Background Filamin is an actin binding protein {{which is}} {{ubiquitous}} in eukaryotes and its basic structure is well conserved – an N-terminal actin binding domain {{followed by a}} series of <b>repeated</b> <b>segments</b> which vary in number in different organisms. D. discoideum is a well established model organism for the study of signalling pathways and the actin cytoskeleton and as such makes an excellent organism in which to study filamin. Ddfilamin plays a putative role as a scaffolding protein in a photosensory signalling pathway and this role is thought to be mediated by the unusual <b>repeat</b> <b>segments</b> in the rod domain. Results To study the role of filamin in phototaxis, a filamin null mutant, HG 1264, was transformed with constructs each of which expressed wild type filamin or a mutant filamin with a deletion of one of the <b>repeat</b> <b>segments.</b> Transformants expressing the full length filamin to wild type levels completely rescued the phototaxis defect in HG 1264, however if filamin was expressed at lower than wild type levels the phototaxis defect was not restored. The transformants lacking any one of the <b>repeat</b> <b>segments</b> 2 – 6 retained defective phototaxis and thermotaxis phenotypes, whereas transformants expressing filaminΔ 1 exhibited a range of partial complementation of the phototaxis phenotype which was related to expression levels. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that filamin lacking any of the <b>repeat</b> <b>segments</b> still localised to the same actin rich areas as wild type filamin. Ddfilamin interacts with RasD and IP experiments demonstrated that this interaction did not rely upon any single <b>repeat</b> <b>segment</b> or the actin binding domain. Conclusion This paper demonstrates that wild type levels of filamin expression are essential for the formation of functional photosensory signalling complexes and that each of the <b>repeat</b> <b>segments</b> 2 – 6 are essential for filamins role in phototaxis. By contrast, <b>repeat</b> <b>segment</b> 1 is not essential provided the mutated filamin lacking <b>repeat</b> <b>segment</b> 1 is expressed at a high enough level. The defects in photo/thermosensory signal transduction caused by the absence of the repeats are due neither to mislocalisation of filamin nor to the loss of RasD recruitment to the previously described photosensory signalling complex. </p...|$|R

For example {{a model of}} global temperature considers both bursts (i. e. solar fare) and periods (i. e. sunspot cycle) of the sun. Algorithms for finding these primitives are required to be fast to process large datasets. Because exact algorithms that guarantee the optimum solutions are very slow for their immense computational requirements, existing algorithms find primitives approximately. This thesis presents efficient exact algorithms for two primitives, time series motif and time series shapelet. A time series motif is any <b>repeating</b> <b>segment</b> whose appearances in the time series are too similar to happen at random and thus expected to bear important information about {{the structure of the}} data. A time series shapelet is any subsequence that describes a class of time series differentiating from other classes and thus can be used to classify unknown instances. We extend the primitives for different environments. We show exact methods to find motifs in three different types of time series data. They are the in-memory datasets suitable for batched processing, the massive archives of time series stored in hard drives and finally, the streaming time series with limited storage. We also describe an exact algorithm for logical-shapelet discovery that combines multiple shapelets to better describe complex concepts. We use efficient bounds to the goodness measures to increase the efficiency of the exact algorithms. The algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than the trivial solutions and successfully discover motifs/shapelets of real time series from diverse sensors such as EEG, ECG, EPG, EOG, Accelerometers and Motion captures. We show applicability of these algorithms as subroutines in high-level data mining tasks such as summarization, classification and compression...|$|E

When elements repeat within the sequence, however (e. g., a-b-c-d-b-e), the same element belongs to two separate “contexts, ” and a more complex sequence encoding mechanism is required to differentiate between the two contexts. Some neural structure must form sequential-context-dependent, or “differential, ” representations of the two contexts (i. e., b as an element of “a-b-c ” as opposed to “d-b-e”) to allow the correct choice to be made after the repeated element. To investigate the possible role of hippocampus in complex sequence encoding, rats were trained to remember repeated-location sequences under three conditions: (1) reward was given at each location; (2) during training, moveable barriers were placed at the entry and exit of the <b>repeated</b> <b>segment</b> to direct the rat and were removed once the sequence was learned; and (3) reward was withheld at the entry and exit of the <b>repeated</b> <b>segment.</b> In the first condition, hippocampal ensemble activity did not differentiate the sequential context of the <b>repeated</b> <b>segment,</b> indicating that complex sequences with <b>repeated</b> <b>segments</b> can be learned without differential encoding within the hippocampus.

These strains lack parts of the repeating sequences of the toxin A gene (tcdA) and are toxin A negative by commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Here, we report the prevalence of the toxin A variant strains in 334 patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea in France. The <b>repeating</b> <b>segment</b> of the tcdA gene (1, 200 bp) was amplified by PCR using the primers NK 9 and NK 11 (H. Kato et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 36 : 2178 - 2182, 1998). In the case of amplified fragments of unexpected size, the entire tcdA gene was studied by PCRs A 1, A 2, and A 3 (Rupnik et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 36 : 2240 - 2247, 1998), and strains were characterized by serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and PCR ribotyping. By PCR with primers NK 9 and NK 11, C. difficile variant strains were detected in 2. 7 % of patients. Several variant types were found. A deletion of approximately 1, 700 bp was observed in six strains from five patients. These strains belonged to serotype F and were characterized by the same pulsotype and the same PCR ribotype.

40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is a {{single-celled}} parasite infecting a {{wide range}} of birds and mammals worldwide. In these warm-blooded animals, it usually causes no symptoms but can cause neurological, ocular, and reproductive problems, especially if the immune system is compromised or if a mammal becomes infected while pregnant. Seroprevalence in some Inuit communities is much higher than in other parts of North America. Inuit are thought to be exposed through handling and consumption of Arctic wildlife. As T. gondii are known to produce oocysts in the intestines of felids, and wild and domestic felids are rare in the tundra regions of the Arctic, there are other transmission mechanisms occurring. Previous work has demonstrated that migratory birds are a potential source for introduction of toxoplasmosis, and that Arctic foxes are likely infected through carnivory. The aim of this research was, first, to determine major routes of transmission of T. gondii in a terrestrial Arctic ecosystem at Karrak Lake in the Queen Maud Gulf Bird Sanctuary, Nunavut, in Arctic foxes and Arctic-nesting geese. We also compared molecular and serological techniques used to detect and characterize T. gondii. Finally, reindeer were experimentally infected to determine effects and tissue distribution of the parasite. This work will address important food safety and public health aspects by looking for T. gondii in two key species, geese and caribou, which are important food sources in northern communities. Caribou populations are declining throughout the Arctic. Knowing what effects this parasite can have on caribou gives us information on whether it causes health problems or not. As for Arctic foxes, looking into seroprevalence and mode of transmission will help us understand how this parasite persists in this particular ecosystem. We hypothesize that T. gondii is maintained via vertical transmission (i. e., female foxes to the pups), in addition to transmission by carnivory. To test this hypothesis, and to determine if any changes in serostatus occurred throughout multiple years, we collected and tested blood samples from live-trapped adult and juvenile Arctic foxes. Samples were analyzed in laboratories by serological methods (Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT), Modified Agglutination Test (MAT)) developed and improved previously. We also tested wild goose samples serologically, using filter papers, thoracic fluids and fluids from frozen hearts, and via 2 different methods of DNA extraction followed by PCR for a 529 bp <b>repeating</b> <b>segment.</b> The magnetic capture technique allowed use of up to 100 g of tissues compared to ≤ 25 mg with traditional DNA extraction methods, thus increasing the chance to find true positives in heart and brain samples. Finally, we investigated the pathology and tissue distribution of T. gondii in experimentally infected reindeer to determine which tissues pose the greatest risk for human exposure. Our work suggests that T. gondii is present in newborn Arctic foxes, supporting the hypothesis of vertical transmission. We also proposed that subsequent litters can be infected congenitally, not just litters of females infected {{for the first time in}} pregnancy, which are pregnant females without T. gondii antibodies at the moment of infection. This can have important implications regarding reproductive success. Changes in serostatus in adult Arctic foxes throughout the years were also noticed, with a higher rate of exposure and seroconversion in mature foxes, as well as a shift of serostatus from positive to negative in an older fox. These findings give us a better understanding of how the parasite can be transmitted and maintained in a terrestrial Arctic ecosystem. Magnetic capture succeeded in detecting higher levels of T. gondii in reindeer tissues than traditional DNA extraction, suggesting the use of this technique when large amount of tissues are available. Toxoplasma gondii was not detected in wild goose tissues (i. e., brain, heart) following conventional PCR and sequencing, possibly due to low infection rates in Ross’s and Lesser Snow Geese, and low sensitivity of the conventional PCR. Antibodies against T. gondii were found serologically in both goose species using body fluids, but not following a chloroform clean-up centrifugation on the samples used to remove fat particles. The quality of samples at the time of serological testing as well as the type of samples (body fluids instead of serum) could explain the negative results after using the chloroform centrifugation. We successfully performed MAT for the first time in the field, suggesting that the use of this technique in remote field areas and northern communities is feasible. Finally, T. gondii was successfully detected in commonly consumed muscles of experimentally infected reindeer. This result gives us important insight on a potential mechanism for food-borne transmission of T. gondii in northern communities and raises concern regarding the safety of caribou meat in naturally infected animals. Subtle behavioral changes were observed in reindeer after infection, as well as respiratory problems in one animal. Numerous studies have demonstrated that T. gondii is capable of vertical transmission in a variety of hosts, including humans. High prevalences of the parasite in host populations that are geographically isolated from definitive felid hosts, as is the case in arctic fox populations, are intriguing scenarios to explore the importance of vertical transmission. It may also help to explain the extent of genetic diversity and the relative roles of sexual recombination (oocysts) vs clonal propagation (asexual reproduction). Moreover, using seroprevalence studies, Arctic foxes can be used as sentinels for T. gondii in this specific ecosystem. This research will provide information about how Arctic peoples become exposed through important food sources (i. e., geese and caribou) and the health effects of toxoplasmosis in threatened wildlife. We need more information on the significance of food-borne routes of transmission of T. gondii in the North in order to implement culturally appropriate and effective local prevention measures...|$|E
