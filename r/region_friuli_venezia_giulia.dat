The results indicated that Hydropower, Wind power, Solar PV (all roofs), Solar PV (parks), and Biogas could replace 30. 6 % of current gross energy consumption, with Wood heating contributing to an additional 7. 1 %.

40|$|Italy is {{considered}} at low incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), and {{the occurrence of}} human cases of TBE appears to be geographically restricted to the north east of the country. However, most information to date derives from case series, with no systematic data collection. To estimate incidence rates (IR) and spatial distribution of TBE cases, we conducted a retrospective study in north-eastern Italy. Data were collected through the infectious disease units and public health districts of three <b>regions</b> (<b>Friuli</b> <b>Venezia</b> <b>Giulia,</b> Trentino Alto Adige and Veneto) between 2000 and 2013. Overall, 367 cases were identified (IR: 0. 38 / 100, 000). The cases' median age was 56 years and 257 (70 %) were male. Central nervous system involvement was reported in 307 cases (84 %). Annual fluctuations in case numbers occurred, with peaks in 2006 and in 2013, when 44 and 42 cases were respectively observed. A strong seasonality effect was noted, with {{the highest number of}} cases in July. In terms of geographical location, three main endemic foci with high TBE IR (> 10 / 100, 000) were identified in three provinces, namely Belluno (Veneto <b>region),</b> Udine (<b>Friuli</b> <b>Venezia</b> <b>Giulia)</b> and Trento (Trentino Alto-Adige). When investigating the whole study area in terms of altitude, the IR between 400 and 600 [*]m was greater (2. 41 / 100, 000) than at other altitudes (p< 0. 01). In conclusion, the incidence of TBE in Italy is relatively low, even considering only the three known affected regions. However, three endemic foci at high risk were identified. In these areas, where the risk of TBEV infection is likely high, more active offer of TBE vaccination could be considere...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the finite mixture models {{approach}} o clustering of high dimensional data.

Finite mixture models allows a flexible approach to the statistical modeling of phenomena characterized by unobserved heterogeneity in different fields of applications. In this analysis we consider the model based clustering on mixture models and compare it with the classical k-means approach.

40|$|Intermodal {{transport}} needs {{improvements in}} order to meet the freight transport demand. Information exchange and cooperation among stakeholders are essential to achieve this goal. This paper illustrates a feasibility study aiming to implement an ICT system for logistics in an Italian <b>region,</b> <b>Friuli</b> <b>Venezia</b> <b>Giulia,</b> {{in order to}} support intermodal transport connecting the regional stakeholders, in particular the infrastructure managers. The feasibility study includes an analysis of the stakeholders ’ requests. It turns out that, although the stakeholders show interest for the system, their requirements are often minimal; moreover, they are unwilling to share information even with their customers. Their interest focuses on four topics: acquiring real time information from the infrastructures, managing hazardous materials, introducing use of electronic documents and sharing among transport operators tracking and tracing information. The feasibility study addresses each of these topics with a specific function. In particular, it is considered here the first function: acquiring real time information from the infrastructures. A case study from the port of Trieste is analyzed to investigate how the ICT system may smooth the logistics operations.

40|$|In a {{previous}} work, a spatial shift-share model was proposed. That model {{took into account}} both the activity information of the territory and {{the legal status of}} the enterprises working inside it. The model presented, which had a twofold form, developed and came together into a unique formulation. The present proposal is able to suitably catch the neighborhood’s effect on the variation of an economical variable measured on the examined territory. This paper does not intend to repropose the aspects regarding the theoretical evolution of the first model. Instead, the principal goal is to make a comparison ceteris paribus between the results obtained with the new model and those reached through the application of the previous one, so to highlight the role of the association between the two factors included inside the decomposition. Italian industrial districts represent the economical context for this application since each model proposed is applicable to each district case without modifying the theoretical structure which is related, to the neighborhood definition.

40|$|Aims: Colorectal {{cancer is}} the most common cancer in Italy, where {{screening}} programs are now in place all over the country. We conducted a research to assess whether the use and outcomes of colorectal cancer screening are different between diabetics, who are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, and non-diabetics in the Italian Northeastern <b>region</b> <b>Friuli</b> <b>Venezia</b> <b>Giulia.</b> Methods: This was a retrospective population-based study which used the administrative databases of the regional health information system as the sources of information. For the two screening rounds 2010 - 2011 and 2012 - 2013, we compared adherence to the program and the results of the fecal occult blood tests and of the colonoscopy among diabetic and non-diabetic residents. Results: Overall, more than 300, 000 persons were invited for the colorectal cancer screening in each round. Of them, approximately 8. 8 % were diabetic. In the regional population, adherence to the screening program was significantly lower among diabetics than among non-diabetics. The proportion of positive fecal occult blood tests was higher among diabetics than among non-diabetics. Among diabetics, the detection rate for initial and advanced adenomas was higher than among non-diabetics, whereas no clear pattern was observed for the detection of cancers. Conclusion: In Friuli Venezia Giulia, efforts should be directed at improving the management of diabetic patients and at reducing the inequalities in access to care due to this comorbidity...|$|E
