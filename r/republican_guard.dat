5|$|The Iraqi Army had between 350,000 and 500,000 {{soldiers}} in theater, organized into 51 divisions, including eight <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> divisions. <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> units normally received the newest equipment; for example, {{most of the}} estimated 1,000 T-72 tanks in the Iraqi Army {{on the eve of}} the war were in <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> divisions. The Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (KTO) also included nine heavy divisions, composed mostly of professional soldiers, but with weapons of a generally lesser grade than those issued to the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nine American {{artillery}} battalions {{would fire}} thousands of rounds and rockets during this particular engagement. At least six Hammurabi <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> battalions were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1991 the 24th Infantry Division would {{participate}} in a controversial engagement against the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> Hammurabi Division. It would take place well after the ceasefire. It {{is known as the}} Battle of Rumaila. Iraqi <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> forces were engaged within the Hammar Marshes of the Tigris–Euphrates river system in Iraq while attempting to reach and cross the Lake Hammar causeway and escape northward toward Baghdad on Highway 8. Most of the five-mile-long Iraqi caravan of several hundred vehicles was first boxed into a kill zone and then {{in the course of the}} next five hours systematically devastated by the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, including its armored forces, by AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, and nine artillery battalions.|$|E

50|$|Because {{of their}} elite status <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> {{received}} better equipment and uniforms than their regular Army counterparts, and could often {{be identified by}} distinctive markings or items of head dress. Members of the regular <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> conventionally wore a scarlet-colored triangle insignia on both shoulders of their uniforms (sometimes backed with white material to form a white border {{around the edge of}} the triangle); they also wore black berets as did some Army personnel, but as a distinctive marking a scarlet ribbon was often sewn to the right of the National cap badge to distinguish bravery in combat and/or loyalty to the Hussein regime. The Special <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> wore a maroon beret with the national eagle device, and a special variation of the triangle shoulder insignia in maroon with green Arabic lettering. The bright red qardoon (shoulder cord) also distinguished Republican Guards; a similar cord with green and red bands was worn by the Special <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards.</b>|$|R
5|$|This devastating {{aerial attack}} assured the {{destruction}} of the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> Forces Hammurabi Division and the remnants of several other infantry divisions. Four companies within 1st Battalion, 24th Aviation Regiment would be awarded Valorous Unit Award Citations.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of FARDC members are land forces, {{but it also}} has a small air force and an even smaller navy. Together the three services may number between 144,000 and 159,000 personnel. In addition, there is a presidential force called the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard,</b> but it and the Congolese National Police (PNC) {{are not part of the}} Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Most non-Republican Guard armored units had older tank designs, {{mainly the}} T-55 or its Chinese equivalents, the Type 59 and Type 69. The {{remaining}} 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts. These divisions were deployed to channel the Coalition's forces {{through a number}} of break points along the front, allowing the Iraqi Army's heavy divisions and the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> units to isolate them and counterattack. However, the Iraqis left their western flank open, failing to account for tactics made possible by the Global Positioning System and other new technologies.|$|E
5000|$|During the DRC presidential {{elections}} in 2011, the UN reported that <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards,</b> {{accompanied by the}} Congolese national police and intelligence agency, shot at protestors, killing 33 and wounding another 83. Another 265 were arrested, many {{reported that they were}} tortured. The UN stated it will work with the country's judiciary to investigate the incident and try those who were responsible. It was reported that <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> opened fire at crowds of opposition members, who rallied near an airport where their leader was expected to be arriving. In the Katanga Province, it was reported that an attack on a polling station in Lubumbashi left several people dead who were caught in a fire fight between the assailants and <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards.</b> Also around that time, 30 people were arrested by the GR as around 60 tried to break into President Kabila's residence in Kinshasa. It was reported that some had military training, but the idea that they were angry <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> was denied by the country's information minister. The GR fought them off successfully, though the fighting also spread to a nearby army base. Kabila called it a [...] "coup attempt".|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the invasion, the pro-Saddam {{forces in}} Anbar–the Ba'ath Party, the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard,</b> the Fedayeen Saddam, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service–remained intact. Saddam hid in Ramadi and Hīt in early April. Other pro-Saddam forces were able to {{relocate}} from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons, where they set up headquarters. The nucleus of the insurgency in its first few months was formed from the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria. In contrast to the looting throughout Baghdad {{and other parts of the}} country, Ba'athist headquarters and homes of high-ranking Sunni leaders were relatively untouched. The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province, General Mohammed Jarawi, formally surrendered to elements of the 3rd Infantry Division at Ramadi on 15 April 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Nayyouf gave an {{interview}} to the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf in which he claimed that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein hid his arsenal {{of weapons of mass}} destruction in Syria before the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. Nayyouf claimed that officers of the Special <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> organized the smuggling in collaboration with relatives of Bashar al-Assad including Dhu al-Himma Shalish and Assif Shoakat, who is also CEO of Bhaha, an import/export company owned by the Assad family. Nayyouf identified sites near the cities of al-Baida, Tell Sinan, and Sjinsjar as alleged holding sites for Iraqi WMDs.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 1991, 12 French Jaguars bombed Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait; {{three were}} damaged {{in the attack}} but all {{returned}} to base. On 26January, RAF Jaguars and Tornadoes raided several Silkworm missile batteries in Kuwait to encourage the perception of an imminent amphibious invasion to liberate the country. On the 30th, two RAF Jaguars destroyed a Polnochny-class landing ship with rockets and cannon. The Iraqi <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard,</b> entrenched on the Kuwait-Saudi border, were subjected to a continuous intensive bombing campaign for weeks to demoralise them, allied Jaguars forming {{a portion of the}} delivering aircraft. The Jaguars also performed valuable reconnaissance of the combat area for Coalition forces. Both nations' Jaguars were withdrawn from the region in March 1991, at the end of Desert Storm.|$|E
50|$|During the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard's</b> Lions, {{most from the}} Medina Division, were deployed around Baghdad to attempt a last-ditch defense of the Baath regime.|$|R
5000|$|South of Baghdad a {{mass grave}} was {{uncovered}} which is thought to contain 60,000 Shia victims of the 1991 popular uprising which was brutally quelled by Saddam's <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards.</b>|$|R

5|$|It {{should be}} made clear also that Joseph Kabila does not trust the military; the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> is the only {{component}} he trusts. Major General John Numbi, former Air Force chief, now inspector general of police, ran a parallel chain of command in the east to direct the 2009 Eastern Congo offensive, Operation Umoja Wetu; the regular chain of command was by-passed. Previously Numbi negotiated the agreement {{to carry out the}} mixage process with Laurent Nkunda. Commenting on a proposed vote of no confidence in the Minister of Defence in September 2012, Baoudin Amba Wetshi of lecongolais.cd described Ntolo as a 'scapegoat'. Wetshi said that all key military and security questions were handled in total secrecy by the President and other civil and military personalities trusted by him, such as John Numbi, Gabriel Amisi Kumba ('Tango Four'), Delphin Kahimbi, and others such as Kalev Mutond and Pierre Lumbi Okongo.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November, the Germans {{launched}} an assault from Podgorica towards Nikšić {{to clear a}} corridor through which the German forces in Montenegro could withdraw towards the Reich. This operation {{was supported by the}} Italian 86th National <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> (GNR) Battalion. Around 1,200 of Đurišić's Chetniks were deployed on the flanks of the attack. Twelve days of fierce fighting resulted in significant casualties, and the Germans made no progress, losing Boka in the meantime. On 25 November, the Germans decided to abandon this line of attack and attack Kolašin. Chetniks under Đurišić's command continued to fight alongside the Germans. After reaching Kolašin, Đurišić's force separated from the Germans to relieve pressure on the German route of march and headed towards Bosnia, marching {{to the west of the}} Germans and bypassing Pljevlja. During the breakout and subsequent withdrawal, both the Germans and Chetniks were subjected to frequent attacks by the Allies.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} major {{personnel}} reshuffle on 12 June 2007. FARDC chief General Kisempia Sungilanga Lombe {{was replaced with}} General Dieudonne Kayembe Mbandankulu. General Gabriel Amisi Kumba retained his post as Land Forces commander. John Numbi, a trusted member of Kabila's inner circle, was shifted from air force commander to Police Inspector General. U.S. diplomats reported that the former Naval Forces Commander Maj. General Amuli Bahigua (ex-MLC) became the FARDC's Chief of Operations; former FARDC Intelligence Chief General Didier Etumba (ex-FAC) was promoted to Vice Admiral and appointed Commander of Naval Forces; Maj. General Rigobert Massamba (ex-FAC), a former commander of the Kitona air base, was appointed as Air Forces Commander; and Brig. General Jean-Claude Kifwa, commander of the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard,</b> was appointed as a regional military commander.|$|E
5000|$|On April 4, 2003, the 2nd Tank Battalion Marine Corps had a stiff {{fight with}} the Al Nida Division of the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> and foreign Islamist fighters on the {{outskirts}} of Baghdad. By the end of the day, the Al Nida was considered rendered [...] "combat-ineffective", but three US Marines (1st Lieutenant Brian McPhillips, Sergeant Duane Rios and Corporal Bernard Gooden) were killed in the At Tuwayhah fighting and a tank lost. That day, the 5th Regimental Combat Team reported that two supporting Abrams tanks were destroyed battling the Fedayeen and Al Nida <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards,</b> the latter attempting to use anti-aircraft guns in the ground role.|$|R

50|$|Allied {{air force}} and navy aircraft, and cruise {{missiles}} engaged command and control, communications, and selected <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> targets {{on the morning of}} 16 December. These concentrated attacks against Iraqi targets continued until the early morning of 19 December.|$|R
5|$|USMC sources {{documented}} the Harrier as holding an 85 percent aircraft availability {{record in the}} Iraq War; in just under a month of combat, the aircraft flew over 2,000 sorties. When used, the LITENING II targeting pod achieved greater than 75 percent kill effectiveness on targets. In a single sortie from USS Bonhomme Richard, a wave of Harriers inflicted heavy damage on a <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> tank battalion in advance of a major ground assault on Al Kut. Harriers regularly operated in close support roles for friendly tanks, one of the aircraft generally carrying a LITENING pod. Despite the Harrier's high marks, the limited {{amount of time that}} each aircraft could remain on station, around 15–20 minutes, led to some calls from within the USMC for the procurement of AC-130 gunships, which could loiter for six hours and had a heavier close air support capability than the AV-8B. AV-8Bs were later used in combination with artillery to provide constant fire support for ground forces during heavy fighting in 2004 around the insurgent stronghold of Fallujah. The urban environment there required extreme precision for airstrikes.|$|E
5|$|The next day, American forces {{advanced}} to Kirkuk during Operation Option North, hoping to control oil fields and military airfields {{in and around}} the city. Controlling the oil fields had been a specific operational goal of the Task Force because they were viewed as the most valuable strategic asset in northern Iraq. Between 30 March and 2 April, the 173d Airborne Brigade, along with the Special Forces detachment and the Kurdish forces, engaged and destroyed the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 38th Iraqi Infantry divisions as well as a force loyal to Ansar al-Islam. The brigade used field artillery assets, as well as coordinated airstrikes to attack Iraqi <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> units defending the city. Within a week these units began to fall apart due to desertions. On 10 April the brigade was able to move into the city, securing it after a short urban battle. The entire battle for Kirkuk cost the brigade only nine casualties. During the operation, some of the troops discovered at least two caches of Iraqi gold, totaling more than 2,000 bars. The unit then took part in Operation Peninsula Strike, quelling Ba'ath party resistance and other insurgent groups. These operations, though successful, would have been more effective if the 4th Infantry Division's four heavy brigades were able to enter Iraq through Turkey as originally planned. 4th ID had to relocate their forces from Turkey to Kuwait and were subsequently slowed down in Baghdad. VCorps was not able to surround Baghdad as quickly as it had hoped {{because of a lack of}} available forces in the north. The resulting wear and tear of 4th ID's M1 Abrams and M2 Bradleys made them an ineffective unit in tight urban areas such as Jar Salah. Because their heavily armored tanks required so much maintenance, the 173d incorporated much of 4th ID's area of operation into their own. The 173d secured these areas with company sized detachments, often patrolling the 4th ID's sectors with two unarmored M998 cargo Humvees at any given time.|$|E
25|$|Berisha {{denied that}} there was a {{specific}} order to shoot the protesters, but he confirmed that it was the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> that perpetrated the shooting. Nevertheless, the Albanian Constitution and its Penal Code allow the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> to non-fatally injure individuals who try to enter any governmental institution.|$|E
50|$|In mid-December, a {{military}} source {{reported that the}} 105th Brigade of <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> had the east district of Jobar under complete fire control and that approximately 800 rebels were trapped inside the city district with almost no ways to retreat.|$|R
50|$|The president's {{car is a}} W221 Mercedes-Benz S600Guard {{armoured}} limousine and it is {{escorted by}} the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard's</b> SUVs and other security vehicles including the preceding official state car, an armoured W140 S600 now possibly used as a back up limo.|$|R
50|$|Both battalions {{crossed the}} border into Iraq when the ground {{campaign}} of Operation Desert Storm began on 24 February 1991 and participated in several sharp engagements. As part of the heaviest brigade in the war, consisting of three armor battalions and a mechanized infantry battalion, the two battalions were in the leading force of the 1st Armored Division. The brigade overran the major logistics center at Al Bussayah, then destroyed a brigade of the Adnan <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> Division near the Ar Rumaylah airport. Finally, at the Battle of Medina Ridge, {{in what has been}} described as the largest tank battle of the war, the brigade led the division in attacking the <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> Forces Command.|$|R
25|$|The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) {{estimated}} the army's composition {{immediately after the}} 1991 War as 6 'armoured'/'mechanised' divisions, 23 infantry divisions, 8 <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> divisions and four <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> internal security divisions. Jane's Defence Weekly for 18 July 1992 stated that 10,000 troops from 5 divisions were fighting against Shia Muslims in the southern marshlands.|$|E

50|$|On November 30, 2002, in an {{elaborate}} but solemn procession, six <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> carried the coffin of Dumas {{from its original}} interment site in the Cimetière de Villers-Cotterêts in Aisne to the Panthéon. The coffin was draped in a blue-velvet cloth inscribed with the motto.|$|R
50|$|During 89 {{hours of}} {{sustained}} offensive combat and mopping up {{operations in the}} first several days after the cease-fire, the 1st Armored Division destroyed 418 enemy tanks, 447 armored personnel carriers, 116 artillery pieces, 1211 trucks and 110 air defense systems. The division drove deeper and faster into the enemy's rear areas than any other division-size force in the Kuwait Theater of Operations. While moving 259 kilometers, the division destroyed the 1st Brigade of the 26th Iraqi Infantry Division, along with two brigades of the elite Madinah <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> Armored Division, one brigade of the elite Tawakalna <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> Mechanized Division, two brigades of the 52nd Armored Division, several battalions of the 17th Armored Division, and elements of 10 other Iraqi Army divisions.|$|R
50|$|On 15 July, {{government}} troops backed by tanks and artillery moved into Qaboun after breaching rebel defenses. Opposition activists claimed <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> troops detained {{hundreds of people}} in public places to prevent rebel fighters from hitting their forces. The next day, rebels sent reinforcements to the district.|$|R
