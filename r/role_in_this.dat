5|$|As {{initially}} conceived, MSR was a short-range {{system for}} tracking Sprint missiles before they {{appeared in the}} MAR's view, as well as offering a secondary target and jammer tracking <b>role.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> initial concept, the MSR would have limited processing power, just enough to create tracks to feed back to the MAR. In the anti-jamming role, each MAR and MSR would measure the angle to the jammer.|$|E
5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A balance between cell division and cell death keeps {{the number of}} cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes play a crucial <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> process.|$|E

5|$|Knockout mice {{have been}} created for a kidney-cancer causing {{mutation}} of BHD; heterozygotes develop kidney cysts and tumors that lead to renal failure within three weeks of birth.

Rapamycin partially rescued the phenotype by regulating mTOR. Homozygotes die in utero.|$|E
5|$|Many {{authors have}} speculated that {{at the core of}} this {{symbolic}} explosion, and in tandem, was the development of syntactic language that evolved through a highly specialized social learning system providing the means for semantically unbounded discourse.

5|$|Southampton was an {{important}} trading port in the 12th century, with trade routes to Normandy, the Levant and Gascony. The castle played {{an important}} <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> trade, in part forming a warehouse for the king's imports, this process being managed by a Crown Bailiff. Royal purchases of wine were particularly important for the castle, being stored and distributed to royal properties across the south of England.

5|$|Viking {{influence}} in the area commenced in the late 8th century, and whilst {{there is no doubt}} that the Uí Ímair dynasty played a prominent <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> early period, the records for the dates and details of the rulers are speculative until the mid-10th century. Hostility between the Kings of the Isles and the rulers of Ireland, and intervention by the crown of Norway (either directly or through their vassal the Earl of Orkney) were recurring themes.|$|E
5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought to play a <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> progression.|$|E

5|$|As Galveston's {{traditional}} economy declined, Texas' {{oil boom}} began in 1901, with oil wells and refineries constructed throughout the state. Galveston's direct <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> boom was minimal as investors avoided building pipelines and refineries {{on the island}} itself (though for a time oil was shipped through the island). Nevertheless, wealth {{brought on by the}} boom transformed nearby Houston, Texas City, Goose Creek (modern Baytown), and other communities. Houston in particular became home to a large community of wealthy businessmen and investors. Galveston became even more tourism-focused as the city sought to attract these nearby nouveau riche. Still, in the first two decades after the 1900 storm, the city's economy struggled to recover.|$|E
5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 million cars have been added to Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to fuel cars has also reportedly played a <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this.</b> According to the government, if oil products consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day. In November 2011, the Government reported that the subsidy reform plan has saved Iran $6 billion.|$|E
5|$|Bernhard Mahler {{supported}} his son's ambitions for a music career, and {{agreed that the}} boy should try for {{a place at the}} Vienna Conservatory. The young Mahler was auditioned by the renowned pianist Julius Epstein, and accepted for 1875–76. He made good progress in his piano studies with Epstein and won prizes {{at the end of each}} of his first two years. For his final year, 1877–78, he concentrated on composition and harmony under Robert Fuchs and Franz Krenn. Few of Mahler's student compositions have survived; most were abandoned when he became dissatisfied with them. He destroyed a symphonic movement prepared for an end-of-term competition, after its scornful rejection by the autocratic director Joseph Hellmesberger on the grounds of copying errors. Mahler may have gained his first conducting experience with the Conservatory's student orchestra, in rehearsals and performances, although it appears that his main <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> orchestra was as a percussionist.|$|E

5|$|Buenos Aires {{faced the}} British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806, when British forces led by William Carr Beresford invaded the city. Saavedra {{was still a}} {{civilian}} by then. Santiago de Liniers organized an army in Montevideo to liberate Buenos Aires, and Saavedra was among the civilians that joined Liniers, {{despite the lack of}} military instruction. His <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> battle was a minor one. Liniers successfully liberated Buenos Aires, and organized the resistance against a likely British counter-attack. All the male population of the city aged from 16 to 50 was drafted into the army, and divided in battalions by casta or origin. The largest one was the Regiment of Patricians, made up of volunteer infantrymen born in Buenos Aires. The Regiment was composed of three infantry battalions, commanded by Esteban Romero, Domingo Urien and Manuel Belgrano, who would later pass that command to Juan José Viamonte. Each battalion could elect their own leaders, including their commander, and the Regiment of Patricians elected Saavedra.|$|E
5|$|By the 12th century, Southampton was an {{important}} trading port with trade routes to Normandy, the Levant and Gascony. Both the town and castle played {{an important}} <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> trade, in part forming a warehouse for the king's imports, this process being managed by a Crown Bailiff. The former castle hall {{was turned into a}} subterranean vault in the 13th century, probably for storing wine. Stone houses, often combining accommodation and storage facilities, began to be built in Southampton by the wealthiest merchants, particularly in the prosperous western and southern parts of the town, but these properties could not be easily defended against attack.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} genetic disorder {{that is associated with}} protein misfolding and aggregation. Excessive repeats of the glutamine amino acid at the N-terminus of the Huntingtin protein cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease. As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure. Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the Huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with rational drug design methods to stop the aggregate formation. The N17 fragment of the Huntingtin protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> process remains largely unknown. Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease. Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.|$|E
