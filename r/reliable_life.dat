Chrysomya’s primary importance to the field of medico-criminal forensic entomology is due to the genus’ <b>reliable</b> <b>life</b> cycle, allowing investigators to accurately develop a postmortem interval.

Ultra <b>reliable</b> <b>life</b> support is needed for Mars and other long, distant missions. Current systems apparently have insufficient reliability. The life cycle cost of the Mars life support system is estimated. Reliability can be increased by improving the intrinsic system reliability, adding spare parts, or by providing technically diverse redundant systems. The costs of these approaches are estimated. Adding spares is least costly but may be defeated by common cause failures. Using two technically diverse systems is effective but doubles the life cycle cost. Achieving ultra reliability is worth its high cost because the penalty for failure is very high...|$|E

In {{order to}} {{research}} {{the relationship between the}} life of hull with different structure and the reliability while using, a life estimation method for hull based on test was proposed. By assuming that the hull life span satisfied the Weibull distribution, with zero-failure data, confidence limit γ and reliability R, the confidence lower limit of <b>reliable</b> <b>life</b> were given according to test data of the hull life span. If the lower limit of the shape parameters of the Weibull distribution were known, this method can accumulate all of zero-failure data to increase the analysis presion of reliability greatly. At last, using this method, under the hull reliability R and the confidence γ, the confidence lower limit of <b>reliable</b> <b>life</b> with the hull structures as steel, titanium alloy and aluminum alloy were computed.

Experts of industry organisations for building materials and products made a final judgement of the new established reference service lives. Reference service lives of building products may show a large unknown bandwidth around the average.

Experts have raised objections to the use the factor method for deriving mathematically a bandwidth of estimated service lives of a building product from the reference service life of the product.

40|$|AbstractFatigue induced {{products}} generally bear fatigue loads {{accompanied by}} impact processes, which reduces their <b>reliable</b> <b>life</b> rapidly. This paper introduces a reliability assessment model {{based on a}} local stress–strain approach considering both low-cycle fatigue and high energy impact loads. Two coupling relationships between fatigue and impact are given with effects of an impact process on fatigue damage and effects of fatigue damage on impact performance. The analysis of the former modifies the fatigue parameters and the Manson–Coffin equation for fatigue life based on material theories. On the other hand, the latter proposes the coupling variables and the difference of fracture toughness caused by accumulative fatigue damage. To form an overall reliability model including both fatigue failure and impact failure, a competing risk model is developed.

40|$|A human {{mission to}} Mars will require highly <b>reliable</b> <b>life</b> support systems. Mars {{life support systems}} may recycle water and oxygen using systems similar to those on the International Space Station (ISS). However, {{achieving}} sufficient reliability is less difficult for ISS than {{it will be for}} Mars. If an ISS system has a serious failure, it is possible to provide spare parts, or directly supply water or oxygen, or if necessary bring the crew back to Earth. Life support for Mars must be designed, tested, and improved as needed to achieve high demonstrated reliability. A quantitative reliability goal should be established and used to guide development t. The designers should select reliable components and minimize interface and integration problems. In theory a system can achieve the component-limited reliability, but testing often reveal unexpected failures due to design mistakes or flawed components. Testing should extend long enough to detect any unexpected failure modes and to verify the expected reliability. Iterated redesign and retest may be required to achieve the reliability goal. If the reliability is less than required, it may be improved by providing spare components or redundant systems. The number of spares required to achieve a given reliability goal depends on the component failure rate. If the failure rate is under estimated, the number of spares will be insufficient and the system may fail. If the design is likely to have undiscovered design or component problems, it is advisable to use dissimilar redundancy, even though this multiplies the design and development cost. In the ideal case, a human tended closed system operational test should be conducted to gain confidence in operations, maintenance, and repair. The difficulty in achieving high reliability in unproven complex systems may require the use of simpler, more mature, intrinsically higher reliability systems. The limitations of budget, schedule, and technology may suggest accepting lower and less certain expected reliability.
