5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{believed that}} the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult {{in the days before the}} election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E
5|$|Entering the {{hyperspace}} pocket, {{the group}} find the Elsa and investigate the area, encountering both Albedo and Virgil and learning that the Vessels of Anima powering their E.S. mecha {{are key to}} the Testaments' plans. They are then confronted by Mantel—who reveals himself as the Red Testament—and T-elos. T-elos almost kills KOS-MOS, but Shion's pendant activates, apparently transporting them to the planet Miltia fifteen years into the past, which is revealed to be a world within Shion's subconscious. They are attacked by Voyager, who is beaten back by a redesigned KOS-MOS. During the group's time there, Shion learns the true events that caused Miltia's fall; her father, Kevin, Margulis and Mizrahi were attempting to control the Zohar through experiments involving both Shion and her mother, but when U-TIC and Federation forces clashed, Kevin and Margulis released unstable combat Realians which slaughtered nearly everyone in the battle. The trauma caused the young Shion to <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Zohar, summoning the Gnosis and awakening U-DO; it was only Mizrahi's self-sacrifice in sealing away Miltia that prevented the chaos from spreading. The group fight Virgil before he is calmed by the spirit of Febronia—who tended {{him when he was}} injured on Miltia and with whom he formed an attachment prior to her death—and follows her into the afterlife. The Red Testament also appears, revealing his true identity as Kevin and asking Shion to join him.|$|E

25|$|In August, 1929, the Chorschüler der evangelisch-reformierten Kirche Basel-Stadt ("Choir {{students}} of the Protestant Church of Basel-City"), which consisted of former choirboys whose voices had changed, was founded. The expansion of the choir to include changed voices had already been considered by January 1928, but the proposal did not <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> older students; the consistory also refused {{it because of the}} unintentional competition it would create with the adult community and church choirs. Nevertheless, the choir students appeared at Hamm's Free Organ Recital in December, 1928, but the group was ultimately unable to survive (for the time being).|$|E
25|$|King's biographers {{agree on}} the {{personal}} characteristics that made him distinctive. He lacked the charisma of such contemporaries as Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, or Charles de Gaulle. He lacked a commanding presence or oratorical skill; his best writing was academic, and did not <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> electorate. Cold and tactless in human relations, he had many political allies but very few close personal friends. He never married and lacked a hostess whose charm could substitute for his chill. He kept secret his beliefs in spiritualism and use of mediums to stay in contact with departed associates and particularly with his mother, and allowed his intense spirituality to distort his understanding of Adolf Hitler throughout the late 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Sting {{began to}} {{question}} Hogan's trustworthiness and credibility in {{the weeks leading up}} to Fall Brawl. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.|$|E
25|$|Jackson, however, {{managed to}} {{successfully}} portray his veto {{as a defense}} of the common man against governmental tyranny. Clay proved to be no match to Jackson's ability to <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> people and the Democratic Party's strong political networks. Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased Jackson's popularity. At Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat Jackson, seemingly confirming Jackson's view that it interfered in the political process. Jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington D.C. Jackson won the election decisively by a landslide, receiving 54 {{percent of the popular}} vote and 219 electoral votes. Clay received 37 {{percent of the popular vote}} and 49 electoral votes. Wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party folded. Jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.|$|E

500|$|The campaign, {{which began}} in 1967, was a well-guided {{response}} to the Six-Day War and the subsequent break-off by the Soviets of all diplomatic relations with Israel. Polish factory workers were forced to publicly denounce Zionism. As the interior minister Mieczysław Moczar's nationalist [...] "Partisan" [...] faction became increasingly influential in the communist party, infighting within the Polish communist party led one faction to again make scapegoats of the remaining Polish Jews, attempting to redirect public anger at them. After Israel's victory in the war, the Polish government, following the Soviet lead, launched an antisemitic campaign {{under the guise of}} [...] "anti-Zionism," [...] with both Moczar's and Party Secretary Władysław Gomułka's factions playing leading roles. However, the campaign did not <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> general public, because most Poles saw similarities between Israel's fight for survival and Poland's past struggles for independence. Many Poles felt pride in the success of the Israeli military, which was dominated by Polish Jews. The slogan, [...] "Our Jews beat the Soviet Arabs" [...] was very popular among the Poles, but contrary to the desire of the communist government.|$|E

In another interview discussing the film, Anand revealed that he wanted to make it different from his earlier films, aiming for it to be a [...] "subdued romance," [...] which is not sexy. He said: [...] "Everyone is going to be covered up in scarf's and mufflers and over coats and boots.

500|$|It is {{possible}} to design filters that operate internally entirely in evanescent modes. [...] This has space saving advantages because the filter waveguide, which often forms the housing of the filter, {{does not need to}} be large enough to support propagation of the dominant mode. [...] Typically, an evanescent mode filter consists of a length of waveguide smaller than the waveguide feeding the input and output ports. [...] In some designs this may be folded to achieve a more compact filter. [...] Tuning screws are inserted at specific intervals along the waveguide producing equivalent lumped capacitances at those points. [...] In more recent designs the screws are replaced with dielectric inserts. [...] These capacitors <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> preceding length of evanescent mode waveguide which has the equivalent circuit of an inductor, thus producing a filtering action. [...] Energy from many different evanescent modes is stored in the field around each of these capacitive discontinuities. [...] However, the design is such that only the dominant mode reaches the output port; the other modes decay much more rapidly between the capacitors.|$|E
500|$|During the concepting {{process of}} Halo 4, O'Connor {{decided it would}} be best for the {{franchise}} to explore the Forerunner fiction of the Halo universe, which had remained largely a mystery before 343 Industries' involvement in the franchise. This ultimately {{led to the creation of}} a new race of enemy, the Prometheans, warriors of the Forerunner empire. Given that the Forerunners themselves had never been featured in previous Halo games, the design process for the appearance of the Prometheans was long and tedious. [...] The art team produced a large number of sketches, which were presented to other member's of the studio to get feedback and reactions. Many variations of different character models were concepted before the team decided on a final design. The main goal when designing their appearance was to make them <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> player, and evoke the image of the Forerunner architecture and language that had been portrayed in previous Halo media. Upon death, the Promethean Knight dissolves from the point where it was last shot; this visual effect also occurs when certain enemies are killed by Promethean weapons. From a gameplay standpoint the design for the Prometheans also needed to fit in well with the sandbox so they would be suitable enemies to fight. A goal when designing their behaviour was to make them highly adaptive from a tactical standpoint. For example, the Promethean Knight can phase in and out of space, allowing it to retreat or charge the player at any given moment; this changes the way that a player engages in a combat encounter.|$|E
