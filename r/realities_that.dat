5|$|As a writer, Sorabji is {{best known}} for his music criticism, the bulk of which is {{contained}} in the books Around Music (1932) and Mi contra fa: The Immoralisings of a Machiavellian Musician (1947). He contributed to various well-known publications dealing with music in England, including The New Age, The New English Weekly, The Musical Times and Musical Opinion. He revised some of those articles and included them in his two books. His writings also devote attention to various non-musical issues: he was, among other things, a critic of British rule in India and a proponent of birth control and legalised abortion. Being homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were illegal in England, he wrote of the biological and social <b>realities</b> <b>that</b> homosexuals faced during much of his lifetime.|$|E

Pinchon, who {{by certain}} aspects of his method seems to proceed from Monet and Guillaumin, has {{nonetheless}} a very personal conception of formal pictorial design that his approach rigorously defines. Imaginative and sensitive, he admits only the visual <b>realities</b> <b>that</b> stimulate sensation. He does not attach significant importance to forms determined by contour lines; these are, in his eyes, the motif upon which the harmonies of color and light are arranged.|$|E

25|$|After the {{transfer}} to the present Isabela the economic <b>realities</b> <b>that</b> resulted from the new land and property opportunities that were readily available, the healthier environment formed due to the wide open plains and prevalent northern winds, and the proximity to the coast and the natural sea port at the bay of 'Punta Sardina' prompted for the diversification of the agricultural products and an increase on trade. The cultivation of sugar cane, coffee, tobacco, cotton, yuca, coconuts and fruits was stimulated further, Isabela has continued to flourish until recent years with the island's economic crisis, the closing of important factories, and the rising crime rate.|$|E
25|$|When {{compared}} with benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines (including zaleplon) appear to offer few significant advantages in efficacy or tolerability among elderly individuals. Long-term use of sedative/hypnotics for insomnia {{has traditionally been}} discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment, anterograde amnesia, daytime sedation, musculoskeletal impairment, and subsequently {{an increased risk of}} harm to oneself (e.g. falling) and to others (e.g. automotive accidents). Though, quite obviously as the body and brain age, these aforementioned phenomena are expected events, as they occur daily regardless of ingestion of a sedative/hypnotic. Thus, statistically significant and empirical evidence are arguably still absent as dramatic precautions and conclusions are drawn irrespective of the debilitating <b>realities</b> <b>that</b> accompany insomnia and the fact that these medicines do indeed provide assistance to millions of elderly individuals. It is important to distinguish between the extrapolation of potential side effects relative to the vast number of examples, wherein the sedative/hypnotic has proven therapeutically beneficial and appropriate.|$|E
25|$|The Alexandrian {{contribution}} to Christian mysticism centers on Origen and Clement of Alexandria. Clement {{was an early}} Christian humanist who argued that reason {{is the most important}} aspect of human existence and that gnosis (not something we can attain by ourselves, but the gift of Christ) helps us find the spiritual <b>realities</b> <b>that</b> are hidden behind the natural world and within the scriptures. Given the importance of reason, Clement stresses apatheia as a reasonable ordering of our passions in order to live within God's love, which is seen as a form of truth. Origen, who had a lasting influence on Eastern Christian thought, further develops the idea that the spiritual realities can be found through allegorical readings of the scriptures (along the lines of Jewish aggadah tradition), but he focuses his attention on the Cross and on the importance of imitating Christ through the Cross, especially through spiritual combat and asceticism. Origen stresses the importance of combining intellect and virtue (theoria and praxis) in our spiritual exercises, drawing on the image of Moses and Aaron leading the Israelites through the wilderness, and he describes our union with God as the marriage of our souls with Christ the Logos, using the wedding imagery from the Song of Songs. Alexandrian mysticism developed alongside Hermeticism and Neoplatonism and therefore share some of the same ideas, images, etc. in spite of their differences.|$|E

500|$|Kapoor often {{speaks of}} {{removing}} both {{the signature of}} the artist from his works {{as well as any}} traces of their fabrication, or what he refers to as [...] "traces of the hand". He aspires to make his works look like they have independent <b>realities</b> <b>that</b> he reveals rather than creates. For him, removing all the seams from Cloud Gate was necessary {{in order to make the}} sculpture seem as though it was [...] "perfect" [...] and ready-made. These effects increase the viewer's fascination with it and makes them wonder what it is and where it came from. His attempts to hide his works' seams as an artist stand in contrast to Frank Gehry's architectural designs in the park, Jay Pritzker Pavilion and BP Pedestrian Bridge, which display their seams prominently.|$|E
500|$|Time {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the language and plot of the play. Both Romeo and Juliet struggle to maintain an imaginary world void of time in the face of the harsh <b>realities</b> <b>that</b> surround them. For instance, when Romeo swears his love to Juliet by the moon, she protests [...] "O swear not by the moon, th'inconstant moon, / That monthly changes in her circled orb, / Lest that thy love prove likewise variable." [...] From the very beginning, the lovers are designated as [...] "star-cross'd" [...] referring to an astrologic belief associated with time. Stars were thought to control the fates of humanity, and as time passed, stars would move along their course in the sky, also charting the course of human lives below. Romeo speaks of a foreboding he feels in the stars' movements early in the play, and when he learns of Juliet's death, he defies the stars' course for him.|$|E

500|$|Juxtaposed {{against the}} {{struggle}} to survive is the enchanting but short beauty of childhood. The magic in the plot reinforces the sense of enchantment and gives the book a fairy-tale like quality, leading the BolognaRagazzi Awards jury to speak of [...] "the great Secret (that) lurks in the story". It is the child Calpurnia who follows the magic to find the river and save the adults from starvation. The contrast of an idealized and protected childhood with the harsh <b>realities</b> <b>that</b> adults must face is another theme common to Rawlings' writings, expressed in the famous speech about adult reality Ezra [...] "Penny" [...] Baxter delivers to his son Jody {{at the end of}} The Yearling: [...] "Ever’ man wants life to be a fine thing, and [...] easy. ’Tis fine, boy, powerful fine, but ’tain’t easy. Life knocks a man down and he gits up and it knocks him down again.... What’s he to do then?... Why, take it for his share and go on." [...] Unlike Jody, who realizes the magic of his childhood is [...] "gone forever" [...] with the death of his fawn, Calpurnia retains the secret river and the magic in her mind.|$|E
500|$|While some reviewers {{regard the}} novel as a thriller, others {{see it as an}} example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the [...] "technocultural future-present". Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of {{illustrating}} society's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are [...] "he Footage and Cayce's special talents" [...] but that he [...] "never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future". Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: cience fiction, in effect, has become a narrative strategy, a way of approaching story, in which not only characters must be invented, but the world and its ways as well, without resorting to magic or the supernatural, where the fantasy folks work. A realist wrestling with the woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place, often from the ground up, a process usually called world-building. In other words, in a science fiction novel, the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot, without whom the story could not take place, whether it's the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the story is in the world. Part of Gibson's point ... is {{that we live in a}} time of such accelerated change and layered <b>realities,</b> <b>that</b> we're all in that boat, like it or not. A novel set in the [...] "real world" [...] now has to answer the question, [...] "Which one?" ...|$|E

In the most ordinary affairs of daily life, we face the challenge of authentic choice, and the temptation of comfortable inauthenticity. All of Roquentin's experiences are related to these themes from Sartre's philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Directed by Mark Lamos {{the cast}} {{featured}} John de Lancie as Felix Barriaux, Daniel Davis, Chris Henry Coffey, Bruce Bohne, Dana Slamp and Jennifer Regan. The Los Angeles Times reviewer wrote: [...] "...the play is still flailing in several directions and not wholly achieving its goals...The proposed crucifixion victim appears {{only as a}} glowing light. Despite eyewitness accounts of his human form, he may be divine or at least an inspired figment of the imagination, Miller suggests. He must decide whether to be crucified or to disappear. This is an interesting tangent, but it further removes the play from the nitty-gritty of the political <b>realities</b> <b>that</b> drove Miller to write. His continuing sense of adventure at age 88 is awe-inspiring, but the play itself isn't." ...|$|E
