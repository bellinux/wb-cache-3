40|$|BACKGROUND: Persons {{with less}} severe disabilities {{are able to}} express their needs and show {{initiatives}} in social <b>contacts,</b> <b>persons</b> with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD), however, depend on others for this. This study analysed the structure of informal networks of persons with PIMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data concerning the number, type and frequency of contacts were collected in 205 persons with PIMD. RESULTS: The mean number of <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> was 5. 1 (range: 0 - 26, SD: 4. 2) per year. 79. 4 % of the <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> are family, {{with an average of}} 72. 3 contacts per year. Parents had significantly more contact compared to the other informal <b>contact</b> <b>persons.</b> In 2. 2 % of the sample contacts with peers were seen. CONCLUSIONS: The informal networks of persons with PIMD consist mainly of family. The question arises how informal networks can be expanded and which role professionals have in this process...|$|R

40|$|Subjects: All {{residents}} {{during an}} 18 month period {{were included in}} this study. Intervention: Hip protectors were introduced as {{a regular part of}} health care service for all residents. Residents at high risk were encouraged to use hip protectors regularly. Each nursing home had a <b>contact</b> <b>person.</b> Main outcome measures: The percentage of residents accepting the hip protector offer, probability of continued use, reasons for terminating use, and percentage of falls with hip protector were evaluated. Results: Fifty five percent of the residents accepted the hip protector offer. The percentage increased by age, but showed no significant dependence on gender, profession of the <b>contact</b> <b>person,</b> or size of nursing home. The probability of continued use showed no significant dependence on age and gender. Nursing homes with a nurse as <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> showed 51 % higher risk of residents terminating regular hip protector use than nursing homes with a physiotherapist as <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> (relative risk (RR) 1. 51, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 11 to 2. 05, p = 0. 008). The corresponding result for large (75 – 92 beds) compared with small (24 – 68 beds) nursing homes was RR= 1. 44 (95 % CI 1. 02 to 2. 02, p = 0. 036).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay was to enhance the {{understanding}} and knowledge about phenomenon access support. Access support means that a third <b>person</b> (<b>contact</b> <b>person)</b> must be present during access visits between a child and its parent, if {{it is necessary for}} the child’s security or because the child needs support. The study was based on qualitative interviews with four <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> and two professional social workers, whose main task have been to support and, partially, coordinate the work of <b>contact</b> <b>persons.</b> During the interviews I put the focus on participant’s experiences and thoughts about the phenomenon access support. Two theoretical perspectives were used to analyze the empirical material. These were an experiential perspective and role perspective. The results showed that being a <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> required certain personal qualities and strategies for managing different situations during access. Generally, the access situations are often affected by problems between divorced parents and the lack of cooperation with other institutions, especially with the court. Parents and children can have different expectations of access support. Nevertheless, participants find the work as access support meaningful and valuable in terms of life experience...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the contact examination results of patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), their clinical characteristics and risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) transmission. Methods: Follow-up charts of 34 MDR-TB patients, who are registered in four tuberculosis dispensaries in Diyarbakir and followed-up between January 2000 and December 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The mean age of MDR-TB patients was 32. 3 ± 14. 2 years. Among the <b>person</b> who in <b>contact</b> with MDR-TB index patients, 7 (20. 6 %) of them had TB while overall 9 <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> developed TB disease. No significant differences were found in gender distribution, education and social security status, monthly income and past TB history between <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> who developed (n= 7) and not-developed (n= 27) TB disease (p> 0. 05). In 17 (50. 0 %) of MDR-TB patients inappropriate anti-TB drug prescription and in 14 (41. 1 %) non-compliance to drug regimen were detected. Inappropriately prescribed anti-TB drugs and delay in TB diagnosis for index MDR-TB patients (18. 7 months vs. 9. 3 months, respectively; p< 0. 05) were more frequently encountered among <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> who developed TB (p< 0. 05). The mean number of <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> for MDR-TB patients was 4. 4 and 1. 8 person per patient had been examined. Examination ratios for MDR-TB <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> who did not developed TB disease was lower than those of TB developed patients (15. 6 % vs. 50. 0 %, respectively; p< 0. 05) Conclusion: Insufficient follow-up and delay in diagnosis in MDR-TB patients may be significant risk factors on their contact persons; therefore it is necessary to increase the screenings and precautions in these contacts...|$|R
