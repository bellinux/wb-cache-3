Comics have been published based on Platinum’s properties, continuously since inception, whether by Platinum itself or the original rights holders. Film productions in 2009-2011 were Cowboys & Aliens and Dylan Dog.|$|E
50|$|Platinum Studios was co-founded in January 1997 by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg and European <b>rights</b> <b>agent</b> Ervin Rustemagić. As {{the former}} head of Malibu Comics, Rosenberg led comic {{spin-offs}} into toys, television, and feature films, including the 1.65 billion-dollar film and television franchise Men in Black, based on the Marvel/Malibu comic The Men in Black by Lowell Cunningham. In 1992, Rosenberg brokered a deal in which seven top-selling artists defected from Marvel Comics to form Image Comics. Rosenberg signed the artists to a label deal which made Malibu the publisher of record for the first comics from Image, which gave the upstart creator-run publisher access to the distribution channels. This subsequently led to Malibu breaking all sales records for independent comics. In 1992, Malibu grabbed almost 10% of the American comics market share, temporarily moving ahead of industry giant DC Comics.|$|E

The methods in this paper are strongly influenced on human heuristics regarding the assignment of confidence ratings on humans. The methods provide a solution to current problems with ontologies: (1) handling contradicting and sloppy information, (2) efficient network use instead of broadcasting information and (3) dealing with ontological drift...|$|R

Traditional solutions, such as centralized directories, may be inaccurate and may often be unavailable in such settings. Therefore, the only way agents can find the <b>right</b> <b>agents</b> is through referrals. In {{order to make the}} referrals effective, the agents must adaptively select the agents with whom they interact. This adaptivity leads to the emergence of referral networks among agents. We study this network experimentally to see the emergence of social structures and the evolution of such structures under different scenarios...|$|R

30|$|Task {{allocation}} {{refers to}} the problems of mapping the tasks obtained through task division to individual agents (Puranam et al., 2014, p. 165). It describes the problem of allocating a job to the <b>right</b> <b>agent.</b> The commonly used mechanisms for task allocation are assignment (Hackman and Oldham, 1976) and self-selection based on capability, resources and preference (Puranam et al., 2014). The process of self-selection can be considered to be decision-making, which can be influenced by both internal and external factors. Competition is an external factor for an organization, {{but it is also a}} critical factor for a successful ecosystem (Moore, 1993; Peltoniemi and Vuori, 2004). Therefore, self-selection based on competition is also a major mechanism of task allocation.|$|R
