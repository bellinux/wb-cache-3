50|$|The Society was {{established}} in 1912, largely on the initiative of Hilary Jenkinson (1882-1961), then an archivist at the Public Record Office and also honorary secretary of the Surrey Archaeological Society. It had become clear that the Archaeological Society was {{unable or unwilling to}} commit itself to a sustained programme of publication of archival sources for the county's history, and Jenkinson believed that an entirely new body was necessary. He became its secretary, and his Record Office colleague M.S. Giuseppi its general editor. Giuseppi stood down in 1924 to be succeeded by Jenkinson, who held the positions of secretary and general editor jointly until 1950. In that year he was elected president of the Society. In these roles, Jenkinson established many of the principles of <b>record</b> <b>editing</b> and publication which were subsequently adhered to not only by the Society itself, but also more widely.|$|E

40|$|In the {{traditional}} workflow for delivering electronic resources to patrons, acquisitions {{have been the}} bridge between collection development and cataloging. However, new Patron Driven Acquisitions (PDA) purchasing models have reordered workflows and reemphasized communications. The sequence of activities differs since e-book discovery precedes purchasing activities. Workflow complexities are further exacerbated in a consortia environment. The University of Colorado (CU) system collaborated to implement a consortium PDA pilot with Ingram Academic on the MyiLibrary platform in December 2011. This presentation {{provides an overview of}} the pilot program and describes the workflow used for shared selection, cataloging, purchasing, and assessment of e-books among five separate libraries. The presenters provide details on the most salient issues encountered at each phase of the process, such as: selecting pilot subject areas; developing a consortium profile; establishing best-practices for MARC <b>record</b> <b>editing</b> and loading; troubleshooting duplicated e-book titles at individual libraries; resolving invoicing logistics; and designing assessment criteria. It also covers strategies for implementing a PDA program and describes {{some of the issues that}} may arise in a consortial PDA program...|$|E

The thesis contains basic rules for proper setup of the measurement {{system and the}} rules to adjust the camera exposure. The experiments were performed on the prototype of a parametric switching chambre, {{while the majority of}} source materials was derived from the requirements of another study which was aimed on the movement of the electode spots. The process of the first adjustment of the camera, a record edit options for the presentation purposes and the process of the 3 D model design of the switching arc in SketchUp software was stated. Paper contains a comparsion of the spectral filter effect and neutral density filter effect on the final record as well. The part of the work outputs are the 3 D model of the switching arc and the supporting <b>record</b> <b>editing</b> software. The paper results show a degree of the inaccuracies in a optical diagnostics made from only one direction caused by the lack of the information about third dimension...|$|E

40|$|A new editing {{system for}} records used to compute USDA-DHIA genetic {{evaluations}} {{was developed to}} allow im-mediate and more complete checking of data. The system uses direct (immediate on-line) access to pedigree and some lac-tation information to evaluate new data received. Birth dates are checked against parent birth dates and dam calving dates. For most conflicts, existing data are re-tained, and new data are returned for correction or verification. Records for early lactation can be edited monthly, and data disposition can be determined electronically on-line through telephone access prior to submission. For July 1993 evaluations, nearly 29, 000 pedigree records were rejected out of 2. 0 million submitted; over 19, 000 others were usa-ble after data received were changed to agree with previous information. The most frequent reasons for questionable data in rejected pedigree records were invalid codes or information and con-flicts with existing information for ani-mal, sire, and dam identification and ani-mal birth date. Over 158, 000 lactation records of 3. 2 million submitted with sire identification were rejected; 3 19, 000 others were usable after data were up-dated to agree with existing information. The four most common reasons for ques-tionable data in rejected lactation records were conflicts for sire or dam identifica-tion and animal birth date and invalid sire identification. The new system will decrease turnaround time for correcting unacceptable records. (Key words: dairy, genetics, database, <b>record</b> <b>editing</b> system...|$|E
