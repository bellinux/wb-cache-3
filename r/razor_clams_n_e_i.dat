40|$|Don Hoi Lord wetland {{located near}} Mae Klong river mouth {{in the area}} of Samut Songkhram province, upper the Gulf of Thailand. The wetland was {{registered}} as the 1099 th Ramsar site. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Solen spp.) is an important species in the sandbars which are a part of this wetland. Fisherman has harvested <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> for generating income more than 2 generations. Due to the previous studies, <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population has decreased through the time. The objective of this study aims to explore possible sustainable management policies for Don Hoi Lord by using Companion Modelling approach (ComMod). The approach mainly consists of Agent-based simulation model (ABM) and participatory simulation workshop with stakeholders involvement. To achieve the aim of the study, there are 3 parts including: 1) ecological study of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population and its environmental factors especially sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC) between June 2008 - May 2009; 2) socio-economic study to understand fisherman harvesting behavior and <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> market mechanism; and 3) ABM development from field study finding and test the management scenarios with the ABM. Moreover, the ABM was used in participatory simulation workshop to validate the ABM and to exchange and discuss on <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> sustainable management. The results from ecological study showed that <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population was in crisis due to the decreasing of population. Mean density of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> was 0. 51 ± 0. 30 clam/m 2 which has been the lowest record among previous scientific studies since 1982. In addition, <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> density had negative correlation with %organic matter in soil sediment and particulate sediment in water column (p < 0. 05) but it was not correlated with POC. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> market is being driven by a trader who buys all <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> from a fisherman and processed <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> as clam meat before distributing to market. The trader set <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> buying price from fisherman independently based on their <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> stock and a current market demand. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> demand usually was increased during weekend and, presently the trader distributing processed <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> to a restaurant and a merchant in fresh market. Regarding fisherman, there were 2 factors affected fisherman's decision to harvest <b>razor</b> <b>clam,</b> firstly the density of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> and secondly <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> price. Due to the low <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> density, fisherman had to harvest on other species instead of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> but <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> is still the first priority. The ABM development was done by added i-stage distribution model and re-calibrated until the simulation model represented system behavior. Then, the management scenarios were tested with the ABM and it was found that reserved zoning accompany with quota system was the best scenario for sustaining <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population. Next, spatial interface of the ABM was upgraded based on socio-economic finding and the upgraded ABM was used in participatory simulation workshop with stakeholders. The workshop can be a forum for discussion among stakeholders by using ABM as mediator and stakeholders in the workshop which could share their representations for collective agreement to achieve the goal. Finally, the whole process of ComMod at Don Hoi Lord by communicating and coworking between researcher and stakeholders in the field study could help them instituted the group to working on sustainable management by implementing a reserved or forbidden zone on the sandbar at Don Hoi Lord.

40|$|Abstract: Heavy metal {{levels were}} {{investigated}} in different tissues of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Solen regularis) and sediments collected from Moyan and Serpan, Sarawak. Analysis of elements, Cd, Mn, Fe, Cr and Cu {{were carried out}} in soft tissues, gills, siphon, foot and whole tissues of <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> (Solen regularis) using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (FAAS). Accumulation pattern in different organs varied with metals and sampling sites. Fe occurred in elevated concentration in sediments (741. 8 - 989. 0 mg/kg) and this was also reflected in <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> (Solen regularis). Siphon and foot recorded highest Fe at Moyan and Serpan respectively. Concentration of Mn did not show no major variations in the organs analyzed at both sampling sites. It {{was found to be}} highest in gill (92. 5 mg/kg) at Moyan and siphon (77. 3 mg/kg) at Serpan. The levels of Cr in <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> (Solen regularis) ranged between 22. 4 and 36. 7 mg/kg and 26. 1 and 34. 4 mg/kg at Moyan and Serpan respectively. Cu in <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> varied from 5. 2 - 8. 1 mg/kg at Moyan and 5. 6 - 12. 4 mg/kg at Serpan. Cd was found to be in the least concentration both in sediments (0. 7 - 3. 0 mg/kg) and <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> (0. 5 - 1. 2 mg/kg).

40|$|Don Hoi Lord, {{a coastal}} wetland {{in the upper}} gulf of Thailand, is famous for the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Solen regularis), which {{is a source of}} food and income for local fishermen. However, the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> {{population}} is significantly decreasing so the aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> fishery and develop a management plan engaging the different stakeholders in collective discussions. A participatory modelling approach was used, including (a) agent-based modelling (ABM) and (b) role-playing games (RPG). First, an individual-state distribution model of the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population was designed and calibrated to synthesise knowledge. Two RPG sessions supported by this biological model were organised to initiate collective learning and promote discussion among stakeholders. After playing with the baseline scenario showing the actual harvesting situation, discussions led to the definition of alternative scenarios for clam management such as establishment and rotation of zones closed for harvesting, and quota systems. These scenarios developed during the RPG sessions were more deeply investigated with an agent-based model that included fishermen agents and the individual-state distribution model of the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population. Simulations of different scenarios (reserve, quota and combination of reserve and quota) were produced to enable better informed discussion between different stakeholders. Stakeholders have acknowledged that management through rotating reserves is not efficient if the duration of reserves is too short. They have realised that the efficiency of reserves is hard to assess without better data on clam recruitment. They have also explored another management option which is the quota system. In the final stage, the local participatory process was endorsed by the incumbent regional policy-making actor. Unfortunately, because of rapid administrative rotation the project abruptly lost support. This unexpected event emphasises the need for continuous monitoring of all actors entering and/or leaving the system, which can radically change the interactions among them and, therefore, the whole management context.

40|$|Annual {{maintenance}} of the Columbia River navigation channel requires the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to dredge sediment from the river and dispose of the sediment in coastal areas {{at the mouth of}} the Columbia River. Some of these disposal areas can be as shallow as 12 m deep in waters off the coastal beaches, and dredged material disposal activities have therefore raised concerns of impacts to local <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Siliqua patula) populations that are prevalent in the area. The Corps’ Portland District requested that the Marine Sciences Laboratory of the U. S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory conduct laboratory experiments to evaluate the potential impacts of burial by dredged material to <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> during disposal. Prior modeling of disposal events indicates three stresses that could have an impact on benthic invertebrates: convective descent and bottom encounter (compression forces due to bottom impact), dynamic collapse and spreading (surge as material washes over the bottom), and mounding (burial by material). Because the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> is infaunal, the effects of the first two components should be minimal, because the clams should be protected by substrate that is not eroded in the event and by the clams’ rapid digging capabilities. The mound resulting from the disposal, however, would bury any clams remaining in the footprint under as much as 12 cm of new sediment according to modeling, and the clams’ reaction to such an event and to burial is not known. Although the literature suggests that <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> may be negatively affected by siltation and therefore perhaps by dredging and disposal activity, as well, impacts of this type have not been demonstrated. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential impacts of dredge material disposal on adult subtidal <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> populations {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. Using the parameters defined in a previous model, a laboratory study was created in which a slurry was added to experimental chambers seeded with adult <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> to produce burial mounds of various thicknesses.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the biology}} of {{economically}} important marine resources is essential in fisheries management. However, the methodologies developed by scientists are usually not applicable for assessing small-scale fisheries (SSFs), as they are too complicated and/or too costly. Classic methodologies taken from industrial fisheries are usually very data demanding and need of highly specialized personnel in modelling and stock assessment; both things are usually not present {{in most of the}} small-scale fisheries. In Galicia, shellfishing (that could be considered as SSFs) is an important economic and social activity that is co-managed between the Autonomous Administration (Xunta de Galicia) and 63 fishers’ guilds (called “cofradías de Pescadores”). Most guilds count with a Technical Assistant in Shellfisheries Management (TA), that serves as liaison between fishers, managers and scientists and is in charge of designing, implementing and supervising management plans (Macho et al., 2013). However, these experts count with scarce time and limited resources, being necessary simple assessment and management procedures. The present work aims to provide easy tools to monitor the species biology in order to incorporate it in the daily fishery management. We took as a model the sword <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Ensis magnus (Schumacher, 1817), syn. E. arcuatus (Jeffreys, 1865)) because despite being the most important commercial species of Solenidae in Europe {{and one of the most}} important shellfisheries in Galicia (370 t in 2013) ([URL] accessed 4 January 2013), little is known about its biology. Furthermore, the fishers and the TAs from Galicia have observed some problems that could be related to {{the biology of}} the species. The most important one is that harvested <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> break by the foot in a high proportion during winter, which could lead to a loss of up to 30 - 40 % of the catch since these individuals have to be discarded. In the light of these problems, the specific objectives of this work were 1) to carry out mesoscale studies (~ 10 km) of the reproductive biology in order to adapt the possible variability to the management strategy (rotation scheme and reproductive close season), 2) to estimate the size at first maturity, 3) to construct a simple tool to easily monitor the gonad development stage of the resource, 4) to determine the cause of the foot breakage in order to reduce it as much as possible, 5) to study the spatial variability in recruitment for evaluate whether should be established seasonal closures for fishing in areas/periods where recruitment is more intense, 6) to ascertain which method was the most efficient in estimating the age of this species (counting external shell rings by eye vs acetate peels of the internal shell microstructure) and to test the possibility of using external rings as an easy management tool and 6) to evaluate the growth variability throughout the ria. To achieve the presented objectives, different samplings were conducted between 2008 and 2011 in three fishing beds of the Ría de Pontevedra (Galicia, NW Spain) (Brensa, Bueu and Ons located at the inner, middle and outer part of the ria) by scuba-diving at depths between 5 and 15 m. Thus, 20 samples of E. magnus were collected fortnightly/monthly during two years in order to study reproduction using the four following methodologies: gonad coverage (established by visually determining the percentage of coverage of the gonad), gonad smear (a new scale was created describing the follicles), gonadal condition index (GCI: gonad fresh weight/dry shell weight) and histology. The proportion of broken clams was recorded by the divers. Besides, 113 sites separated 50 m between them and distributed throughout the main beds of the ria were sampled by scuba diving in the shallower points and using a box corer in the deeper ones. The collected sand was sieved and processed by binocular microscope to calculate the recruit (size < 2 cm) density at each site. Finally, 110 samples were collected in each bed to estimate the age. The reproductive cycle was characterized by a resting stage during summer and early autumn, initiation of gametogenesis in autumn and a period of successive spawning interspersed with gonad recovery during winter and spring (Fig. 1). However, differences in the reproductive cycle were detected between study sites. Thus, a 15 -day to one month delay in advanced stages of gametogenesis and maturation was observed between the inner and the outermost fishing beds of the ria, as well as an extended spawning period in the outermost bed. In view of these results, the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> fishery in the Ría de Pontevedra has adapted the rotation scheme to the reproductive cycle, moving the harvesting from the inner to the outer bed during the maturation period and from the outer to the inner bed at the end of the spawning period. Size at first maturity was determined in 79 mm, lower than the commercial size established for the species (100 mm). A simple tool to monitor the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> gonad development stage was created based on a correspondence table which linked the easiest and fastest reproductive study methods (gonad coverage and gonad smear) to the most accurate but more time consuming methods (GCI and histology). Gonad coverage was confirmed as a good descriptor of the reproductive cycle of the sword <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> because it changed considerably along the sexual development, following exactly the same evolution as the GCI used. Moreover, the gonad smear could be used to identify the maturation period, complementing the gonad coverage method. Using these methods, the reproductive stage of the <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> could be monitored by TAs. Besides, a relationship between gonadal development and the proportion of broken <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> was observed as most broken <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> appeared during maturity, postspawning and gonad recovery (Fig. 1). This information could be incorporated in the daily management of the fishery since the Galician harvesting plans allows adaptive management according to stock characteristics, such as the reproductive state, at any time (Fig. 2). Monitoring the gonad development stage could prevent the highest <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> breakage and contribute to reduce as much as possible the discards. Although the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> recruits were not easily found due to the burrowing behaviour and the final recruitment density was too low (average of 120 recruits per m 2) to explain the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> production (34 adults per m 2), the recruitment was higher (390 recruits per m 2) at the shallowest points of the innermost bed of Brensa. The acetate peel technique proved to be the most suitable method for growth estimate and equivalence between methods is not possible (Hernández Otero et al. 2014). Following the acetate peel method, the growth of E. magnus is faster during the first three years of life, declines at about four–six years old and almost ceases in subsequent years, with the organisms entering into an asymptotic phase around the age of eight-nine years (Fig. 3). The mean population length is attained at four-five years. As observed by the fishers, growth differences were found between beds with the slower growth observed in the middle area (L∞ = 140. 4, k = 0. 40) followed by the innermost one (L∞ = 151. 91, k = 0. 40) and the outermost one (L∞ = 172. 7, k = 0. 33) reaching commercial size in 2. 8, 2. 3 and 1. 7 years respectively. Some of the findings of the present study are being applied since 2011 in the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> fishery of the Ría de Pontevedra leading to a more efficient and sustainable exploitation and contributing to its certification as a sustainable fishery by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC).

40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} design of two scaled {{mechanical}} end effectors that mimic the digging of Ensis directus, the Atlantic <b>Razor</b> <b>Clam.</b> Modeled after a 0. 5 x Ensis scale device, the end effectors are 1. 0 x and 2. 0 x Ensis scale. The end effectors will be coupled to a pneumatic robotic actuator to explore the nondimensional relationships governing the digging dynamics of <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> in littoral substrates. Such dynamics could be exploited to construct novel mimetic engineering devices which would provide an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing subsea burrowing and anchoring technologies. by Mario Attilio Bollini.

40|$|RoboClam is a {{burrowing}} technology {{inspired by}} Ensis directus, the Atlantic <b>razor</b> <b>clam.</b> Atlantic <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> {{should only be}} strong enough to dig a few centimeters into the soil, yet they burrow to over 70 cm. The animal uses a clever trick to achieve this: by contracting its body, it agitates and locally fluidizes the soil, reducing the drag and energetic cost of burrowing. RoboClam technology, which is based on the digging mechanics of <b>razor</b> <b>clams,</b> may be valuable for subsea applications that could benefit from efficient burrowing, such as anchoring, mine detonation, and cable laying. We directly visualize the movement of soil grains during the contraction of RoboClam, using a novel index-matching technique along with particle tracking. We show that the size of the failure zone around contracting RoboClam can be theoretically predicted from the substrate and pore fluid properties, provided that the timescale of contraction is sufficiently large. We also show that the nonaffine motions of the grains are {{a small fraction of the}} motion within the fluidized zone, affirming the relevance of a continuum model for this system, even though the grain size is comparable to the size of RoboClam.

40|$|Residual {{antibiotics}} from aquacultural farming may alter {{microbial community}} structure in aquatic environments {{in ways that}} may adversely or positively impact microbially-mediated ecological functions. This study investigated 26 ponds (26 composited samples) used to produce fish, <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> and shrimp (farming and drying) and 2 channels (10 samples) in a saltwater aquacultural farm in southern China to characterize microbial community structure (represented by phospholipid fatty acids) in surface sediments (0 - 10 cm) with long-term exposure to residual antibiotics. II out of 14 widely-used antibiotics were quantifiable at mu g kg(- 1) levels in sediments but their concentrations did not statistically differ among ponds and channels, except norfloxacin in drying shrimp ponds and thiamphenicol in <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> ponds. Concentrations of protozoan PLFAs were significantly increased in sediments from <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> ponds while other microbial groups were similar among ponds and channels. Both canonical-correlation and stepwise-multiple-regression analyses on microbial community and residual antibiotics suggested that roxithromycin residuals {{were significantly related to}} shifts in microbial community structure in sediments. This study provided field evidence that multiple residual antibiotics at low environmental levels from aquacultural farming do not produce fundamental shifts in microbial community structure.
