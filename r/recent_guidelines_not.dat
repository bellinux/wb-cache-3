30|$|Ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (VAP) {{is common}} in intensive care patients and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates [1]. To improve outcomes, nebulised antibiotic therapy has been recommended for prevention [2] and treatment of VAP [3]. However, there is controversy, with <b>recent</b> <b>guidelines</b> <b>not</b> recommending the use of nebulised antibiotics, citing a lack of robust effectiveness data, possibly due to inadequate trial designs and/or ineffective drug delivery [4]. Antibiotic nebulisation can potentially be {{a viable alternative to}} conventional therapy for lung infection because if administered appropriately, it should enable high lung antibiotic concentrations without significant side effects [5]. However, {{there are a number of}} factors involved in achieving optimal delivery [6, 7], which need to be characterised to ensure desired concentrations are achieved. These include physicochemical properties of the antibiotics, tracheal tube size and type [7 – 9], besides factors associated with mechanical ventilation such as ventilator settings, circuit-related factors, nebuliser factors and patient-related factors such as airway geometry and patency [7]. Due to methodological limitations, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of nebulised antibiotics during mechanical ventilation is not well understood.|$|E
30|$|Introduction In {{large-scale}} trials, {{endotracheal intubation}} (EI) associated with mechanical ventilation is performed in 40 – 85  % {{of patients with}} septic shock possibly indicating an important variation in practice across physicians. No study has been dedicated until now to define the place of this procedure in shock patients, and <b>recent</b> <b>guidelines</b> does <b>not</b> put forward any recommendation. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the characteristics associated with endotracheal intubation in septic shock patients.|$|R
40|$|General {{management}} of severe acute pancreatitis Severe acute pancreatitis remains a very challenging disease with multiple complications and high mortality. As early identification and aggressive treatment of associated organ dysfunction can exert {{a major impact}} on outcome, early assessment of prognosis and severity is important. Supportive therapy includes vigorous hydration, analgesia, and pharmacological or mechanical support targeted towards specific organ dysfunctions. The most <b>recent</b> <b>guidelines</b> do <b>not</b> recommend the use prophylactic antibiotics. Enteral nutrition via a nasojejunal tube has become the preferred feeding route. The available evidence indicates that patients with severe acute pancreatitis do not benefit from a therapy with available antisecretory drugs or protease inhibitors. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Replantation of an avulsed tooth is an {{invasive}} proce-dure {{that requires}} informed {{consent of the}} patientor parent and {{the cooperation of the}} patient. Informed consent requires the dentist to know and explain the range of outcomes that include survival prospects, possible effects of replantation on future interventions and costs associated with the decision to replant a tooth. Because replantation is such a rare occurrence, dentists often consult published guidelines or information posted on dental association Web sites. Unfortunately, even <b>recent</b> <b>guidelines</b> do <b>not</b> address the question of whether it is in the patient’s best interests to replant a tooth. 1 Other <b>guidelines</b> do <b>not</b> include information from recent basic science, clinical and socioeconomic investigations or they include untested “treatments. ” 1 – 3 As a consequence, dentists make recommendations and provide treatment for this rare injury based on information that is neither current no...|$|R
40|$|Resistant {{hypertension}} is {{an important}} public health issue, affecting 10 % of treated hypertensive patients. These patients are the most affected by target organ damage and high cardiovascular event rates, presenting higher levels of morbidity and costs for the national health system. The treatment of resistant hypertension presents a challenging task for the clinicians despite the greater awareness to the issue and the improvements {{at the level of}} the treatment of these patients. Indeed, it is unclear whether the administration of 25 mg of spironolactone is the most appropriate therapeutic strategy for these patients. The range of alternative treatments is large and the most <b>recent</b> <b>guidelines</b> are <b>not</b> prescriptive about the best choice of treatment The aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled triple-blind trial to compare two different approaches for resistant hypertensive patients: routine treatment with 25 mg spironolactone or treatment according to the hemodynamic study- Impedance Cardiography in the improvement of blood pressure control. This study will be conducted in Hospital Entre o Douro e Vouga E. P. E. (CHEDV), Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal. CHEDV is responsible for supporting 25 Primary Health Care Centers, from where the sample of 982 true resistant hypertensive patients will be taken.

40|$|AbstractThe role of interferon-γ release assays in the {{diagnosis}} of active tuberculosis disease is uncertain, and <b>recent</b> <b>guidelines</b> do <b>not</b> support their routine use. We reviewed the clinical records of 415 patients who had a QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay between 29 June 2005 and 28 October 2010 to determine its performance in {{the diagnosis}} of active tuberculosis disease in a low prevalence setting, specifically in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -positive and HIV-negative patients, those of UK and non-UK origin, and those with pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease. For the diagnosis of active tuberculosis disease the overall sensitivity of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay was 71. 4 % (95 % CI 59. 3 – 81. 1), specificity was 81. 0 % (95 % CI 75. 5 – 85. 6) and negative predictive value was 92. 6 % (95 % CI 88. 2 – 95. 5). No significant difference in sensitivity was seen in culture-positive and culture-negative tuberculosis, in pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, or with HIV infection. Specificity and negative predictive value were significantly higher in patients of UK origin {{compared with those of}} non-UK origin (89. 3 % (95 % CI 83. 3 – 93. 3) and 97. 1 % (95 % CI 92. 7 – 98. 9) versus 66. 3 % (95 % CI 55. 6 – 75. 5) and 83. 3 % (95 % CI 72. 6 – 90. 4)). Our study suggests {{that there may be a}} role for interferon-γ release assays in excluding active tuberculosis disease, particularly extrapulmonary disease, in patients originating from areas of low tuberculosis incidence, with a negative test highly predictive of a lack of active tuberculosis disease in this group. We cannot support the use of these assays {{in the diagnosis}} of active tuberculosis infection in patients from areas of higher incidence...|$|R

40|$|Background Treatment of splanchnic vein {{thrombosis}} (SVT) is challenging {{due to the}} heterogeneous clinical presentation and the increased bleeding risk. We aimed to describe current treatment strategies and factors associated with therapeutic decisions. Materials and Methods Between May 2008 and January 2012, consecutive SVT patients were included in an international registry collecting information on etiology, diagnostic process and therapeutic management. Results During the acute phase, 474 (77. 5 %) of the 613 included patients were treated with anticoagulant drugs: unfractionated heparin (10. 4 %), low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux (67. 2 %), vitamin K antagonists (VKA) (48. 9 %). Four patients received aspirin. Surgery and thrombolysis were performed in 3. 1 % and 1. 5 % whereas 130 patients (21. 2 %) were untreated. Of patients with incidentally diagnosed SVT, 63. 3 % received anticoagulant treatment. The decision not to treat patients {{was significantly associated with}} incidental diagnosis, single {{vein thrombosis}}, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, cancer and cirrhosis. Treated patients had significantly more history of venous thrombosis, myeloproliferative neoplasm, surgery and hormonal treatment. Within one month from diagnosis, 300 patients were started on VKA. These patients were significantly younger and had more symptomatic onset, multiple vein involvement and unprovoked thrombosis than patients not started on VKA. Conversely, 174 patients were maintained on parenteral anticoagulation, especially if anemia, thrombocytopenia, cancer and cirrhosis were present. Currently, information on clinical events during the first month is available for 551 patients, showing 5 thrombosis extensions (2 treated and 3 untreated patients), 4 major bleeding (2 in each group) and 11 deaths (7 and 4, respectively). Conclusions Despite the increased bleeding risk and <b>recent</b> <b>guidelines</b> suggesting <b>not</b> to treat incidentally detected SVTs, 77. 5 % of newly diagnosed SVTs receive anticoagulant therapy in clinical practice. Longstanding parenteral drugs are often used in patients at perceived higher bleeding risk. The longterm follow up will provide additional data on thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications...|$|R
