50|$|Direct laser {{engraving}} of flexographic printing cylinders and plates {{has been an}} established process since the 1970s. This first began {{with the use of}} a carbon dioxide laser used to selectively ablate or evaporate a variety of <b>rubber</b> <b>plate</b> and sleeve materials to produce a print ready surface without the use of photography or chemicals. With this process there is no integral ablation mask as with direct photopolymer laser imaging (see below). Instead a high-power carbon dioxide laser head burns away, or ablates, unwanted material. The aim is to form sharp, relief images with steep first relief and contoured shoulder supported edges to give a high standard of process color reproduction. A short water wash and dry cycle follows, which is a lot less involved than in the post-processing stages for direct laser imaging or conventional flexo platemaking using photopolymer plates. After engraving, the photopolymer is exposed through the imaged black layer and washed out in the traditional photopolymer process requiring photography and chemicals. See below.|$|E

50|$|A game {{is played}} between two teams, each {{composed}} of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat {{and one in the}} field, by each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings {{at the high school level}} and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues). One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond. A player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise to first base, second base, third base, and back home in order to score a run. The team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring and to record outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's batting order comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.The {{game is played}} on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a detailed numerical investigation on the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) test case presented in Kalmbach and Breuer (Journal of Fluids and Structures, 42, (2013), pp. 369 - 387). It relies on detailed experimental investigations on the fluid flow and the structure deformation using modern optical measurement techniques such as particle-image velocimetry and laser triangulation sensors. The present numerical study is based on an efficient partitioned FSI coupling scheme especially developed for turbulent flow simulations around light-weight structures using large-eddy simulation. The current FSI configuration is composed of a fixed cylinder with a flexible thin <b>rubber</b> <b>plate</b> and a rear mass inducing a turbulent flow (Re = 30, 470). Mainly based on a movement-induced excitation the flexible structure oscillates in the second swiveling mode involving large deformations. Thus, particular attention has been paid to the computational model and the numerical set-up. Special seven-parameters shell elements are applied to precisely model the flexible structure. Structural tests are carried out to approximate the optimal structural parameters. A fine and smooth fluid mesh has been generated in order to correctly predict the wide range of different flow structures presents near and behind the flexible <b>rubber</b> <b>plate.</b> A phase-averaging is applied to the numerical results obtained, so that they can be compared with the phase-averaged experimental data. Both are found to be in close agreement exhibiting a structure deformation in the second swiveling mode with similar frequencies and amplitudes. Finally, a sensitivity study is carried out to show the influence of different physical parameters (e. g. Young’s modulus) and modeling aspects (e. g. subgrid-scale model) on the FSI phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the highly}} damping nature of rubber, it is {{difficult}} to characterize its dynamic elastic properties using classical methods. In this paper, an experimental approach employing laser excited guided acoustic waves is proposed to accurately determine the real and imaginary part of the longitudinal and shear elastic modulus of a rubber layer. From the spatiotemporal evolution of a propagating laser excited Lamb wave measured by a laser Doppler vibrometer, which is scanning along a line perpendicular to a line of excitation, the phase velocity dispersion curves in the wave number - frequency domain are obtained. The results are interpreted in the framework of a detailed semianalytical study, analyzing the influence of elastic damping on the Lamb dispersion curves. This analysis is exploited to adequately fit the experimental dispersion curves and thus extract information about the elastic moduli and absorption coefficients of the <b>rubber</b> <b>plate.</b> The results are validated by a pulse-echo measurement, and by guided wave propagation results with the rubber layer connected in a bi-layer plate configuration to non-damping plates. status: publishe...|$|E

The reflectivity of MMA samples were measured by the NRL-arch testing systems.

Moreover, after proposing double FSS layers in a proper arrangement, the MMA sample with the thickness of only 1. 8 mm could obtain peak value of – 9. 35 dB and the reflectivity value of – 3. 49 dB at 1 GHz, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to determine whether hydrophilic and hygroscopic particulate pollutants on glass and silicone insulator surfaces maintain their electrical and water absorption properties, once low molecular weight siloxanes have migrated through the pollution layer. Surface conductivity measurements were performed on glass and silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>plates</b> (HTV and RTV) under conditions of extremely high humidity. Test dusts from the Sahara and Negev Deserts, from Glogow insulator pollution test station (Poland), fly-ash and also standard kaolin were applied in a laboratory to virgin glass and <b>rubber</b> <b>plates.</b> It was found that the value of the surface conductivity measured on the HTV silicone rubber is similar to that on virgin glass. This is true even after time is allowed for possible hydrophobicity transfer to the applied hygroscopic pollution dust. Surface conductivity on RTV silicone rubber with dusts, applied two weeks earlier, was 30 % to 60 % lower than on a freshly polluted sample. Surface conductivity measured at 100 % humidity, increases, where the final surface conductivity depends on the dust type, yet is considerably lower than the surface conductivity measured on a sample wetted by a sufficient amount of water. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} behaviour of carbon black rubber at moderate strain (0 - 25 % engineering strain). Experimental testing in uniaxial, equi-biaxial and planar tension under cyclic quasi-static loading shows strain-induced stress softening, hysteresis {{and a certain}} amount of unrecoverable strain. The data obtained from experiments is first simplified assuming a preconditioned perfectly elastic material, and then fitted to popular hyperelastic models in the finite element analysis (FEA) software ANSYS™. A biaxiality test is developed, providing information on the dominant mode of simple strain in the elements of a FE model, and selecting the most appropriate hyperelastic model for the simulation. A two-iteration Preconditioning Method is developed to approximate the softening effect of cyclic loading in a static FEA simulation with hyperelastic material properties. FEA simulations and experimental tests of a cantilevered <b>rubber</b> <b>plate</b> subjected to a bending load at its free end are presented in this paper.

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{investigated}} theoretically {{the influence of}} sliding speed and temperature on the hysteretic friction {{in case of a}} smooth, reciprocating steel ball sliding on smooth <b>rubber</b> <b>plate</b> by finite element method (FEM). Generalized Maxwell-models combined with Mooney-Rivlin model have been used to describe the material behaviour of the ethylenepropylene-diene-monomer (EPDM) rubber studied. Additionally, the effect of the technique applied at the parameter identification of the material model and the number of Maxwell elements on the coefficient of friction (COF) was also investigated. Finally, the open parameter of the Greenwood-Tabor analytical model has been determined from a fit to the FE results. By fitting, as usual, the Maxwell-model to the storage modulus master curve the predicted COF, in a broad frequency range, will be underestimated even in case of 40 -term Maxwell-model. To obtain more accurate numerical prediction or to provide an upper limit for the hysteretic friction, in the interesting frequency range, the Maxwell parameters should be determined, as proposed, from a fit to the measured loss factor master curve. This conclusion can be generalized for all the FE simulations where the hysteresis plays an important role...|$|E
