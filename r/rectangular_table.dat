25|$|The end of wet season farming {{ends with}} Xantolo. It {{is similar to}} Day of the Dead and celebrated at the same time, but it has {{important}} differences. Xantolo brings people to cemeteries as well but it is to celebrate {{the living and the}} dead, as it marks the harvest of this growing season. Preparations for Xantolo last a week with altars remaining through November. Gifts of food are prepared to exchange with god parents, friends, family and neighbors. Altars consist of arches over a <b>rectangular</b> <b>table.</b> Each corner of the table has a pole to represent the four stages of human life (childhood, adolescence, adult and old age). The poles are bent towards the center above the table to form arches, and covered with branches of local flora. It shares certain elements with Day of the Dead such as cempasúchil flowers, papel picado and the creation of altars to the dead adorned with local fruit, candles and copal incense. It lasts from 29 October with the slaughter of pigs and turkeys. October 30 and 31 are for the remembrance of children and adults respectively and November 1 is not only for saints but also to honor godparents. A traditional dance for the event has groups of dancers who ridicule the powerful of the local society then are chained by a devil. These dancers perform with cloth masks, with the aim that Death does not recognize them and take them away.|$|E

50|$|Cocktail {{cabinets}} {{are shaped}} like low, <b>rectangular</b> <b>tables,</b> with the controls usually set at {{either of the}} broad ends, or, though not as common, at the narrow ends, and the monitor inside the table, the screen facing upward. Two-player games housed in cocktails were usually alternant, each player taking turns. The monitor reverses its orientation (game software controlled) for each player, so that everything seems right-side-up from each perspective. This requires special programming of the cocktail versions of the game (usually set by dip switches). The monitor's orientation is usually in player two's favour only in two-player games when it's player two's turn, and in player one's favour all other times. Simultaneous, 4 player games that are built as a cocktail include Warlords, and others.|$|R

Additions may include a chopstick holder; a large water or wine glass; and a smaller glass for baijiu. At homes and low-end restaurants, napkins may consist of tissues or occasionally must be provided by the diner.

40|$|This paper, by {{a parent}} {{of a child with}} severe mental and {{physical}} disabilities, discusses why parent/professional teaming is important to maximize benefits for children and youth with severe disabilities. It recounts the family's experience with the impact of disability. Strategies for effective parent/professional teaming are outlined, stressing the importance of professionals understanding parents as individuals, and the value of empathy, respect, and efforts toward true collaboration. Specific suggestions cover inclusion of parents in team meetings, joint development of Individualized Education Programs, personal communication with parents, avoidance of jargon, use of round (rather than <b>rectangular)</b> <b>tables</b> in meetings, careful planning for meetings, inclusion of the student (and sometimes siblings) in meetings, encouraging parents to bring a relative or friend, use of a comfortable communication style, follow up of meetings with a thank you note, and involvement of parents {{at all levels of the}} education system.

40|$|In {{statistical}} practice, <b>rectangular</b> <b>tables</b> of {{numeric data}} are commonplace, {{and are often}} analyzed using dimension reduction methods like the singular value decomposition (SVD) and its close cousin, principal component analysis (PCA). This analysis produces score and loading matrices representing the rows and the columns of the original table and these matrices {{may be used for}} both prediction purposes and to gain structural understanding of the data. In some tables, the data entries are necessarily non-negative (apart, perhaps, from some small random noise), and so the matrix factors meant to represent them should arguably also contain only non-negative elements. This thinking, and the desire for parsimony, underlies such techniques as rotating factors in a search for “simple structure. ” These attempts to transform score or loading matrices of mixed sign into nonnegative, parsimonious forms are however indirect and at best imperfect. The recent development of non-negative matrix factorization, or NMF, is an attractive alternative. Rather than attempt to transform a loading or score matrix of mixed signs into one with only non-negative elements, it directly seeks matrix factors containing only non-negative elements. The resulting factorization often leads to substantial improvements in interpretability of the factors. We illustrate this potentia...|$|R

We will also learn how to use MATLAB as a computer tool for implementing our algorithms and producing cool, important, realistic, and interesting results. Or so we hope. 2 Mathematical concepts 2. 1 Vectors and matrices A vector is an ordered collection of numerical values. In most applications, these values are real, and the vector is called a real vector. But we can also speak of integer, rational, and even complex (see further) vectors. The number of entries in a vector is called the dimension. The standard mathematical notation for a vector is ⃗x = x = ⎜ x 1 x 2 xn ⎠, or ⃗x = x = (x 1, x 2, [...] ., xn) for columns and rows respectively. The ith entry is denoted xi. Matrices are <b>rectangular</b> <b>tables</b> or arrays of values. Each column and each row of a matrix represents a vector. So we can associate a matrix with a collection of individual vectors arranged in a certain order. Just like vectors, matrices can be real, integer, rational, or complex. A matrix has two dimensions: n- the number of rows, and m-the number of columns. We will refer to it as an n × m matrix. The standard matrix notation i...|$|R
