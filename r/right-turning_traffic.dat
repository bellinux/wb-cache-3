40|$|Intersection {{traffic delay}} {{research}} has traditionally placed {{greater emphasis on}} the study of through and left-turning vehicles than right-turning ones, which often renders existing methods or models inapplicable to intersections with heavy pedestrian and non-motorized traffic. In the meantime, there is also a need for understanding the relations between different types of delay and how they each contribute to the total delay of the entire intersection. In order to address these issues, this paper first examines models that focus on through and left-turn traffic delays, taking into account the presence of heavy mixed traffic flows that are prevalent in developing countries, then establishes a model for calculating <b>right-turn</b> <b>traffic</b> delay and, last, proposes an approach to analyzing how much each of the three types of traffic delay contributes to the total delay of the intersection, based on the application of shift-share analysis (SSA), which has been applied extensively in the field of economics...|$|R
50|$|In {{the state}} of Victoria, some intersections of this type employ a turn arrow without the red arrow. This would turn green with the main signal, before turning yellow, then off, giving {{priority}} to oncoming traffic. The nationwide standard seems to now include a red arrow that turns off. This arrow turns red simultaneously with the main light. After the cross traffic has had its turn, the arrows on opposite sides would both turn green, until one side runs out of <b>right-turn</b> <b>traffic.</b> In any case, when {{both sides of the}} intersection turn green, the corresponding arrow will turn off after a short delay, thus working similarly to the old Victorian standard. This method has the advantage of being controlled during peak-hours, where controllers would be able to prevent the arrow from turning off in extreme peak-hour traffic, but causes confusion as drivers expect a light to be on when three are present.|$|R

40|$|Unlike {{the typical}} stage-based policy {{commonly}} applied in Japan, the group-based control (often called movement-based in the traffic control industry in Japan) refers {{to such a}} control pattern that the controller is capable of separately allocating time to each signal group instead of stage based on traffic demand. In order to investigate its applicability at signalized intersections in Japan, an intersection located in Yokkaichi City of Mie Prefecture was selected as an experimental application site by the Japan Universal Traffic Management Society (UTMS). Based on the data collected at the intersection before and after implementing the group-based control policy respectively, this study evaluated the impacts of such a policy on driver behavior and intersection safety. To specify those impacts, a few models utilizing cycle-based data were first developed to interpret the occurrence probability and rate of red-light-running (RLR). Furthermore, analyses were performed on the yellow-entry time (Ye) of the last cleared vehicle and post encroachment time (PET) during the phase switching. Conclusions supported that the group-based control policy, along with certain other factors, directly or indirectly influenced the RLR behavior of through and <b>right-turn</b> <b>traffics.</b> Meanwhile, it has potential safety benefits as well, indicated by the declined Ye and increased PET values...|$|R

50|$|A stack {{interchange}} is a four-way interchange whereby a semi-directional {{left turn}} and a directional right turn are both available. Usually access to both turns is provided simultaneously {{by a single}} offramp. Assuming right-handed driving, in order to cross over incoming traffic and go left, vehicles first exit onto an off-ramp from the rightmost lane. After demerging from <b>right-turning</b> <b>traffic,</b> they complete their left turn by crossing both highways on a flyover ramp or underpass. The penultimate step is a merge with the right-turn on-ramp traffic from the opposite quadrant of the interchange. Finally an onramp merges both streams of incoming traffic into the left-bound highway. As {{there is only one}} offramp and one onramp (in that respective order), stacks do not suffer from the problem of weaving, and due to the semi-directional flyover ramps and directional ramps, they are generally safe and efficient at handling high traffic volumes in all directions.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill, the roadway re-divides and resumes having two lanes in each direction. Through this area, the roadway is {{completely}} undeveloped, as the road traverses a flat that is only the width of the road. Drivers can look out and over the eastern edge of development, once exclusively large stately homes, but now some businesses and smaller starter homes, along Route 302 in Berlin. [...] The road enters a more developed area of Barre city, and the speed limit is reduced to 40 mph. Shortly after is an intersection with Berlin Street, the historic road from the North End of Barre to Berlin (hence its name). Turning left from East 62 onto Berlin Street is a shortcut to Route 302, particularly west, used by some locals. However, at that street's intersection with 302, a large building creates a significant blind spot requiring drivers to partially obstruct traffic on 302 to see around it. A traffic island at the intersection that does not prohibit, but by its design discourages, all left turns at the intersection, makes it worth a driver's time to continue on Route 62. As Route 62 has supplanted the original purpose of Berlin Street, right turns from either direction are usually taken by local traffic only. Thus, unlike the other intersections, <b>right-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> shares the travel lane with through traffic.|$|E
40|$|An {{intersection}} {{with heavy}} right-turn volumes, without any reduction, might mislead a signal warrant analysis, {{and a different}} conclusion may be reached on whether a signal is warranted. Previous right-turn volume reduction methods based mostly on engineering judgment lack specific theoretical backgrounds. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method with theoretical justification. The method focuses on traffic operation principles centered on finding the delay equivalent relationship between <b>right-turn</b> and through <b>traffic,</b> that is, to equate the right-turn volume to through vehicles to produce the same control delay on a minor street. Equivalent factor tables were constructed {{on the basis of}} four geometric configurations. Combining with the various traffic volume distributions, more than 12, 000 scenarios were analyzed. The volume ratio in the two directions of the main street was especially considered. The analysis showed that the uneven volume distribution in the main street had a greater effect on the minor-street right-turn movement. To use the equivalent factors efficiently, statistical regression models were developed. Last, the proposed method was applied to one signal warrant case and demonstrated promising results for its practical application in traffic signal warrant analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new risk-averse user {{equilibrium}} (RAUE) model {{to estimate the}} distribution of traffic flows over road networks with taking account the effects of accident risks due to the conflicting traffic flows (left- and <b>right-turning</b> and through <b>traffic</b> flows) at signalized intersections. It is assumed in the proposed model that drivers consider simultaneously both the travel time and accident risk in their route choices. The accident risk of a route {{is measured by the}} potential accident rate on that route. The RAUE conditions are formulated as an equivalent path-based variational inequality problem which can be solved by a path-based solution algorithm. It is shown that the traditional user equilibrium (UE) model is in fact a special case of the proposed model. A numerical example on a grid network is used to illustrate the application of the proposed model and to compare the results with the conventional UE traffic assignment. Numerical results show that the traditional UE model may underestimate the total system travel time and overestimate the system accident rate. Sensitivity tests are also carried out to assess the effects of drivers' preferences, signal control parameters (i. e., green time proportions), and various network demand levels on the route choice problem.

40|$|Analysis of {{the right}} turn lane length of urban roads in {{left-hand}} traffic countries, such as Australia, UK and India (left-turn lane length in right-hand traffic countries such as USA), at signalised intersections encounters two main geometric features namely, deceleration length and storage length. The literature shows that in routine practice, the deceleration length is generally estimated by using constant deceleration rate. Many researchers consider this assumption for all design speeds unrealistic as it {{does not reflect the}} influence of the pavement condition. Hence, it may be desirable to consider the pavement’s condition in terms of its longitudinal coefficient of friction in the design analysis. In regard to the storage length, a large number of the current guidelines and models estimate the storage length of right-turn lane at signalised intersections under split phase. Hence, {{there is a need to}} examine other phase types and timings and integrate the signal timing as a part of the geometric design In this thesis, two analytical expressions have been analysed for the design of deceleration length. The first expression assumes a constant deceleration rate, and the second expression employs the concept of forces on a rotating wheel in which the coefficient of longitudinal friction between a vehicle’s tyres and the road surface is considered. The calculated deceleration lengths by these two expressions were compared with the recommended values in American and Australian standards as well as with the deceleration lengths that were obtained by a recent simulation study presented in the literature. It has been found that applying a constant deceleration rate of 2. 74 m/s 2 in the first expression provides the values of deceleration length comparable to most guidelines and studies. The second expression highlights the importance of using the pavement design in terms of the coefficient of friction to reduce the deceleration length in the case of limited space. A MATLAB based simulation programme has been developed to provide an estimate {{of the right}}-turn lane storage length for different traffic volumes in order to avoid the problems associated with blocking and overflow of right turn vehicles in 95 % of cycles. In established intersections that cannot be modified due to physical constraints, the model is flexible enough to examine different signal phase types and timings and provides other solutions to reduce overflow and/or blockage situations. The simulation model also takes into consideration the leftover queue. The model results have been compared against an available analytical method in which similar signal phases and timings were investigated. The outcomes are similar to those of the analytical model in most of the signal phase types. The simulation model provides the flexibility to estimate the right-turn lane length for different combinations of through lane and <b>right-turn</b> lane <b>traffic</b> volumes. The developed simulation model has also been validated against the field data using three parameters, namely 95 th percentile of maximum queue, overflow cycle percentage, and blockage cycle percentage. Comparing with the field observations yields a level of accuracy in the range of 78 %- 85 %. Finally this simulation model has been used to optimise the green time in the case of split phase that demonstrates a large difference in traffic volumes of two opposite approaches; this could reduce the mean wait time by up to 28 %...|$|R

This island {{is similar to the}} traffic island provided in the center portion of a single point urban interchange and should be designed considering the design vehicle swept path. A painted island could be adequate for a single point urban interchange serving homogeneous traffic; however, for heterogeneous traffic with weak lane discipline, a raised traffic island is suggested. In the proposed layout, the concept of “least control is the best control” for traffic management is not followed because heterogeneous traffic with weak lane discipline requires additional guidance and control to enhance traffic safety.|$|E
40|$|Highway Capacity Manual 2010 {{provides}} {{various factors}} {{to adjust the}} base saturation flow rate for the capacity analysis of signalized intersections. No factors, however, is considered for the potential change of signalized intersections capacity caused by the access point closeing to the signalized intersection. This paper presented a theoretical model to estimate the lane group capacity at signalized intersections with the consideration {{of the effects of}} access points. Two scenarios of access point locations, upstream or downstream of the signalized intersection, and impacts of six types of access traffic flow are taken into account. The proposed capacity model was validated based on VISSIM simulation. Results of extensive numerical analysis reveal the substantial impact of access point on the capacity, which has an inverse correlation with both the number of major street lanes and the distance between the intersection and access point. Moreover, among the six types of access traffic flows, the access traffic flow 1 (<b>right-turning</b> <b>traffic</b> from major street), flow 4 (left-turning traffic from access point), and flow 5 (left-turning traffic from major street) cause a more significant effect on lane group capacity than others.

40|$|Guidelines {{for the use}} of right-turn lanes at {{access points}} on urban two-lane and four-lane {{sections}} of the state highway system in Nebraska were developed in this research. The guidelines are {{based on the results of}} a benefit-cost analysis conducted over the range of conditions representative of those on urban sections of the state highway system in Nebraska. The guidelines define the design hour traffic volumes for which the benefits of right-turn lanes exceed their costs. The benefits used in the analysis were operational and accident cost savings they provide to road users. The operational cost savings were those associated with reductions in stops, delay, and fuel consumption experienced by through traffic. These operational effects were determined by computer simulation. The accident cost savings were those associated with the reduction in accidents expected from the lower speed differences between <b>right-turning</b> and through <b>traffic</b> provided by <b>right-turn</b> lanes. The relationship between speed differential and accidents established by Solomon (14) was used to estimate the reduction in rearend accidents that would be expected to result from the provision of a right-turn lane. The right-turn lane costs used in the development of the guidelines were typical right-turn lane construction costs on urban sections of the state highway system in Nebraska. These costs were computed as a function of roadway speed and right-of-way cost. The right-of-way costs used included zero for construction within the existing right-of-way and values representative of low, medium, and high urban right-of-way costs in Nebraska. ^ The guidelines define the right-turn design hour volume required to justify a right-turn lane as a function of the following factors: (1) directional design hour volume, (2) roadway speed, (3) number of lanes on the roadway, and (4) right-of-way cost. The guidelines indicate that the right-turn design hour volume that warrants a right-turn lane is lower on roadways with higher directional design hour volumes and higher roadway speeds, because the road user costs associated with the operational and safety effects of right turns are greater on higher-volume, higher-speed roadways. Likewise, the right-turn design hour volume required to justify a right-turn lane on a two-lane roadway is lower than that on a four-lane roadway. Comparison with guidelines developed by others indicates that the guidelines developed in this research are within the range of existing guidelines. In addition, they are more definitive than the other guidelines because they account for the effects of roadway speed and right-of-way costs. ...|$|R
40|$|Heavy traffic volumes at signalized {{at-grade}} intersections {{on urban}} and suburban multilane divided highways may cause the traffic signal control system installed will not function efficiently which in turn will lead to congestions and excessive traffic delays. A favourable approach is to close such intersections except for left-turning movements only. This intersection closure is often coupled with provisions on midblock U-turns in the downstream to accommodate the <b>right-turning</b> <b>traffic.</b> A particular concern about a midblock U-turn {{is that it may}} result in safety and operational problems. This study is carried out to evaluate the merging gap of U-turning vehicles and to compare the reported gap with the gap values obtained from other researchers. The traffic delay of the U-turning vehicles was also evaluated. The data pertaining to the analysis of gap acceptance and rejection as well as the delay was abstracted from the video playbacks using X-Note Stopwatch application. The driver’s merging gap was analyzed using Greenshield, Raff and Probit methods. The result of the analysis indicates that the critical gap for drivers at a midblock U-turn facility is in the range of 4. 0 - 4. 5 seconds, which is much lower than the values obtained from studies carried out for American traffic characteristics. However, the traffic delay of U-turning vehicles cannot be concluded in this study due to the weak relationship obtained from the plot of the U-turning delay against nearside traffic volumes. Such a finding suggests the need for thorough study to be carried out to evaluate the current practice of U-turn facility design and assessment methods since traffic operations at such facility is different from those at on-ramp facilities where the design in based on the American Highway Capacity Manual...|$|E
