It is shown that the acceleration spectrum of the vibrational field {{is related to the}} pressure spectrum by a coupling factor which is a simple function of the radiation and mechanical resistance of the structure. The radiation resistance of a <b>ribbed</b> <b>panel</b> is studied as a function of frequency. The analysis predicts that ribbing increases the radiation resistance of the panel and hence its coupling to the acoustic field. The effect of various panel-rib boundary conditions is also considered. The results of experiments which were conducted to test the theory are reported. The agreement between theory and experiments is shown to be satisfactory...|$|E

First, a tool for estimating the wave propagation characteristics of one- and two-dimensional structures by k-space analysis is presented. This tool uses a concept of Inhomogeneous Wave Correlation with sparse measured or extracted data, and leads to the estimation of θ-dependent wavenumbers. Here, the method is employed with the sparse simulated and measured normal velocities {{of a set of}} <b>ribbed</b> <b>panels</b> and new insights into their k-space behavior are highlighted. Behavior is essentially characterized at low frequencies by structural orthotropy. Comparisons with homogenized data show very good agreement.

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of visual assessment grade on the residual flexural capacity of 46 existing precast concrete <b>ribbed</b> <b>panels</b> from different agricultural buildings was studied. Before the tests the panels were assessed on a 6 -point rating scale according to visually distinguishable corrosion deterioration. All panels, the ultimate load {{of which was}} lower than the control load, received grade 0 on the visual rating scale. Consequently, attention should be paid to panels where the concrete cover of longitudinal reinforcement has spalled (grade 0) which could {{be a sign of}} decreasing load capacity. The majority of panels with grade 0 exhibited larger deflections under load than panels with higher grades. Of the 46 panels tested flexural ductile failure was noticed at 36 panels.

The computer model of the panel under consideration, developed through selection of the finite element as a result of reshaping designated to ensure the formation of a plastic hinge in the points of junction between the principal element (the plate) and the stripes, makes it possible to perform a sufficiently accurate analysis of experimental and theoretical data of structures of ribbed panels under consideration. Application of the finite elements method in the course of development of computer models for the purpose of research of the process of shaping of ribbed panels at each stage of pumping of compressed air into the panel, makes it possible to assess the alteration of the stress-strained state of the structure and to identify the parameters of the new cylindrical <b>ribbed</b> <b>panel</b> {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, including such parameters as the radius of curvature R, swell ratio k р, and compression ratio k с...|$|E
40|$|The cost {{of housing}} in the U. S. {{continues}} to rise faster than household income. Innovative building materials and construction technologies {{have the potential to}} reduce housing construction costs. One strategy to do this is componentization. There is a longstanding trend towards the increased use of components in U. S. residential construction. One such type of component is the composite building panel, used for walls, roofs and floors. Presently the types of composite panels used in residential construction include pre-framed walls of standard construction and, more innovatively, structural foam core panels with wood or wood composite faces. This thesis focuses on the design of a panelized roofing system for residential construction. The roof was chosen for various reasons. It includes some of the most complicated geometrical and structural challenges. It is often the most difficult area of the house to frame conventionally. Its construction is a crucial step in getting the house weather tight. For these reasons and others builders have identified it as a prime target for innovation. The design of the panelized roof system is illustrated as a tree of decisions. The path traveled down this tree led to a <b>ribbed</b> <b>panel</b> spanning from eave to ridge. A design selection method developed by Stuart Pugh was used to design the connection details of the system. The interdisciplinary design process used to design the roof system is examined and evaluated in light of the results it yielded. Mock-ups, models and a full scale proof-of-concept structure were built. These constructions were used as learning tools during design and to demonstrate and evaluate the performance of the roof system design. by Jordan Lewis Dentz. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|The {{present study}} has its root in a {{need of the}} {{aircraft}} industry related to modeling of aircraft structures by the statistical energy analysis method. The measurement of the damping loss factor is more particularly addressed for complex structures showing low to high damping characteristics. The {{first part of this}} work is totally dedicated to the damping loss factor. Two much used methods are scrutinized: the decay rate method and the power input method. The efficiency of those methods is somewhat validated by the aid of the half-power bandwidth method. A parametric study using the finite element method is proposed and focuses on constant thickness <b>panels</b> and <b>ribbed</b> <b>panels.</b> The conclusions of this parametric study are further put to test by experimenting on various structures like flat aluminium panels, composite trim panels, sandwich panels and flat and curved <b>ribbed</b> aluminium <b>panels.</b> The boundary conditions are whether free-free or clamped. Different damping levels are added to the structure via viscoelastic constrained layer materials or by sound packages. The excitation is provided by both a hammer and a shaker. Notwithstanding the fact that the decay rate method does systematically under evaluates the damping level, it is nevertheless the most constant method as proven by both the numerical study and the experimental measurements. This conclusion is also valid for all tested structures. It evolved for <b>ribbed</b> <b>panels</b> that the physics of the structure plays a fundamental role for the power input method ability to measure damping loss factor. The second part of this work is devoted to two SEA applications. The first one compares structure-borne insertion loss and air-borne insertion loss of sound packages applied to a <b>ribbed</b> curved <b>panel</b> installed in the transmission loss facility. It is demonstrated that under high damping characteristics, both indicators are equivalent. The frame radiation influence on transmission loss of <b>ribbed</b> <b>panels</b> is also presented. The second SEA application presents the complete modeling of a fully furnished Q 400 aircraft. A total of four models are proposed. The biggest difference between the models resides in the sound package modeling strategy. The model leading to the best correlation is the single wall model where the trim panel is included in the noise control treatment applied onto the skin. The results are well correlating with the experimental results. It is demonstrated that the weaker link of the panel is the windows. Modeling the windows using an insertion loss in conjunction with conveniently measured damping loss factor yielded the best correlation...|$|R

Such a structural solution has several advantages over conventional plywood boards - weight and material savings {{are just some}} of them. However hollow core panels demand special attention to accurate structural design for selected loading scenarios. In order to acquire mechanical behaviour of plywood boards and rib-stiffened panels the ANSYS finite element (FE) calculation code has been employed linked with predefined design of computer experiments. Based on acquired mechanical responses from FE analysis metamodelling technique has been implemented to optimise cross-section parameters of <b>rib</b> stiffened <b>panels.</b> Optimisation results demonstrated that such a strategy allows to obtain an optimum solutions and to substitute conventional thick plywood boards (h> 30 mm) with equivalently stiff hollow core sandwich alternative. This could be of particular interest for applications where bending is dominating load case and structure span length is at least 20 times larger than thickness. In such a case weight reduction of plywood hollow-core panels may reach up to 45 %, comparing with conventional plywood boards.
