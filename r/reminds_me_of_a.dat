Her alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, [...] " [...] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill [...] vocal delivery. She kind of <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions." ...|$|E

[...] They got {{matching}} tattoos of each other's initials; in Wood's case, a [...] "J" [...] on her left ankle. After a year together, the relationship ended in 2006. Wood later commented that, [...] "We had matching tattoos because we knew our love would last forever. Trouble is, it didn't, things happened, we split. But I don't regret the tattoo. It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great, great period in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Harding's vague oratory irritated some; McAdoo {{described}} a typical Harding speech as [...] "an army of pompous phrases moving over {{the landscape in}} search of an idea. Sometimes these meandering words actually capture a straggling thought and bear it triumphantly, a prisoner in their midst, until it died of servitude and over work." [...] H. L. Mencken concurred, [...] "it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> string of wet sponges, it reminds me of tattered washing on the line; it reminds me of stale bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It is so bad that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. It drags itself out of the dark abysm... of pish, and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of tosh. It is rumble and bumble. It is balder and dash." [...] The New York Times took a more positive view of Harding's speeches, stating that in them the majority of people could find [...] "a reflection of their own indeterminate thoughts".|$|E
500|$|New Phillies' bench coach Larry Bowa said, [...] "(Asche) <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> younger Chase Utley, he gets real mad when {{he misses}} a ball, {{he wants to}} make every play, he wants to go out and work, you can't hit enough groundballs to him ... he's got a great {{attitude}} ... that kind of energy can invigorate a ball club." [...] Marcus Hayes, a writer for the Philadelphia Daily News concurred with Bowa's comparison of Asche to Utley, calling their similarities [...] "eerie", and writing, [...] "Already, Asche's solution to failure is to ignore fatigue; to work harder; to improve at all costs. His objective is not necessarily to hit home runs, or to hit a big payday, but, rather, to make sure he can beat out a ground ball in late September. Sound familiar?" [...] Sal Rende, the hitting coach for the Phillies' AAA affiliate, noted that Asche also has solid intangibles, including makeup and work ethic, garnering yet another comparison to Utley. For his part, Asche said that while he appreciates the comparison, he wants to be his own player. Asche's determination and work ethic contributed to his fast ascent through the Phillies minor league system. He is a perfectionist, who recalled a game in which he made three fielding errors as his most memorable game with the big league Phillies.|$|E

[...] Of the {{character}} [...] "Sally" [...] {{referred to in the}} song he commented, [...] "I don't actually know anybody called Sally. It's just a word that fit, y'know, might as well throw a girl's name in there. It's gotta guarantee somebody a shag off a bird called Sally, hasn't it?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 4 stars out of 4, writing: [...] "Kill Bill, Volume 1 shows Quentin Tarantino so {{effortlessly}} and brilliantly {{in command of}} his technique that he <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> virtuoso violinist racing through 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'– or maybe an accordion prodigy setting a speed record for 'Lady of Spain'. I mean that as a sincere compliment. The movie is not about anything at all except the skill and humor of its making. It's kind of brilliant." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} illustrative metaphors {{have been used}} to {{describe}} Petrosian's style of play. Harold C. Schonberg said that [...] "playing him was like trying to put handcuffs on an eel. There was nothing to grip." [...] He {{has been described as a}} centipede lurking in the dark, a tiger looking for the opportunity to pounce, a python who slowly squeezes his victims to death, and as a crocodile who waits for hours to make a decisive strike. Boris Spassky, who succeeded Petrosian as World Chess Champion, described his style of play as such: [...] "Petrosian <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hedgehog. Just when you think you have caught him, he puts out his quills." ...|$|E
