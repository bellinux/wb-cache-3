If these men had their way they would close the river Thames altogether. They actually do this along the minor tributary streams and in the backwaters. They drive posts into the bed of the stream, and draw chains across from bank to bank, and nail huge notice-boards on every tree. The sight of those notice-boards rouses every evil instinct in my nature. I feel I want to tear each one down, and hammer it over the head of the man who put it up, until I have killed him, and then I would bury him, and put the board up over the grave as a tombstone.|$|E

40|$|Though at {{one time}} in England {{there may have been}} some doubt as to the {{character}} of a riparian owner 2 ̆ 7 s rights in the waters of the stream, it must be considered as definitely settled by a series of cases that the doctrine of reasonable use by all the proprietors on the stream is the rule of the common law, and that the matter of priority of use or appropriation is, under that system, immaterial, unless, of course, a question of prescriptive right is involved. Wright v. Howard, 1 Sim. 2 ̆ 6 S. 190; Mason v. Hill, 3 B. 2 ̆ 6 Ad. 304, 5 id. I; Wood v. Waud, 3 Exch. 748; Embrey v. Owen, 6 Exch. 353; Sampson v. Hoddinott, 1 C. B. (N. S.) 590, Miner v. Gilnour, 12 Moore P. C. 131. The American courts have generally adopted the view of the law early expressed by Chancellor KENT, which is the view approved by the English courts above referred to. See 3 KENT, COMM. * 439. The rule of law is clear, the difficulties arise in its application to particular cases in the determination of the question as to whether a certain use is reasonable or not. In the second edition of his splendid treatise on IRRIGATION AND WATER RIGHTS, Mr. KINNEY has said: 2 ̆ 2 Under the common law there are three classes of uses which the riparian proprietors may or may not make of the waters of a stream flowing by their lands. These are: First, natural or primary uses for which any <b>riparian</b> <b>proprietor</b> may take the waters of the whole stream; second, artificial uses or uses which are not classified as those for natural wants; and, third; uses of the water which may not be made at all; such, for example, would be the use of water by a riparian owner upon non-riparian lands. 2 ̆ 2 § 486...|$|E

He was largely instrumental in defeating an attempt in 1843 to make a reduction of salary apply to judges already in office and {{an attempt by the}} Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853 to abolish the life term of judges.

While the ability of social conflict to constrain aquaculture has been demonstrated in a few cases, its current potential to constrain aquaculture on Cape Cod had not been established prior to this study. This study was based on information gathered from town records and public hearings related to proposed aquaculture ventures. In addition, town officials were interviewed to obtain additional information related to cases. The {{finding of this study}} is that private <b>riparian</b> <b>proprietors,</b> and interests in shell-fishing tend to constrain aquaculture on Cape Cod today. This study utilized the qualitative case study method described by Merriam (1988) ...|$|R
