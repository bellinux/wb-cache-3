50|$|Cell fenders {{are best}} {{employed}} for small or large vessels where reaction force {{is an important}} criterion. Among all types of fenders, cell fenders offer minimum reaction per ton-meter energy absorbed. The very geometric shape gives it sturdiness, shear resistance, compact structure {{and the capacity to}} absorb energy equally from all directions. The Cylindrical buckling column absorbs axial loads effectively and buckles radially. This results in multi-directional dispersion of energy. Cell fenders are the most durable <b>rubber</b> <b>fenders</b> available and are currently the largest moulded fenders made. 2000-2500 mm high cell fenders are typically used for LNG berths. In order to distribute the reaction force, cell fenders are typically supplied with large fender panels, which keeps the hull pressure low.|$|R

50|$|In boating, a fender is {{a bumper}} used {{to absorb the}} kinetic energy of a boat or vessel {{berthing}} against a jetty, quay wall or other vessel. Fenders, used on all types of vessels, from cargo ships to cruise ships, ferries and personal yachts, prevent damage to vessels and berthing structures. To do this, fenders have high energy absorption and low reaction force. Fenders are typically manufactured out of rubber, foam elastomer or plastic. <b>Rubber</b> <b>fenders</b> are either extruded or made in a mold. The type of fender that is most suitable for an application depends on many variables, including dimensions and displacement of the vessel, maximum allowable stand-off, berthing structure, tidal variations and other berth-specific conditions.

40|$|The {{floating}} modular hybrid pier (MHP) is a multi-level {{reinforced concrete}} structure {{that was developed}} {{as an alternative to}} traditional fixed pile-supported pier structures. A test structure was constructed to investigate the actual performance of the structure. To maintain its position in the bay, four Trellex MV 1000 x 900 B <b>rubber</b> <b>fenders</b> are mounted to the structure and face the sides of a mooring shaft. In addition to resisting the typical wind, wave, and tidal forces, they must be able to withstand ship berthing and seismic activity. In order to determine the level of performance available in this installation, the fenders were subjected to a series of long term tests, where creep behavior was studied. A series of short term tests were also developed to explore the temporary, high load behavior of the fender system. Since the reaction capacity and stiffness are rate dependent, two hydraulic actuators were used to load the fenders at varying rates for several cycles, which also allowed for a study of fender interaction behavior and friction between the fender and mooring shaft. Analysis of the test data has shown that the measured fender axial load-deformation relationship is typically similar to the manufacturer's data, with strength degradation at high displacement cyclic loading. Axial reaction capacity was also reduced during bi-axial testing due to the presence of lateral load. These studies revealed that the access ramp exhibits a high level of friction that significantly affects fender behavior for the test structure. Lower friction between the fenders and primary mooring shaft was found once sliding was initiate...|$|R

40|$|Seaway Heavy Lifting is an {{offshore}} contractor, {{involved in the}} wind energy market. Nowadays SHL is preparing on expanding T&I capabilities to include WTGs, after the experiences with foundations, platforms and met-masts. The company desires to enter in this market with innovative and highly efficient solutions. In order to achieve this goal, Oleg Strashnov HLV, SHL’s flagship, has been selected as the ideal means for this path. Indeed, the potential of such a vessel is seen, by the offshore experts, as possibly being applied to the T&I of WTGs in single pieces, including the nacelle. Current practice is to perform the scope in parts, by means of jack-up vessels, addressing {{a great amount of}} the work offshore. Offering an integrated solution would definitely mark a turning point for the market, providing that this new proposal has the economical and efficiency characteristics required. The main challenge for such a proposal, from the structural point of view, is to provide a proper sea-fastening for safe and stable logistical procedures, ensuring structural integrity of both vessel and transported elements. The goal of this thesis is to propose a sea-fastening solution able to meet such requirements. An articulated and detailed path has been followed, from general to more detailed analyses, in order to reach the proposed objectives. Firstly, the definition of the boundary conditions and company’s choices took place, according to the specific needs of the chosen vessel and the solution effectiveness requirements. Current offshore wind energy market situation and trends have been investigated and analysed, in order to find specific WTG designs to use for the study. After the definition of sea state conditions, vessel accelerations have been quantified and the most critical load combination for the WTGs was found. Then, possibilities of sea-fastening arrangements have been analysed, through a conceptual study. In order to deal with the destructive bending moment effects on the WTGs, the concept providing a free moment connection at foundation level has been selected. It was required to provide additional external structures, clamping the WTGs at a certain height, in order to doubly support the transported elements. A parametric study has been carried out to compare the best achievable solution using such a hinged bottom connection, against the best achievable solution adopting a fixed connection. Higher requirements in stiffness, for the external supporting structures, have been found in the case of fixed connection. Among other advantages, important steel savings resulted and it was ensured that final solution did not exceed them. Detailed design has been provided for bottom support, due to its challenges from a structural point of view. Besides rotation, main requirements were vertical and horizontal loads constraint. After a dedicated conceptual analysis, a combination of rubber and steel elements was found to be most effective for the purpose. Linear structural analysis have been carried out, supported by parametric studies. The unusual utilization of rubber for sea-fastening has been analysed and proven to be feasible. Starting from the defined model, additional studies for linear buckling and free vibration analyses followed. Subsequently, focus moved to the intermediate support connection. Where design was less detailed, {{because of the presence of}} features more related to mechanical engineering, considerations and suggestions have been proposed. An innovative flexible clamping connection has been designed and proven to be effective; this involved <b>rubber</b> <b>fenders,</b> steel rings and bracings. Finally, the design was carried out for the bottom grillage system, connecting the above sea-fastening to the vessel deck. Practical considerations led to a conservative solution, able to meet the structural integrity requirements and available for further optimisations. Once all the individual parts were designed, adaptation of initial assumptions and solution final assessment were proposed. With its 8050 tonnes of total weight, such a system is proven to provide safe and efficient T&I activities for six WTGs per voyage. Among the selected models, the ALSTOM 6 MW is chosen for the analysis, because of its most onerous configuration. Structural feasibility and integrity are assessed through hand calculations and FEAs. Boundary conditions are all met and effective features are finally pointed out. Because of the choice of taking advantage of flexibility and the unusual application of rubber elements, the final solution demonstrates clear innovative features. According to the initial conditions, such a sea-fastening system provides a solution for extremely critical sea-states, probably unlikely to appear in real operations.

40|$|A Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH) Test Level 4 (TL- 4) energy-absorbing, urban roadside/median barrier was {{developed}} to reduce lateral vehicle accelerations below those observed during similar crashes into permanent concrete barriers. Several types of energy absorbers were evaluated for use in this barrier. Elastic polymers, or elastomers, have superior restorability, reusability, compressibility, and resistance to environmental effects. Although many shapes were explored, conical-shaped, cylindrical-shaped, and shear fender elastomers {{were found to be}} the most efficient in terms of size, weight, ease of use, and energy absorption. Finite element analysis simulations were used to further study the energy absorption and deflection of the elastomer shapes. One point nodal pressure tetrahedron solid elements accurately modeled the deformation of rubber. The best elastomer material models in LS-DYNA were the Simplified Rubber/Foam and the Blatz-Ko Rubber models, which were validated through component tests. Component tests were conducted at 5 mph on (1) an 80 -durometer, 2 -in. thick cylinder, (2) a 60 -durometer, 2 -in. thick cylinder, and (3) an 80 -durometer, 1 -in. thick cylinder. Components tests were also conducted at speeds varying from 5 mph to 15 mph on a 16 -in. high, 14 -in. wide, and 22 -in. long marine shear fender. ^ The final design consisted of an open concrete rail with shear <b>fender</b> <b>rubber</b> posts that are anchored to a concrete foundation. The precast concrete beams measured 22 in. wide, 20 in. tall, and 20 ft long and were spliced on top of 16 -in. high, 14 -in. wide, and 22 -in. long shear fender posts, which were spaced at 10 ft on center. Finite element analysis simulations also demonstrated that lateral vehicle accelerations were reduced by up to 33 percent for a MASH TL- 4 small car impact and up to 29 percent for a MASH TL- 4 pickup truck impact into the new barrier as compared to a rigid concrete barrier. Simulations also demonstrated that the new barrier had adequate capacity to contain the MASH TL- 4 single-unit truck. The cost of the barrier was estimated to be $ 175 /ft. The barrier should be further evaluated using finite element simulations and full-scale crash testing. ...|$|R
