25|$|Cowboy {{boots are}} a {{specific}} style of <b>riding</b> <b>boot</b> which combines function with fashion. They became popular among cowboys {{in the western}} United States during the 19th century. Traditional cowboy boots have a Cuban heel, rounded to pointed toe, high shaft, and, traditionally, no lacing. They are normally made from cowhide leather but may be made from more exotic skins such as ostrich, anaconda, or elephant skins.|$|E
25|$|Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. Cowboy boots, {{which have}} pointed toes and higher heels than a {{traditional}} <b>riding</b> <b>boot,</b> {{are designed to}} prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being draggedâ€”most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called chaps. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in rodeo, cutting and reining competitions, especially for men, though sometimes {{both men and women}} wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.|$|E
500|$|While {{dealing with}} the Hornet's Nest, the South {{suffered}} a serious setback {{with the death of}} their commanding general. Albert Sidney Johnston was mortally wounded at about 2:30p.m. as he led attacks on the Union left through the Widow Bell's cotton field against the Peach Orchard, accompanied by Tennessee governor Isham Harris. Johnston was shot in his right leg, behind the knee. [...] Deeming the wound insignificant (possibly due to a wound he received 25 years earlier that had inflicted permanent nerve damage preventing him from feeling how bad his injury was), Johnston continued on leading the battle. Eventually, Johnston's staff members noticed him slumping in his saddle. [...] Harris asked Johnston if he was wounded, and the general replied [...] "Yes, and I fear seriously." [...] Earlier in the battle, Johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded Confederate troops and Yankee prisoners, and there was no medical staff at his current location. [...] An aide helped him off his horse and laid him down under a tree, then went to fetch his surgeon, but did not apply a tourniquet to Johnston's wounded leg. Before a doctor could be found, Johnston bled to death from a torn popliteal artery that caused internal bleeding and blood to collect unnoticed in his <b>riding</b> <b>boot.</b> Jefferson Davis considered Johnston to be the most effective general they had (this was two months before Robert E. Lee emerged as the preeminent Confederate general). Johnston was the highest-ranking officer from either side to be killed in combat during the Civil War. Beauregard assumed command, but his position in the rear, where he relied on field reports from his subordinates, may have given him only a vague idea of the disposition of forces at the front. Beauregard ordered Johnston's body shrouded for secrecy to avoid lowering morale and resumed attacks against the Hornet's Nest. This was likely a tactical error, because the Union flanks were slowly pulling back to form a semicircular line around Pittsburg Landing. If Beauregard had concentrated his forces against the flanks, he might have defeated the Union army at the landing, and then reduced the Hornet's Nest position at his leisure.|$|E

2500|$|Half chaps, {{also known}} as chapettes, are a popular style of equestrian gaiters that extend from the ankle to just below the knee. [...] When worn over a short paddock boot they give the {{protection}} {{and some of the}} appearance of a tall <b>riding</b> <b>boot,</b> but at lower cost. [...] They are widely worn by children in horse shows and by trail riders. Half chaps usually are made of leather, and have a zipper or hook and loop closure on the outside. [...] They provide grip for the rider, and protection from sweat and the stirrup leather. They are commonly used over the paddock boots of English-style riders in place of tall boots. [...] While not true chaps, some Western-style riders use half chaps, particularly in hot weather, but gaiter-style half chaps are not traditional cowboy gear.|$|E

50|$|The jodhpur boot is {{an ankle}} boot {{designed}} as a <b>riding</b> <b>boot</b> with a rounded toe and a low heel. They originally fastened with a strap and buckle, but today the term also includes designs with straps that do not wrap entirely around the ankle and the elastic-sided design without a strap also known as Chelsea boots.
