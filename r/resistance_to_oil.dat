5000|$|Physicochemical {{methods are}} based on the use of coagulants and {{adsorbents}} [...] Coagulants promote the coarsening and precipitation of fine-dispersed asphalt-resinous substances in oil. Adsorbents selectively absorb organic and inorganic compounds. These methods remove asphalt and resinous compounds, emulsified and dissolved water from oil. Adsorptive treatment with bleaching clays neutralizes free acid in acid-treated oil, unstable oxidized and sulphurized products as well as traces of sulphonic acid. In addition, clay treatment leads to higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>oil</b> oxidation at high temperatures and increased colour stability. This process is used in clay polishing plants for waste oil re-refining and transformer oil regeneration systems for the reclamation of old transformer oil to as-new condition.|$|E

5000|$|Nitrile rubber (NBR, HNBR, HSN): {{a common}} {{material}} for o-rings {{because of its}} good mechanical properties, its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> lubricants and greases, and its relatively low cost. The physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials {{are determined by the}} acrylonitrile (ACN) content of the base polymer: low content ensures good flexibility at low temperatures, but offers limited <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>oils</b> and fuels. As the ACN content increases, the low temperature flexibility reduces and the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>oils</b> and fuels improves. Physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials are also affected by the cure system of the polymer. Peroxide-cured materials have improved physical properties, chemical resistance and thermal properties, as compared to sulfur-donor-cured materials. Standard grades of NBR are typically resistant to mineral oil-based lubricants and greases, many grades of hydraulic fluids, aliphatic hydrocarbons, silicone oils and greases and water to about 80 °C. NBR is generally not resistant to aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuels with a high aromatic content, polar solvents, glycol-based brake fluids and non-flammable hydraulic fluids (HFD). NBR also has low <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> ozone, weathering and aging. HNBR has considerable improvement of the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> heat, ozone and aging, and gives it good mechanical properties.|$|R

30|$|In {{heavy oil}} production, {{the loss of}} energy to ambient {{surroundings}} decreases {{the temperature of the}} heavy oil flowing upwards in a vertical wellbore, which increases the oil viscosity and the oil may not flow normally in the wellbore. Therefore, it is necessary to lower the heavy oil viscosity by heating methods to allow it to be lifted easily. Heating of heavy oil in an oil well is achieved by circulating hot water in annuli in the well (tubing-casing annulus, casing-casing annulus). In this paper, based on heat transfer principles and fluid flow theory, a model is developed for produced fluids and hot water flowing in a vertical wellbore. The temperature and pressure of produced fluids and hot water in the wellbore are calculated and the effect of hot water on heavy oil temperature is analyzed. Calculated results show that the hot water circulating in the annuli may effectively heat the heavy oil in the tubing, so as to significantly reduce both oil viscosity and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>oil</b> flow.|$|E

Superficial sediments were either noncontaminated or contaminated by Escalante crude oil and incubated in the laboratory for 30 days. Oil contamination induced adverse effects on macrobenthic community at both concentrations with, for the highest concentration, a marked decrease of approximately 40 and 55 %of density and specific richness, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{effect of}} pre-treatments on {{mechanical}} oil expression from dika kernels {{was investigated in}} this study. The parameters considered were particle sizes (fine and coarse), moisture content (4, 6, and 8 %), heating temperature (30, 40, and 50 °C), heating time (15, 35 and 45 min) and applied pressure (5, 10 and 15 MPa). The {{results showed that the}} oil point pressure of dika kernels reduced with increase in heating temperature and time and moisture content. The highest oil point pressure for coarse particles was recorded at 2. 11 MPa; whereas oil point pressure for fine particles was below 1 MPa. The lowest pressure at which oil began to flow was 0. 41 MPa (at 50 °C and 8. 3 % MC) while the highest was 0. 65 MPa (at 30 °C and 4. 2 % MC). The optimal oil point pressure ranged from 0. 55 to 0. 65 MPa for fine particles and 1. 51 to 2. 11 MPa for coarse particles. The least oil yield was at 4 % moisture content at 5 Mpa for coarse particles; whereas the highest yield was obtained at 4 % moisture content at 15 MPa for fine particles. For coarse particles, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>oil</b> flow decreased significantly with increase in moisture content, heating temperature and heating time. The optimal oil expression occurred at pressure range of 0. 55 to 0. 65 MPa for fine particles and 1. 51 to 2. 11 MPa for coarse particles.

40|$|Poly(acrylonitrile-co-butadiene) or {{nitrile-butadiene}} rubber (NBR) {{is frequently}} {{used as an}} O-ring material in the oil extraction industry due to its excellent chemical properties and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>oil.</b> However, degradation of NBR gaskets is known to occur during the well completion and oil extraction process where packers are exposed to completion fluids such as ZnBr 2 brine. Under these conditions NBR exhibits accelerated chemical degradation resulting in embrittlement and cracking. Samples of NBR, poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) and poly(butadiene) (PB) {{have been exposed to}} ZnBr 2 based completion fluid, and analyzed by ATR and diffuse reflectance IR. Analysis shows the ZnBr 2 based completion fluid promotes hydrolysis of the nitrile group to form amides and carboxylic groups. Analysis also shows that carbon-carbon double bonds in NBR are unaffected after short exposure to zinc bromide based completion fluid, but are quickly hydrolyzed in acidic bromide mixtures. Although fluoropolymers have excellent chemical resistance, their strength is less than nitrile rubber and replacing the usual gasket materials with fluoroelastomers is expensive. However, a fluoropolymer surface on a nitrile elastomer can provide the needed chemical resistance while retaining their strength. In this study, we have shown that this can be achieved by direct fluorination, a rather easy and inexpensive process. Samples of NBR O-rings have been fluorinated by exposure to F 2 and F 2 /HF mixtures at various temperatures. Fluorination with F 2 produces the desired fluoropolymer layer; however, fluorination by F 2 /HF mixtures gave a smoother fluorinated layer at lower temperatures and shorter times. Fluorinated samples were exposed to ZnBr 2 drilling fluid and solvents. Elemental analysis shows that the fluorinated layer eliminates ZnBr 2 diffusion into the NBR polymeric matrix. It was also found that surface fluorination significantly retards the loss of mechanical properties such as elasticity, tensile strength, toughness and compression set of nitrile rubber when exposed to zinc bromide fluid. This surface fluorination can be applied to extend the useful life of O-rings and packers in the field during oil extraction. The extended life can save millions of dollars by limiting the downtime of the well...|$|E

Furthermore, it was shown how a reinforcing element can be used to increase the stability and how the necessary reinforcement tensile force is calculated. In order to determine the limiting surface natural angle of incline of the sealing system, shear tests were carried out in a shear device with dimensions 30 x 30 cm.
