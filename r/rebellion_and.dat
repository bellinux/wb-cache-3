5|$|The Monmouth <b>Rebellion</b> <b>and</b> {{the events}} {{surrounding}} it have {{formed the basis for}} several works of fiction. John Dryden's work Absalom and Achitophel is a satire partially concerned with equating biblical events with the Monmouth Rebellion. The Monmouth Rebellion {{plays a key role in}} Peter S. Beagle's novel Tamsin, about a 300-year-old ghost who is befriended by the protagonist. Arthur Conan Doyle's historical novel Micah Clarke deals directly with Monmouth's landing in England, the raising of his army, its defeat at Sedgemoor, and the reprisals which followed. Several characters in Neal Stephenson's trilogy The Baroque Cycle, particularly Quicksilver and The Confusion, play a role in the Monmouth <b>Rebellion</b> <b>and</b> its aftermath.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} political environment was {{further complicated by}} the death of Paul Eyschen, who had been Prime Minister for 27 years. With his death came a string of short-lived governments, culminating in <b>rebellion,</b> <b>and</b> constitutional turmoil after the withdrawal of German soldiers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the rebellion, most of the {{remaining}} insurgents attempted to escape eastwards across the Shire Highlands, towards Portuguese East Africa, from where they hoped to head north to German territory. Chilembwe was seen by a patrol of Nyasaland police and shot dead on 3 February near Mlanje. Many other rebels were captured; 300 were imprisoned following the <b>rebellion</b> <b>and</b> 40 were executed. Around 30 rebels evaded capture and settled in Portuguese territory near the Nyasaland border.|$|E
50|$|Slaveholders feared slave <b>rebellions</b> <b>and</b> {{attempts}} of escape. Most of them sought to minimize slaves' {{exposure to the}} outside world {{to reduce the risk of}} rebellion. The desired result was to eliminate slaves' dreams and aspirations, restrict access to information about other slaves <b>and</b> <b>rebellions,</b> <b>and</b> stifle their mental faculties.|$|R

5|$|As part of {{his efforts}} to secure England, William ordered many castles, keeps, and mottes built– among them the central keep of the Tower of London, the White Tower. These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when {{threatened}} with <b>rebellion</b> <b>and</b> allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside. The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures.|$|E
5|$|Aurobindo was {{influenced}} by studies on <b>rebellion</b> <b>and</b> revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In his public activities he favoured non-co-operation and passive resistance; in private he took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt, in case that the passive revolt failed.|$|E
5|$|By 1796, {{the end of}} George Washington's eighth year as {{president}} of the United States, the United States' strategic position was dire. Interstate rivalries, violent insurrections (such as the Whiskey <b>Rebellion),</b> <b>and</b> solidifying opposition to the national government {{in the form of the}} Anti-Federalist Party combined with its dependence on trade with Europe to weaken the new nation. During this time, the country's increasingly-brittle government was held together almost entirely by Washington's charismatic authority.|$|E

5|$|Discontent {{against the}} king grew, however, and {{eventually}} affected also Edmund. The antagonism was largely caused by Edward's preference {{for his new}} favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father. In 1326, Edmund joined a rebellion led by Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, whereby Edward II was deposed. Edmund failed {{to get along with}} the new administration, and in 1330 he was caught planning a new <b>rebellion,</b> <b>and</b> executed.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy II {{begins as}} Firion, Maria, Guy and Leon are {{attacked}} by Palamecian Black Knight soldiers {{and left for}} dead. Firion, Maria, and Guy are rescued by Princess Hilda, who has established a rebel base {{in the town of}} Altair after her kingdom of Fynn was invaded by the Emperor. Hilda denies their request to join the rebel army because they are too young and inexperienced. The three set off for Fynn in search of Leon; there they find a dying Prince Scott of Kashuan, Hilda's fiancé, who informs them that a former knight of Fynn, Borghen, betrayed the <b>rebellion</b> <b>and</b> became a General in the Imperial army. The party returns to Altair to inform Hilda. She allows the group to join the <b>rebellion</b> <b>and</b> asks them to journey north to find mythril, a metal which could be used to create powerful weapons. The party makes its way north to the occupied village of Salamand, saves the villagers forced to work in the nearby mines, and retrieves the mythril.|$|E

5|$|Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never {{attempted}} another nationalist <b>rebellion,</b> <b>and</b> remained {{loyal to}} Rome {{until the fall}} of the Western Empire in 476 AD. However, although Gaul itself was to thereafter remain loyal, cracks were appearing in the political unity of Rome's governing figures– partly over concerns over the loyalty of Caesar's Gallic troops to his person rather than the state– that were soon to drive Rome into a lengthy series of civil wars.|$|E

5|$|Mycale was, in many ways, the {{beginning}} of a new phase in the conflict, in which the Greeks would go on the offensive against the Persians.
