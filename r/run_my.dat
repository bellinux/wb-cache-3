5|$|When she died, Tubman {{was buried}} with semi-military honors at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn. The city commemorated {{her life with}} a plaque on the courthouse. Although it showed pride for her many achievements, its use of dialect ("I nebber <b>run</b> <b>my</b> train off de track"), {{apparently}} chosen for its authenticity, {{has been criticized for}} undermining her stature as an American patriot and dedicated humanitarian. Still, the dedication ceremony was a powerful tribute to her memory, and Booker T. Washington delivered the keynote address. The Harriet Tubman home was abandoned after 1920, but was later renovated by the AME Zion Church. Today, it welcomes visitors as a museum and education center.|$|E

500|$|On September 4, 1995, Simms' jersey was {{retired in}} a halftime {{ceremony}} {{of a game}} versus the Dallas Cowboys. During an emotional speech, Simms stated {{that he wanted to}} don his jersey one final time, and throw [...] "one more pass" [...] to teammate Lawrence Taylor. Simms later commented, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass." [...] Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern, and after 30–40yards, threw him the pass. Taylor later stated that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, [...] "I'm saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), 'If I drop this pass, I got to <b>run</b> <b>my</b> black ass all the way to Upper Saddle River because there ain't no way I'm {{going to be able to}} stay in that stadium'." [...] Taylor caught the pass however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval. Since he has been retired for more than five years, Simms is eligible for selection into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; he has yet to be inducted, however.|$|E
500|$|After {{his career}} ended, Taylor worked in several regular {{television}} jobs. He first {{worked as a}} football analyst for the now defunct TNT Sunday Night Football. In a one-off show, Taylor also appeared as a wrestler in the World Wrestling Federation, defeating Bam Bam Bigelow in the main event of WrestleMania XI. He also worked as a color commentator on an amateur fighting program entitled Toughman on the FX channel. On September 4, 1995, the Giants retired Phil Simms' jersey during halftime of {{a game against the}} Cowboys (Taylor had his number retired the year before). Simms celebrated the moment by throwing an impromptu ceremonial pass to Taylor. Simms recalled, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass."

500|$|As with Oasis' {{previous}} two albums, {{the songs on}} Be Here Now are generally anthemic. The structures are traditional, and largely follow the typical verse – chorus – verse – chorus – middle eight – chorus format of guitar-based rock music. Reviewing for Nude as the News, Jonathan Cohen noted that the album is [...] "virtually interchangeable with 1994's Definitely Maybe or its blockbuster sequel, (What's the Story) Morning Glory?", while Noel had previously remarked {{that he would make}} three albums in this generic style. Yet the songs on Be Here Now differ in that they are longer than previous releases; an extended coda brings [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] to almost eight minutes, while [...] "All Around the World" [...] contains three key changes and lasts for a full nine minutes. The tracks are more layered and intricate than before, and each contains multiple guitar overdubs. While Morris had previously stripped away layers of overdubs on the band's debut Definitely Maybe, during the production of Be Here Now he [...] "seemed to gleefully encourage" [...] such excess; [...] "My Big Mouth" [...] has an estimated thirty tracks of guitar overdubbed onto the song. A Rolling Stone review described the guitar lines as composed of [...] "elementary riffs." [...] There was some experimentation: [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] contains a slowed down loop from N.W.A's [...] "Straight Outta Compton", while [...] "Magic Pie" [...] features psychedelically arranged vocal harmonies and a mellotron. According to Noel, [...] "All I did was <b>run</b> <b>my</b> elbows across the keys and this mad jazz came out and everyone laughed." [...] The album's production is dominated by top-end high frequency tones, and according to Uncuts Paul Lester, its use of treble is reminiscent of both late 1980s Creation Records bands such as My Bloody Valentine, and The Stooges' famously under-produced Raw Power.|$|E

2500|$|Chelsea Milling Company has {{received}} offers from debt-financing companies {{and also from}} corporations that are interested in taking over the company.

2500|$|Their next {{recording}} date, in March 1939, produced five sides, including [...] "Keep a-Knockin'" [...] (originally {{recorded in}} the 1920s and later famously covered by Little Richard), [...] "Sam Jones Done Snagged His Britches" [...] and [...] "Doug the Jitterbug". Lem Johnson subsequently left the group {{and was replaced by}} Stafford Simon. Sessions in December 1939 and January 1940 produced two more early Jordan classics, [...] "You're My Meat" [...] and [...] "You Run Your Mouth and I'll <b>Run</b> <b>My</b> Business". Other musicians who passed through the band in 1940 and 1941 included the tenorist Kenneth Hollon (who recorded with Billie Holiday) and the trumpeter Freddie Webster (from Earl Hines's band), who was part of the nascent bebop scene at Minton's Playhouse and influenced Kenny Dorham and Miles Davis.|$|E

2500|$|While {{living in}} Odessa, Orbison saw a {{performance}} by Elvis Presley, who was only a year older and a rising star. Johnny Cash toured the area in 1955, playing on the same local radio show as the Teen Kings, and suggested that Orbison approach Sam Phillips at Sun Records, the home of rockabilly artists Presley, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Cash. Orbison telephoned Phillips and during their conversation was curtly told, [...] "Johnny Cash doesn't <b>run</b> <b>my</b> record company!" [...] While at North Texas State College he was persuaded {{to listen to a}} song called [...] "Ooby Dooby", composed by Dick Penner and Wade Moore in mere minutes atop a fraternity house at the college. The Teen Kings recorded the song on the Odessa-based Je–Wel record label. Phillips was impressed and offered the Teen Kings a contract in 1956.|$|E
2500|$|This heavy {{civilian}} presence mitigated against Victorys further {{use as a}} naval vessel, and she ceased her formal role as a Wellingtons tender. The {{impact of}} so much human traffic also left her increasingly decrepit, particularly {{in the absence of}} Admiralty funding for repairs. Sir Edward Seymour, the future Duke of Somerset, visited the vessel in 1886 and considered that [...] "a more rotten ship never probably flew the pennant. I could literally <b>run</b> <b>my</b> walking stick through her sides in many places." [...] In 1887 she sprang a catastrophic leak and it was only with some difficulty that she was prevented from sinking at her mooring. Admiralty thereafter provided a small annual subsidy for maintenance, and in 1889, Victory was restored to a military function by being fitted up as a Naval School of Telegraphy. The school remained on Victory until 1904, when training was transferred temporarily to , and from 1906 to a permanent establishment at the Royal Naval Barracks, Portsmouth.|$|E
2500|$|Barnard {{was born}} in Ashfield, Sydney, to Ethel Frances and Oswald Holme Barnard, and was their only {{surviving}} child. She had polio {{as a child and}} was taught by a governess until she was 10 years old. She then attended the Cambridge School and Sydney Girls High School. After high school, she went to the University of Sydney, from which she graduated with first class honours and the first University Medal for History in 1918. She was offered a scholarship to Oxford, but her father refused her permission to go, and so she trained as a librarian at the Sydney Teachers' College. She worked as a librarian at the Public Library of New South Wales and then the Sydney Technical College until 1935 when she left to write full-time, at the encouragement of her friend, writer and literary critic, Nettie Palmer, and made possible through a small allowance from her father. She wrote to Nettie Palmer at the time that she was seeking [...] "some sort of fulfilment, to <b>run</b> <b>my</b> vital energy into a creative mould instead of just letting it soak into the thirsty sand of a daily round".|$|E
