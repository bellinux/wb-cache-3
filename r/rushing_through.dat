5|$|Mud plume feeding is {{a feeding}} {{technique}} {{performed by a}} small community of bottlenose dolphins over shallow seagrass beds (less than 1 m) in the Florida Keys in the United States. The behavior involves creation of a U-shaped plume of mud {{in the water column}} and then <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> the plume to capture fish.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rushing</b> <b>through</b> the University, Jack {{narrowly}} rescues Will {{from the}} falling debris. Will warns Jack he cannot simply repair the fracture then and there, {{as it would}} erase key future events and risk a time paradox. Passing a frozen Beth during a stutter, Jack reaches to unfreeze her, but hesitates and leaves. Reaching the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Will travel forward in time, only to find Paul and Monarch waiting for them. Paul is intent on either retrieving the CFR or destroying it. Jack fights and kills him. Hooking the CFR into his time machine, Will asks Jack to jumpstart it with chronon energy. The CFR activates and blasts the area with chronons, fixing the tear and vaporizing Paul. As Will examines the CFR, burnt out from the blast, Jack has a vision of his future self traveling {{to the end of}} time, and begins exhibiting symptoms of chronon syndrome.|$|E

Physicians with defibrillators <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> the city to reach a non-breathing, unconscious person whose heart had stopped were quite unusual by 1968 standards. However, the program was limited in vision, and although it could work in some communities, it was not nationally applicable. An evolution in prehospital emergency care was needed.|$|E

The most shocking change to Honda came when Kawamoto ended Honda's successful participation in Formula One after the 1992 season, citing costs in light of the takeover threat from Mitsubishi as well as the desire to create a more environmentally-friendly company image.|$|E
25|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} (also {{known as}} paracusia) are {{the perception of}} sound without outside stimulus. Auditory hallucinations {{are the most common}} type of hallucination. Auditory hallucinations can be divided into two categories: elementary and complex. Elementary hallucinations are the perception of sounds such as hissing, whistling, an extended tone, and more. In many cases, tinnitus is an elementary auditory hallucination. However, some people who experience certain types of tinnitus, especially pulsatile tinnitus, are actually hearing the blood <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> vessels near the ear. Because the auditory stimulus is present in this situation, it does not qualify as a hallucination.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Disasters in the Air, former KLM pilot and {{one-time}} IFALPA president Jan Bartelski, of Polish origin, {{suggests that the}} crash of the Liberator that carried Gen. Sikorski was caused by a half-empty mail bag jammed between the horizontal stabilizer and the elevator, thus [...] "freezing" [...] the controls and preventing F/Lt Prchal from gaining altitude after takeoff. The mail bag was in the cargo compartment and was blown out of the aircraft through the side hatch (which in normally configured Liberators would have served to protect the machine gun position) by a strong airflow <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> the nose gear door.|$|E

500|$|The episode has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Gregory Hardy of the Orlando Sentinel placed it at number eleven {{on his list}} of the show's fifteen best episodes that target the world of sports. Writing for IGN, Robert Canning gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating, commenting that he thought the three acts felt disconnected. He wrote: [...] "First Maude dies, then Ned dates and now Ned questions his faith. To me, these three storylines {{would have been better}} served had they been the focus of their own individual episodes." [...] Canning added that he felt [...] "the episode made a poor choice by <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> the mourning period and moving right into Ned dating," [...] but that [...] "the dating stuff, while, again, feeling hurried, was quite funny, especially Ned's date with Edna Krabappel." ...|$|E
500|$|Post-war {{analysis}} by the U.S. Naval Technical Mission to Japan noted that Shinano had serious design flaws. Specifically, the joint between the waterline armor belt on the upper hull and the anti-torpedo bulge on the underwater portion was poorly designed, a trait shared by the Yamato-class battleships; Archerfishs torpedoes all exploded along this joint. The force of the torpedo explosions also dislodged an I-beam {{in one of the}} boiler rooms which punched a hole into another boiler room. In addition, the failure to test for water-tightness in each compartment played a role as potential leaks could not be found and patched before Shinano put to sea. The executive officer blamed the large amount of water that entered the ship on the failure to air-test the compartments for leaks. [...] He reported hearing air <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> gaps in the water-tight doors just minutes after the last torpedo hit—a sign that seawater was rapidly entering the ship, proving the doors were unseaworthy.|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} {{refereed}} by Major Francis Marindin of the Royal Engineers, {{who was also}} President of the Football Association. His two umpires were Charles Wollaston of Wanderers and C. Crump of the Birmingham Football Association. According to initial estimates, there were around 10,000 to 12,000 spectators, breaking previous records for attendances in London. This was unexpected, {{and so there was}} not enough staff at the stadium to prevent the crowd from <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> the turnstiles without paying. The weather was described as [...] "bright and seasonable". Queen's won the coin toss and chose to defend the gasometer end. Rovers kicked off, but play quickly turned in the Scottish team's favour and they made the first two attacks. The work of Inglis and Sowerbutts saw Rovers take control of the match briefly, but Queen's Park were awarded an indirect free kick for handball inside the Blackburn half. The ball was shot straight into the Blackburn net without touching another player, and so no goal was awarded. Rovers quickly gained a corner kick but failed to score.|$|E

500|$|For the CGI used {{throughout}} the film, companies Rhythm & Hues (R) and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed {{different parts of the}} film. R focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> Washington D.C. Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that [...] "This is the first time where we had to do a whole series of shots that were happening mid-day, where {{you were going to get}} a really long look at the water and what it was doing." [...] The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film Poseidon. Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.|$|E
500|$|Bride of Frankenstein was {{subjected}} to censorship, both during production by the Hays office and following its release by local and national censorship boards. Joseph Breen, lead censor for the Hays office, objected to lines of dialogue in the originally submitted script in which Henry Frankenstein and his work were {{compared to that of}} God. He continued to object to such dialogue in revised scripts, and to a planned shot of the Monster <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> a graveyard to a figure of a crucified Jesus and attempting to [...] "rescue" [...] the figure from the cross. Breen also objected to the number of murders, both seen and implied by the script and strongly advised Whale to reduce the number. The censor's office, upon reviewing the film in March 1935, required a number of cuts. Whale agreed to delete a sequence in which Dwight Frye's [...] "Nephew Glutz" [...] kills his uncle and blames the Monster, and shots of Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley in which Breen felt too much of her breasts were visible. Curiously, despite his earlier objection, Breen offered no objection to the cruciform imagery throughout the film– including a scene with the Monster lashed Christ-like to a pole– nor to the presentation of Pretorius as a coded homosexual. Bride of Frankenstein was approved by the Production Code office on April 15, 1935.|$|E
500|$|For the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, Madonna and her {{supporting}} dancers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory {{were dressed}} as old women in fluffy dressing gowns with dollar signs and curling pins in their hair. Singing the song {{with a strong}} mid-western accent, they got up and revealed a frivolish pink dress underneath their gown, in which they danced around. On some dates Madonna replaced the words [...] "experience has made me rich" [...] with [...] "experience has made me a bitch". After singing, she produced dollar bills out of her corsage and threw {{them up in the}} air for the audience to catch. Two different performances were taped and released on video, Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. During the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004, a general setlist was decided where the show rehearsals would start with [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] from American Life, [...] "Dress You Up" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". But [...] "Dress You Up" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] were later dropped from the show. Hence [...] "Material Girl" [...] was transferred as the closing song of the military segment of the show, and was re-arranged as an electric guitar version. Madonna wore military themed clothes and sang the song while {{standing in front of a}} microphone and playing an electric guitar. The backdrops displayed mathematical equations along with DNA helixes <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> the screens.|$|E

500|$|The {{central theme}} of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with {{different}} themes: French Baroque–Marie Antoinette Revival, Military–Army, Circus–Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. It began with [...] "The Beast Within", an ominous recitation from the Book of Revelation by Madonna and the screens displaying Madonna's X-STaTIC PRo=CeSS installations. Once the introduction had finished, Madonna appeared onstage on a rising platform in a golden corset (for some European shows she wore a lilac one), striking yoga poses to perform [...] "Vogue". It {{was followed by the}} energetically performed [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] on a conveyor belt with some of the words to the song appearing on the screens, then [...] "Frozen", during which a video of a naked male and a naked female wrestling, caressing and intertwining in water, their faces and genitals darkened by shadows so as to preserve their androgyny, were displayed on the backdrops. This video was directed by Chris Cunningham, who directed Madonna's original music video to the song. The military segment started with the sound of a helicopter in the background as Madonna's backup dancers, dressed as soldiers, crawled on their bellies as though in the middle of battle, then hugged each other as if saying goodbye. Madonna appeared onstage, on top of a structure made up of TV sets, wearing camouflage pants, an olive army jacket and black beret. She started performing [...] "American Life" [...] as war footage of death and destruction flashed on screens behind her (at the end of the song, it showed a George W. Bush look-alike lovingly resting his head on the shoulder of a Saddam Hussein look-alike, as though the pair were waiting for a marriage license [...] ). During the performance Madonna ran down a lengthy V-shaped catwalk that descended from the ceiling and allowed her to reach the middle of the stadium. She also twirled army rifles during a march-like [...] "Express Yourself" [...] before strapping on a guitar for rock versions of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". During the latter's performances, the backdrops displayed mathematical equations along with DNA helixes <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> the screens. A remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards.|$|E

Two more launches by the 485th followed, including one from The Hague against London {{on the same day}} at 6:43p.m. – the first landed at Staveley Road, Chiswick, killing 63-year-old Mrs. Ada Harrison, 3-year-old Rosemary Clarke, and Sapper Bernard Browning on leave from the Royal Engineers, and one that hit Epping with no casualties. [...] Upon hearing the double-crack of the supersonic rocket (London's first ever), Duncan Sandys and Reginald Victor Jones looked up from different parts of the city and exclaimed [...] "That was a rocket!", and a short while after the double-crack, the sky was filled with the sound of a heavy body <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> the air.|$|E

During the flood, 26,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water was reported as flowing through the river; this was only slightly less than the massive flood event in 1984, which saw 29,000 cfs of water <b>rushing</b> <b>through</b> the river. River levels during early fall are typically between 350 and 700 cfs. There were reports and photos of salmon seen swimming in flooded parking lots and roads, and of anglers targeting these fish.|$|E
