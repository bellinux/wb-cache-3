5|$|Gaudí's main {{new project}} at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century was the Park Güell (1900–1914), commissioned by Eusebi Güell. It was intended to be a <b>residential</b> <b>estate</b> in the style of an English garden city. The project was unsuccessful: of the 60 plots into which the site was divided only one was sold. Despite this, the park entrances and service areas were built, displaying Gaudí's genius and putting into practice many of his innovative structural solutions. The Park Güell is situated in Barcelona's Càrmel district, a rugged area, with steep slopes that Gaudí negotiated with a system of viaducts integrated into the terrain. The main entrance to the park has a building on each side, intended as a porter's lodge and an office, and the site is surrounded by a stone and glazed-ceramic wall. These entrance buildings are an example of Gaudí at the height of his powers, with Catalan vaults that form a parabolic hyperboloid. After passing through the gate, steps lead to higher levels, decorated with sculpted fountains, notably the dragon fountain, which has become a symbol of the park and one of Gaudí's most recognised emblems. These steps lead to the Hypostyle Hall, which was to have been the residents' market, constructed with large Doric columns. Above this chamber is a large plaza in the form of a Greek theatre, with the famous undulating bench covered in broken ceramics ("trencadís"), the work of Josep Maria Jujol. The park's show home, the work of Francesc Berenguer, was Gaudí's residence from 1906 to 1926, and currently houses the Casa-Museu Gaudí.|$|E

40|$|Investment in <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> {{involves}} {{almost all}} members of the public at some stage of their lives, whether this be one's first home or the purchasing of one‟s first investment property. Understanding how to maximise the return on one's investment is something that can benefit the investor from before the investment is made until after the property has been sold, if it is sold at all. Literature surveys have concluded {{that there are a number}} of variables to consider when maximising the return on investment. As <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> is not a perfect science, there are guidelines and routes that are more beneficial to the investor depending on the current market, environment and economic standing. A survey was undertaken by members of the public that are involved in <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> investment, relative to the maximisation of the return on investment in <b>residential</b> real <b>estate.</b> The salient findings include: Investors in <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> spend more than average to extensive time prior, to investment researching the chosen <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> property; Investors in <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> perform a feasibility study before committing to the development whereas; Investors in <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> make use of financial advisors/valuers/estate agents or other investors' knowledge bases in deciding whether to invest in a residential property development; Investors in <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> believe that their degree of knowledge about the residential property market and residential property investments are average to very high. Investors in <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> somewhat agree that <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> investors do not effectively manage their investments. It was recommended that investors make use of help and guidance when investing in <b>residential</b> real <b>estate,</b> perform a feasibility study and ensure that they know their market before investing in a project. It was also noted that location plays a large role when deciding on an investment opportunity worth investing into. By creating awareness and ensuring that all methods and guidelines have been used to maximise the returns that their proposed <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> investment, investors can ensure a stronger, healthier cash flow and reap the highest possible benefits from their <b>residential</b> real <b>estate</b> portfolio...|$|R

500|$|In 1952, the Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company {{was renamed}} the Artizans and General Properties Company Ltd. The {{combination}} of a taxation system biased against private property developments and legal restrictions on raising rents made the company's traditional model unprofitable, and it began to divest itself of its original low-rent developments and instead to sell vacant houses on the estates and to reinvest in non low-rent housing and commercial property, especially in the United States and Canada where depreciation before tax was permitted. In 1966, ownership of the four original London estates (Shaftesbury Park, Queen's Park, Noel Park and Leigham Court) {{was transferred to the}} respective local authorities as council housing – in the case of Noel Park, the newly created London Borough of Haringey, which purchased the 2,175 properties comprising the Noel Park estate for a total of £2,917,000 (approximately £ today) [...] leaving 377 homes at Pinnerwood Park in Pinner as the last <b>residential</b> <b>estate</b> in Greater London owned by the company.|$|E

[...] The route runs north from Aldersgate along Aldersgate Street which is a modern dual carriageway, and from the 13th century was known as a wide street with fine buildings and travellers' inns; these were destroyed or badly damaged during the Blitz, and from 1965 to 1976 the 40 acre (162,000m²) Barbican Estate, an arts complex and <b>residential</b> <b>estate,</b> was constructed along the entire eastern side of the street.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the leisure and recreation activities {{and experiences of}} people living in urban <b>residential</b> <b>estates</b> in the Lower Hunter, New South Wales. Drawing on data collected in household surveys of residents aged 14 years and over in four <b>residential</b> <b>estates,</b> this paper profiles the respondents themselves, describes their leisure preferences and activities, and explains how they felt about how they experienced the leisure and recreation spaces and settings within, and adjacent to, their <b>residential</b> <b>estates.</b> The findings revealed that although {{the quantity and quality of}} recreation resources varied among the estates, some common themes emerged among respondents with respect to their leisure and recreation needs, perceptions, and demand. In particular, substantial numbers of respondents in each estate expressed dissatisfaction with recreation resource provision. There was an expressed need for larger areas of open space and parkland, and better facilities for a wider range of age groups. The authors concluded that leisure and recreation planning for urban <b>residential</b> <b>estates</b> is generally ad hoc and at best standards based, and characterised by the reproduction of familiar but inadequate leisure and play spaces. Supply was not based on sound empirical evidence of who occupies, or will occupy, homes in a particular estate, or of those people 2 ̆ 7 s leisure and recreational needs and how these affect equality...|$|R

"We have {{considered}} your report {{as to the}} extensive mortgages which [...] we hold upon the Honham Castle estates, and have allowed due [...] weight to your arguments as to the advisability of allowing Mr. de [...] la Molle time to give things a chance of righting. But we must [...] {{tell you that we}} can see no prospect of any such solution of the [...] matter, at any rate for some years to come. All the information [...] that we are able to gather points to a further decrease in the [...] value of the land rather than to a recovery. The interest on the [...] mortgages in question is moreover a year in arrear, probably owing [...] to the non-receipt of rents by Mr. de la Molle. Under these [...] circumstances, much as it grieves us to take action against Mr. de [...] la Molle, with whose family we have had dealings for five [...] generations, we can see no alternative to foreclosure, and hereby [...] instruct you to take the necessary preliminary steps to bring it [...] about in the usual manner. We are, presuming that Mr. de la Molle [...] is {{not in a position to}} pay off the mortgages, quite aware of the [...] risks of a forced sale, and shall not be astonished if, in the [...] present unprecedented condition of the land market, such a sale [...] should result in a loss, although the sum recoverable does not [...] amount to half the valuation of the estates, which was undertaken [...] at our instance about twenty years ago on the occasion of the [...] first advance. The only alternative, however, would be for us to [...] enter into possession of the property or to buy it in. But this [...] would be a course totally inconsistent with the usual practice of [...] the bank, and what is more, our confidence in the stability of [...] landed property is so utterly shattered by our recent experiences, [...] that we cannot burden ourselves by such a course, preferring to [...] run the risk of an immediate loss. This, however, we hope that the [...] historical character of the property and its great natural [...] advantages as a <b>residential</b> <b>estate</b> will avert, or at the least [...] minimise.|$|E
