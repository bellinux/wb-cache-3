Results {{showed that a}} target was identified better when surrounded by an opposite <b>polarity</b> <b>mask</b> {{as compared to the}} same <b>polarity</b> <b>mask.</b> Opposite <b>polarity</b> <b>mask</b> decreased an effect of distracters, indicating influence on the time of directing attention to a target. The opposite <b>polarity</b> <b>mask</b> decreased masking when delayed for longer than 100 ms. Stimuli with the same polarity but different contrast showed increased masking with high contrast mask. Luminance processing, particularly polarity processing, probably enables faster formation of distinct object representation, interacting with attentional selection processes in object substitution masking...|$|R

40|$|This report {{described}} {{the characteristics of}} the cross electrode type plasma jet genrator, which has been consisted of the cross electrode to lay in the nozzle constrictor and of center electorode. Experiments were made at the arc current range from 20 to 60 A for straight polarity jet and 10 to 30 A for <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet in Argon gas flow rate from 15 to 40 l/min. The results of this experimental investigation were as follws : The arc voltage versus arc current characteristics for straight polarity jet were drooping characteristics, untill the arc current was 40 A, but for over 40 A, it was positive characteristics. On the other hand, for <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet, it was always drooping one. As the gas flow rate increased, the arc voltage of both jets was increased. The arc voltage of <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet was higher than straight polarity jet. For straight polarity jet, the ratio of the sum of the cross electrode loss and the nozzle loss to the total loss was rang from 70 to 80 %, and the ratio of the cross electrode loss to the former was rang from 70 to 84 %. But for <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet, the cross electrode loss was down fifth value of straight polarity jet. The thermal efficiency of this generator was rang from 65 to 85 % as the general plasma jet generator, and increasing the gas flow rate, it was increase. The mean temperature was below 3015 °K. The arc mode of straight polarity jet was indicated the quasisteady mode or steady mode, but for <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet, it was always indicated the oscillation mode. At the same power input, the plasme flame length of <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet was longer than that of straight polarity jet and so the form of <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet was more sharp. Increasing the arc current and the gas flow rate, the core section and the outer flame of straight polarity jet was expanded, but the <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> jet, the core section was only expanded...|$|R

The sapce charge in these two polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) were measured with the PEA technique after he each period of poling. The charge distribution in the host materials was substantially smaller after <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> compared to dc negative polarity.

We derived the non-linear dynamic interaction models from modified neuronal population activity models whose dynamics can reproduce basic features of ECT-induced seizures within local areas and across distant cortical areas. We applied the Square-Root Cubature Kalman filter in three EEG states: baseline under general anesthesia, ictal and post-ictal. This yielded the functional connectivity between right and left frontal and parietal regions.

It is the common practice in EDM to make tool negative and work piece positive (direct polarity), but researches shows that reverse of it is also possible in which tool is positive and work piece is negative (<b>reverse</b> <b>polarity),</b> but not much work has been carried out on the <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> till now. This paper discusses the effect of tool polarity on the machining characteristics in electric {{discharge machining}} of silver steel. High metal removal rate, low relative electrode wear and good surface finish are conflicting goals, which can not be achieved simultaneously with a particular combination of control settings. To achieve the best machining results, the goal has to be taken separately in different phases of work with different emphasis. A 32 factorial design has been used for planning of experimental conditions. Copper is used as tool material and Silver steel of 28 grade is selected as work piece material with positive and negative polarities. The effectiveness of EDM process with silver steel is evaluated in terms of metal removal rate (MRR), percent relative electrode wear (%REW) and the surface roughness (S. R) ofthe work piece produced at different current and pulse duration levels. In this experimental work spark erosion oil (trade name IPOL) is taken as a dielectric and experiments have been conducted at 50 % duty factor. The study reveals that direct polarity is suitable for higher metal removal rate and lower relative electrode wear but <b>reverse</b> <b>polarity</b> gives better surface finish as compared to direct polarity.
