5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument {{was based on the}} premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay for government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{consistently}} {{called for}} a more equitable <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth,</b> so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share fully in Canada's prosperity. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald deserves credit for the introduction, in 1957, of an equalization scheme designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens. Macdonald's advocacy of provincial autonomy however, fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post-war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{principles}} of New Labour existed in the post-war socialist revisionism of Anthony Crosland. Crosland emphasised that Labour should not just focus on nationalisation and social welfare, but attempt to reform education, resolve wealth inequality, and pursue better industrial relations. His work The Future of Socialism stressed the idea that socialism is moral and should pursue liberty, fellowship, social justice, and equality. This required the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> through a progressive tax system, rendering public ownership {{of the means of}} production, enshrined in Clause IV of Labour's constitution, unnecessary. Crosland also proposed that education reform allow greater egalitarianism, proposing the abolition of the eleven plus exam.|$|E

5|$|The state's {{financial}} position was poor. Supporters of the dictatorship attempted to block progress on reforming the economy. The <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> {{supported by the}} new government seemed {{a threat to the}} richest, in light of the recent Wall Street Crash and the onset of the Great Depression. The government attempted to tackle the dire poverty in rural areas by instituting an eight-hour day and giving the security of tenure to farm workers. Landlords complained. The effectiveness of the reforms was dependent on the skill of the local governance, which was often badly lacking. Changes to the military were needed and education reform was another problem facing the Republic. The relationship between central government and the Basque and Catalan regions also needed to be decided.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had voted}} for Hoover in 1928, {{and he did}} so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a {{reaction}} to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including Walter Lippmann, he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.|$|E

For example, the Regina Manifesto pledged the CCF to the eradication of capitalism; the Winnipeg Declaration recognized the utility of private ownership of business, and stated {{that the government should}} own business only when it was in the public interest. In its election campaign, the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries. It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> in Canada. It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax, to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for tax purposes, and to eliminate sales tax on food, clothing, and other necessities of life. It also promised to raise taxes on the higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate dividends.|$|E

30|$|Second, {{there is}} the problem of default risk and {{property}} rights. In addition to rare events driven by market fluctuations, possibly in response to macroeconomic policies, we also have to recognize that explicit confiscation or <b>redistributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth,</b> or other failures of property rights, have often figured in Argentina’s history. Beyond the serial pattern of default (Reinhart and Rogoff 2004), we would include bank suspensions, forced debt conversions, specifications, and other expropriations. Although on occasion, ex post, these events were discriminatory as to locals versus foreigners, on most occasions, and in general ex ante, such differential treatment may not have been expected.|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that the vast majority}} of planned altruistic transfers between generations are human capital investments in children (households are generally bequest constrained). This paper demonstrates that empirically based calibrations of simple overlapping generations models with altruism generate binding bequest constraints with realistic endogenous growth rates and returns to capital. The author also shows how intergenerational and intragenerational <b>redistributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> affect long-run growth in bequest-constrained economies. Redistribution is a feature of fiscal policy abstracted away from by the standard infinitely lived representative agent models used to analyze endogenous growth.

25|$|The Chinese {{have claimed}} {{that most of the}} {{population}} of Tibet at that time were serfs, bound to land owned by lamas. This claim has been challenged by other researchers (see serfdom in Tibet controversy). Any attempt at land reform or the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> would have proved unpopular with the established landowners. The Seventeen Point Agreement was put into effect only in Tibet proper; ergo, eastern Kham and Amdo, being outside the administration of the government of Tibet, were treated like territory belonging to any other Chinese province, with land reform implemented in full. As a result, a rebellion broke out in these regions in June 1956. The rebellion eventually spread to Lhasa, but was crushed by 1959. The 14th Dalai Lama and other government principals fled to exile in India.|$|E
25|$|A {{month after}} taking office, Campbell-Bannerman called a general election, {{in which the}} Liberals gained a {{landslide}} majority of 132. However, Asquith's first budget, in 1906, was constrained by the annual income and expenditure plans he had inherited from his predecessor Austen Chamberlain. The only income for which Chamberlain had over-budgeted was the duty from sales of alcohol. With a balanced budget, and a realistic assessment of future public expenditure, Asquith was able, in his second and third budgets, to lay the foundations for limited <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> and welfare provisions for the poor. Blocked at first by Treasury officials from setting a variable rate of income tax with higher rates on those with high incomes, {{he set up a}} committee under Sir Charles Dilke which recommended not only variable income tax rates but also a super-tax on incomes of more than £5,000 a year. Asquith also introduced a distinction between earned and unearned income, taxing the latter at a higher rate. He used the increased revenues to fund old-age pensions, the first time a British government had provided them. Reductions in selective taxes, such as that on sugar, were aimed at benefiting the poor.|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} the American journal for Economics has {{addressed}} the issue of Utilitarian ethics within <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth.</b> The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy {{is the best way to}} make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services. Many utilitarian philosophers, including Peter Singer and Toby Ord, argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world, for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity. Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking. Singer's ideas have formed the basis of the modern effective altruist movement.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. federal {{government}} faces {{the prospect of}} exponentially rising entitlement obligations that threaten to push the debt-to-GDP ratio to historically unprecedented levels. I introduce a fiscal limit into a Perpetual Youth model to assess how intergenerational <b>redistributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> and the maturity structure of government debt impact the economic consequences of fiscal stress. Growing entitlement commitments require taking a stand on how future monetary and fiscal policies may adjust. When the economy hits its fiscal limit—the point at which increases in taxes are no longer feasible—either the fiscal authority must renege on its promised entitlement benefit or the monetary authority must adjust its policy to stabilize debt. I find that intergenerational transfers <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> strengthen the expectational effects of the fiscal limit and magnify the likelihood of stagflation. A longer average maturity of government debt weakens these effects in the short and medium runs but still {{increases the risk of}} stagflation when taxes come due in the long-run.
