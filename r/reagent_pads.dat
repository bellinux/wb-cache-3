40|$|AIMS: To explore {{first time}} mothers’ {{expectations}} and experiences regarding rupture of membranes (RoM) at term, and {{their views on}} the potential use of <b>reagent</b> <b>pads</b> that detect amniotic fluid. BACKGROUND: There is little information available on women’s experiences of spontaneous rupture of membranes, or interest in utilising methods to confirm rupture of membranes (e. g. <b>reagent</b> <b>pads).</b> DESIGN: Descriptive qualitative study, utilising focus groups and telephone interviews with women during pregnancy and after the birth of their first baby. Thematic analysis was undertaken to analyse women’s responses. METHODS: Ethics committee approval was obtained. Twenty-five women participated in the study of whom 13 contributed both during pregnancy and postpartum between October 2015 and March 2016. FINDINGS: Three overarching themes emerged from the data from women’s expectations and experiences: uncertainty in how, when and where membranes may rupture; information which was felt to be limited and confirmation of rupture of membranes. The potential use of <b>reagent</b> <b>pads</b> met with varied responses. CONCLUSION: Women were interested in having facts and figures regarding RoM, such as characteristics of liquor; volume and probability of membranes rupturing spontaneously at term. Use of a pad as a means of confirmation was viewed as helpful, although the potential for increasing anxiety was raised...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from March 26, 2017 - March 26, 2018 Miniaturized and portable microfluidic analytical platforms have been widely explored in the broad field of chemical analysis. The concept of microfluidics offer {{a number of important}} advantages, including low reagent consumption, low-cost detection, high sample throughput, and shorter analysis time. Semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots have been extensively utilized {{in a wide variety of}} manners including as emitters in consumer products (light bulbs) and, more importantly here, as elements for chemical and biological sensing. These applications are possible because of their unique optical and electronic properties. The goal of this dissertation was to integrate two fields of study – microfluidics for chemical and biological analysis, and semiconductor nanocrystals for detection – into a single analytical device. In this work, the development of microfluidic analytical devices incorporating semiconductor nanocrystals for chemical sensing is presented. The research effort started with the synthesis of a dual emission fluorescent quantum dot pair. CdTe quantum dots of two different sizes, emitting green and red light, were utilized as fluorophores. The green dot was used as a constant emitter and was encapsulated in a silica shell. The red dot was immobilized on the silica surface and selectively quenched in the presence of copper. The wavelength-ratiometric sensor thus constructed resulted in a fluorescence color change from red to green, identified visually, corresponding to the absence and presence of copper. The wavelength-ratiometric sensor was transferred to a microfluidic format made of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and assembled using polycaprolactone (PCL). Red and green intensity values from the RGB colorspace were used as analytical signals to generate a calibration curve. A Stern-Volmer plot in the range of 1 - 30 mg/L was used to quantify copper in water samples. For serum samples, absolute intensity values of green and red were plotted to mitigate non-linearity in the Stern-Volmer plot arising from the formation of copper-protein complexes. The research continued with the development of a quantum dot assay performed in a paper-based well plate format for cyanide detection. Chitosan modified CdTe quantum dots (CS-QDs) were synthesized and used as a fluorophore. The CS-QDs were quenched with copper and deposited onto a glass microfiber filter (GF/B). The paper-based well plate resembled a conventional plastic well plate in its x and y dimensions, to facilitate detection in a plate reader, and was designed to contain three layers: an opaque floor, a middle layer containing the reagents in a GF/B matrix, and an upper layer that retained the <b>reagent</b> <b>pads</b> while providing direct access to the individual wells for sample application and optical interrogation. The dried assay of quenched CS-QDs on GF/B was assembled on a paper-based well plate using PCL as a hydrophobic barrier and adhesive for each individual assay. The introduction of cyanide triggered recovery of a fluorescent signal from the CS-QDs in proportion to cyanide concentration, arising from copper-cyanide complex formation and depletion of copper from the QD surface. Linear calibration was measured in the range of 0 - 200 µM within 30 min. A paper-based well plate using CS-QDs made rapid, high sample throughput, low-cost testing feasible and convenient for cyanide detection. The color change was visually perceptible (making field use feasible) and the fluorescence output change was readily and sensitively measured, with greater accuracy and precision, using an automated plate reader. In the final component of the research effort described here, a novel method of constructing dsDNA, aimed at total gene synthesis on a shortened timescale and with a reduced error rate, was developed. Short (28 -mer) oligo fragments from a library were assembled through successive annealing and ligation processes, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. First, two oligo fragments annealed to form a double-stranded DNA molecule (dsDNA). The dsDNA was immobilized onto magnetic beads as solid support via streptavidin-biotin binding. Next, singlestranded oligo fragments were successively added through ligation to form the complete DNA molecule. More than 97...|$|E

Vegetable peroxidase and bacterial enzymes, including an Escherichia coli peroxidase, may also cause false-positive reactions. Therefore, sediments containing bacteria should be checked closely for the presence of red blood cells. Traditionally, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been associated with false-negative reagent strip reactions for blood. Both Multitistix and Chemstrip have modified their reagent strips to reduce this interference to very high levels of ascorbic acid, and Chemstip overlays the <b>reagent</b> <b>pad</b> with an iodate-impregnated mesh that oxidizes the ascorbic acid prior to its reaching the reaction pad. False-negative reactions can result when urine with a high specific gravity contains crenated red blood cells that do not lyse when they come in contact with the <b>reagent</b> <b>pad.</b> Decreased reactivity may also be seen when formalin is used as a preservative or when the hypertension medication captopril or high concentration of nitrite are present. Red blood cells settle {{to the bottom of the}} specimen container, and failure to mix the specimen prior to testing causes a falsely decreased reading.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{companies}} manufacture ketone screening strips. A strip consists of a thin piece of plastic film slightly larger than a matchstick, with a <b>reagent</b> <b>pad</b> on one end that is either dipped into a urine sample or passed through the stream while the user is voiding. The pad is allowed to react for an exact, specified amount of time (it is recommended to use a stopwatch to time this exactly and disregard any resultant colour change after the specified time); its resulting colour is then compared to a graded shade chart indicating a detection range from negative presence of ketones up to a significant quantity. It {{is worth noting that}} in severe diabetic ketoacidosis, the dipstix reaction based on sodium nitroprusside may underestimate the level of ketone bodies in the blood. It is sensitive to acetoacetate only, and the ratio of beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate is shifted from a normal value of around 1:1 up to around 10:1 under severely ketoacetotic conditions, due to a changing redox milieu in the liver. Measuring acetoacetate alone will thus underestimate the accompanying beta-hydroxybutyrate if the standard conversion factor is applied.|$|R

The key innovation of our approach was to combine powerful image processing encoded into a mobile phone application with a low cost 3 D printed sample holder that allowed to control lighting conditions and significantly improved sensitivity. Different solutions with protein and glucose concentrations ranging from 0 to 2000 mg/dL were prepared and analyzed using our system.

50|$|Chemical {{tests for}} blood use the pseudoperoxidase {{activity}} of hemoglobin to catalyze a reaction between the heme component of both hemoglobin and myoglobin and the chromogen tetramethylbenzidine {{to produce and}} oxidized chromogen, which has a green-blue colour. Reagent strip manufacturers incorporate peroxide, and tetramethylbenzidine, into the blood testing area. Two colour charts are provided that correspond to the reactions that occur with hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria and hematuria (RBCs). In the presence of free hemoglobin/myoglobin, uniform colour ranging from a negative yellow through green to a strongly positive green-blue appears on the pad. In contrast, intact red blood cells are lysed {{when they come in}} contact with the pad, and the liberated hemoglobin produces an isolated reaction that results in a speckled pattern on the <b>pad.</b> <b>Reagent</b> strip tests can detect concentrations as low as five red blood cells per microliter; however, care must be taken when comparing these figures with the actual microscopic values, because the absorbent nature of the pad attracts some of urine. The terms trace, small, moderate, and large or trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+ are used for reporting.|$|R
