40|$|Summary A central open {{problem in}} the study of shape memory polycrystals is the {{prediction}} of their <b>recoverable</b> <b>strains.</b> Solving this problem requires an understanding of the possible stress and strain fields that arise in such polycrystals. For polycrystals made of materials undergoing cubic-tetragonal transformations, we show that the strains fields associated with macroscopic <b>recoverable</b> <b>strains</b> are related to the solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations. We explore consequences of this relationship and connections to previous conjectures characterizing polycrystals with non-trivial <b>recoverable</b> <b>strains.</b> We also show that stress fields in shape memory polycrystals could be concentrated on lower-dimensional surfaces (planes and lines). We do this by proving a dual variational charac-terization of <b>recoverable</b> <b>strains</b> and presenting several examples. Implications of this characterization for effective properties and the development of numerical methods are discussed. THE SHAPE MEMORY EFFECT IN POLYCRYSTALS Shape memory (SM) effect is the ability of a solid to recover on heating apparently plastic deformation sustained below a critical temperature. Many alloys (e. g. NiAl, FeNiC) exhibit good SM behavior as single crystals but little or none as polycrystals while others (e. g. CuAlNi, NiTi) are good SM materials both as single crystals and as polycrystals. Since the utility of SM alloys critically depends on their polycrystalline behavior, this issue is of both scientific interest and technological importance. Thus we desire (a) to know the reason for this difference in the behavior of SM polycrystals; (b) to predict which materials generically exhibit good polycrystalline SM behavior; and (c) to characterize, for a give...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{problems of}} microstructure and its macroscopic consequences in multiphase elastic solids, both single crystals and polycrystals. The elastic {{energy of a}} two-phase solid {{is a function of}} its microstructure. Determining the infimum of the energy of such a solid and characterizing the associated extremal microstructures is an important problem that arises in the modeling of the shape memory effect, microstructure evolution (precipitation, coarsening, etc.), homogenization of composites and optimal design. Mathematically, the problem is to determine the relaxation under fixed volume fraction of a two-well energy. We compute the relaxation under fixed volume fraction for a two-well linearized elastic energy in two dimensions with no restrictions on the elastic moduli and transformation strains; and show that there always exist rank-I or rank-II laminates that are extremal. By minimizing over the volume fraction we obtain the quasiconvex envelope of the energy. We relate these results to experimental observations on the equilibrium morphology and behavior under external loads of precipitates in Nickel superalloys. We also compute the relaxation under fixed volume fraction for a two-well linearized elastic energy in three dimensions when the elastic moduli are isotropic (with no restrictions on the transformation strains) and show that there always exist rank-I, rank-II or rank-III laminates that are extremal. Shape memory effect is the ability of a solid to recover on heating apparently plastic deformation sustained below a critical temperature.

Os filmes foram processados em uma sopradora industrial. As propriedades reológicas estudadas foram : a viscosidade em regime permanente de cisalhamento, h(), a primeira diferença de tensões normais, N 1 (), o módulo complexo em cisalhamento, G* (ômega) e a deformação recuperável, gamar (t). h() e N 1 () foram medidos num reômetro de deformação controlada com cone e placa (taxas baixas) e num capilar (taxas elevadas); G* (ômega) e gamar(t) foram medidos num reômetro de tensão controlada com placas paralelas. As propriedades óticas (brilho e opacidade) foram medidas num opacímetro. As morfologias superficiais dos filmes soprados foram analisadas por microscopia eletrônica de varredura e microscopia de força atômica. Uma correlação entre deformação recuper��vel, opacidade total e morfologia dos filmes das blendas de LLDPE/LDPE foi obtida: quanto maior a recuperação elástica, menor a opacidade total e menor o tamanho do cristalito.

In such components, heavily loaded contact points (e. g., meshing gear teeth, bearing ball-raceway contacts) experience high contact stresses.

In addition, mechanical component materials, such as tool steel or silicon nitride exhibit limited <b>recoverable</b> <b>strain</b> (typically less than 1 percent).

We present a model in which the material microstructure is represented macroscopically as a <b>recoverable</b> transformation <b>strain</b> that is constrained by the texture of the polycrystal. The point of departure in this model is the recognition that the mechanics of the onset of martensitic transformation are fundamentally different from those of its saturation.

The effects of constraint geometry on the constitutive response of SMAs are studied. Several well known properties of SMAs are demonstrated. Finally the model is simply implemented in a commercial finite-element package as a proof of the concept. ...|$|R

The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of martensite variants, aging heat treatment, crystal orientations and grain size on the superelastic properties. Although the theoretical transformation strain of single crystal with the orientation in tension (26. 5 %) is higher {{than it is in}} compression (10. 5 %), the compression sample shows a better <b>recoverable</b> <b>strain</b> than that in the tension sample from the experimental results. The differences in reversibility and the shape of the stress-strain curves under tension and compression are attributed to the lower number of martensite variants activated under tension as compared to compression. The effect of aging has profound influences on the size and volume fraction of precipitates, transformation temperatures, stress-temperature phase diagram, <b>recoverable</b> <b>strain</b> and stress hysteresis. Increasing the aging times improves the superelastic strain in compression and decreases it in tension. The reason for these is related to the selection of martensite variants. The crystal orientations affect the superelastic properties such as the stress-temperature phase diagram and transformation strain. The differences in the slope of the stress-temperature curves and critical stress in different orientation are attributed to the transformation strain and resolved shear stress factors, respectively. Aging heat treatment decreases the orientation effect on slope of stress-temperature curve. The sheet is brittle (high hardness values) after being hot-rolled which causes to appear after the cold-rolled experiment. The hot-rolled sheet was annealing at 900 ?C for 1 hour to obtain two phases (bcc+fcc) and ductility (small hardness values). Therefore, cold-rolling of the annealing sheet is practical up to 76 %.
