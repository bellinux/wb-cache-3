5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Golden Cascade' is {{yet another}} plant from the same {{locality}} as 'Birthday Candles'; this is more spreading again, to perhaps 30cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with red-styled gold flowers 15cm high by 6cm across. It is also seen as B.spinulosa 'prostrate'. Propagated by Gondwana Nursery, this is a <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> release.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{programs}} were by necessity low-budget affairs, {{and the network}} received relatively few awards from the TV industry. Most awards during the 1950s went to NBC and CBS, {{who were able to}} out-spend other companies and draw on their extensive history of radio broadcasting in the <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> television medium. DuMont, however, did win a number of awards during its years of operation.|$|E
5|$|Morrison co-wrote a {{paper with}} Leonard I. Schiff in 1940 {{in which they}} {{calculated}} the gamma rays emitted {{by the process of}} K-electron capture. Initially at Cornell after the war, Morrison continued working in nuclear physics, collaborating with Bethe on a textbook, Elementary Nuclear Physics (1952), one of the early treatments of the <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> field.|$|E

5|$|One major {{limitation}} to {{a forensic}} investigation {{is the use}} of encryption; this disrupts initial examination where pertinent evidence might be located using keywords. Laws to compel individuals to disclose encryption keys are still <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> and controversial.|$|E
5|$|Technologically and socially, {{most of the}} civilizations in Eora are in what roughly {{corresponds}} to {{the early stages of}} the Renaissance. Firearms are still a <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> invention and are quite cumbersome to use; as a result, their use is not widespread. They have, however, proven quite effective against magic users.|$|E
5|$|The Living Daylights was {{the final}} Bond film to be scored by {{composer}} John Barry. The soundtrack is notable for its introduction of sequenced electronic rhythm tracks overdubbed with the orchestra—at the time, a <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> innovation.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{instructions}} on how to experimentally produce light sources ("standard sources") corresponding to the older illuminants.

5|$|The {{building}} was {{designed in the}} Art Nouveau style, which {{was at that time}} a <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> style and featured flowing, curvilinear designs often incorporating floral and other plant-inspired motifs. Horodecki featured such motifs in the building's exterior decor in the forms of mythical creatures and big-game animals. His work on the House with Chimaeras has earned him the nickname of the Gaudí of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Auxois is closely tied to its homeland, {{for which it is}} named. The rich {{pastures}} of the Auxois area, including the French Gold Coast, parts of Yonne, the Saône-et-Loire and northern Nièvre, are conducive to the breeding of large draft horses. The recognition of the Auxois dates back to the early 20th century, making it <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> compared to other French draft breeds.|$|E
40|$|Biometric {{authentication}} technologies, such as fingerprint, face, iris, and vein, {{have been}} widespread in many applications from individual portable devices to national ID management systems. Furthermore, <b>relatively</b> <b>newer</b> biometric authentication modalities including eye movement, lip-motion, etc., have been also researched and developed {{in order to}} improve an authentication accuracy and an usability of a biometric authentication system. In addition, some these kind of modalities are effective as a liveness detection technique, which can not only improve authentication accuracy in traditional biometric authentication systems, but also decrease risks regarding anti-spoofing attacks. In this paper, we introduce some <b>relatively</b> <b>newer</b> prospective biometric authentication modalities related to face, hand, and some traits.

50|$|Of all {{the seven}} {{historical}} bridges of Srinagar, the Amira Kadal Bridge {{also referred to}} as the “first Bridge” is a <b>relatively</b> <b>newer</b> one if compared {{with the rest of the}} six bridges. Built in 1774-77 by the Afghan Governor Amir Khan Sher Jawan, this bridge has been witness to many events of historical importance.|$|R
50|$|Random {{encounters}} {{have become}} less popular in video {{games with the}} passage of time, as gamers often complain that they are annoying, repetitive or discouraging to exploration. The Final Fantasy and Tales series have abandoned random encounter systems with successive games, while <b>relatively</b> <b>newer</b> franchises such as the Chrono series and Kingdom Hearts have never used them.|$|R
5|$|The <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> {{field of}} radio {{astronomy}} sparked Bacher's interest, and he hired John Bolton and Gordon Stanley from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in 1955. A {{grant from the}} Office of Naval Research allowed Bolton to build the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, which became an important {{center for the study}} of quasars.|$|E
5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a cornet {{representing}} a bugle, {{is followed by a}} brisk military march initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo (B). A passage for brass precedes the introduction of a theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> to the orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E
5|$|Batik {{making in}} the island of Bali is <b>relatively</b> <b>new,</b> but a fast-growing industry. Many {{patterns}} are inspired by local designs, which are favoured by the local Balinese and domestic tourists. Objects from nature such as frangipani and hibiscus flowers, birds or fishes, and daily activities such as Balinese dancer and ngaben processions or religious and mythological creatures such as barong, kala and winged lion are common. Modern batik artists express themselves freely {{in a wide range}} of subjects.|$|E
5000|$|Although Hebrew and Greek words meaning [...] "world" [...] {{are used}} in Scripture with the normal variety of senses, many {{examples}} of its use in this particular sense {{can be found in}} the teachings of Jesus according to the Gospel of John, e.g. 7:7, 8:23, 12:25, 14:17, 15:18-19, 17:6-25, 18:36.

5|$|Domains are a <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> grouping. First {{proposed}} in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system {{was not generally}} accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in baseball, Paschal was {{described}} as a five-tool player who excelled at running, throwing, fielding, hitting for average, and power. However, his playing time with the Yankees was limited because they already had future Baseball Hall of Famers Ruth and Earle Combs, and star Bob Meusel, in the outfield. Paschal was considered one of the best bench players in baseball during his time with the Yankees, and sportswriters wrote how he would have started for most other teams in the American League. He {{was one of the best}} pinch hitters in the game during the period, at a time when the term was still <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> to baseball.|$|E
5|$|In 1345, while Grosmont was in France, {{his father}} died. The younger Henry was now Earl of Lancaster – the wealthiest and most {{powerful}} peer of the realm. After participating in the Siege of Calais in 1347, the king honoured Lancaster by including him as a founding knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348. A few years later, in 1351, Edward bestowed an even greater honour on Lancaster when he created him Duke of Lancaster. The title of duke was of <b>relatively</b> <b>new</b> origin in England; only one other ducal title existed previously.|$|E
