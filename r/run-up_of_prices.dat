40|$|Average net {{farm income}} was $ 322, 165 in 2010 for the 97 farms {{included}} in this annual report of the Southwestern Minnesota Farm Business Management Association. Average earnings increased by 362 % from $ 69, 787 in 2009 (Figure 1). Inflations adjusted profits rebounded after a downturn in 2009 that was caused primarily by low profits in the livestock sectors. Strong yields, substantially higher crop inventory values, and rebounding profitability of the livestock sectors {{led the way to}} much higher profits in 2010. Highlights of association financial results for 2010 : Entire report is available at: [URL] Median net farm income, or the income earned by the middle farm, was $ 234, 879, substantially lower than the average, indicating that the average was skewed by high profits of the most profitable farms. In 2009, this effect was reversed due to large losses suffered by some of the large livestock farms in the association. • As is the case every year, incomes varied widely across the entire group. The average net farm income for the most profitable 20 % of the farms was $ 819, 795 while the least profitable 20 % earned only $ 62, 563. • Average gross cash income was up 11 % from 2009 (Figure 2) while cash expenses increased by 5 %. • Government payments were down 5 % and accounted for 2 % of gross cash farm income (Figure 2). Crop sales accounted for 46 % of income while livestock sales were 47 %. • Average rate of return on assets (ROA) rebounded to 17 % with assets valued at adjusted cost or book value, up from 3 % in 2009 (Figure 3). Rate of return on equity (ROE) averaged 24 %, up from 2 %. The fact that ROE was higher than ROA indicates that debt capital earned more than the average interest rate paid. • The average farm reported net worth growth of $ 291, 599. Net worth growth from earnings (farm and non-farm) averaged $ 254, 596. The remainder resulted from changes in asset values. The average debt-to-asset ratio decreased from 40 % to 38 % (Figure 4). Crops • Corn yields were almost unchanged from 2009 but above historical averages at 184 bushels per acre. Soybeans yields averaged 51 bushels, up from 49 in 2009 (Figure 5). • Both corn and soybean prices received decreased from 2009 levels but remained above historical averages. The average price received for corn was $ 3. 67 per bushel compared to $ 3. 83 in 2009. Soybeans average $ 9. 72 per bushel, down from $ 10. 15. Most of the increased profits for crop farms resulted from the increased value of inventories with the <b>run-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> {{at the end of the}} year. • The cost to raise an acre of corn (with land rent) decreased by 5 % while soybean costs were virtually unchanged. The cost to produce a bushel of corn on cash rented land decreased from $ 3. 30 per bushel in 2009 to $ 3. 12 in 2010, while soybean costs were virtually unchanged ($ 8. 18 in 2009, $ 8. 17 in 2010). These costs include a charge for unpaid labor and management, but do not include a charge for equity capital. For corn, fertilizer costs per acre decreased by 37 %. Drying and chemical costs were also down, while seed and cash rent were up. Farm Management,...|$|E

40|$|This article uses both linear and {{nonlinear}} causality {{tests to}} examine the causal relationships between changes in commodity prices and U. S. inflation. Prior to the Great Moderation, {{there is evidence that}} changes in commodity price indices linearly lead inflation. The stability of the causal relationship appears to vary over time with a stronger bivariate link established before the Great Moderation. Further, there is evidence of significant nonlinear causality from raw industrials and metals indices to inflation with most of this detected nonlinear relationship being captured using the Baba, Engle, Kraft, and Kroner asymmetric generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model. This implies that the observed nonlinear Granger causality is largely driven by unanticipated shocks and volatility spillovers in the <b>run-up</b> <b>of</b> commodity <b>prices</b> in late 2000.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the link between}} the run-up on the stock market and fixed investments, especially in the manufacturing sector, during the late 1990 s. The stock market increase may have given lenders an incentive to invest primarily in companies that have seen large stock price gains, thereby possibly raising financial constraints for manufacturing firms. Further, possible large capital gains on the stock market may have made investments in fixed assets less attractive, thereby offering corporate decision makers incentives to use corporate resources to support share prices through dividend pay-outs and share repurchases. Our results indicate that overall investment during the late 1990 s remained lower than it could have been without the large <b>run-up</b> <b>of</b> stock <b>prices,</b> due to a reorientation of the uses of corporate resources away from investments. We also find that investment in manufacturing, which was responsible for a large share of the productivity gains in the late 1990 s, was impeded by the developments of the stock market. Especially, the reorientation of investment priorities in the face <b>of</b> rising stock <b>prices</b> is a consistent determinant of investment in manufacturing. Based on our results...|$|R
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{suggests}} that investors' independent biases should {{cancel each other}} out and have little impact on equilibrium at the aggregate level. In contrast to this intuition, this paper analyzes models with biased investors and finds that biases often {{have a significant impact on}} the equilibrium even if they are independent across investors. First, independent biases aÂ¿ect the equilibrium asset price if investor demand for the asset is a nonlinear function of the bias. Second, even if the demand function is linear in the bias, it may still have a significant impact on the equilibrium due to the fluctuation of the wealth distribution. An initial <b>run-up</b> <b>of</b> the stock <b>price</b> makes optimistic investors richer, which then further pushes the stock price up and leads to lower future returns. This effect can lead to price overshooting, i. e., a negative expected future return. Similarly, an initial drop <b>of</b> the stock <b>price</b> leads to higher future returns. Simple calibrations show that a modest amount of biases can have a large impact on the equilibrium. Aggregation, bias, noise trading, behavioral finance...|$|R
