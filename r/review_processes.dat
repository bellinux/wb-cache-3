25|$|Starting in the 1990s, several {{scientific}} journals (including the high impact journal Nature in 2006) started experiments with hybrid peer <b>review</b> <b>processes,</b> allowing the open peer reviews in {{parallel to the}} traditional model. The initial evidence {{of the effects of}} open peer reviews was mixed. Identifying reviewers to the authors does not negatively impact, and may potentially have a positive impact upon, the quality of reviews, the recommendation regarding publication, the tone of the review and the time spent on reviewing. However, more of those who are invited to review decline to do so. Informing reviewers that their signed reviews might be posted on the web and available to the wider public did not {{have a negative impact on}} quality of reviews and recommendations regarding publication, but it led to a longer time spent on reviewing, besides a higher reviewer decline rate. The results suggest that open peer review is feasible, and does not lead to poorer quality of reviews, but needs to be balanced against the increase in review time, and higher decline rates among invited reviewers.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Portal, Valve decided to make Portal 2 a {{standalone}} product, partly because of pressure from other developers within Valve who wanted {{to work on a}} Portal product. Work began almost immediately after the release of Portal. Valve committed more resources to Portal 2s development than they had for the first game; Portal had a team of seven or eight people, but Portal 2 had a team of 30 or 40. The initial team of four was expanded as subgroups formed to devise game mechanics and to plot the story. Participants in internal <b>review</b> <b>processes</b> were inspired by what they saw to join the project. According to Erik Wolpaw, some Portal 2 developers worked on the Left 4 Dead games to help them meet milestones, but returned to Portal 2, [...] "with extra people in tow." [...] Kim Swift, Portals designer, left Valve for Airtight Games halfway through Portal 2s development.|$|E

Using the hermeneutic circle it describes the literature <b>review</b> <b>process</b> as being constituted by literature searching, classifying and mapping, critical assessment, and argument development. The hermeneutic approach emphasizes continuous engagement with and gradual development of a body of literature during which increased understanding and insights are developed.

2500|$|In {{the case}} of {{dredging}} within the United States, a permit is almost always required from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, after submission of extensive data on the project limits, [...] chemical properties of the bay muds to be disturbed, a dredge disposal plan and often a complete Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. [...] Further review by the United States Coast Guard would normally be required.

40|$|Arguably, {{the most}} {{important}} opportunity to acquire the standards and norms of the discipline and develop researchers’ judgement is the peer <b>review</b> <b>process</b> – but this depends {{on the quality of}} the reviews. ‘Good’ feedback - which we take to mean feedback that has the capacity to improve subsequent practice - has been identified as being timely, specific and relevant. Yet often reviews lack these basic qualities. In this paper we report an investigation of the peer <b>review</b> <b>process</b> at the 2010 Australasian Association of Engineering Education (AAEE) conference. Authors at the conference were given the chance to rate their reviews and we subsequently analysed both the nature of the reviews and authors’ responses. Findings suggest that the opportunity to use the peer <b>review</b> <b>process</b> to induct people into the field and improve practice is being missed. As in other disciplines there is also ample evidence that the <b>review</b> <b>process</b> does little or nothing to ensure the standard and relevance of conference presentations. It is therefore legitimate to ask whether there may not be better processes to attain these ends and we conclude with some discussion of how the <b>review</b> <b>process</b> may be made more helpful for everyone involved...|$|R
