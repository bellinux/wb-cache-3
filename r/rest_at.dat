5|$|According to {{a letter}} written to General Cheatham from Judge Mangum post war, Cleburne's remains were first laid to <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia, Tennessee. At the urging of Army Chaplain Biship Quintard, Judge Mangum, staff officer to Cleburne and his law partner in Helena, Cleburne's remains were moved to St. John's Episcopal Church near Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, where they {{remained}} for six years. He had first observed St. John's during the Army of Tennessee's march into Tennessee during the campaign {{that led to the}} Battle of Franklin and commented that it was the place he would like to be buried because of its great beauty and resemblance to his Irish homeland. In 1870, he was disinterred and returned to his adopted hometown of Helena, Arkansas, with much fanfare, and buried in the Confederate section of Maple Hill Cemetery, overlooking the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|After {{the attack}} the {{battalion}} {{was given a}} weeks <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> Cape Helles, where it received a number of reinforcements before being {{sent back to the}} lodgement at Anzac Cove, where a stalemate situation had developed. In an effort to break this deadlock, the Allies launched an offensive in August and the battalion took part in the Battle of Lone Pine. After taking over positions that had been captured by the 1st Brigade, the battalion defended the trenches against repeated Turkish counterattacks and, in the process, four of its members performed acts of gallantry that later led to them receiving the Victoria Cross (VC), the nation's highest military decoration. These men were: Corporal Alexander Stewart Burton, Corporal William Dunstan, Lieutenant William John Symons and Lieutenant Frederick Harold Tubb. During this fighting, the 7th Battalion lost 87 men killed.|$|E

5|$|As {{the date}} approaches, Sir Gawain sets {{off to find}} the Green Chapel and keep {{his side of the}} bargain. Many adventures and battles are alluded to (but not described) until Gawain comes across a splendid castle where he meets Bertilak de Hautdesert, the lord of the castle, and his {{beautiful}} wife, who are pleased to have such a renowned guest. Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel and that he only has a few days remaining. Bertilak laughs, explains that the Green Chapel is less than two miles away and proposes that Gawain <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> the castle till then. Relieved and grateful, Gawain agrees.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the night strike Task Group 111.2 departed for Manus Island. On 16 June a Japanese aircraft was detected by radar. One of the Seafires was detached from the combat air patrol to intercept it, but the fighter's pilot had to abandon the attempt due to a mechanical problem. The Task Group arrived at Manus Island on 17 June, and continued training exercises there until the remainder of the BPF arrived on 4 July en route to further operations off Japan. All of the warships at Manus sailed on 6 July to join the Fast Carrier Task Force in attacks on the Japanese home islands. Implacable and the other ships of the BPF operated against Japan from 17 July to 12 August, during which time the Fleet conducted air attacks and participated in several bombardments of coastal Japanese cities. On 12 August most of the BPF's ships, including Implacable, departed for a period of maintenance and <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's {{infantry}} divisions {{were at the}} end {{of their}} lines of communication and were not able to follow up the Ottoman withdrawal. XXI Corps's 54th (East Anglian) Division was forced to <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> Gaza and the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade at Beit Hanun. In the rear, Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode's XX Corps had transferred its transport to XXI Corps. XX Corps's 60th (2/2nd London) Division (Major General John Shea) was resting at Huj and its 10th (Irish) (Major General John Longley) and 74th (Yeomanry) (Major General Eric Girdwood) Divisions were at Karm. The only units in the field were the 53rd (Welsh) Division (Major General S. F. Mott), corps cavalry, the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, deployed in the front line near Tel el Khuweilfe in the foothills of the Judean Hills north of Beersheba.|$|E

5|$|On {{their way}} to King's Landing, the king's entourage has stopped to <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> an inn. While the {{recently}} promised Prince Joffrey and Sansa Stark are walking along the river, they run into Arya sparring with sticks with her friend, a butcher's boy named Mycah. Taunting the boy, Joffrey draws his sword and demands a duel, under pretext of punishing him for accidentally hitting Arya, {{a member of the}} nobility. Mycah and Arya desperately explain that she asked him to spar with her so she could practice. As Joffrey savors the butcher boy's pain and fear, Arya hits Joffrey while her friend flees. Enraged, Joffrey turns on Arya and is about to strike her with his sword when her direwolf Nymeria bites his wrist. Arya seizes his sword and throws it into the river before running into the forest, where she drives away Nymeria and hides until dark.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rest</b> <b>at</b> Metz was {{interrupted}} by the German offensive in the Ardennes, the Battle of the Bulge. The division moved north to Luxembourg from 19 to 21 December, {{to take part in}} the battle of the Ardennes break-through. It attacked at Rambrouch and Grosbous on 22 December, beat off strong German counterattacks, captured Arsdorf on Christmas Day after heavy fighting, attacked toward the Wiltz River, but was forced to withdraw in the face of determined German resistance. After regrouping on 5–8 January 1945, it attacked again, crossing the Wiltz River on 20 January. The division continued its advance, taking Grumelscheid on 21 January, and crossed the Clerf River on 24 January. The division was reassigned to XX Corps. The division immediately shifted to the east bank of the Saar, and maintained defensive positions in the Saarlautern area from 29 January until 6 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|Two Rivers is {{the final}} {{checkpoint}} in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route. Mushers are required to <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> least eight hours in Two Rivers in odd years to ensure the health of their dogs during the final leg of the race. The terrain in this stretch is among the easiest on the trail, with gently rolling hills and forest which gradually change into an urban landscape as racers approach Fairbanks. The greatest challenge for racers in the Two Rivers area is distinguishing the Yukon Quest trail from other sled dog trails, {{many of which have}} similar markings. Mushers have occasionally been deceived by these markings and taken wrong turns.|$|E

5|$|Bravely Default is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) {{which features}} a party of four characters navigating the fantasy world of Luxendarc. Navigation in towns, dungeons and the world map environments are done from an angled, third-person overhead view: the character remains still, the camera zooms out to a distant view. These environments are displayed on the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS system, while the bottom screen displays maps of environments, party stats and other information such as item menus. On the world map, a day-night cycle alters the types of enemies present, and after {{a certain point in}} the story an airship can be used to speed up travel and access previously inaccessible areas. In towns, players can interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), purchase items or magic at specialized shops, buy or sell weapons and equipment at an armory, or <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> an inn to restore health points (HP) and magic points (MP). In all environments, the party can find chests containing items, weapons or equipment. During certain points, a Party Chat option appears, giving players the option of initiating conversations between the party members. During exploration, standard enemies appear through random encounters: outside battle, the counter rate can be adjusted from high to nothing. The game features multiple difficulty levels, which can be adjusted freely outside battle.|$|E
5|$|The column {{had yet to}} {{run into}} any American troops when they reached Howard's Tavern (also known as Howard's Half-Way House), {{just a few hundred}} yards from the Jamaica Pass. Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). Five minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia {{officers}} stationed at the pass were captured without a shot fired, as they thought that the British were Americans. Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn, the British were through the pass and stopped so that the troops could <b>rest.</b> <b>At</b> 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass, while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy VII {{is mostly}} comparable to earlier Final Fantasy titles and Japanese role-playing games. The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, {{and the battle}} screen. At its grandest scale, players explore the entire world of Final Fantasy VII on a 3D world map. The world map is littered with representations of areas for the player to enter, including towns, environments, and ruins. Natural barrierssuch as mountains, deserts, and bodies of waterblock access by foot to some areas; as the game progresses, the player receives vehicles that help traverse these obstacles. Chocobos {{can be found in}} certain spots on the map, and if caught, can be ridden to areas inaccessible by foot or vehicle. In field mode, the player navigates fully scaled versions of the areas represented on the world map. For {{the first time in the}} Final Fantasy series, this mode is represented in three-dimensional space. The player can explore the environment, talk with characters, advance the story, and initiate event games in this mode. Event games are short minigames that use special control functions and are often tied into the story. While in field mode, the player may also find shops and inns. Shops provide an opportunity to buy and sell items that can aid Cloud and his party, such as weapons, armor, and accessories. If the characters <b>rest</b> <b>at</b> an inn, their hit points and mana points will be completely restored, along with any abnormalities contracted during battles.|$|E
