40|$|A rapid, <b>radiometric</b> <b>method</b> was {{developed}} to determine the susceptibility of filamentous fungi to amphotericin B. The rapid, <b>radiometric</b> <b>method</b> depended on measurement of the inhibition of 14 CO 2 production {{in the presence of}} amphotericin B. Thirty isolates of filamentous fungi were tested by the rapid, <b>radiometric</b> <b>method</b> and a reference agar dilution method. There was 93 % agreement between the two methods when an 80 % or greater decrease in CO 2 production was used to calculate the minimal inhibitory concentration with the rapid, <b>radiometric</b> <b>method.</b> Minimal inhibitory concentrations, based on 80 % decrease of CO 2 production, were achieved within 24 h of incubation with all of the fungi tested...|$|E
40|$|A rapid <b>radiometric</b> <b>method</b> for {{susceptibility}} {{testing of}} Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare to eight chemotherapeutic agents was {{compared with a}} conventional method.

50|$|By {{measuring}} {{the amount of}} radioactive decay of a radioactive isotope with a known half-life, geologists can establish the absolute age of the parent material. A number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose, and depending on the rate of decay, are used for dating different geological periods.

With the exception of the radiocarbon method, most of these techniques are actually based on measuring an increase in the abundance of a radiogenic isotope, which is the decay-product of the radioactive parent isotope. Two or more <b>radiometric</b> <b>methods</b> can be used in concert to achieve more robust results. Most <b>radiometric</b> <b>methods</b> are suitable for geological time only, but some such as the radiocarbon method and the 40Ar/39Ar dating method can be extended into the time of early human life and into recorded history.|$|R

A mixture of [U- 14 C] glucose, [guanido- 14 C] arginine, and [U- 14 C] glycine was used to monitor the metabolic activity of both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The tube dilution method and the <b>radiometric</b> <b>method</b> were performed in parallel in 18 clinical serum samples. In the <b>radiometric</b> <b>method,</b> the samples were separated into control and test portions and serially diluted in Mueller-Hinton broth. Antibiotics in the control portion were inactivated with penicillinase or cellulose phosphate or both. The radioactive mixture and a 1 -h culture of the patient's infecting organisms were added to all vials. The 14 CO 2 production after a 3 -h incubation at 37 degrees C was measured, and the percent inhibition was determined for each vial by using the control vials as reference (no inhibition). Radiometric dose-response curves obtained for all samples showed that, by using a {{greater than or equal}} to 60 % inhibition at 1 : 8 dilution, the <b>radiometric</b> <b>method</b> correctly predicted the outcome of the tube dilution method in 16 or 18 clinical samples...|$|E
40|$|A new <b>radiometric</b> <b>method</b> for the {{automatic}} detection of bacterial growth in blood cultures {{has been compared}} with conventional methods. A total of 2, 967 cultures from 1, 280 patients suspected of having bacteremia were studied. A 2 -ml amount of blood was inoculated into culture media in which the glucose was labeled with carbon- 14. The release of 14 CO 2 by bacterial metabolism was checked hourly for 18 to 24 hr, daily for the next 2 days, and, on the 12 th day, with an automated instrument. A 10 -ml amount of blood was studied by conventional bacteriological techniques. In 125 cultures from 50 patients, there was bacterial growth {{in at least one}} of the routine media. Of these, the <b>radiometric</b> <b>method</b> detected 102 cultures from 40 patients. In 111 cultures from 48 patients, there was radiometric detection of bacterial growth. In all of these cultures, there was detection of bacterial growth in subcultures from the radioactive medium. Of these, the routine laboratory detected 98 cultures from 40 patients. Neither method detected all patients with bacteremia. Among the 57 patients positive by one or both methods, routine techniques detected bacteria in 87 % and the <b>radiometric</b> <b>method</b> detected bacteria in 85 %. Seventy per cent of the cultures were detected first by the <b>radiometric</b> <b>method,</b> 65 % on the day of inoculation. Our results suggest that the <b>radiometric</b> <b>method</b> is faster than conventional techniques and comparable in accuracy. Its great advantage is that it is simple, automatic, and can be extended to automatic detection of bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics...|$|E

Forty (71 %) laboratories use fluorochrome rather than conventional basic fuchsin stains for screening clinical specimens for acid-fast bacilli. Of the 55 laboratories that routinely culture for mycobacteria, 16 (29 %) use the more rapid <b>radiometric</b> <b>methods.</b> Species identification of isolates is done by biochemical tests in 13 (23 %) laboratories; 40 (72 %) use nucleic acid probes, high-performance liquid chromatography, or the BACTEC p-nitro-alpha-acetylamino-beta-hydroxypropiophenone (NAP) test (rapid tests); 3 laboratories do not perform species identification. Drug susceptibility testing is performed with solid media by 36 of 45 (80 %) laboratories, while the more rapid <b>radiometric</b> <b>methods</b> are used by 9 (20 %) laboratories.

40|$|A {{new method}} for rapid, {{automatic}} radiometric measurement of antibiotic effects on bacterial growth {{was developed and}} compared with a conventional broth dilutior technique. The <b>radiometric</b> <b>method</b> measures the amount of radioactive CO 2 generated by the bacterial metabolism of 14 C-glucose {{in the presence of}} antibiotics. Antibiotic effect on bacterial growth was standardized by measuring the evolution of 14 CO 2 3 hr after inoculation. This measurement was found to be quantitatively related to increasing concentration of antibiotic provided the organism was susceptible to the antibiotic tested. In 50 of 179 experiments (28 %), each testing one organism against serial concentrations of an antibiotic, the concentration of antibiotic producing a 50 % reduction of 14 CO 2 within 3 hr after inoculation in comparison with a control culture was the same as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined by the broth dilution technique.

In 1995, a 20 % sample of hospital laboratories that responded to the initial questionnaire was resurveyed. Responses to the 1992 survey were received from personnel at 756 (70 %) hospitals representing 750 laboratories. Among laboratories performing the services, the use of recommended methods was as follows: fluorochrome stain for acid-fast bacillus microscopy (47 %); <b>radiometric</b> <b>methods</b> for primary culture (29 %); rapid (<b>radiometric</b> <b>methods,</b> use of nucleic acid probes, high-performance liquid chromatography, or gas-liquid chromatography) methods for identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (59 %); and <b>radiometric</b> <b>methods</b> for drug susceptibility testing (55 %). Reported times to complete specimen processing were shortest for laboratories that used recommended methods and longest for hospitals that referred specimens to outside laboratories. Only 46 % of surveyed laboratories performed at least the minimal number of mycobacterial cultures (20 /week) deemed necessary to maintain competence.
