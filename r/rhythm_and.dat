5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, <b>rhythm,</b> <b>and</b> {{intonation}} of a poem. <b>Rhythm</b> <b>and</b> meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} {{different}} circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues produced by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, {{but it has also}} been noted that they both popularised that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues artists. In order to sustain their careers most British R artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music. Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of world, folk and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and post-punk music and had a major impact on later genres, including Britpop. As a result, British <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music.|$|E
5|$|British <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues {{differed}} in tone {{from that of}} African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues singers were criticised for their emulation of <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually to whip up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E

5|$|By the 1960s, {{the term}} <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues had no longer been in wide use; instead, terms like soul music {{were used to}} {{describe}} popular music by black artists. In the 1980s, however, <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues came back into use, most often {{in the form of}} R, a usage that has continued to the present. Contemporary R arose when sultry funk singers like Prince became very popular, alongside dance-oriented pop stars like Michael Jackson and Madonna.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Dave Kelly, who {{had been}} a member of the John Dummer Blues Band formed The Blues Band with ex-Manfred Mann vocalist Paul Jones and Gary Fletcher, who {{continued}} to tour and record <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues into the new millennium. Roots music, including <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues, began to enjoy another resurgence of interest towards the end of the 1980s and in the 1990s. Annual blues festivals were established, including The Great British <b>Rhythm</b> <b>and</b> Blues Festival, held at Colne in Lancashire from 1989, which hosts both US and British R acts. In 1994 Jools Holland, former keyboard player with Squeeze and presenter of the highly influential TV show Later..., reshaped his backing band as Jools Holland's <b>Rhythm</b> <b>and</b> Blues Orchestra and, as well as supporting him on the show, they embarked on a series of tours. After leaving the Rolling Stones in 1997 Bill Wyman formed the Rhythm Kings, which featured guitarists Peter Frampton and Albert Lee as well former Procol Harum keyboardist Gary Brooker, touring and producing a series of R based albums. By 2000 the fanzine Blues Matters! had managed to become a regular glossy magazine.|$|E

The musical content of Freak Out! ranges from <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues, doo-wop and standard blues-influenced rock to orchestral arrangements and avant-garde sound collages. Although the album was initially poorly received in the United States, it was a success in Europe. It gained a cult following in America, where it continued to sell in substantial quantities until it was discontinued in the early 1970s.|$|E

With her portion of the proceeds, Mambo paid for both of her brothers to attend university and bought a car.|$|E

5|$|As a self-taught {{composer}} and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences {{led him to}} create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern, along with 1950s <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, {{while at the same}} time playing drums in <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues bands; later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} their second album, the Clash {{had started to}} depart from the punk rock sound.

This developed fascination with rock and roll inspired their approach for London Calling.|$|E

5|$|British trad jazz band-leader Chris Barber {{was one of}} {{the major}} figures in the {{development}} and popularisation of <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues in Britain the 1950s. His interest in the blues would help foster both the skiffle craze and the development of electric <b>rhythm</b> <b>and</b> blues, as members of his dance band would be fundamental to both movements. He founded the National Jazz League partly as a means of popularising the blues, served as co-director of the National Jazz Federation and helped establish the Marquee Club, which would become one of the major venues for British R bands. He also brought over American folk and blues performers who found they were much better known and paid in Europe than America, a series of tours that began with Josh White and Big Bill Broonzy in 1951, and would include Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Memphis Slim, Muddy Waters and Lonnie Johnson.|$|E
