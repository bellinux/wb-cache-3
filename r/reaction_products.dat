5|$|In nature, sixteen {{repositories}} {{were discovered}} at the Oklo mine in Gabon where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago. The fission products in these natural formations {{were found to}} have moved less than 10ft (3 m) over this period, though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and sorption from moving ground water; uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in spent fuel rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction, so that <b>reaction</b> <b>products</b> would be less accessible to groundwater attack.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} {{methods for}} different isotopes vary, and only those for promethium-147 are given {{because it is}} the only isotope with industrial applications. Promethium-147 is produced in large quantities (compared to other isotopes) by bombarding uranium-235 with thermal neutrons. The output is relatively high, at 2.6% of the total product. Another way to produce promethium-147 is via neodymium-147, which decays to promethium-147 with a short half-life. Neodymium-147 can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium-146 with thermal neutrons or by bombarding a uranium carbide target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator. Another method is to bombard uranium-238 with fast neutrons to cause fast fission, which, among multiple <b>reaction</b> <b>products,</b> creates promethium-147.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{chemical}} chain reactions was first suggested in 1913 by the German chemist Max Bodenstein for {{a situation in}} which two molecules react to form not just the final <b>reaction</b> <b>products,</b> but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the original substances to cause more to react. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction was first hypothesized by the Hungarian scientist Leo Szilard on 12 September 1933. Szilard realized that if a nuclear reaction produced neutrons or dineutrons, which then caused further nuclear reactions, the process might be self-perpetuating. Szilard proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts, although he did entertain the possibility of using uranium as a fuel. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple nuclear reactor the following year. The discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, opened up the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction with uranium or indium, but initial experiments were unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|Whereas {{oxidation}} by air {{is still}} being used, oxygen (> 95% purity) is preferred for several reasons, such as higher molar yield of ethylene oxide (75–82% for oxygen vs. 63–75% for air), higher reaction rate (no gas dilution) and no need of separating nitrogen in the <b>reaction</b> <b>products.</b>|$|E

40|$|Ultrastructural {{localization}} of thiamine pyrophosphatase (TPPase) {{activity was}} studied in secretory {{cells of the}} lateral prostate and seminal vesicle of normal and castrated guinea pigs and castrates treated with 17 β-oestradiol benzoate. The present study has demonstrated that TPPase <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> is consistently localized in the three to four trans cisternae of Golgi complexes in both the lateral prostate and the seminal vesicle. The reaction was intense and the <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> often filled the cisternae completely. After castration there was a decrease in TPPase activity in both glands as revealed by {{the reduction in the}} amount of the <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> which was found mainly in one to two trans cisternae of the regressed Golgi complex. The <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> changed from a dense to a more particulate or granular pattern or to discrete deposits of high electron-density. Administration of 17 β-oestradiol benzoate to the castrates caused changes in the localization and patterns of distribution of TPPase. In the lateral prostate there was an apparent increase in TPPase activity. The <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> was found in two to four trans cisternae and occasionally in the trans-most cisternae of the dilated Golgi complex. The <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> appeared as discrete, dense coarse precipitates. In the seminal vesicle TPPase <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> was consistently found in one to two trans cisternae in cells with larger Golgi complexes. However, almost all cisternae of the smaller Golgi complexes were TPPase-positive. The cytochemical {{results of the present study}} suggest that TPPase activity and possibly the process of glycosylation in secretory cells of the lateral prostate and seminal vesicle may have been affected after castration and after oestradiol administration. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|In another application, Mössbauer {{spectroscopy}} is used {{to characterize}} phase transformations in iron catalysts, e.g., those used for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.

40|$|Previous electron-microscopic {{studies on}} the liver have shown that {{following}} excessive administration of iron to experimental animals, small particles believed to represent ferritin and/or hemosiderin (electron-dense iron-containing particles [IPs]) accumulate in membrane-bound bodies [...] many with a lysosome-like structure [...] in liver parenchymal and Kupffer cells. Further identification of the IP-containing bodies has been facilitated by the application of histochemical techniques for the demonstration of acid phosphatase. The results have shown that <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> was deposited over organelles similar in appearance to the IP-containing ones, indicating that they were lysosomes. However, the granular nature of the <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> makes it difficult or impossible to decide whether IPs are present simultaneously with <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> in the organelle. In order to clarify this qualitative aspect, x-ray microanalysis has been utilized to identify iron and lead (<b>reaction</b> <b>product)</b> in the various structures thought to represent lysosomes. The results indicate that all IP-containing bodies also show the presence of <b>reaction</b> <b>product,</b> and thus {{can be regarded as}} lysosomes.

25|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{synthesis}} of benzoic acid from phenylmagnesium bromide and dry ice.

The 3, 3 '-diaminobenzidine (DAB) -Mn 2 + technique in which cobalt ions {{were included in the}} incubation medium was applied to unfixed cryostat sections of intact tissues. Addition of manganese ions to the DAB-Co(2 +) -containing medium greatly increased the amounts of final <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> formed compared with incubations with only DAB and cobalt ions. In liver, a blue final <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> was deposited, particularly in hepatocytes surrounding portal tracts. In the small intestine, the DAB-cobalt complex was mainly found at the basal side of enterocytes. Goblet cells remained unstained. Electron microscopical images revealed that an electron-dense <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> was exclusively present at both inner and outer membranes and at the intermembrane space in mitochondria of liver parenchymal cells and duodenal enterocytes. It was shown that the spontaneous formation of final <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> was enzymatic and dependent on the presence of oxygen in the medium.

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{basis of}} glomerular filtration and protein reabsorption in mouse kidney was examined by using mushroom tyrosinase subunits (mol wt 34, 500), as an ultrastructural tracer. Almost immediately after injection tyrosinase <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> was visualized in the glomerulus, {{and within the}} capillary lumen extending into the endothelial fenestrae. The entire basement membrane showed accumulations of tyrosinase in the subendothelial and subepithelial layers. The urinary space contained considerable amounts of <b>reaction</b> <b>product,</b> some of which was adsorbed to the cell coat of the podocytes. <b>Reaction</b> <b>product</b> could also {{be seen in the}} brush border region of the proximal tubule cells. By 30 min after injection, no tyrosinase <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> was demonstrable in the glomerulus except for dense vesicles in mesangial cells.

The behavior of tyrosinase in the mouse kidney is in accordance with that of other low molecular weight tracers. The pattern of localization within the basement membrane provides additional support for the presence of two filtration barriers in the glomerulus. The adherence of tyrosinase to the cell coat of the glomerular epithelial cells suggests that this may be an additional mechanism whereby protein is removed from the glomerular filtrate.
