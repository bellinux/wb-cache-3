5|$|The name Level Mountain is a {{reference}} to the gently sloping plateau surface of this large volcano. It was adopted on December 21, 1944 as identified in the Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. This name appeared on the National Topographic System (NTS) map 104/NE but was replaced with the name Level Mountain <b>Range</b> <b>on</b> August 14, 1952 upon production of NTS map 104J. The reason for this name change was that cartographers were uncertain as to what the name Level Mountain referred to. They cited H. S. Bostock's 1948 report Physiography of the Canadian Cordillera, With Special Reference to the Area North of the Fifty-Fifth Parallel in which Bostock stated that Level Mountain is a small prominent mountain <b>range</b> <b>on</b> the Nahlin Plateau. Despite this misinterpretation, Level Mountain is still the local name for the entire massif and the Level Mountain Range for a range of steep peaks centered on the volcano's summit.|$|E
5|$|A {{short-lived}} medicane developed {{near the}} end of September2006 along the coast of Italy. The origins of the medicane {{can be traced to the}} alpine Atlas mountain <b>range</b> <b>on</b> the evening of 25September, likely forming as a normal lee cyclone. At 0600UTC on 26September, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model analyses indicated the existence of two low-pressure areas along the shoreline of Italy, one on the west coast, sweeping eastward across the Tyrrhenian Sea, while the other, slightly more intense, low was located over the Ionian Sea. As the latter low approached the Strait of Sicily, it met an eastward-moving convection-producing cold front, resulting in significant intensification, while the system simultaneously reduced in size. It then achieved a minimum atmospheric pressure of approximately 986mbar (29.12inHg) after transiting north-northeastward across the -wide Salentine peninsula in the course of roughly 30minutes at 0915UTC the same day.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war with}} Japan began, Wau became an {{evacuation}} centre, receiving refugees from Lae and Salamaua. Non-native {{women and children were}} evacuated while men of military age were called up for service in the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles, the local militia unit. Initially, civilians were evacuated by civilian aircraft but as the Japanese drew closer—bombing Wau on 23 January 1942—it became too dangerous to fly without fighter escort, which was unavailable. This left some 250 European and Asian men stranded. These refugees made a hazardous journey over the Owen Stanley <b>Range</b> <b>on</b> foot by way of Kudjeru and Tekadu to Bulldog, a disused mining settlement where there was an aerodrome, and thence down the Lakekamu River to the sea.|$|E

5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} fast-swimming, agile predators that feed {{primarily}} on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Their aggressive demeanor {{enables them to}} dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite their moderate size. Many grey reef sharks have a home <b>range</b> <b>on</b> a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow water, where the higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the grey reef shark is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters of one to six pups are born every other year.|$|E
