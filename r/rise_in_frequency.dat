50|$|The {{reason that}} preemphasis {{is needed is}} {{that the process of}} {{detecting}} a frequency-modulated signal in a receiver produces a noise spectrum that <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> (a so-called triangular spectrum). Without preemphasis, the received audio would sound unacceptably noisy at high frequencies, especially under conditions of low carrier-to-noise ratio, i.e., during fringe reception conditions. Preemphasis increases the magnitude of the higher signal frequencies, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio. At the output of the discriminator in the FM receiver, a deemphasis network restores the original signal power distribution.|$|R

40|$|Plasmodium falciparum invades {{erythrocytes}} via {{interactions with}} proteins on the host cell surface. By analyzing genome sequence data from human populations, including 1269 African individuals, we identify a {{diverse array of}} large copy number variants affecting the erythrocyte invasion receptor genes GYPA and GYPB. We find that a nearby association with severe malaria is explained by a complex structural rearrangement that involves the loss of GYPB and gain of two hybrid genes, each with a GYPB extracellular domain and GYPA intracellular domain. This variant {{reduces the risk of}} severe malaria by 40 % and has recently <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>in</b> parts of Kenya. We show that the structural variant encodes the Dantu blood group antigen, a serologically distinct red cell phenotype. Thus structural variation of erythrocyte invasion receptors is associated with natural resistance to severe malaria...|$|R

40|$|Several human genetic {{disorders}} of hemoglobin have <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> {{because of}} the protection they offer against death from malaria, sickle-cell anaemia being a canonical example.

We demonstrate that these contrasting profiles of malaria-protective alleles can arise and be stably maintained by two well-documented phenomena: an alleviation of the clinical severity of α- and β-thalassemia in compound thalassemic genotypes and a cancellation of malaria protection when α-thalassemia and the sickle-cell trait are coinherited. The complex distribution of globin mutants across Africa and the Mediterranean can therefore be explained by their specific intracellular interactions.

40|$|Background: Belgian Blue cattle {{are famous}} for their {{exceptional}} muscular development or " double-muscling". This defining feature emerged following the fixation of a loss-of-function variant in the myostatin gene in the eighties. Since then, sustained selection has further increased muscle mass of Belgian Blue animals to a comparable extent. In the present paper, we study the genetic determinants of this second wave of muscle growth. Results: A scan for selective sweeps did not reveal the recent fixation of another allele with major effect on muscularity. However, a genome-wide association study identified two genome-wide significant and three suggestive quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting specific muscle groups and jointly explaining 8 - 21 % of the heritability. The top two QTL are caused by presumably recent mutations on unique haplotypes that have rapidly <b>risen</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>in</b> the population. While one appears {{on its way to}} fixation, the ascent of the other is compromised as the likely underlying MRC 2 mutation causes crooked tail syndrome in homozygotes. Genomic prediction models indicate that the residual additive variance is largely polygenic. Conclusions: Contrary to complex traits in humans which have a near-exclusive polygenic architecture, muscle mass in beef cattle (as other production traits under directional selection), appears to be controlled by (i) a handful of recent mutations with large effect that rapidly sweep through the population, and (ii) a large number of presumably older variants with very small effects that <b>rise</b> slowly <b>in</b> the population (polygenic adaptation).

Dermatoglyphics form in utero during early gestation and {{may be influenced by}} genetic and environmental factors operating at that time. Present investigation was undertaken to study alterations in dermatoglyphic patterns with special reference to various congenital heart diseases (CHD). The study involved 102 cases of CHD and 100 cases of normal individuals. It was observed that percent frequency of ulnar loops significantly increased in CHD group as compared to control group. Mean 'atd' angle was also increased in CHD group as compared to control group indicating distal displacement of palmar axial triradius (t). Thus, <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> of ulnar loops and increase in 'atd' angle can be considered as one of the diagnostic criteria for CHD. ...|$|E

40|$|With the {{occurrence}} of disasters caused by natural hazards <b>rising</b> <b>in</b> <b>frequency</b> and intensity, the importance of conducting research {{on the effect of}} disasters on major infrastructure becomes evident. Road infrastructure such as bridges, culverts and flood-ways play an important role before, during and after a disaster since providing access to affected areas is a vital factor influencing the evacuation, rescue, recovery and also reconstruction activities. Consequence assessment of disasters on road structures provides valuable information for decision makers to measure the potential risk on structures and to identify and implement appropriate strategies and programs to sustain the infrastructure. Assessment of social, environmental and economic consequences of failure of road structures provides necessary data to design road structures that are not only more resilient to natural hazards, but also sustainable in the long run. This paper reviews the current literature which focuses on measuring sustainability (i. e. social, environmental and economic) impacts of road structure failure due to disasters. The paper also analyses {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} relevant studies in order to understand the knowledge gap and to build a more rigorous, holistic model that could be used to assess sustainability impacts of failure of road structures in varied disaster scenarios...|$|R
