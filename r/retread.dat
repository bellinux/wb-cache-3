50|$|There are {{two main}} {{processes}} used for <b>retreading</b> tires, called Mold Cure and Pre Cure. Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as shearograph to locate non-visible damage and embedded debris and nails. Some casings are repaired and some are discarded. Tires can be <b>retreaded</b> multiple times if the casing is in usable condition. Tires used for short delivery vehicles are <b>retreaded</b> more than long haul tires {{over the life of}} the tire body. Casings fit for <b>retreading</b> have the old tread buffed away to prepare for <b>retreading.</b>|$|R

The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide said [...] "A deliberately mawkish Christmas episode that is low on good jokes (although the Simpsons watching their own fire on television is a good start) and a <b>retread</b> of any number of episodes where Bart does wrong, feels guilty and eventually has to fess up.

500|$|The band's {{music is}} often {{compared}} to Alice in Chains which the band cites as an influence.

Katherine Turman of Amazon.com states the band has [...] "dark, swirling, commanding music". She also commented on the band's third album Faceless, which [...] "mixes arena rock in the vein of an Alice in Chains", [...] "riff-heavy, layered tunes and sharp, confident bridge-burning lyrics".|$|E
500|$|DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, did {{not think}} the episode {{developed}} Lisa's and Homer's relationship, but it [...] "tosses in some good pokes at the NFL and the culture that surrounds the sport." [...] Jacobson added that although the episode [...] "echoes the neglectful father theme seen not long ago in 'Lisa's Pony', the show doesn't feel like just a <b>retread.</b> [...] It's not a classic, but it remains an above average program." [...] The San Jose Mercury Newss Daniel Brown said NFL gambling [...] "seems to be a crew-wide addiction, which is why 'Lisa the Greek' is filled with sophisticated gags about point spreads and bookies."

50|$|Tires {{that are}} fully worn can be re-manufactured {{to replace the}} worn tread. This is known as <b>retreading</b> or recapping, a process of buffing away the worn tread and {{applying}} a new tread. <b>Retreading</b> is economical for truck tires because the cost of replacing the tread {{is less than the}} price of a new tire. <b>Retreading</b> passenger tires is less economical because the cost of <b>retreading</b> is high compared to the price of new cheap tires, but favorable compared to high-end brands.|$|R

500|$|Retrospective reviewers {{recommended}} {{the game for}} those who mastered the original, or those who would appreciate painful challenge. Casual Mario fans, GameZone wrote, would not find much to enjoy. Nintendo Life reviewer felt that while the original was designed for recklessness, its sequel taught patience, and despite its difficulty, remained both [...] "fiendishly clever" [...] and fun. On the other hand, GamesRadar felt that the game was an unoriginal, boring <b>retread,</b> and apart from its [...] "pointlessly cruel" [...] difficulty, not worthy of the player's time. GamesRadar and IGN agreed with Nintendo of America's choice against releasing the harder game in the 1980s, though Eurogamer thought that The Lost Levels was [...] "technically a much better game" [...] than the Doki Doki Panic-based Super Mario Bros. 2 the American market received instead.|$|E
500|$|Several media {{commentators}} made negative {{comparisons between}} Mercy Point and other television programs. The show {{was described as}} reminiscent of a Saturday Night Live skit [...] "that sounded brighter on paper than it plays on the air" [...] by The Sun-Sentinels Tom Jicha, who felt it served as a spoof of ER. Caryn James of The New York Times wrote that Mercy Point was the [...] "oddball new series", saying it was not compelling either in a dramatic or campy manner. Editor Jason Snell criticized the show as a <b>retread</b> of Crisis Center and General Hospital, describing it as an [...] "utter waste of an intriguing premise", and The Chicago Tribune's Steve Johnson called it the [...] "ER-in-space mess". Both Snell and Johnson encouraged UPN to cancel the series following the announcement of its hiatus.|$|E

On the review aggregation website Metacritic, the first season scored 78 out of 100 based on 22 reviews. One reviewer pointed to the <b>retread</b> of some themes from HBO and David Simon's earlier works, but still found it valuable viewing and particularly resonant because it parallels the war on terror through the chronicling of the war on drugs. Another review postulated that the series might suffer because of its reliance on profanity and slowly drawn-out plot, but was largely positive about the show's characters and intrigue.|$|E

Gaston called the loose structure and openness of the game a [...] "revelatory change", and {{was glad to see}} that some restrictions in previous Zelda titles were not present in A Link Between Worlds. The introduction of the item rental system was well received, with many reviewers pointing out that the system granted players with more freedom. Ryckert loved having items available from the beginning, saying that it allowed him to experiment in combat. Both MacDonald and Gies agreed that losing rented items upon defeat added another layer of challenge and consequence to the game.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a legal-economic {{analysis of the}} Appellate Body decision in Brazil ‚Äì <b>Retreaded</b> Tyres. We develop a simple economic model that we use to analyze the market structure and environmental externalities that were most relevant to this case. We start by analyzing Brazil's policies in a model in which tyre <b>retreading</b> generates a positive production externality through the delay it provides society before a used tyre becomes a waste product {{with the potential to}} harm society through its adverse impact on human health and the environment. We examine the different welfare implications of (i) a production subsidy for <b>retreading</b> of once-used Brazilian tyres, (ii) a tariff on imports of <b>retreaded</b> tyres, and (iii) a ban on imports of <b>retreaded</b> tyres. While a production subsidy is the first-best instrument to address this type of externality, there are reasons to believe that it might be infeasible. The welfare implications of the other measures depend importantly on the magnitude of the positive production externality. From the lens provided by this economic analysis, we draw three primary insights. First, we identify the critical piece of empirical information that the Panel and Appellate Body require to make a rational judgment of the utility of the Brazilia...|$|R
