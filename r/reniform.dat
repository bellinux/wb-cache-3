5|$|One {{potentially}} distinguishing {{character is}} {{the shape of}} the ultimate segments in the middle part of the leaf blade, which are oblong in A.pedatum and long-triangular or <b>reniform</b> (kidney-shaped) in A.viridimontanum and some specimens of A.aleuticum. Furthermore, A.viridimontanum can grow in both shade and sun, while A.pedatum grows in shade only.|$|E
5|$|Viewed in deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} of A. daucipes are white, cream, or {{yellowish}} in color. Viewed with a microscope, they have an ellipsoid to elongate shape (sometimes kidney-shape, or <b>reniform),</b> and dimensions of 8–11 by 5–7µm. They are translucent (hyaline), with thin walls, and are amyloid, meaning that they absorb iodine when stained Melzer's reagent. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 30–50 by 7–11µm, club-shaped, and 4-spored, with clamps at their bases. The cheilocystidia are abundant, small, roughly spherical to club-shaped cells, with dimensions of 15–40 by 10–28µm. The cap cuticle is between 75 and 180µm thick, and consists of a dense layer of thin-walled, interwoven, and slightly gelatinized hyphae that are 2–5µm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae of this species.|$|E
25|$|The fruit (utricle) is {{immersed}} in the swollen, hardened perianth base. The fruit is indehiscent or dehiscence eventually circumscissile. The horizontal seed is orbicular or <b>reniform,</b> with dark brown, smooth or glossy seed coat. The seed contains an annular embryo and copious perisperm.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of terms are used to {{describe}} seed shapes, {{many of which are}} largely self-explanatory such as Bean-shaped (<b>reniform)</b> – resembling a kidney, with lobed ends {{on either side of the}} hilum, Square or Oblong – angular with all sides more or less equal or longer than wide, Triangular – three sided, broadest below middle, Elliptic or Ovate or Obovate – rounded at both ends, or egg shaped (ovate or obovate, broader at one end), being rounded but either symmetrical about the middle or broader below the middle or broader above the middle.|$|E
25|$|Other {{less obvious}} terms include discoid (resembling a disc or plate, having both {{thickness}} and parallel faces {{and with a}} rounded margin), ellipsoid, globose (spherical), or subglobose (Inflated, but less than spherical), lenticular, oblong, ovoid, <b>reniform</b> and sectoroid. Striate seeds are striped with parallel, longitudinal lines or ridges. The commonest colours are brown and black, other colours are infrequent. The surface varies from highly polished to considerably roughened. The surface may {{have a variety of}} appendages (see Seed coat). A seed coat with the consistency of cork is referred to as suberose. Other terms include crustaceous (hard, thin or brittle).|$|E
25|$|Underside: yellow, {{generally}} a slightly paler shade {{than that of}} the upperside, with the following reddish-brown markings. Forewing: two small spots or specks in basal half of cell and a <b>reniform</b> (kidney-shaped) spot or ring on the discocellulars. Hindwing: a slightly curved subbasal series of three small spots, an irregular slender ring or spot on the discocellulars, followed by a highly irregular, curved, transverse, discal series of spots or specks, some or all of which are often obsolescent. On both the forewings and hindwings, the veins that attain the costal and terminal margins end in minute reddish-brown specks. Antenna are greyish yellow, the club black; head, thorax and abdomen are yellow, shaded with fuscous scales; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen are yellowish white. The sex-mark seen from above appears as a thickening of the basal half of the median vein on the forewing.|$|E
500|$|The spores of A.auricula-judae {{are long}} and sausage shaped, {{ranging in size from}} 16 to 18 micrometres (μm) long by 6 to 8 μm thick. The spores {{themselves}} are white, cream or yellowish, and are hyaline. The spores can sometimes be seen in a whitish mass {{on the underside of the}} fruit body. The species has elongated cylindrical basidia with three transverse septa (internal cross-walls dividing the hyphae). Basidia 60-72x 4-7.5μm; sterigmata lateral, well developed, 3-4.5μm long. [...] Spores smooth, hyaline, <b>reniform</b> to allantoid, 14-18 Χ 6-8μm, guttulate. Hairs on the fruit body are from 85 to 100 μm in length, and 5 to 6 μm in diameter. They are hyaline, lack a central strand and have rounded tips. They do not grow in dense tufts.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Podoserpula species have an unusual form unknown in other fungi. The fruit bodies, which grow to {{a height of}} , consist of up to a dozen {{cup-shaped}} (spathulate) to kidney-shaped (<b>reniform)</b> caps arranged in multiple tiers and attached to a central stem. Caps are joined to the main axis by short, flattened, stem-like attachments. The variety tristis, in contrast, has [...] caps that are more circular and appear to be pierced either centrally or off to the side. The surface of the caps is smooth and often brightly colored. The hymenium (spore-bearing surface) {{on the underside of}} the caps is pink and has a folded and corrugated surface. Close to the area of attachment between the cap and the stem-like connection to the main axis are swellings resembling warts or blisters. Individual caps resemble somewhat those of the European species Plicaturopsis crispa.|$|E
60|$|The {{varieties}} of the peach and the nectarine {{run in parallel}} lines. In both classes the kinds differ {{from each other in}} the flesh of the fruit being white, red, or yellow; in being clingstones or freestones; in the flowers being large or small, with certain other characteristic differences; and in the leaves being serrated without glands, or crenated and furnished with globose or <b>reniform</b> glands. (10/55. 'Catalogue of Fruit in Garden of Hort. Soc.' 1842 page 105.) We can hardly account for this parallelism by supposing that each variety of the nectarine is descended from a corresponding variety of the peach; for though our nectarines are certainly the descendants of several kinds of peaches, yet a large number are the descendants of other nectarines, and they vary so much when thus reproduced that we can scarcely admit the above explanation.|$|E
6000|$|The great {{preponderance}} of the two orders Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ are what first strike us in this list. In the former case the facilities for wind-dispersal afforded by the structure {{of so many of}} the seeds render it comparatively easy to account for their having reached the islands at an early period. The Lobelias, judging from Hildebrand's descriptions, may have been transported in several {328} different ways. Most of the endemic genera are berry-bearers and thus offer the means of dispersal by fruit-eating birds. The endemic species of the genus Lobelia have sometimes very minute seeds, which might be carried long distances by wind, while other species, especially Lobelia gaudichaudii, have a [...] "hard, almost woody capsule which opens late," [...] apparently well adapted for floating long distances. Afterwards [...] "the calycine covering withers away, leaving a fenestrate woody network" [...] enclosing the capsule, and the seeds themselves are [...] "compressed, <b>reniform,</b> or orbicular, and margined," [...] and thus of a form well adapted to be carried to great heights and distances by gales or hurricanes.|$|E
6000|$|The {{varieties}} of the peach have largely increased in number since the Christian era, when {{from two to}} five varieties were known (10/56. Dr. A. Targioni-Tozzetti 'Journal Hort. Soc.' volume 9 page 167. Alph. de Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 885.) and the nectarine was unknown. At the present time, besides many varieties said to exist in China, Downing describes, in the United States, seventy-nine native and imported {{varieties of}} the peach; {{and a few years}} ago Lindley (10/57. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 5 page 554. See also Carriere 'Description et Class. des Varietes de Pechers.') enumerated one hundred and sixty-four varieties of the peach and nectarine grown in England. I have already indicated the chief points of difference between the several varieties. Nectarines, even when produced from distinct kinds of peaches, always possess their own peculiar flavour, and are smooth and small. Clingstone and freestone peaches, which differ in the ripe flesh either firmly adhering to the stone, or easily separating from it, also differ in the character of the stone itself; that of the freestones or melters being more deeply fissured, with the sides of the fissures smoother than in clingstones. In the various kinds the flowers differ not only in size, but in the larger flowers the petals are differently shaped, more imbricated, generally red in the centre and pale towards the margin: whereas in the smaller flowers the margin of the petal is usually more darkly coloured. One variety has nearly white flowers. The leaves are more or less serrated, and are either destitute of glands, or have globose or <b>reniform</b> glands (10/58. Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 907.) and some few peaches, such as the Brugnen, bear on the same tree both globular and kidney-shaped glands. (10/59. M. Carriere in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 1154.) According to Robertson (10/60. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 3 page 332. See also 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 271 to same effect. Also 'Journal of Horticulture' September 26, 1865 page 254.) the trees with glandular leaves are liable to blister, but not in any great degree to mildew; whilst the non-glandular trees are more subject to curl, to mildew, and to the attacks of aphides. The varieties differ in the period of their maturity, in the fruit keeping well, and in hardiness,--the latter circumstance being especially attended to in the United States. Certain varieties, such as the Bellegarde, stand forcing in hot-houses better than other varieties. The flat-peach of China is the most remarkable of all the varieties; it is so much depressed towards the summit, that the stone is here covered only by roughened skin and not by a fleshy layer. (10/61. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 4 page 512.) Another Chinese variety, called the Honey-peach, is remarkable from the fruit terminating in a long sharp point; its leaves are glandless and widely dentate. (10/62. 'Journal of Horticulture' September 8, 1853 page 188.) The Emperor of Russia peach is a third singular variety, having deeply double-serrated leaves; the fruit is deeply cleft with one-half projecting considerably beyond the other: it originated in America, and its seedlings inherit similar leaves.
