5|$|Louis Pojman has {{suggested}} four strong influences on Kant's ethics. The {{first is the}} Lutheran sect Pietism, to which Kant's parents subscribed. Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief, more concerned with feeling than <b>rationality.</b> Kant believed that <b>rationality</b> is required, but {{that it should be}} concerned with morality and good will. Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work, The Social Contract, influenced Kant's view on the fundamental worth of human beings. Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant's ethics. Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism, which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge, rather than something based on human desire. Natural law (the belief that the moral law is determined by nature) and intuitionism (the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths) were, according to Pojman, also influential for Kant.|$|E

5|$|Because Kant viewed <b>rationality</b> as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he {{believed}} that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their <b>rationality</b> and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E

5|$|Some {{arguments}} from moral order suggest that morality {{is based on}} <b>rationality</b> and that this can only be the case {{if there is a}} moral order in the universe.

Alternative {{arguments from}} moral order have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E

25|$|By {{locating}} {{the conditions of}} <b>rationality</b> in the social structure of language use, Habermas moves the locus of <b>rationality</b> from the autonomous subject to subjects in interaction. <b>Rationality</b> is a property not of individuals per se, but rather of structures of undistorted communication. In this notion Habermas has overcome the ambiguous plight of the subject in critical theory. If capitalistic technological society weakens the autonomy and <b>rationality</b> of the subject, it is not through the domination of the individual by the apparatus but through technological <b>rationality</b> supplanting a describable <b>rationality</b> of communication. And, in his sketch of communicative ethics as the highest stage in the internal logic {{of the evolution of}} ethical systems, Habermas hints at the source of a new political practice that incorporates the imperatives of evolutionary <b>rationality.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{understand}} how organizations can connect with their customers already in the early phases of innovation. Understanding latent customer needs is important for organizational success. Customer understanding is organizational knowledge about the customers, their needs and wants, as well as an understanding about what the organization can do for the customers (Nordlund 2009). Customer understanding is constructed in the early and chaotic stage of new product development, in the fuzzy front end. As the phase shapes the overall direction of the innovation process, the key for successful new product development is understanding latent customer needs already in the fuzzy front end. (Koen et al. 2001; Kim & Wilemon, 2002.) This study is a case study that offers a snapshot on the values and <b>rationalities</b> behind an organization's customer understanding in the fuzzy front end. By understanding the similarities and differences in values and <b>rationalities</b> shaping both latent customer needs as well as customer understanding, we can better understand how to connect the two. The theoretical frame of this study builds on several discussions in the fields of innovation research, marketing research, organizational studies and sociology. It combines a practice-based view to knowledge with the theoretical discussions about values and <b>rationalities.</b> Combining these lines of thought offers an opportunity to examine organizational customer knowledge from viewpoints not widely addressed in the current literature. The data was collected by using empathic research method, and the underlying values and <b>rationalities</b> were being interpreted by using an interpretational framework. According to the instrumental case study, the case itself is secondary, and facilitates of the study of something else. In this study, the instrumental case refers to the differences between two bodies of knowledge, the customer understanding and the latent customer needs. The results of this study imply that connecting with the customers in the fuzzy front end is more than sharing the same values and <b>rationalities.</b> In this study, the organization's customer understanding in the fuzzy front end is mainly based on norms. However, the customers base their everyday practices, and thus latent customer needs, equally on values, <b>rationalities,</b> as well as norms. Emphasizing practice-based collaboration between organizations and the customers is important in the fuzzy front end, so that the nature of customer understanding can be built equally on values and <b>rationalities,</b> together with norms...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of Ontario 2 ̆ 7 s legal aid program {{has followed the}} trajectory of broader discursive shifts, beginning from charity to rights and towards fiscal responsibility. Such discursive developments have been imagined by governmentality scholars as indicative of specific historical governmental strategies. Within this field, <b>rationalities</b> of welfarism and neo-liberalism have dominated {{the ways in which}} government has been analysed. This paper examines how representative the shift from welfarism to neo-liberalism is of actual programs and to what extent these dominant discourses structure the current legal aid program in Ontario, Legal Aid Ontario (LAO). Through discourse analysis, I critically examine programmatic texts such as manuals and policy guidelines to draw out the discourses which operate in these documents. The findings suggest that the governmental <b>rationalities</b> that inform LAO cannot be neatly categorized as neo-liberalism; rather, there is evidence of a multiplicity or complexity of <b>rationalities</b> that have shaped LAO...|$|R

The policy-making process was in line with the Assembly’s commitment to participative and stakeholder policy-led development. I explore the policy-making process through a Foucauldian understanding of power, discourses, and policy <b>rationalities,</b> identifing four primary <b>rationalities</b> within the TAN  8 policy: spatial planning, energy targets, reliance on large-scale wind power, and the rationale that the traditional planning paradigm can resolve deep-seated conflicts over renewable energy. I explore how these <b>rationalities</b> emerged and were reinforced through the powerful discourse coalitions that emerged within the TAN  8 stakeholder group. As a result, I suggest that ‘consensus’ should not necessarily be the aim of participative policy making and that the participatory process should not be relied upon to deliver ‘rational’ planning policies, leading to sustainable development. Instead, we must embrace the notion of pluralism with an understanding of the discursive powers at work within the policy-making process. ...|$|R
