OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), etidronic (HEBP), and citric acid (CA) associated with different irrigation regimens on root dentin roughness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five root halves of anterior teeth were used. The root parts were sectioned in thirds, embedded in acrylic resin and polished to a standard surface roughness. Initially, the samples of each third were randomly assigned into 3 groups and treated as follows: G 1 - saline solution (control); G 2 - 5 % NaOCl+ 18 % HEBP mixed in equal parts; and G 3 - 2. 5 % NaOCl. After initial measuments, the G 3 samples were distributed into subgroups G 4, G 5 and G 6, which were subjected to 17 % EDTA, 10 % CA and 9 % HEBP, respectively. Following the new measuments, these groups received a final flush with 2. 5 % NaOCl, producing G 7, G 8 and G 9. The dentin surface roughness (Ra) was determined before and after treatments using a profilometer. The Wilcoxon test (&# 945;< 0. 05) was used to compare the values before and after treatments, and the Friedman test (&# 945;< 0. 05) to detect any differences among root thirds. RESULTS: (i) NaOCl did not affect the surface roughness; (ii) there was a significant {{increase in}} roughness after the use of chelating agents (P< 0. 01); and (iii) only the G 3 group showed a difference in surface roughness between apical third and other thirds of the teeth (P< 0. 0043).

50|$|As {{part of the}} Apollo 12 mission, {{the camera}} from the Surveyor 3 probe was brought back from the Moon to Earth. On {{analyzing}} the camera {{it was found that}} the common bacterium Streptococcus mitis was alive on the camera. This was attributed by NASA to the camera not being sterilized on Earth prior to its launch two and a half years previously.. However later study showed that the scientists analysing the camera on return to Earth used procedures that were inadequate to prevent <b>recontamination</b> after return to Earth, for instance with their arms exposed, not covering their entire bodies as modern scientists would do. There may also have been possibilities for contamination during the return mission as the camera was returned in a porous bag rather than the airtight containers used for lunar sample return. As a result the result remains controversial.|$|E
50|$|Antimicrobial {{substances}} that {{are incorporated into}} packaging materials can control microbial contamination by reducing the growthrate and the maximum growth population. This is done by extending the lagphase of the target microorganism or by inactivating themicroorganisms on contact. One of these applications is to extend the shelf life of food and promotesafety by reducing {{the rate of growth}} of microorganisms when the package is in contact with the surfaces of solid foods, for example, meat, cheese, etc. Second, antimicrobial packaging materials greatly reduce the potential for <b>recontamination</b> of processed products and simplify the treatment of materials to eliminate product contamination. For example, self-sterilizing packaging might eliminate the need for peroxide treatment in aseptic packaging. Antimicrobial polymers {{can also be used to}} cover surfaces of food processing equipment as self-sanitizer. Examples include filter gaskets, conveyors, gloves, garments, and other personal hygiene equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{the optical}} flat {{and the surface}} to be tested need to be {{extremely}} clean. The tiniest bit of dust settling between the surfaces can ruin the results. Even the thickness of a streak or a fingerprint on the surfaces can be enough to change {{the width of the}} gap between them. Before the test, the surfaces are usually cleaned very thoroughly. Most commonly, acetone is used as the cleaning agent, because it dissolves most oils and it evaporates completely, leaving no residue. Typically, the surface will be cleaned using the [...] "drag" [...] method, in which a lint-free, scratch-free tissue is wetted, stretched, and dragged across the surface, pulling any impurities along with it. This process is usually performed dozens of times, ensuring that the surface is completely free of impurities. A new tissue will need to be used each time, to prevent <b>recontamination</b> of the surfaces from previously removed dust and oils.|$|E
50|$|Process speeds are {{generally}} not as fast as conventional dry abrasive blasting when using the equivalent size and type of media. However the presence of water between {{the media and the}} substrate being processed creates a lubricating cushion that can protect both the media and the surface from excess damage. This has the dual advantage of lowering media breakdown rates and preventing impregnation of foreign materials into the surface. Hence surfaces after wet blasting are extremely clean, there is no embedded secondary contamination from the media or from previous blasting processes, and there is no static cling of dust to the blasted surface. Subsequent coating or bonding operations are not effected by the use of wet blasting or dry blasting because of the cleanliness levels achieved are identical. However wet blasting of mild steel will result in immediate or 'flash' corrosion of the blasted steel substrate due to the presence of water. The lack of surface <b>recontamination</b> also allows the use of single equipment for multiple blasting operations—e.g., stainless steel and carbon (mild) steel items can be processed in the same equipment with the same media without problems.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the tests}} are {{apparently}} conducted at the water treatment plants, not at the tap. Old rusting pipes cause a metallic taste and unpleasant smell of tap water in the south part of the city. According to Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, drinking water is recontaminated in the old distribution network spanning 1,900 km. Some residential complexes also have their own wells and water distribution systems, which are not under {{the responsibility of the}} city's water bureau. Most Beijing residents do not drink water straight from the tap for fear of contamination. They often boil or filter water before drinking it, although boiling will not remove pesticides or heavy metals if they should be present in drinking water. Some filters discharge 3 units of water to the sewers to produce 1 unit of filtered water, thus increasing total water use, according to Zhao Feihong, deputy director of the Beijing Institute of Public Health and Drinking Water. In addition to <b>recontamination</b> in the network, the municipality has acknowledged that some of the wells that provide drinking water for municipal water supply have unspecified [...] "safety risks" [...] related to water quality, but it says they are being addressed through [...] "technical modifications".|$|E

A 2002 study showed {{more than half of}} the children living within a quarter mile of the smelter had high blood-lead levels. Doe Run agreed to buy 160 homes in the contaminated area around the smelter at a cost of more than $10 million.

5000|$|... ==Deaeration of feed water== Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide {{are removed}} from the feed water by deaeration. Deaeration can be {{accomplished}} by using deaerators heaters, vacuum deaerators, mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In deaerating heaters steam sprays incoming feed water and carries away the dissolved gases. The deaerators also store hot feed water which is ready {{to be used in the}} boiler. This means of mechanical deaeration is also used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p. 129) Deaerating heaters can be classified in to two groups. The two deaerating heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type deaerating heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the <b>recontamination</b> of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The non-condensables and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type deaerating heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct contact vent condenser, tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters. The oxygen and non-condensables are vented to the atmosphere.(Sendelbach, p. 130) ...|$|E

If so, why are source control efforts not able to prevent <b>recontamination?</b> To assess whether <b>recontamination</b> is likely to occur at the T- 117 site this thesis looks at what guidance and laws are available to help prevent <b>recontamination,</b> then reviews the T- 117 pollution source control plans and actual source control actions to assesses whether the guidance is being followed.

40|$|Food {{products}} {{that have been}} submitted to an adequate heat-treatment during processing are free of vegetative pathogens and, depending on the treatments, of sporeformers and are generally regarded as safe. Processed products such as pate, ice cream, infant formulae and others have nevertheless been responsible for food-borne illnesses. Thorough epidemiological investigations of several of these outbreaks have demonstrated {{that the presence of}} vegetative pathogens such as Salmonella spp. or Listeria monocytogenes in the consumed products was frequently due to post-process <b>recontamination.</b> The majority of studies on pathogens in foods are devoted to investigations on their presence in raw materials or on their growth and behaviour in the finished products. Reference to <b>recontamination</b> is, however, only made in relatively few publications and very little is published on the sources and routes of these pathogens into products after the final lethal processing step. The investigation of an outbreak, including epidemiological studies and typing of strains, is very useful to trace the origin and source of the hazard. Published data demonstrate that the presence of pathogens in the vicinity of unprotected product in processing lines represents a significant risk of <b>recontamination.</b> Microbiological Risk Assessment studies can be conducted as part of governmental activities determining appropriate protection levels for populations.

40|$|<b>Recontamination</b> of food {{products}} can cause foodborne illnesses or spoilage of foods. It is therefore useful to quantify this <b>recontamination</b> {{so that it}} can be incorporated in microbiological risk assessments (MRA). This paper describes a first attempt to quantify one of the <b>recontamination</b> routes: via the air. Data on the number of airborne microorganisms were collected from literature and industries. The settling velocities of different microorganisms were calculated for different products by combining the data on aerial concentrations with sedimentation counts assuming that settling is under the influence of gravity only. Air movement is not explicitly considered in this study. Statistical analyses were performed to clarify the effect of different products and seasons on the number of airborne microorganisms and the settling velocity. For both bacteria and moulds, three significantly different product categories with regard to the level of airborne organisms were identified. The statistical distribution in these categories was described by a lognormal distribution. The settling velocity did not depend on the product, the season of sampling or the type of microorganism, and had a geometrical mean value of 2. 7 mm/s. The statistical distribution of the settling velocity was described by a lognormal distribution as well. The probability of <b>recontamination</b> via the air was estimated by the product of the number of bacteria in the air, the settling velocity, and the exposed area and time of the product. For three example products, the contamination level as a result of airborne <b>recontamination</b> was estimated using Monte Carlo simulations.

40|$|The siphon filter is a {{household}} water filter {{developed by the}} Basic Water Needs Foundation based {{on the design of}} ceramic candle filters. The siphon filter is marketed under brand names CrystalPur and Tulip and is sold for roughly US$ 10. An independent Dutch laboratory found log reductions of 4. 4 - 5. 5 for the filter, and the filter features flow rates of roughly 3 - 5 liters per hour. This thesis evaluates the viability of the siphon filter for households in Northern Ghana, where water- borne diseases are a serious issue. With the help of Pure Home Water, a social enterprise that sells household water treatment and safe storage technologies in Northern Ghana, a field study was conducted in twenty-four (24) households in this region. The study consisted of household visits, water quality analysis and an Effective Use survey, which determined how properly the technology was used. Households drinking low and high turbidity source waters were studied, from a mix of middle and lower class households. A preparatory study was conducted at a MIT laboratory prior to the Ghana field study in order to be most effective during the field study. Initially, the field study was designed to avoid <b>recontamination</b> of siphon filtered water samples by taking filtered water samples directly from filter taps rather than sampling lower (post-filtration) container water. However, six (6) of forty-eight (48) filtered water samples showed higher levels of contamination than household stored water samples, indicating that <b>recontamination</b> occurred despite sampling directly from taps. (cont.) Two possible causes of <b>recontamination</b> included bacterial regrowth within the filter, and filter taps resting in dirty lower water containers or touched by dirty hands. <b>Recontamination</b> {{is believed to have been}} due to the latter cause, but further research is needed to confirm this conclusion. The average percent removal of total coliform was 90. 7 %, and the average positive percent removal for E. coli of 94. 1 % (these values do not include the five and three samples respectively showing negative percent removals for total coliform and E. coli). However, these values may have been affected by <b>recontamination</b> and true filter performance may have been more effective. A post-filtration safe storage container design is recommended for the siphon filter to maintain the microbial quality of filtered water, and additional testing of the siphon filter with a safe storage container is advised. The distinction between middle and lower class households was not found to influence how effectively the filter was operated. Use of high turbidity water was found to affect filter performance in households: the filter clogged frequently with high turbidity water, partially because study participants did not consistently maintain the filter. Filter maintenance is less crucial for households drinking low turbidity water, and the filter clogged infrequently for these households, even with little maintenance. Alternative household water treatment technologies are compared to the siphon filter for use in households drinking low and high turbidity source waters in Northern Ghana. These technologies include chlorine, alum (coagulation), and the Kosim ceramic pot filter. (cont.) If the siphon filter <b>recontamination</b> issue were resolved, the siphon filter would be recommended for households drinking low turbidity water in Northern Ghana over the other treatment options considered. The siphon filter is recommended over chlorine for low turbidity water because chlorine is consumable and requires a substantial wait for treated water, while the siphon filter is more permanent and requires little wait for treated water. Alum plus chlorine treatment is recommended for most households drinking turbid water, with the siphon filter as an alternative treatment method for households desiring a more permanent treatment technology, again if the siphon filter <b>recontamination</b> issue were resolved. The siphon filter is preferred over the Kosim filter because while the Kosim filter can only be cleaned by scrubbing and features a slow flow rate, the siphon filter can be kept clean by other methods (e. g. backwashing) before scrubbing is needed, and has a considerably faster flow rate.
