2500|$|The 1948 Citroen 2CV was {{launched}} in France with a manual headlamp leveling system, controlled by the driver with a knob through a mechanical <b>rod</b> <b>linkage.</b> This allowed the driver to adjust the vertical aim of the headlamps {{to compensate for the}} passenger and cargo load in the vehicle. In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle's suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of vehicle load, without driver intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps' aim by means of a dashboard control lever or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps' aim angle and create glare. Such systems typically use stepper motors at the headlamp and a rotary switch on the dash marked [...] "0", [...] "1", [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] for different beam heights, [...] "0" [...] being the [...] "normal" [...] (and highest) position for when the car is lightly loaded.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "steam dummy" [...] {{locomotive}} {{filled up}} with water at Glasgow Junction before it made the 9 mi journey pulling the coach up the Chester Escarpment, gaining 200 ft in elevation about every mile. The two component train on the spur went {{through a series of}} hills and valleys. It would wind its way over a trestle at Doyle Valley and eventually come to Mammoth Cave hotel and estate. The train carried at least a three-man crew that consisted of a train engineer to run the locomotive, a boiler man to stoke the engine, and a conductor to tend to the passengers. Many times there were up to seven employees to operate the railroad train. On rare occasions the train pulled additional cars besides the passenger coach. Most famous of the steam engine locomotives was number 4, which was called Hercules.The reason the small steam Baldwin locomotive was called a [...] "dummy" [...] was because it was boxed up to look like a passenger street car. The idea was to prevent the horses from being spooked when it came close to them. Most times horses are very sensitive to mechanical machines and loud noises. Its condensing engines operated without the noise of escaping steam. It covered the mechanics of the <b>rods,</b> <b>linkage,</b> pipes, bolts, rivets, and most of the moving parts.|$|R
50|$|The Vienna valve {{was invented}} in Leipzig in 1821 by Sattler, predating the Perinet valve and rotary valve used in France and Germany (and in all French horns). The Vienna Valves (or Double Valves) have two short {{parallel}} pistons connected at the bottom by a bar that is moved by a long <b>rod</b> or <b>linkage</b> connected to the spring-loaded finger plate. The Vienna system was in common use in Germany {{on all kinds of}} instruments including trumpets up to 1850.

5000|$|Underneath the Maxi's {{practical}} and spacious bodyshell lay an all-new {{front wheel drive}} chassis, which was interlinked with an innovative five-speed manual transmission. The latter suffered from notorious problems with its control linkage, especially in early models which had a cable-operated linkage prone to cable stretch and other problems. These were noted by autotesters such as Vicar in Today's Driver (1969), who wrote: [...] "This is probably a good idea that just needs {{a little bit of}} working on." [...] The later <b>rod</b> <b>linkage</b> was less problematic.

50|$|The basic aim of {{steering}} is {{to ensure}} that the wheels are pointing in the desired directions. This is typically achieved by a series of <b>linkages,</b> <b>rods,</b> pivots and gears.

5000|$|The Shelby Charger is a {{modified}} 1980s Dodge Charger. Carroll Shelby tuned the Dodge Omni-based Charger for Dodge from 1983 to 1987, with the resulting car sold as the Dodge Shelby Charger. When the Charger was discontinued, Shelby bought the last 1,000 and replaced the fuel intake and {{engine management system}} with the same high-performance one used in the 1986 Shelby GLHS. It has a blow-through long runner two-piece intake, modified turbocharger (reclocked with a different compressor cover), and is intercooled. This engine was rated at [...] and 175 ftlbf Nm of torque from 2400 rpm to 4800 rpm. This {{is similar to the}} Turbo II inline-four engine used in various Chrysler vehicles, but the Turbo II uses a forged crank, as opposed to a cast one, and a stronger Getrag A555 five-speed manual transmission is used in place of the A525. The GLHS still came equipped with the <b>rod</b> <b>linkage</b> a525 transmission, however. Shelby also changed the struts and shocks with Koni adjustable units, wheels from his own wheel company (Centurion 2s), and high performance Goodyear Eagle GT tires. His modifications prompted the federal government to declare the car a Shelby model. A Dodge badge appears nowhere on the car, unlike its five-door L-body sibling, the GLH Omni, which does have the Dodge nameplate. Shelby Chargers were built at Chrysler's Belvidere, Illinois, assembly plant, with the GLHS models in 1987 being built at the Whittier, California, plant of Carroll Shelby.|$|E
5000|$|The Hillman 16 had a 2110 cc 15.90 hp {{side valve}} straight-six engine whilst the {{matching}} 20/70 had larger 2810 cc 20.9 hp engines.

All these vehicles had Bendix [...] "Duo Servo" [...] brakes, which used <b>rod</b> and cable <b>linkages</b> and operated on all four wheels via both the foot pedal and the handbrake lever.|$|R
50|$|No {{damage was}} done to the track or signalling, but No. 73096 blocked the line for some time. Shuttle {{services}} were quickly organised between Alresford and Ropley and between Alton and Medstead, until the line could be cleared. Parts of the steam locomotive's 'motion' (connecting <b>rod,</b> valve gear <b>linkages</b> etc.) on the driver's side {{had to be removed}} by MPD staff to allow the locomotive to be moved. As the 5MT was unable to move under its own power, a diesel locomotive was dispatched from Ropley engine shed to retrieve it. The Gala thereafter continued with a revised timetable.|$|R
30|$|Since the dual-horsehead {{pumping units}} {{were used in}} 1996, its {{application}} results indicated that its energy-saving rate was about 20 – 30 % (Wang 2006; Chi et al. 2011). The dual-horsehead pump units were reformed with a flexibility reconfiguration, based on the conventional beam pumping units. Its back arm of walking beam was connected a horsehead having a variable radius of curvature. The walking beam connected the <b>linkage</b> <b>rod</b> with flexible drive rope. This variable length four-bar linkage could decrease the torque factor that could decrease the polished torque and avoided the negative torque, and the motor efficiency would be improved (Liu and Feng 2014).|$|R
50|$|If {{coil springs}} are used, then a lateral {{location}} link (usually either a Panhard <b>rod</b> or Watt's <b>linkage)</b> is required, plus additional torque links {{on each side}} (five link suspension) {{or a combination of}} lower trailing links and an upper transverse wishbone. None of these additional links are required if leaf springs are used, but ride can be compromised due to the leaves having to do double duty as both locating links and springs. The torque links are not required if the setup uses inboard brakes, like in the Pegaso 1502, Rover P6, all Iso cars and Alfa Romeo type 116 (and derivatives), as the wheels do not transmit torque to the suspension.|$|R
50|$|For {{vehicles}} with {{leaf spring suspension}} such as pickup trucks, the leaf spring is sometimes eliminated and replaced with a multiple-bar linkage. These bars are typically in a trailing arm configuration and the air spring may be situated vertically between a link bar or the axle housing and a point on the vehicle's frame. In other cases, the air bag is situated {{on the opposite side}} of the axle from the main link bars on an additional cantilever member. If the main linkage bars are oriented parallel to the longitudinal (driving) axis of the car, the axle housing may be constrained laterally with either a Panhard <b>rod</b> or Watt's <b>linkage.</b> In some cases, two of the link bars may be combined into a triangular shape which effectively constrains the vehicles axle laterally.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{conventional}} steam locomotive, the crankshaft {{is one of}} the driving axles. In a jackshaft-driven steam locomotive, the crankshaft turns a jackshaft which, in turn, turns the driver. Some steam locomotives have had designs intermediate between these extremes, with crankshafts distinct from the driving axle. Phineas Davis's first B&O Grasshopper tested on the B&O in 1831 was in this class, as was the Stockton and Darlington Railway's Swift from 1836, where the crankshaft was directly between the driving axles. [...] Both of these examples used vertical cylinders, with the crankshaft in the plane of the driving axles. The former used a geared drive to the first driving axle, the latter used side <b>rods</b> for this <b>linkage.</b> In the latter case, the reason inferred for using a crankshaft distinct from the driven axles was [...] "to take the shocks of working away from the power shaft." ...|$|R
2500|$|Each piston transmits power {{directly}} through a connecting rod (Main rod in the US) and a crankpin (Wristpin in the US) on the driving wheel (Main {{driver in the}} US) or to a crank on a driving axle. The movement of the valves in the steam chest is controlled {{through a set of}} <b>rods</b> and <b>linkages</b> called the valve gear, actuated from the driving axle or from the crankpin; the valve gear includes devices that allow reversing the engine, adjusting valve travel and the timing of the admission and exhaust events. The cut-off point determines the moment when the valve blocks a steam port, [...] "cutting off" [...] admission steam and thus determining the proportion of the stroke during which steam is admitted into the cylinder; for example a 50% cut-off admits steam for half the stroke of the piston. The remainder of the stroke is driven by the expansive force of the steam. Careful use of cut-off provides economical use of steam and in turn reduces fuel and water consumption. The reversing lever (Johnson bar in the US), or screw-reverser (if so equipped), that controls the cut-off therefore performs a similar function to a gearshift in an automobile – maximum cut-off, providing maximum tractive effort at the expense of efficiency, is used to pull away from a standing start, whilst a cut-off as low as 10% is used when cruising, providing reduced tractive effort, and therefore lower fuel/water consumption.|$|R
40|$|Describes a {{steering}} system in an all-terrain four-wheeled vehicle with independent suspension where the necessary forces for wheels to respond to steering control is supplied by fluid pressure or electrical actuators mounted parallel to the suspension arm between vehicle frame and wheel control arm. Steering control by the driver is by manipulation of right and/or left steering levers eliminating the need of steering wheel and steering column {{in front of the}} driver. The steering actuators are independent and there is no tracking <b>rod</b> or other <b>linkage</b> for coordinating their turning angles. Close coordination of the wheel turning angles for achieving the Ackerman angle relation or other non-linear turning angle relation between the wheels is by a now-linear linkage between left and right steering levers or elsewhere or by a computer control for electric actuators. Optionally, a computer control in an electrical system has inputs for acceleration and velocity for detecting hazards associated with steering and inputs to provide artificial feel signals to the hand levers...|$|R
5000|$|After short runs during January 1930, {{a longer}} test run from Glasgow to Carstairs was {{scheduled}} for 10 February 1930. Approaching Carstairs station at slow speed, one of the ultra-high-pressure tubes burst and the escaping steam ejected the coal fire through the fire-hole door, killing Mr Lewis Schofield of the Superheater Company. Subsequently the burst tube was thoroughly investigated at Sheffield University but no definitive conclusion reached. The boiler was eventually repaired and Fury moved to Derby where a number of running trials were carried out until early 1934, mostly revealing significant shortcomings in performance. Fury's <b>rods</b> and <b>linkages</b> were then removed together with the indicator shelter and test gear when in 1935 it was rebuilt by William Stanier at Crewe Works with a more conventional type 2 boiler becoming 6170 British Legion, {{the first of the}} LMS 2 and 2A boilered 4-6-0 locomotives.Despite the accident, Fury was primarily an economic rather than a technological failure. Although tolerating the trials from Derby, Stanier didn't devote much effort to rectifying the faults Fury displayed, no doubt because of his many other work pressures and development of the LMS Turbomotive. Nevertheless, Fury never earned revenue for the LMS and in fact [...] "Fury must have travelled more miles under tow than under its own steam". As many other experimental locomotives showed, the theoretical benefits of ultra high steam pressure steam were hard to realise in practice. Fuel is only one part of the operating costs of a steam locomotive - maintenance is very significant, and introducing extra complications always increased this disproportionally.|$|R
40|$|The {{selectivity}} of Ca 2 + over Na+ is ∼ 3. 3 -fold {{larger in}} cGMP-gated channels of cone photoreceptors {{than in those}} of rods when measured under saturating cGMP concentrations, where the probability of channel opening is 85 – 90 %. Under physiological conditions, however, the probability of opening of the cGMP-gated channels ranges from its largest value in darkness of 1 – 5 % to essentially zero under continuous, bright illumination. We investigated the ion selectivity of cGMP-gated channels {{as a function of}} cyclic nucleotide concentration in membrane patches detached from the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptors and have found that ion selectivity is linked to gating. We determined ion selectivity relative to Na+ (PX/PNa) from the value of reversal potentials measured under ion concentration gradients. The selectivity for Ca 2 + over Na+ increases continuously as the probability of channel opening rises. The dependence of PCa/PNa on cGMP concentration, in both rods and cones, is well described by the same Hill function that describes the cGMP dependence of current amplitude. At the cytoplasmic cGMP concentrations expected in dark-adapted intact photoreceptors, PCa/PNa in cone channels is ∼ 7. 4 -fold greater than that in <b>rods.</b> The <b>linkage</b> between selectivity and gating is specific for divalent cations. The selectivity of Ca 2 + and Sr 2 + changes with cGMP concentration, but the selectivity of inorganic monovalent cations, Cs+ and NH 4 +, and organic cations, methylammonium+ and dimethylammonium+, is invariant with cGMP. Cyclic nucleotide–gated channels in rod photoreceptors are heteromeric assemblies of α and β subunits. The maximal PCa/PNa of channels formed from α subunits of bovine rod channels is less than that of heteromeric channels formed from α and β subunits. In addition, Ca 2 + is a more effective blocker of channels formed by α subunits than of channels formed by α and β subunits. The cGMP-dependent shift in divalent cation selectivity is a property of αβ channels and not of channels formed from α subunits alone...|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from its}} ability to alter its camber, each low-mounted wing of the AL5 was {{externally}} unremarkable, with a rectangular plan out to broadly rounded tips. There were two spars, rigidly and conventionally joined together. The plywood covered {{leading and trailing edges}} were each rigid structures but they were hinged on duralumin tubes which ran through the lower parts of the forward and rear spars respectively. Their angular positions were controlled together via <b>rod</b> and lever <b>linkages</b> and determined the profile of the surfaces between the spars. As the edges were rotated downwards, the underside surface bent upwards; spacers kept the local thickness constant so the upper surface curvature also increased, as did the overall camber. As a result, the upper side surface path between the spars increased, so extra skin was allowed to slide out from under the upper side of the trailing edge. There were three wing settings, one for take-off, one for speed and a third for landing. [...] Lachassagne estimated that the camber-changing features added about 15% to the weight of the wing. Broad chord ailerons occupied about 40% of the span. Each wing was wire braced with two pairs of long Vs from the spars at about mid-span, one to the upper fuselage and the other to the landing gear.|$|R
50|$|For the Rekord B the {{manufacturer}} {{introduced a new}} generation of four cylinder engines to replace the robust but by now technically outdated engine first seen in the 1937 Opel Olympia. Several manufacturers replaced pre-war side-valve engines with new overhead camshaft engines during this decade, and the new Opel also carried its camshaft directly above the cylinders. This did away with the old <b>rods</b> and rocker <b>linkage</b> that had been a feature of the old engines. However, instead of operating directly on the cylinder valves, the camshaft still operated the valves using rocker arms because the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves. One reason for this may have been cosmetic. Other automakers such as BMW with their 1500 launched in 1962 and Volkswagen with their NSU designed K70 (which finally made it to the showrooms in 1970) squeezed vital centimeters off the height of the engine unit by canting it over at an eccentric angle in the engine bay. Opel's so-called Camshaft in Head (CIH) engine configuration similarly enabled a succession of Opels to feature the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments favoured. The camshaft on the new Opel engine was chain driven, which also represented a change from the 1930s design philosophy implicit in the directly cogwheel driven camshaft included in earlier generations of Opel Rekord.|$|R
40|$|Gelation {{due to the}} Maillard {{reaction}} {{took place}} when solutions containing {{a low level of}} bovine serum albumin were heated in the presence of carbonyl compounds. The Maillard reaction caused a change in colour, a decrease in the pH and induced gelation. These changes were dependent on the type and concentration of sugars or protein and on the heating conditions used. Reducing sugar and Maillard reaction products (e. g. glyoxal) affected these changes, yet their order of reactivity for browning and gelation were not necessarily the same. Loss of available lysine and arginine plus changes in the thio amino acids showed that these were implicated in the reaction. The gelation kinetics (gelation time and development of storage modulus) were followed in real time using a Bohlin CS Rheometer at a temperature of 90 °C. These studies showed that the gels did not form at a specific pH, the pH being lower for samples where the more reactive carbonyl compounds were used. Measurement of the charge on the protein after the Maillard reaction showed an increased negative charge, hence causing a lowering in the protein's isoelectric point. This had the effect of changing the critical protein concentration necessary for gelation at any pH above the isoelectric point. This reasoning would also explain the low syneresis seen in the Maillard gels. Hydrodynamic studies on dilute solution showed that the protein molecules heated in the presence of xylose associated in an orderly manner despite having a low pH. The aggregates could be described as "stiff and <b>rod</b> like". The <b>linkages</b> holding *the aggregates together were mostly attributed to additional non-disulfide linkages resulting from the Maillard reaction. Similar types of crosslinks were formed in the Maillard gels heated at 90 °C and were thought to have enhanced the gel strength. Extrusion of soya grits with reducing sugars did not form a retort-stable product. However, microwave heating of the extruded product was successful in producing a product that survived a typical canning process. This suggests that formation of crosslinks may be controlled to produce novel food products...|$|R
