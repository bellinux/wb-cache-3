5|$|After {{the deal}} closed in May 2006, Lasseter {{revealed}} that Iger had realized Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade {{at the opening}} of Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005. Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade, not one was a character that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar. Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information {{to the board of directors}} at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar. Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth-generation iPod Classic), and in turn, Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his epiphany that Disney <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> re-focus on animation.|$|E

Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein questioned in April 2004 if such a large hotel, questionably financed by the city, was <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> make the convention center profitable.

25|$|Freddie worries over Effy's {{psychological}} {{state in}} his centric episode, {{as she is}} developing a psychotic depression that resembles what his mother had before she committed suicide. He is able to save Effy after an attempt on her life; she is hospitalised and he is left desolate. JJ's episode sees him {{fall in love with}} a single mother called Lara (Georgia Henshaw), through whom he finds a new-found confidence and begins to doubt whether he <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be so highly medicated his whole life. In the penultimate episode, Effy's psychiatric counsellor Dr John Foster (Hugo Speer) uses unorthodox hypnotic methods to cure Effy's depression, making her forget and want to abandon her old friends. After an incident at the spot of Tony's accident where she nearly commits suicide again, her psychosis comes back and Freddie insists Dr Foster cease treating Effy. Later, Foster lures Freddie to discuss Effy, and brutally murders Freddie with a baseball bat. In the finale episode, everyone deals with Freddie's absence, thinking that he has left of his own volition. Naomi and Emily finally repair their damaged relationship, scorched by cheating, and Naomi confesses she loved Emily since they first met; Thomas and Pandora are thrown back together by chance when they both get into Harvard College; a mostly-recovered Effy holds Freddie's birthday party in his shed, knowing that he loved her and pining for his return. Cook, who is on the run from the police after breaking out of prison, uncovers Dr Foster's killing and after confronting him, furiously lunges at Foster. The series ends here in freeze-frame leaving both Cook's and John Foster's fates unknown.|$|E

500|$|During {{her time}} as a model, Larter moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. In 2002, she moved to New York {{for a period of}} three years.

[...] In 2007, he returned as a novelist to California, where some of his earlier fiction had been set, with You Don't Love Me Yet, a novel about an upstart rock band. The novel revolves around a woman in the band, Lucinda, who answers phones for her friend's complaint line and uses some of a caller's words as lyrics. [...] According to Lethem, the book was inspired by the years he spent as the lead singer in an upstart California band in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during what he called [...] "the unformed posturing phase of life". [...] The novel received mixed reviews.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{inserted}} {{a reference to}} the villain Eugene Victor Tooms from the first season episodes [...] "Squeeze" [...] and [...] "Tooms" [...] in a conversation between Ryan and Mulder. The episode represents one of the first entries in the series to be written by someone from outside the main writing staff of The X-Files. Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow {{to be able to move}} independently; Carter and writer Howard Gordon rewrote the story to remove this aspect. Gilligan later noted, [...] "they rewrote the episode [...] this saved an enormous amount of money in animation costs." [...] In addition, the [...] character of X was not in the first draft of the script. However, the series staff realized that Banton's fear of having the government control him should be [...] "more than just paranoia". Thus, X was written into the story. Writer Frank Spotnitz later noted, [...] "it had been a long time since X had done anything and the character <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> grow." ...|$|E

But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 2006, {{after six}} years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she {{did not need to}} commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had {{recently}} appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, [...] "HSN <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products".

Several of the scenes shot in Budapest, including a large-scale battle with the zombies in Moscow's Red Square, were dropped from the final cut in order to water down the film's political undertones, and steer it towards a more generally friendly summer blockbuster. The climactic battle scene in Russia, for which there was [...] of footage, had Pitt's character fighting through zombies more like [...] "a warrior hero" [...] than [...] "the sympathetic family man" [...] of the earlier acts.

2500|$|The first {{unambiguous}} {{consequence of}} the existence of stardust within meteorites came from the laboratory of Edward Anders in Chicago, who found using traditional mass spectrometry that the xenon isotopic abundances contained within an acid-insoluble carbonaceous residue that remained after the meteorite bulk had been dissolved in acids matched almost exactly the predictions for isotopic xenon in red giant stardust. It then seemed certain that stardust grains were contained within Anders' acid-insoluble residue. Finding the actual stardust grains and documenting them was a much harder challenge that required locating the grains and showing that their isotopes matched those within the red-giant star. [...] There followed a decade of intense experimental searching in the attempt to isolate individual grains of those xenon carriers. But what was <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> discover stardust was a new type of mass spectrometer that could measure the smaller number of atoms in a single grain. Sputtering ion probes were pursued by several laboratories in the attempt to demonstrate such an instrument. But the contemporary ion probes needed to be technologically much better.|$|E
2500|$|Aguinaldo had {{presented}} surrender terms to Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines Basilio Augustín, who refused them.

On 16 June, warships departed Spain to lift the siege, but they altered course for Cuba where a Spanish fleet was imperiled by the U.S. Navy. Life in Intramuros (the walled center of Manila), where the normal population of about ten thousand had swelled to about seventy thousand, had become unbearable. Realizing {{that it was only}} a matter of time before the city fell, and fearing vengeance and looting if the city fell to Filipino revolutionaries, Governor Augustín suggested to Dewey that the city be surrendered to the Americans after a short, [...] "mock" [...] battle. Dewey had initially rejected the suggestion because he lacked the troops to block Filipino revolutionary forces, but when Merritt's troops became available he sent a message to Fermin Jáudenes, Augustín's replacement, agreeing to the mock battle. Spain had learned of Augustín's intentions to surrender Manila to the Americans, which had been the reason he had been replaced by Jaudenes.|$|E
