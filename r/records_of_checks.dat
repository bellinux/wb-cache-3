DOD has also been unable to resolve discrepancies between its and Treasury's <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> issued by DOD. Because documentation that would allow for resolution of these payment recording problems could not be found after so many years, DOD requested and received legislative authority to write off certain aged suspense transactions and check payment differences. The conference report (H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 107 - 772) that accompanied the legislation (Pub. L. No. 107 - 314) required GAO to review and report on DOD's use of this write-off authority. ...|$|E

50|$|Although {{these systems}} can alert a driver to a {{hazardous}} blowout condition, {{they may not}} help fleets deal with slow-leaking tires, unless the driver reports them to fleet-maintenance personnel {{before it is too}} late. This has given rise in recent years to monitoring solutions that track the tire condition and send alerts to fleet-maintenance personnel. This allows them to schedule maintenance on a slow-leaking tire on an exception basis, instead <b>of</b> having to <b>check</b> each tire manually. Many fleets today admit that tire-pressure checking is a major problem in enforcement. Most have policies in place requiring the regular <b>check</b> <b>of</b> every tire, however, the practice is not terribly effective because of the sheer scope of the issue, {{and the fact that it}} is hard to get a complete <b>record</b> <b>of</b> all tire <b>checking.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background. Protecting {{public funds}} {{is a high}} {{priority}} for all governments. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) regulates and defines the responsibilities of counterparties in business and banking transactions. The code states that liability and monetary loss in a fraudulent transaction is split between the counterparties in a transaction based on each party’s due diligence and negligence. Consequently, to reduce liability {{in the event of a}} fraudulent transaction, it is important to have proper controls in place. Advances in technology have reduced the effectiveness of traditional fraud prevention techniques and have even enabled new forms of fraud. For example, in the past, many governments relied upon physical security features embedded in check stock to prevent check fraud. These included watermarks, unique colors, and graphical designs. Advanced duplication technology and remote deposit capture have reduced the effectiveness of these physical measures to prevent fraud. The banking industry has developed the following fraud prevention tools: Positive pay is a type of account reconciliation service provided by banks. In positive pay, a bank compares checks that it receives for payment against the <b>record</b> <b>of</b> the <b>checks</b> issued by the government. If the bank receives a check that does not match the information (date, check number, and amount) in the government’s record, it identifies it as an exception item (i. e., a non-conforming positive pay item) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: A recent {{case-control study}} {{reported}} {{an association between}} non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use and acute appendicitis. This association was investigated in a case-control study of patients, aged 30 years and over, admitted as an emergency to hospitals in Tayside between 1989 and 1992, who had appendicectomy for acute appendicitis. Methods: A record-linkage database containing <b>records</b> <b>of</b> dispensed prescriptions and hospital admissions was used. A total of 223 patients were identified. The medical <b>records</b> <b>of</b> 161 were <b>checked,</b> <b>of</b> which 138 were valid cases, and information on white cell count and NSAID exposure was recorded. Community and hospital controls were generated. Results: Some 9. 0 per cent of patients were prescribed NSAIDs within 90 days of hospitalization, compared with 7. 6 per cent of community controls and 11. 5 per cent of hospital controls. The odds ratio was 1. 21 (95 per cent confidence interval 0. 73 - 2. 01) and 0. 75 (0. 43 - 1. 32) respectively. There {{was no significant difference}} in white cell count between exposed and non-exposed cases. No increased risk of appendicectomy was associated with aspirin use: odds ratio 1. 67 (052 - 5. 30) and 0. 37 (0. 1 2 - 1. 13) using community and hospital controls respectively. Conclusion: Appendicectomy for acute appendicitis is not associated with increased prior use of NSAIDs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Embedded {{systems with}} digital signal {{processor}} (DSP) {{become more and more}} popular for the increasing requirement of supercomputing these days. Efficient development of DSP serials used in embedded systems shortens the embedded system R&D cycle. Functional verification {{is one of the most}} complex and expensive tasks during DSP serials design process. A random test platform which is urged for DSP serials verification is proposed in this paper. The platform can automatically generate the random test program. The platform also realized the <b>recording</b> and <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> simulation results, which make the verification more effective. In order to improve the efficiency of DSP verification, a testing experience library has been generated through the testing procedure. This platform can be transplanted for different DSP models easily by updating few modules. According to the verification results, this platform has satisfactory coverage of DSP models...|$|R

That is why the proponents proposed the topic entitled “SMART SYSTEM for BatStateU ARASOF - NASUGBU ROTC”. The researchers used the prototyping technique to develop the step by step process of the system. The researchers also used the Visual Studio 2008 as the developing tool and MySQL server as the database. This system include database of all information that is required in order to perform the function of the system. The user can print reports of grades and official list of the enrolled students and officers. Complete with full backup and restore feature, the system was also proven to be a helpful source of information. This can help future researchers especially the third year students who may opt to upgrade this proposed system. The documentation produced and the software developed by the researchers and can be used as guidelines or references for future researchers. After thorough analysis, evaluation and testing, this study was found to be a big help to the BatStateU ARASOF – Nasugbu ROTC in terms of convenience, accuracy, security and speed in retrieving of information of any student and officers that is registered in the system.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the market for}} checks using the monopoly problem as an approximation. The need for such an analysis arises due to the following policy proposal : the Turkish government considers increasing the lump-sum amount that drawee banks are legally responsible to pay per bad check.

We report that a percentage increase in banks' obligation per bad check could lead up to a 1. 7 % decline in the total supply <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> on the margin. We establish that the extent of the monopoly distortion depends on three main factors : (i) the elasticity <b>of</b> demand for <b>checks,</b> (ii) how fast the fraction <b>of</b> bad <b>checks</b> increase with the total supply <b>of</b> <b>checks,</b> and (iii) the degree <b>of</b> preference heterogeneity. <b>Checks,</b> regulation, monopoly power, preference heterogeneity. ...|$|R
