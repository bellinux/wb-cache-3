5000|$|In aviation, {{instrument}} pilots use <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> aids. To {{ensure that}} the stations the pilots are using are serviceable, the stations all transmit a short set of identification letters (usually a two-to-five-letter version of the station name) in Morse code. Station identification letters are shown on air <b>navigation</b> <b>charts.</b> For example, the VOR based at Manchester Airport in England is abbreviated as [...] "MCT", and MCT in Morse code is transmitted on its radio frequency. In some countries, during periods of maintenance, the facility may radiate a T-E-S-T code (...) or the code may be removed which tells pilots and navigators that the station is unreliable. In Canada, the identification is removed entirely to signify the navigation aid {{is not to be}} used. [...] In the aviation service, Morse is typically sent at a very slow speed of about 5 words per minute. In the U.S., pilots do not actually have to know Morse to identify the transmitter because the dot/dash sequence is written out next to the transmitter's symbol on aeronautical <b>charts.</b> Some modern <b>navigation</b> receivers automatically translate the code into displayed letters.|$|R
