CW and pulsed modes at 1470 nm were initially compared as a function of power on bovine liver tissue. In the pulsed mode, various parameters including repetition <b>rate,</b> <b>duty</b> cycle, and irradiation time were compared to evaluate tissue response during thermal treatment. The results demonstrated that CW and pulsed modes yielded almost similar coagulation development possibly due to shorter irradiation time of 5 sec.

50|$|Inverted tariff {{benefits}} exist {{when the}} <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> {{for the overall}} finished good {{is lower than the}} <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> of the component parts. Therefore, by manufacturing finished goods within an FTZ, US importers {{can take advantage of the}} inverted tariff <b>duty</b> <b>rate,</b> all while keeping manufacturing operations within the US. Inverted tariff works when an importer with manufacturing authority within an FTZ is allowed to admit their components into the zone duty-free, manufacture the finished good, and pay CBP duties on the foreign content in the finished good at the lower <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> of the finished goods at the time of entry. The importer avoids paying the higher <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> on the component parts and defers the lower duty payment on the value of the foreign content until the time of consumption in the commerce of the US. Inverted tariff is seen predominantly in the manufacturing industry, benefiting automotive, petroleum, pharmaceutical, aerospace, electronics, textile companies and many more.|$|R

40|$|Different motives in {{determining}} the level and structure of alcohol taxes lead to greatly varying alcohol excise duty levels. The aim {{of this paper is}} to look at alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> in European Union (EU) and the mechanisms affecting them. Also the trends in alcohol prices and alcohol consumption will be discussed. Material. Material concerning alcohol taxes and consumption comes from available statistics and published literature. Results. This paper shows that despite many attempts the EU has not been able to harmonise alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> in its member states. The importance of alcohol taxes as an alcohol control measure has decreased as the real value of alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> has decreased in most EU countries during the last decades. Discussion. In most European countries the share of alcohol taxes of the price of alcoholic beverages is quite low. Therefore, increasing alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> would in most countries lead to increased alcohol tax revenues to the public sector. Consequently, increasing alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> would serve both the fiscal and the health and social policy interests of the state...|$|R

40|$|A central {{feature of}} the {{constitutional}} changes imposed {{at the time of}} Federation in 1901 was the “fiscal union ” of the six States. This union involved the abolition of tariffs on trade between the States, the harmonisation of the tariff rates and of the excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> of the former six Colonies, and the establishment of the financial arrangements to distribute the surplus net customs and excise revenues among the States. This paper examines these four elements of the fiscal union. It provides, for the first time, a measure of the change in the level of tariff duties imposed on imports from outside the Commonwealth and in excise duties. The harmonisation of the customs <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> increased the average <b>rate</b> of customs <b>duty</b> on dutiable imports from outside the Commonwealth by about 36 per cent while the harmonisation of the excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> maintained the rates at about the mid-point of these rates in the colonies. The four aspects of fiscal union are intimately connected and together they laid the foundations of assistance policy, commodity taxation and Commonwealth-Stat...|$|R

40|$|The {{constitutional}} changes {{imposed on}} the States {{at the time of}} Federation in Australia required the harmonisation of the excise tax rates of the former colonies as well as the harmonisation of <b>rates</b> of tariff <b>duty.</b> Each Colony had its own excise rate system. Excise rates were a major source of revenue for the Colonies and for the Commonwealth but the harmonisation of the excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> has not been studied. This paper outlines the excise tax systems of the Colonies before Federation and that of the Commonwealth after Federation. Estimates are made of the consumer tax equivalent rates and of the rates of protection which were implicit in the excise cum tariff systems in each Colony before Federation and in the Commonwealth after Federation. I find that the Commonwealth government harmonised the excise tax rates of the colonies at about the mid-points of the rates of the Colonies. The implicit rates of protection, however, increased after Federation because the higher customs <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> were combined with the constant excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates.</b> The paper also traces how the Commonwealth excise tax system evolved from the colonial systems of excise taxation...|$|R
