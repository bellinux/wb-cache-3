40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this}} {{population-based}} {{study was}} to investigate associations between <b>recreational</b> <b>values</b> of the close natural environment and neighbourhood satisfaction, physical activity, obesity and wellbeing. METHODS: Data from a large public health survey distributed as a mailed questionnaire in suburban and rural areas of southern Sweden were used (N = 24, 819; 59 % participation rate). Geocoded residential addresses and the geographical information system technique were used to assess objectively five <b>recreational</b> <b>values</b> of the close natural environment: serene, wild, lush, spacious and culture. RESULTS: On average, a citizen of the Scania region, inner city areas excluded, only had access to 0. 67 <b>recreational</b> <b>values</b> within 300 metres distance from their residence. The number of <b>recreational</b> <b>values</b> near the residence was strongly associated with neighbourhood satisfaction and physical activity. The effect on satisfaction was especially marked among tenants and the presence of <b>recreational</b> <b>values</b> was associated with low or normal body mass index in this group. A less marked positive association with vitality among women was observed. No evident effect on self-rated health was detectable. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate access to natural environments with high <b>recreational</b> <b>values</b> was rare in the study population and was distributed in an inequitable manner. Moreover, such access was associated with a positive assessment of neighbourhood satisfaction and time spent on physical activity, which can be expected to reduce obesity and increase vitality by having a buffering effect on stress...|$|R

5|$|Elevation rise {{across the}} park results from land uplift along the Burnside-Eden fault zone. This zone {{is a major}} land fault {{separating}} the Adelaide Plains from the Mount Lofty Ranges and runs north-north-east across the park from its southwest corner. The park is underlain by neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Burra Group overlying a Precambrian crystalline basement. Sediments were formed approximately 700million years ago (mya) from sand washed into a shallow sea. Sand layers were then folded and slightly metamorphosed during the delamerian orogeny, a period of mountain building caused by tectonic plate movements and resulting east–west compression of Australia. This pushed up a mountain range, {{on the site of}} the present Mount Lofty Ranges, approximately 450mya. The range was eroded to a level plain over the following 350million years. Approximately 40mya, the location of today's ranges and plains were flat, with a hard sedimentary capping. About 2mya, block faulting raised the Mount Lofty Ranges, and much of the former land surface west of the ranges eroded away. The Gun Emplacement is a small remnant of this pre-erosion surface. It is a raised semi-circular flat area and has views over much of Adelaide from the southwestern corner of the park. The Emplacement is seen as an important regolith deposit, particularly for its role in understanding Adelaide's landscape's evolution. The Emplacement was declared a Geological Monument in 1978 for this geologic importance as well as its aesthetic and <b>recreational</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

25|$|Surface and {{groundwater}} in the Barada basin is polluted by industrial and domestic wastewater, {{as well as}} by agricultural non-point sources such as fertilizers and pesticides. Much of the wastewater generated from industrial activities in Greater Damascus is discharged into the environment, mainly to the Barada River, without prior treatment. The uncontrolled disposal of toxic, chemical products, primarily from lead industries and battery manufactories, has also resulted in severe soil pollution. There is no pre-treatment of industrial wastewater discharged into the sewer network. As a result, the largest wastewater treatment plant of Damascus in Adra frequently malfunctions. Measured concentrations of biological oxygen demand (BOD), a measure of organic water pollution, exceeded the allowed limits in most of the branches of the Barada River. According to the Syrian National Environmental Action Plan of 2003, concentrations of BOD and ammonia in the Barada River exceeded Syrian Standards for 86% of collected samples between 1995 and 2000. Well and spring water in the basin is bacteriologically contaminated because of sewage discharge. The concentrations of nitrates in some wells in the Ghouta exceeded the limits set by the drinking water standards. Because of discharges by tanneries concentrations of Chromium III reach 10mg/liter in Al Daiyani River and exceed the allowable limits tenfold in the wells of Al Zablatini area, all located in the Barada basin. Surface water pollution reduces real estate values next to the river and its branches, as well as the <b>recreational</b> <b>value</b> of the river.
