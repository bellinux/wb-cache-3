25|$|Gyula Németh, {{following}} Zoltán Gombocz, derived Xazar from {{a hypothetical}} *Qasar reflecting a Turkic root qaz- ("to <b>ramble,</b> to roam") being an hypothetical velar variant of Common Turkic kez-. In the fragmentary Tes and Terkhin inscriptions of the Uyğur empire (744–840) the form 'Qasar' is attested, though uncertainty remains whether {{this represents a}} personal or tribal name, gradually other hypotheses emerged. Louis Bazin derived it from Turkic qas- ("tyrannize, oppress, terrorize") {{on the basis of}} its phonetic similarity to the Uyğur tribal name, Qasar. András Róna-Tas connects it with Kesar, the Pahlavi transcription of the Roman title Caesar.|$|E
25|$|Hard Network Out – For some reason, {{unbeknownst to}} {{humanity}} at present, professional journalist and Miami Herald columnist Greg Cote cannot {{understand the concept}} of the hard network {{out at the end of}} an hour of the show and will continue to talk through the break. There was a period on the show wherein Le Batard would wear a hat with a clock on the brim to help Cote understand how much time remained at the end of a segment, but to no avail. The phenomenon has now morphed into Le Batard and Stugotz attempting to trap Cote by waiting until late in an hour to ask his opinion, setting him up to <b>ramble</b> through the out. The show maintains frequently that this feat is not a contrived gag but is an actual problem for Cote that they exploit to great comedic benefit. Le Batard and Stugotz also use this as a prank; during an episode in February 2017, the two had Cote on the phone to discuss a Twitter beef with Dwyane Wade, and cut him off at the hard network out before he could respond to Dan's question regarding it. Le Batard admitted he was on the show just so they could cut him off.|$|E
