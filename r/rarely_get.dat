25|$|Gateshead Council is Labour controlled. In total {{there are}} 54 Labour councillors and 12 Lib Dem councillors. In general, the Whickham area along with Low Fell tend to favour the Liberal Democrats. Pelaw, Ryton and Dunston Hill are more evenly matched {{between the two}} parties, {{and the rest of}} the borough is {{dominated}} by Labour, especially the East. UKIP were able to get 23% of the vote in Winlaton and High Spen in 2016, while the Liberal Party have one of their few strongholds in Birtley, where they once held. The Conservatives <b>rarely</b> <b>get</b> more than 10%, polling best in Bridges and Saltwell wards; both of these have large Jewish communities.|$|E
25|$|The series {{centers on}} the surreal adventures and antics of three {{anthropomorphic}} fast food items: Master Shake, a selfish, pathological lying milkshake; Frylock, an intelligent, well-meaning box of French fries; and Meatwad, a shapeshifting, simple-minded ball of ground meat. They live together as roommates, and <b>rarely</b> <b>get</b> along with their human neighbor Carl Brutananadilewski, a balding, middle-aged, sex-crazed sports fanatic. The main protagonists also interact with various villains or other individuals in each episode; these interactions are often restricted to one episode, as minor characters rarely reappear in following episodes. Some episodes feature the main protagonists interacting with celebrities (such as adult film actress Tera Patrick) and occasionally with historical figures and professional athletes (such as Bart Oates or John Kruk).|$|E

25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You <b>rarely</b> <b>get</b> that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
25|$|The Adelaide Oval {{is usually}} a flat, lifeless wicket where the fastest bowlers could <b>rarely</b> <b>get</b> the ball to rise above knee level and looked fit for a {{thousand}} runs. Freddie Brown won the toss and sent Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook out the bat. The Yorkshireman was back at 31/1 {{and said that the}} wicket was turning so much that they would be lucky to make 250. He wasn't just saving his blushes as the fast-medium seamer Geoff Noblet took 5/54 in the searing heat and Slow Left Armer John Wilson 3/39 as the MCC were out for 211 with no batsman making 30 except Washbrook (32) and David Sheppard (32) {{at the start of the}} innings. The heat badly affected the South Australians with only Neil Dansie (44) made any headway as Eric Hollies took 3/16, Roy Tattersall (2/32) and Doug Wright (2/39) and Freddie Brown (1/1) spun them out for 126. Hutton (66) and Washbrook (45) added 112 for the first wicket in the MCC's reply of 220 with the leg-breaks of Allan McLean (5/68) cleaning up the tail after Noblet (3/39) helped remove the first three batsmen. Even so, 306 runs to win was too much for South Australia as they collapsed to 152 all out after being 90/1 with Dansie (42) top scoring again and Wright taking 5/57. This was the MCC's second win over South Australia and their fourth win in a row since the Third Test, so they had high hopes for Adelaide.|$|E
500|$|PopMatters {{reviewer}} Brendan Maher accused Insane Clown Posse of misogyny {{and described}} The Amazing Jeckel Brothers as [...] "music to strangle your ex-girlfriend to". Robert Christgau gave the album a C+, writing [...] "Though they claim clown, they <b>rarely</b> <b>get</b> funnier than 'I'd cut my head off but then I would be dead'." [...] However, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album a {{four out of}} five star rating, writing that [...] " [...] actually delivered an album that comes close to fulfilling whatever promise their ridiculous, carnivalesque blend of hardcore hip hop and shock-metal had in the first place".|$|E

500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode in 2010, for The A.V. Club, {{giving it a}} rating of an A. He praised {{the fact that there}} was no mystery to the episode, and that it was instead explained immediately that Sarek was the cause of the crewmembers' problems. He added that there was a [...] "beautiful simplicity to this concept, an elegance that makes the tragedy at the heart of the episode all the more powerful". Handlen said that the scene in which Picard deals with the emotions of Sarek after the mind meld was a [...] "remarkable work, a level of naked, raw intensity that we <b>rarely</b> <b>get</b> on , and in the hands of a lesser actor (basically anyone else in the ensemble), this could've been ridiculous".|$|E
500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode a 4.6 out of 5 stars, {{and went on}} to {{describe}} the episode as [...] "A funny, touching, entertaining Glee episode that didn't feature a single line from Sue Sylvester? I never thought I'd see the day. But that's exactly what transpired on 'Silly Love Songs', as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, and wrote, Silly Love Songs' strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-Super Bowl episode in that tonight was more about the kids and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part because we got some insight into the lives of two New Directions members we <b>rarely</b> <b>get</b> to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine praised the storyline and the musical performances of the episode. However, Soraya Roberts of the Daily News gave the episode a negative review: [...] "This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer. It's almost as bad as Tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing 'My Funny Valentine' to Mike and Blaine attempting to channel Frank Sinatra while singing Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs' in the middle of Breadsticks." [...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised the storyline, calling it cohesive.|$|E

2500|$|Tom Long from The Detroit News remarked {{about the}} film: [...] "Appealling, entertaining, {{touching}} {{and perhaps even}} a bit healing, The Help is an old-fashioned grand yarn of a film, the sort we <b>rarely</b> <b>get</b> these days."

2500|$|Razor Smith (William Charles Smith; 4 October 1877, Oxford, Oxfordshire – 15 July 1946, Bermondsey, London) was a Surrey slow bowler. Nicknamed [...] "Razor" [...] {{because of}} his extreme thinness, Smith was prone to serious injury and could <b>rarely</b> <b>get</b> through a full season's cricket, but when sound, could command the sharpest off-break among bowlers of his day. He was also able to bowl a {{somewhat}} faster ball with a very high flight that turned a little from leg and, with any help from the pitch, would get up almost straight.|$|E
2500|$|However, Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "But in {{his attempt}} to blend his preoccupations with the plot of C. J. Koch's 1978 novel, Weir has perhaps packed too much imagery and {{information}} into his movie ... The plot becomes landlocked in true-life implausibilities; the characters <b>rarely</b> <b>get</b> a hold on the moviegoer's heart or lapels". In his review for the Washington Post, Gary Arnold described the film as [...] "a grievously flawed yet compelling tale of political intrigue, certainly a triumph of atmosphere if not of coherent dramatization". Newsweek magazine called the film [...] "an annoying failure because it fritters away so many rich opportunities".|$|E

2500|$|Dog {{fighting}} and {{the possession of}} any fighting equipment designed for dog fighting is illegal in all Australian states and territories.

2500|$|According to Jesse Zwick, RT persuades [...] "legitimate {{experts and}} journalists" [...] {{to appear as}} guests by {{allowing}} them to speak at length on issues ignored by larger news outlets. It frequently interviews progressive and libertarian academics, intellectuals and writers from organisations like The Nation, Reason magazine, Human Events, Center for American Progress and the Cato Institute who are critical of United States foreign and civil liberties policies. RT also features little known commentators, including anarchists, anti-globalists and left-wing activists.
