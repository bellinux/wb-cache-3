[...] Furthermore, end groups {{play an important role}} in the process of initiation, propagation and termination of graft polymers. Graft polymers can be achieved by either “grafting from” or “grafting to”; these different methods are able to produce a vast array of different polymer structures, which can be tailored to the application in question. [...] The “grafting from” approach involves, for example, generation of radicals along a polymer chain, which can then be reacted with monomers to grow a new polymer from the backbone of another. In “grafting from” the initiation sites on the backbone of the first polymer can be part of the backbone structure originally or generated in situ. [...] The “grafting to” approach involves the reaction of functionalized monomers to a polymer backbone. [...] In graft polymers, end groups play an important role, for example, in the “grafting to” technique the generation of the <b>reactive</b> <b>functionalized</b> monomers occurs at the end group, which is then tethered to the polymer chain. There are various methods to synthesize graft polymers some of the more common include redox reaction to produce free radicals, by free radical polymerization techniques avoiding chain termination (ATRP, RAFT, Nitroxide mediated, for example) and step-growth polymerization. A schematic of “grafting from” and “grafting to” is illustrated in the figure below. The [...] "grafting from" [...] technique involves the generation of radicals along the polymer backbone from an abstraction of a halogen, from either the backbone or a functional group along the backbone. Monomers are reacted with the radicals along the backbone and subsequently generate polymers which are grafted from the backbone of the first polymer. The schematic for [...] "grafting to" [...] shows an example using anionic polymerizations, the polymer containing the carbonyl functionalities gets attacked by the activated polymer chain and generates a polymer attached to the associated carbon along with an alcohol group, in this example. These examples show us the potential of fine tuning end groups of polymer chains to target certain copolymer structures.|$|E

Synthesis {{is carried out}} via sol-gel processing in combination with organic crosslinking reactions of <b>reactive</b> <b>functionalized</b> organosilanes. Depending on chemical composition and processing parameters, special properities are available to meet the material requirements of applied technology. To overcome the general problems resulting from anion movement in using salts and acids, alkylsulfone functionalized alkosilanes were cocondensed with reactive polymerizable alkoxysilanes such as 3 -methacryloxypropyl- (for uv-initiated polymerization of the organics) and 3 -glycidoxypropyl-tri-methoxysilane (for thermally initiated polymersation).

40|$|International audienceCoextrusion {{technologies}} {{are commonly used}} to produce multilayered composite sheets or films for a large range of applications from food packaging to optics. The contrast of rheological properties between layers can lead to interfacial instabilities. Important theoretical and experimental advances regarding theses defects have, during the last decades, been made using a mechanical and numerical approach. This study deals with {{the influence of the}} physicochemical affinity between the neighboring layers on interfacial instabilities for functionalized incompatible polymers. It was experimentally confirmed, in this case, that weak disturbance can be predicted by considering an interface of nonzero thickness (corresponding to an interdiffusion/ reaction zone interphase) instead of a purely geometrical interface between the two reactive layers. According to the rheological investigations, an experimental strategy was here formulated to investigate the parameters that controlled the stability of the reactive multilayer flows. The role of the viscosity ratio, elasticity ratio, and layer ratio of the stability of the interface was also investigated coupling to the reaction rate/ compatibilization phenomenon.

40|$|In this study, we {{synthesized}} a phosphorus-containing triply <b>functionalized</b> <b>reactive</b> modifier, DOPO-tris(azetidine- 2, 4 -dione), and a phosphorus-free doubly <b>functionalized</b> <b>reactive</b> modifier, bis(azetidine- 2, 4 -dione), and embedded {{them into}} epoxy resin systems. We characterized these synthesized reactive modifiers using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and mass spectrometry. During the thermosetting processes, we reacted the epoxy curing agents 4, 4 -diaminodiphenylmethane and tris(4 -aminophenyl) amine with the multiply hydrogen-bonding reactive modifiers and epoxy monomers. The introduction of the DOPO segment, strongly hydrogen bonding malonamide linkages, and hard aromatic groups into the backbones of the synthesized reactive modifiers resulted in epoxy networks exhibiting tailorable crosslinking densities, flexibilities, glass transition temperatures, thermal decomposition temperatures, and flame retardancies. Furthermore, dynamic mechanical analyses indicated that intermolecular hydrogen bonding of these reactive modifiers enhanced the thermal and physical properties of their epoxy resins through the formation of unique pseudocrosslinked polymer networks.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{highlight}} the presence of long chain branching, LCB, due to the incorporation of a multifunctional epoxide, named Joncryl ®, as a chain extender, into both poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and poly (butylene-adipate-co-terephtalate) (PBAT) polymers. The modified polymers were prepared using a twin-screw reactive extrusion system. It has been demonstrated through this study that the modified polymers with the multi-functionalized epoxide are thermo-rheologically complex. This complexity {{may be attributed to}} the formation of covalent bonds between both polymer and chain extender and leads to a failure of the time-temperature superposition (tTS). Furthermore, the resulting linear and branched chains, due to the <b>reactive</b> highly <b>functionalized</b> epoxide, are discussed using rheological investigations (relaxation spectra, flow activation energy) coupled with solution viscometry (solution viscosimetry properties, gyration and hydrodynamic radii) and physicochemical properties (size-exclusion chromatography).

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{kinetics}} of the application and washing process of two different functionalized silicones on cotton fabric. The first, a polyquaternary polysiloxane - blockcopolymer, interacts by hydrogen bonding to the hydroxyl-groups of the cotton fibre. The second, a <b>reactive</b> <b>functionalized</b> polyquaternary polysiloxane-block-copolymer consists of uretdione functions, which can react with either the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose or with OH-groups of the silicone to form a silicone network. In this work the kinetic aspects of the finishing and washing process are decribed. The first examinations to analyse the application process were done using a fluorescent ammonium functionalized silicone softener. This modification allows measurements of the silicone concentration in the bath during the application by photometric detection. The fibre cross section could be analysed by fluorescence microscopy during the application process. The bath analysis shows that the application process follows a sorption isotherm described by Langmuir. The examinations by fluorescence microscopy show {{a change in the}} cross section of the fibre towards an oval shape after treatment and a diffusion of the silicone polymer into the lumen. The examination of the fiber surface during the application process with a non fluorescent modified silicon polymer was accomplished by XPS. The changes in the concentration of silicone in the bath were measured by photometric detection after reaction of the ammonium groups of the silicone with bromophenol blue. The kinetics can be described by the square-root-t-relation. The resulting rate constants do not differ significantly for different bath temperatures. The examinations by XPS and IR-spectroscopy of the washing process showed a diffusion of the silicone molecules from the core {{to the surface of the}} fibre, where they are removed by the surfactants of the washing bath. XPS results show that after one washing cycle the silicone concentration on the surface stays almost constant. The IR-spectroscopic examinations indicate a continuous decrease of silicone in the fibre. In parallel to the spectroscopic analysis of the fiber surface the changes in the silicone concentration in the bath were analysed by photometric detection. The examinations showed a square-root-t-relation for the washing process. In another part the influence of the silicone treatment to the evenness of the coloration of a yellow dyed cotton skirt was examined by datacolor measurement and CIELAB interpretation. Further examinations showed that an overdose of silicone during the finishing causes discoloration which is an undesirable effect. In this part, the application process of the <b>reactive</b> <b>functionalized</b> polyquaternary polysiloxane-block-copolymer silicone was examined by fluorescent microscopy. In a similar manner to the non-reactive silicones, the reactive silicones diffuse into the fibre, but in this case but no change in fiber cross section could be observed. The amount of applied silicone on the fiber was much lower compared with the fibers treated with the non-reactive silicone. The kinetics of the application process follows a square root-t- relation. The rate constants are very similar to those for the non-reactive silicone polymers. It is likely that the silicones build a charged layer in the pores of the cotton fibre, which repels any further silicone molecules diffusing into the pores. That implies that no further molecules can diffuse into the pores, which is proven by a very low swelling of the fibre and a very low rate of exhaustion. The improved washing resistance in comparison to the non-reactive silicones is due to the chemical bonding to the fibre, which is much stronger than for the non-reactive silicone...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCoextrusion {{technologies}} {{are commonly used}} to produce multilayered composite sheets or films for a large range of applications from food packaging to optics. The contrast of rheological properties between layers can lead to interfacial instabilities during flow. Important theoretical and experimental advances regarding the stability of compatible and incompatible polymers have, during the last decades, been made using a mechanical approach. However, few research efforts have been dedicated to the physicochemical affinity between the neighboring layers. The present study deals with the influence of this affinity on interfacial instabilities for functionalized incompatible polymers. Polyamide (PA 6) /polyethylene grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (PE-GMA) {{was used as a}} reactive system and PE/PA 6 as a non reactive one. Two grades of polyamide (PA 6) were used in order to change the viscosity and elasticity ratios between PE (or PE-GMA) and PA 6. It was experimentally confirmed, in this case, that weak disturbance can be predicted by considering an interphase of non-zero thickness (corresponding to an interdiffusion/reaction zone) instead of a purely geometrical interface between the two reactive layers. According to rheological investigations from previous work, an experimental strategy was here formulated to optimize the process by listing the parameters that controlled the stability of the reactive multilayer flows. Plastic films with two layers were coextruded in symmetrical and asymmetrical configurations in which PA 6 was the middle layer. Indeed, for reactive multilayered systems, the interfacial flow instability could be reduced or eliminated, for instance, by (i) increasing the residence time or temperature in the coextrusion bloc (for T above the reaction temperature T[*]=[*] 240 °C), and (ii) reducing the total extrusion flow rate. The reaction rate/compatibilization played a major role that must be taken into account. Furthermore, the role of the viscosity ratio, elasticity ratio, and layer ratio of the stability of the interface were also investigated coupling to the physicochemical affinity. The results show {{that it is necessary to}} obtain links between the classic factors that are introduced in the evaluation of the theoretical, given by linear stability analysis/longwave asymptotic investigations, and its corresponding experimental stability charts. Hence, based on this analysis, guide-lines for a stable coextrusion of <b>reactive</b> <b>functionalized</b> polymers can be provided...|$|E

Polymer flooding by hydrophobically associated polyacrylamides (HAPAM) and its modified silica nanocomposite are a widely implemented technique through {{enhanced oil}} recovery (EOR) technology.

40|$|Arylazide {{derivatives}} {{have been}} used for the surface functionalization of chalcogenide glasses. These compounds are photografted by a deposition step followed by an irradiation step under UV light. Two photosensitive molecules were studied: the so-called "molecular clip" which is a phenylazide moiety linked via a propylene chain to a succinimidyl ester (4), and the perfluoro- 4 -azido- 1 -benzoic acid coupled to a hexaethyleneglycol chain (3). Two approaches have been considered: the indirect approach that consists in the binding of the azido compound onto a primary organic layer (made of the PEGylated molecules 1 and 2) previously deposited on the glass surface, and the direct approach that is the reaction of the azido compound directly with the native glass surface. After photografting, the samples were analyzed by water contact angle measurement (θw), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The "molecular clip" 4 binds strongly to the surface and also forms multilayers by intermolecular linkages, either in the direct or the indirect approach. According to the θw values, the perfluorophenylazide 3 reacts weakly with the surface; however, the ToF-SIMS spectra confirm the presence of photografted molecules. In this case, intermolecular reactions are highly favored and therefore responsible of the poor surface coverage. The binding of 4 leads to a <b>reactive</b> surface, <b>functionalized</b> by succinimidyl ester groups, the surface reactivity of which has been assayed by coupling 3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) benzylamine, followed by XPS analysis.

40|$|Metal {{nanoparticles}} hold {{promise for}} many {{scientific and technological}} applications, such as chemical and biological sensors, vehicles for drug delivery, and subdiffraction limit waveguides. To fabricate such devices, a method to position particles in specific locations relative to each other is necessary. Nanoparticles tend to spontaneously aggregate into ordered two- and three-dimensional assemblies, but achieving one-dimensional structures is less straightforward. Because of their symmetry, nanoparticles lack the ability to bond along specific directions. Thus, the technological potential of nanoparticles would be greatly enhanced {{by the introduction of}} a method to break the interaction symmetry of nanoparticles, thus inducing valency and directional interparticle interactions. When a nanoparticle is coated with a mixture of two different ligands, the ligands have been shown to phase-separate into ordered domains encircling or spiraling around the core. Topological constraints inherent in assembling two-dimensional vectors (e. g., ligands) onto a sphere (the core of the nanoparticle) dictate the necessary formation of two diametrically opposed defect points within the ligand shell. The molecules at these points are not optimally stabilized by intermolecular interactions and thus these sites are highly <b>reactive.</b> By <b>functionalizing</b> the polar singularities with a third type of molecule, we generate divalent nanoparticles with "chemical handles" {{that can be used to}} direct the assembly of the particles into chains. For example, taking inspiration from the wellknown interfacial polymerization synthesis of nylon, we place carboxylic acid terminated molecules at the polar defect points and join the newly bifunctional nanoparticles into chains by reacting them with 1, 6 -diaminohexane through an interfacial reaction. (cont.) Furthermore, we perform a full kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of the molecularly defined polar defect points. We demonstrate that the rate of place-exchange at these points is significantly faster than it is elsewhere in the ligand shell. We also determine the equilibrium constant and standard free energy of the place-exchange reaction at the polar defect sites and demonstrate that the reaction is strongly affected by the molecular environment, i. e. the composition of the ligand shell. by Gretchen Anne DeVries.
