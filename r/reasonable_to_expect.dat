It is <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> {{a relationship between the}} amplitude of such fluctuations and the elasticity of the network. Since the elasticity measures the resistance of the network to either elastic (reversible) or plastic (irreversible) deformation, the fluctuations should grow larger as the elasticity declines. The divergence of the scattered light intensity at a finite critical temperature implies that the elasticity approaches zero, or the compressibility becomes infinite, which is the typically observed behavior of a system at the point of instability. Thus, at the critical point, the polymer network offers no resistance at all to any form of deformation.|$|E

500|$|Public {{nuisance}} concerns {{protecting the}} public, unlike private nuisance, which protects an individual. As such {{it is not}} only a tort but also a crime. In Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, it was defined by Romer LJ as any act or omission [...] "which materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty's subjects". Because of the wide definition given, there are a large range of issues which can be dealt with through public nuisance, including picketing on a road, as in Thomas v NUM, blocking a canal, as in Rose v Miles, or disrupting traffic by queuing in a road, as in Lyons v Gulliver. A significant difference between private and public nuisance is that under public, one can claim for personal injuries as well as damage to property. Another difference is that public nuisance is primarily a crime; it only becomes a tort if the claimant can prove that they suffered [...] "special damage" [...] over and above the effects on the other affected people in the [...] "class". The test for the required size of a [...] "class" [...] was also discussed in Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, with the court concluding that the test was whether the nuisance was [...] "so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect {{that it would not be}} <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large".|$|E
500|$|The {{claimant}} {{must first}} {{show that the}} defendant's actions have caused an interference with their use or enjoyment of the land. These interferences are indirect, and almost always the result of continuing events rather than a one-off incident. This interference may be a physical invasion of the land, such as in Davey v Harrow Corporation, noise, as in Christie v Davey, or smells, such as in Wheeler v J J Saunders. The courts have allowed cases where the interference causes emotional distress, as in Thompson-Schwab v Costaki, but have been loath to protect recreational facilities or [...] "things of delight"; things such as the blocking of a pleasant view or a television signal are not considered a nuisance. The latter was discussed in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, where the claimants argued that the blocking of their television signal by {{the construction of the}} skyscraper at One Canada Square was a nuisance. The House of Lords rejected this argument. There are rights to land known as servitudes, such as the right to light through windows or the right of support. An occupier can also be liable for an interference that is naturally arising, assuming they are aware of the interference's existence and fail to take reasonable precautions, as in Leakey v National Trust, which established that in such situations [...] "the standard ought to be to require of the occupier what is <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> of him in his individual circumstances". This principle was extended in Holbeck Hall Hotel v Scarborough Borough Council, where the Court of Appeal said that if a landowner knows or ought to know that their property may cease to support another's, they are required to take reasonable precautions or they will be liable.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{temporal}} evolution of natural illite du Puy dissolution rates was measured from Si release rates in single-pass flow-through experiments lasting at least 100 days at 25 °C and pH ranging from 2 to 12. Si release rates decreased {{by a factor}} of five and three at pH 12 and 2, respectively, during the experiments. These observations are interpreted to stem from changes in illite du Puy reactive surface area during these experiments. As the edges of clay minerals dissolve faster than the basal planes, dissolution tends to change clay mineral morphology decreasing the percentage of reactive edge sites. This continuously changing morphology prevents illite dissolution rates from attaining steady state during laboratory experiments lasting 100 to 200 days. A similar temporal decrease in dissolution rates is evident for many different sets of clay mineral dissolution rate data available in the literature.
