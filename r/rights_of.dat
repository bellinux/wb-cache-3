Specifically, the article argues that traditional protection stemming from actions for invasion <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> privacy, trademark infringement, and copyright infringement cannot substitute for the protection afforded by a post-mortem <b>right</b> <b>of</b> publicity. Therefore, the article argues that a postmortem <b>right</b> <b>of</b> publicity should be descendible and inheritable as personal property upon the owner’s death. The article concludes that adopting a post-mortem <b>right</b> <b>of</b> publicity in Arkansas would protect Arkansans from use of their name, image, or likeness for commercial purposes without their consent...|$|R
