500|$|In his 1988 memoirs, Regan {{wrote about}} Reagan's {{consultations}} with the astrologer, {{the first public}} mention of them, which resulted in embarrassment for the First Lady. Reagan later wrote, [...] "Astrology was simply {{one of the ways}} I coped with the fear I felt after my husband almost died... Was astrology one of the reasons ? I don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was, but I don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> wasn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early August 2005, leaked emails {{from former}} US {{prosecutors}} criticised the legal process, accusing it of being [...] "a half-hearted and disorganised effort by a skeleton group of relatively inexperienced attorneys to prosecute fairly low-level accused {{in a process}} that appears to be rigged" [...] and [...] "writing a motion saying that the process will be full and fair when you don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is kind of hard, particularly when you want to call yourself an officer and lawyer". Ruddock responded by saying that the emails, written in March 2004, [...] "must be seen as historic rather than current." [...] In October 2005, the US government announced that if Hicks was convicted, his pre-trial detention would not count as time served against his sentence.|$|E
60|$|Joe, even I {{could be}} guilty {{of such a thing}} as that--if I were in party-politics; I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{the door}} Mrs. Chaffery kissed Lewisham an effusive good-bye, and told Ethel she <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> {{was all for}} the best.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wonder if}} he <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it.</b> I have noticed that the maids and the waiters seem to look at us with a certain interest.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes. My aunt shut me {{up because}} I would not tell a story," [...] said Kate, <b>really</b> <b>believing</b> <b>it</b> herself. [...] "Oh, let us get home, Charlie, do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> Lottie?" [...] Mrs. Kenton entreated, with {{a sudden}} {{tenderness}} for her younger daughter such as she did not always feel.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was," [...] she consented, {{recognizing}} {{an architectural}} resemblance, {{and she fell}} asleep again, and woke renewed for the work before them.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{yourself}} for instance?" [...] Isabel suggested jocosely. And then, [...] "Do you <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> will ruin me?" [...] she asked in quite another tone.|$|E
60|$|THE STATUE. [Stoutly] Not a bit; for I <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> {{with all}} my soul at the moment. I had a heart: not like you. And it was this sincerity that made me successful.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{smarter than}} anybody else in all the Green Forest and on all the Green Meadows. She is smarter {{than anybody else}} in all the Great World," [...] boasted Reddy, and he <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Supposing you'd asked God to do something," [...] said Philip, [...] "and <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> {{was going}} to happen, like moving a mountain, I mean, and you had faith, and it didn't happen, what would it mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|L. Because {{you have}} been taught that it is all evil--'only evil continually.' Somehow, often as people say that, they never seem, to me, to believe it? Do you <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|It {{turned me}} blind when I first heard Swett was beaten and Lovejoy nominated; but, after much reflection, I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> {{is best to}} let it stand. This, of course, I wish to be confidential.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is a sled with a {{reindeer}} attached!" [...] cried Dave. And such {{proved to}} be the case. But before they could {{get a good look at}} the novel turnout, sled and reindeer flashed out of sight.|$|E
60|$|All {{of which}} Flora said {{with so much}} headlong vehemence as if she <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it.</b> There is not much doubt that when she worked herself into full mermaid condition, she did {{actually}} believe whatever she said in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where I come from," [...] {{he said in}} {{an audible}} voice to his neighbor, [...] "a young lady like that would have been spared this public disappointment. A dozen men would have made up that sum and let her go without knowing {{anything}} about her account being overdrawn." [...] And he <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
2500|$|King Bhumiphol... {{informed}} the Foreign Minister {{that he considered}} the [...] rumors [...] absurd, that he knew his brother well {{and that he was}} certain that his death had been accidental... What the King said to Direk does not necessarily represent what he <b>really</b> <b>believes,</b> <b>it</b> is nevertheless interesting that he made so categorical a statement to the Foreign Minister.|$|R
6000|$|... 'More {{than the}} rest,' said Violet; 'but unluckily he {{is a little}} bit of a coward, and is afraid when papa plays with him. We make resolutions, but I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is a matter of nerves, and that poor Johnnie cannot help it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Jack brightened up suddenly. [...] "I can't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is you, Harry. You've {{grown so}} big and burly, and you look so old." [...] He smiled. [...] "I wish I could see some of that {{shooting}} they all tell about, but that would let the cat out." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nasmyth smiled. [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> {{originated}} with her, but, {{as a matter}} of fact, it might have gone no further, which is an admission. Still, the desire to win those spurs has been growing so strong of late that I can't resist it. In one way, I scarcely think that is very astonishing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Filmmaker Michael Bavaro was one {{of those}} kids who watched Rex Trailer on TV, thought it was real and never forgot the memory of its magic. [...] "I grew up in Milford, Massachusetts and Boomtown {{was one of}} my first memories," [...] he recalls. [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> was the Wild West." [...] He credits the show with {{sparking}} his interest in film and television.|$|R
60|$|Armine {{worked for}} this {{examination}} as eagerly {{as he had}} decorated for Miss Parsons, and {{in the face of}} the like sneers; for Bobus <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> was all waste of time, and did not scruple to tell him so, and to laugh when he consulted Jock, whose acquirements lay more in the way of military mathematics and modern languages than of university requirements.|$|R
5000|$|Austin Bucks (voiced by Cam Clarke) - A monopolizing store tycoon {{that wants}} to buy the store from the Spankenheimers, but {{near the end of}} the special, decides instead of buying out the Spankenheimers, he decides to {{franchise}} the store, which Grandma eventually accepts. Bucks is completely unaware of Cousin Mel's plots and, in fact, gives Jake the opportunity to prove his story, despite not <b>really</b> <b>believing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And I, too," [...] {{said her}} daughter, {{with tears in}} her eyes; [...] "that {{was one of the}} ways in which I worked it out. But it is too dreadful. John Gayther, don't you think you have made a mistake? If you were to {{consider}} it all carefully don't you <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> could not be that, at least not quite that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> would. You {{would have}} looked as if you thought it so impossible, that I should have been {{strengthened}} up to do something {{they could not have}} taken for consent. I'll tell you all about it, Marian, from the beginning, and you will see how little free will I had in it, and how distracted I am now." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{was indeed}} approaching the little cottage, and with apparently some confidence. He was a well-dressed, well-made man, whose age looked uncertain from {{the contrast between}} his heavy brown moustache and his hair, that, curling under {{the brim of his}} hat, was almost white in color. The young man started, and said, hurriedly: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is Fletcher,--they say his hair turned white from the Panama fever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it would}} be WRONG to take it from them," [...] Philip cried, growing fiery red and half losing his temper, for he <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "It would be sheer confiscation; the land's their own; they either bought it or {{inherited}} it from their fathers. If you were to begin taking it away, what guarantee would you have left {{for any of the}} rights of property generally?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{would have}} sent it long ago. But I must explain. I brought home with me from my bad times in America two strains of {{unsoundness}} of mind, the first, a perpetual fear that I can do no more work--the second, a perpetual fear that my friends have quarrelled with me.[43] This last long silence of yours drove me into <b>really</b> <b>believing</b> <b>it,</b> and I dared not write to you.|$|R
6000|$|He {{showed me}} my room, a little bower of chintz, with open windows {{where the light}} was green, and before he left me he said irrelevantly, [...] "As for my little boy, you know, we shall {{probably}} kill him between us, before wo have done with him!" [...] And he made this assertion as if he <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it,</b> without any appearance of jest, with his fine, near-sighted, expressive eyes looking straight into mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> {{is because}} I have been {{threatened}} with legal proceedings by my creditors, and have just come victoriously {{out of a}} hard struggle to appease them for the time. This little fight has roused me from my apathy; it has rallied my spirits, and {{made me feel like}} my old self again. I am no longer content with silently loving my dearest friend; I open my heart and write to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--don't count me" [...] {{interrupted}} the hostess; [...] "I must stay with Flo; besides, I must visit poor Mrs Donaldson, who is again laid up. But I'll be glad {{if you will}} take Aggy Anderson. Ever since the poor girl came here for a little change of air she has been longing {{to go out in}} the boat. I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is a natural craving for the free, fresh breezes of the sea. May she go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{did tell}} Aunt Susan by letter, giving Lady Georgina's {{authority}} for the statement; and I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> had a consoling effect upon her; for Aunt Susan {{is one of those}} innocent-minded people who cherish a profound respect for the opinions and ideas of a Lady of Title. Especially where questions of delicacy are concerned. It calmed her to think that though I, an officer's daughter, had declined upon trade, I was mixing at least with the Best People! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If Harvey {{chooses to}} loiter {{where there is}} great danger of being taken into custody, it is no affair of mine. On first {{learning}} that Archie had been imprisoned, I was so foolish as to say, without <b>really</b> <b>believing</b> <b>it</b> could be done, that we would form some plan for his rescue; but came to see right soon {{that it would be}} a piece of folly to raise our hands in such direction." ...|$|R
5000|$|Whatever I come up with, Pompeois always game to play. She's {{been so good}} at what she's {{done that}} I've just let the {{character}} do what I've wanted the character to do, which has been wonderful. She's managed to sell every single thing because she's <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it.</b> The incredible {{thing is that you}} can have no fear to write what you think because she is always able to deliver. Executive producer Betsy Beerson developing Pompeo's character ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Whom do {{you take}} me for?' she exclaimed angrily. 'Do you <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>it</b> was just for the {{pleasure}} of talking that I gave you the advice you have neglected so abominably?' ...|$|R
