40|$|OBJECTIVE: Benign {{intracranial}} hypertension (BIH) {{may be caused}} by intracranial venous sinus thrombosis. Cerebral angiograms may, however, be normal in patients <b>with</b> <b>BIH</b> that are associated with conditions with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. This raises the possibility that unrecognised non-occlusive venous thrombus might impede CSF drainage. This study therefore examined the strength of the association between risk factors for thrombosis and BIH. METHODS: The incidence of prothrombotic abnormalities among a mixed prospectively and retrospectively investigated cohort of 38 patients <b>with</b> <b>BIH,</b> was compared <b>with</b> healthy obese subjects, and patients with other neurological diseases. Prothrombotic abnormalities investigated included anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, antithrombin III, proteins C and S, plasma fibrinogen, kaolin cephalin clotting time, prothrombin time, and full blood counts. RESULTS: Evidence for the presence of an antiphospholipid antibody was found in 32 % of cases. Cases of familial deficiency of antithrombin III, thrombocytosis, and polycythaemia were also noted. Additionally, an increased concentration of plasma fibrinogen was found in 26 %. A coagulation abnormality was more often detectable in those subjects with normal or low body mass index and in those tested within six months of onset. CONCLUSION: There is a thrombotic pathogenesis in some cases of BIH...|$|R

Patients affected by migraine, benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) or unilateral movement disorders, such as hemichorea and hemidystonia with acute-subacute onset, were screened for aPLs. None of them had clinical or serological evidence of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or other connective tissue disease. Moderate to high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and/or positive Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) were demonstrated in 6 out of 17 patients with migraine, in 3 out of 4 patients <b>with</b> <b>BIH</b> and in all of the 5 patients showing unilateral movement disorders.

40|$|Benign {{intracranial}} hypertension (BIH) is a syndrome characterized by papilledema and elevated intracranial {{pressure in the}} absence of hydrocephalus or intracranial mass. The condition is found most often in obese females in the fourth decade of life. Etiology remains unclear but a wide variety of medications, disease states and altered physiology have been associated with its onset. The complaints of headache and disturbed visual acuity are those directly related to increased intracranial pressure. The most serious sequelae of untreated BIH is permanent, partial visual deficit. Early diagnosis and referral is important if visual loss is to be minimized or prevented. The case of a 33 -year-old female <b>with</b> <b>BIH</b> presenting to a chiropractic office is described.

50|$|For {{the period}} of Roman and pre-Roman times there is no data for Žirovac, {{but we know that}} in Banija area {{activity}} certainly existed. Since at those times, people and goods were moving along river valleys, one can only assume that Radašnica and Žirovac saw some traffic. Later, the main transport route is the road Novi Grad - Glina through Donji Žirovac. That it is well marked on the map of 1763. At the end of the 19th century, road maps of Austro-Hungarian Empire show that now there is even an official trade road through Gornji Žirovac from south (from Bužim, BiH), to the north to Donji Žirovac (at the time, possibly monitored from CP Radašnica) and connecting to the road Novi Grad - Glina.

40|$|Abstract Background Benign Intracranial Hypertension (BIH) may be caused, {{at least}} in part, by {{intracranial}} sinus thrombosis. Thrombosis is normally due to derangements in blood coagulation cascade which may predispose to abnormal clotting activation or deficiency in natural inhibitors' control. The aim {{of the study is}} to examine the strength of the association between risk factors for thrombosis and BIH. Patients and methods The incidence of prothrombotic abnormalities among a randomly investigated cohort of 17 patients <b>with</b> <b>BIH,</b> was compared <b>with</b> 51 healthy subjects matched for sex, age, body mass index, height and social background. Results The number of subjects with protein C deficiency was significantly higher in patients than in controls (3 vs 1, p Increased plasma levels of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, fibrinopeptide A (FPA), and PAI- 1 were demonstrated in patients group (5. 7 ± 1. 15 nM vs 0. 45 ± 0. 35 nM; 8. 7 ± 2. 5 ng/mL vs 2. 2 ± 1. 25 ng/mL; 45. 7 ± 12. 5 ng/mL vs 8. 5 ± 6. 7 ng/mL, respectively; p Discussion In agreement with other authors our data suggest a state of hypercoagulability in <b>BIH</b> associated <b>with</b> gene polymorphisms. Our findings also showed that mutations in cardiovascular genes significantly discriminate subjects <b>with</b> a <b>BIH</b> history. The association between coagulation and gene derangements, usually regarded to as cryptogenic, may suggest a possible pathogenetic mechanism in BIH. So, a prothrombotic tendency may exist that would, {{at least in}} part, explain some cases of BIH. Although based on a small population, these findings raise the exciting possibility of using these haemostatic factors as markers for selecting high-risk subjects in BIH disease. </p...|$|R
