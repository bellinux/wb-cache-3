5|$|The {{heart of}} Western Europe had been {{stabilized}} after the Christianization of the Saxon, Viking, and Hungarian peoples {{by the end}} of the 10th century. However, the breakdown of the Carolingian Empire gave rise to an entire class of warriors who now had little to do but fight among themselves. The <b>random</b> <b>violence</b> of the knightly class was regularly condemned by the church, and in response it established the Peace and Truce of God to prohibit fighting on certain days of the year. At the same time, the reform-minded papacy came into conflict with the Holy Roman Emperors, resulting in the Investiture Controversy. Popes such as Gregory VII justified the subsequent warfare against the Emperor's partisans in theological terms. It became acceptable for the Pope to utilize knights in the name of Christendom, not only against political enemies of the Papacy, but also against Al-Andalus, or, theoretically, against the Seljuq dynasty in the east.|$|E

500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the Millennium Group was a real-life organization called the Academy Group, which consisted of retired law enforcement agents working as a private investigative firm. Millennium creator Chris Carter {{had come to know}} members of the Academy Group through contacts he had made with the Federal Bureau of Investigation while researching his earlier television series The X-Files. The Academy Group focused on offender profiling, which shaped the main Millennium Group characters of Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). Describing his initial inception of the Group, Carter has stated [...] "they believe that all this <b>random</b> <b>violence</b> we see these days, there may actually be some order in the chaos [...] These guys think that, if they care enough, that they can stem the tide of this thing".|$|E
2500|$|In West's view, the September 11 attacks gave white Americans {{a glimpse}} {{of what it means to}} be a black person in the United States—feeling [...] "unsafe, unprotected, subject to <b>random</b> <b>violence,</b> and hatred" [...] for who they are. [...] "The ugly {{terrorist}} attacks on innocent civilians on 9/11," [...] he said, [...] "plunged the whole country into the blues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, {{serious and}} heinous acts of {{familial}} and <b>random</b> <b>violence</b> occur periodically, directly within {{the interior of}} the neighborhood. [...] The neighborhood lies completely within Oakland's Police Beat 4x, one of 35 across the city. [...] In recent months of 2009, violent crimes, as reported by the Oakland Police Department, included five burglaries, twelve robberies, and multiple assaults during the summer of 2009.|$|E

5000|$|Lange Frans & Baas B {{started to}} release singles as a duo in 2004. Their second single [...] "Moppie" [...] ("Babe") became a huge hit. Though they {{performed}} as a duo, {{the chorus of}} this song was sung by Brace. Their third single [...] "Zinloos" [...] ("Senseless"), a protest against so-called senseless <b>violence</b> (<b>random</b> street <b>violence</b> without a clear reason or sprung from minor incidents [...] - [...] a current hot topic in the Netherlands), became a number one hit in the Dutch charts {{at the end of}} the same year. On this track they were joined by singer Ninthe, who won TMF's 'Kweekvijver' later on. After the assassination of filmer and critic Theo van Gogh by Muslim fanatic Mohammed Bouyeri on November 2, 2004, a special version of [...] "Zinloos" [...] was recorded with adjusted lyrics. Parts of the lyrics were changed in order to address Theo van Gogh's assassination.|$|R
2500|$|In his review, Roger Ebert {{defended the}} artistic license of Russian roulette, arguing [...] "it is the {{organizing}} {{symbol of the}} film: Anything you can believe about the game, about its deliberately <b>random</b> <b>violence,</b> about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it, will apply to the war as a whole. It is a brilliant symbol because, {{in the context of}} this story, it makes any ideological statement about the war superfluous." ...|$|E
2500|$|A further {{significant}} motif is metaphor related to violence; [...] "the world of Titus {{is not simply}} one of meaningless acts of <b>random</b> <b>violence</b> but rather one in which language engenders violence and violence is done to language through the distance between word and thing, between metaphor and what it represents." [...] For example, in 3.1 when Titus asks Aaron to cut off his hand because he believes it will save his sons' lives he says, [...] "Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine." [...] Therefore, {{in the language of}} Titus, [...] "to lend one's hand is to risk dismemberment." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{first made}} the world scene in 1993, when {{one of its most}} popular singles, [...] "Ibo Lele (Dreams Come True)", a song with both English and Creole lyrics, was {{included}} in the soundtrack for the major motion picture Philadelphia, next to famous musicians including Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young. [...] The song was later re-released on RAM's first album, Aïbobo, in 1996. [...] This new-found success overseas did not, however, translate to security at home. [...] By April 1994, the band had to finish rehearsals before dark so that band members heading home could cross an open area in the city center known as [...] "The Frontier" [...] without too much risk of <b>random</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{developing}} {{street gang}} problem in Los Angeles which began to worsen {{at the end}} of the 1960s and got considerably worse in the late 1970s, also hurt traditional commercial activity in the area, as it did much of downtown. While the LAPD indicates that the area is a sort of neutral zone, which has not been claimed by any single gang and <b>random</b> gang <b>violence</b> is rare, the area remains one of the major areas for street drug sales in Los Angeles.|$|R

2500|$|Great {{theories}} generate numerous testable hypotheses. Engelmann’s {{theory was}} very successful in that regard. [...] His hypotheses were on target whether about aggression, <b>random</b> <b>violence,</b> cultural closure, anti-intellectualism, diminishing freedoms, or scientific viewpoints. In the late 1960s when riots were common place and everyone blamed everyone else, Engelmann sought answers to questions {{no one else was}} asking. Statistically speaking, how do groups emerge? In terms of probability how can they persist? The questions involve two mathematical curves. One represents the likelihood that a subgroup of a specific size will emerge; the other is the probability that it will persist. The product of the two curves provided the answer for the one-third hypothesis in 1967. Those groups most likely to emerge and to persist are the ones that amount to one-third of the total population, whether they be ethnic enclaves in the city, students protesting in the streets, social movements coming to the fore, or local governments on the rise.|$|E

50|$|Interpersonal {{violence}} {{is divided into}} two subcategories: Family and intimate partner violence - that is, violence largely between family members and intimate partners, usually, though not exclusively, taking place in the home. Community violence - violence between individuals who are unrelated, and {{who may or may not}} know each other, generally taking place outside the home. The former group includes forms of violence such as child abuse, intimate partner violence and abuse of the elderly. The latter includes youth <b>violence,</b> <b>random</b> acts of <b>violence,</b> rape or sexual assault by strangers, and violence in institutional settings such as schools, workplaces, prisons and nursing homes. When interpersonal violence occurs in families, its psychological consequences can affect parents, children, and their relationship in the short- and long-terms.|$|R
