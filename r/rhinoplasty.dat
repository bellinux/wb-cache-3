5|$|Over time, Jackson's facial {{structure}} {{changed as}} well. Surgeons speculated {{he also had}} a <b>rhinoplasty,</b> a forehead lift, cheekbone surgery, altered his lips, and had a cleft put in his chin. Those close to the singer estimated that, by 1990, he had undergone around ten procedures. According to Taraborrelli, Jackson had his first <b>rhinoplasty</b> after breaking his nose during a complex dance routine in 1979. However, the surgery was not a complete success, and he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to Steven Hoefflin, who performed his second <b>rhinoplasty</b> in 1981. Katherine Jackson, though, has {{said in a recent interview}} that Michael intentionally got his first nosejob from Steven Hoefflin. Taraborrelli stated Jackson had a third <b>rhinoplasty</b> three years later and a fourth in 1986. Jackson wrote in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that, in addition to the two rhinoplasties, {{he also had a}} dimple created in his chin. From 1986 onward he was a regular client of Arnold Klein, a dermatologist who specializes in dermal filler injection, a non-surgical cosmetic procedure.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Columbia in September 1948, Monroe {{became the}} protégée of Johnny Hyde, {{who was the}} vice {{president}} of the William Morris Agency. Hyde represented her and their relationship soon became sexual, although she refused his proposals of marriage. To advance Monroe's career, he paid for a silicone prosthesis to be implanted in her jaw and possibly for a <b>rhinoplasty,</b> and arranged a bit part in the Marx Brothers film Love Happy (1950). Monroe also continued modeling, and in May 1949 she posed nude for photos taken by Tom Kelley.

40|$|Filling {{the nasal}} dorsum with Gore-tex in <b>rhinoplasties</b> Filling the nasal dorsum with Gore-tex in <b>rhinoplasties</b> Uso do Gore-tex para preenchimento do dorso nasal em rinoplastias Background: Many {{autogenous}} and exogenous materials have been frequently {{used for the}} production of grafts and implants in <b>rhinoplasties.</b> The ideal graft or implant should be biocompatible, biointegrated, non-absorbable, and easily moldable and should not cause an inflammatory response. Gore-tex, an expandable form of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has been used since the 1970 s for vascular graft production. Although Gore-tex is extremely versatile and has extensive uses and low complication rates, the demonstration of Gore-tex use in aesthetic surgery is very limited in medical literature. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 7 patients who received Gore-tex implants in order to fill the nasal dorsum from January 2005 to December 2007. All patients were assessed for aesthetic and functional factors and for {{the presence or absence of}} complications. Results: All patients had good postoperative evolution, with great satisfaction in terms of aesthetic and functional aspects and no complications. Conclusions: Gore-tex is a satisfactory synthetic material as it is inexpensive, easily moldable, has good biocompatibility, and has shown no incidence of extrusion or infection in implants used for nasal dorsum filling in previously reported cases...|$|R

She begins dating new glee club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), and later accepts a promise ring from him. When Sue forces Quinn, Santana and Brittany to choose between cheerleading and the glee club, all three initially go with the Cheerios to retain their popularity, but are later convinced by Finn to defect to New Directions. Quinn cheats on Sam with Finn, and Sam dumps Quinn after she lies to him about her time with Finn. She and Finn reunite, and Quinn starts campaigning for junior prom king and queen elections. Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), Puck's new girlfriend and one of Quinn's rivals for prom queen, discovers that before transferring to McKinley High, Quinn was known by her first name, Lucy. She was overweight and unpopular, and after slimming down and having <b>rhinoplasty,</b> reinvented herself as Quinn, using her middle name. At prom, Finn is thrown out for fighting with Rachel's date Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff). Quinn is not named prom queen, and blames Rachel for her loss. She slaps her, but immediately regrets it and apologizes. Finn later breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1984, Michael {{and other}} members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi {{commercial}} overseen by executive Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third <b>rhinoplasty</b> shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor. Dusenberry recounted the episode in his memoir, Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for a reported $10 million. The second campaign had a global reach of more than 20 countries and would provide financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Although Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi, which later signed other music stars such as Britney Spears and Beyoncé to promote its products.|$|E

500|$|Jackson stated he had {{had only}} two <b>rhinoplasties</b> and no other facial surgery, {{although}} at one point mentioned having had a dimple created in his chin. He lost weight in the early 1980s because {{of a change in}} diet and a desire for [...] "a dancer's body". Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy, and speculated he was suffering from anorexia nervosa. Periods of weight loss would become a recurring problem later in life. During the course of his treatment, Jackson made two close friends: his dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein, and Klein's nurse Debbie Rowe. Rowe eventually became Jackson's second wife and the mother of his two eldest children. He also relied heavily on Klein for medical and business advice.|$|R
25|$|Nonetheless, at mid–20th century, {{despite such}} {{refinement}} {{of the open}} <b>rhinoplasty</b> approach, the endonasal <b>rhinoplasty</b> was the usual approach to nose surgery—until the 1970s, when Padovan presented his technical refinements, advocating the open <b>rhinoplasty</b> approach; he was seconded by Wilfred S. Goodman in the later 1970s, and by Jack P. Gunter in the 1990s. Goodman impelled technical and procedural progress with the article External Approach to <b>Rhinoplasty</b> (1973), which reported his technical refinements and popularized the open <b>rhinoplasty</b> approach. In 1982, Jack Anderson reported his refinements of nose surgery technique in the article Open Rhinoplasty: An Assessment (1982). During the 1970s, the principal application of open <b>rhinoplasty</b> was to the first-time <b>rhinoplasty</b> patient (i.e., a primary <b>rhinoplasty),</b> not as a revision surgery (i.e., a secondary <b>rhinoplasty)</b> to correct a failed nose surgery. In 1987, in the article External Approach for Secondary <b>Rhinoplasty</b> (1987), Jack P. Gunter reported the technical effectiveness of the open <b>rhinoplasty</b> approach for performing a secondary rhinoplasty; his improved techniques advanced the management of a failed nose surgery.|$|E
25|$|Hence does {{contemporary}} rhinoplastic praxis {{derive from}} the primeval (c. 600 BC) Indian <b>rhinoplasty</b> (nasal reconstruction via an autologous forehead-skin flap) and its technical variants: Carpue's operation, the Italian <b>rhinoplasty</b> (pedicle-flap reconstruction, aka the Tagliocotian rhinoplasty); and the closed-approach endonasal <b>rhinoplasty,</b> featuring exclusively internal incisions that allow the plastic surgeon to palpate (feel) the corrections being effected to the nose.|$|E
25|$|In time, the 5th-century BC Indian <b>rhinoplasty</b> technique—featuring a free-flap graft—was rediscovered by Western {{medicine}} in the 18th century, during the Third Anglo–Mysore War (1789–1792) of colonial annexation, by the British against Tipu Sultan, when the East India Company surgeons Thomas Cruso and James Findlay witnessed Indian <b>rhinoplasty</b> procedures at the British Residency in Poona. In the English-language Madras Gazette, the surgeons published photographs of the <b>rhinoplasty</b> procedure and its nasal reconstruction outcomes; later, in the October 1794 issue of the Gentleman's Magazine of London, the doctors Cruso and Findlay published an illustrated report describing a forehead pedicle-flap <b>rhinoplasty</b> that was a technical variant of the free-flap graft technique that Sushruta had described some twenty-three centuries earlier.|$|E
40|$|Lateral {{osteotomy}} is a {{very important}} step in a cosmetic rhinoplasty; it allows the surgeon to narrow the nose, to close the open roof created after hump removal, and to achieve symmetry of an asymmetrical nasal bony framework. In most patients a single lateral osteotomy reaches the expected result, with excellent cosmetic outcome, good stability, and rapid healing. We find that double lateral osteotomy is useful in managing severe asymmetry of nasal walls in patients with too prominent and thick maxillary processes that join asymmetrically together with nasal bones. It is also valuable in correcting very large and wide noses. We review our experience of about 1660 <b>rhinoplasties</b> with more than one year follow-up. Two hundred and ten cases (12. 65 %) had been treated with monolateral, or bilateral double osteotomy. We evaluate postoperative aesthetic and functional results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the surgical {{reconstruction of the}} nose in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries.

Histories of plastic surgery currently state that after Tagliacozzi's death in 1599, his procedure disappeared from medical knowledge. I demonstrate that {{this was not the case}} through a thorough book history of an English translation of De curtorum chirurgia published in London in 1687 and 1696 that was attached to the collected works of the Scottish surgeon Alexander Read. In the seventeenth century, the disfigured nose became associated with the effects of syphilis and its mercury treatment, and I examine this relationship in order to account for <b>rhinoplasty's</b> stigmatization, and medical resistance to using the procedure that led to its alleged disappearance in the period.

It can be also a consequence of surgical procedures in the nasal area where a loss of bone or septal cartilaginous support has occurred. They compare the techniques employed in the reconstruction and describe the advantage of the use of cartilage from the 11 th rib and evaluate the results of an engineering analysis of tension forces on the rib cartilage.

25|$|The plastic {{surgical}} {{correction of}} congenital and acquired abnormalities {{of the nose}} restores functional and aesthetic properties by the surgeon's manipulations of the nasal skin, the subcutaneous (underlying) cartilage-and-bone support framework, and the mucous membrane lining. Technically, the plastic surgeon's incisional approach classifies the nasal surgery either as an open <b>rhinoplasty</b> or as a closed <b>rhinoplasty</b> procedure. In open <b>rhinoplasty,</b> the surgeon makes a small, irregular incision to the columella, the fleshy, exterior-end of the nasal septum; this columellar incision is additional to the usual set of incisions for a nasal correction. In closed <b>rhinoplasty,</b> the surgeon performs every procedural incision endonasally (exclusively within the nose), and does not cut the columella.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, rhinoplastic {{technique}} was refined by surgeons {{such as the}} Berlin University professor of surgery Karl Ferdinand von Gräfe (1787–1840), who published Rhinoplastik (Rebuilding the Nose, 1818) wherein he described fifty-five (55) historical plastic surgery procedures (Indian <b>rhinoplasty,</b> Italian <b>rhinoplasty,</b> etc.), and his technically innovative free-graft nasal reconstruction (with a tissue-flap harvested from the patient’s arm), and surgical approaches to eyelid, cleft lip, and cleft palate corrections. Dr. von Gräfe’s protégé, the medical and surgical polymath Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1794–1847), who {{was among the first}} surgeons to anaesthetize the patient before performing the nose surgery, published Die Operative Chirurgie (Operative Surgery, 1845), which became a foundational medical and plastic surgical text. (see strabismus, torticollis) Moreover, the Prussian Jacques Joseph (1865–1934) published Nasenplastik und sonstige Gesichtsplastik (<b>Rhinoplasty</b> and other Facial Plastic Surgeries, 1928), which described refined surgical techniques for performing nose-reduction <b>rhinoplasty</b> via internal incisions.|$|E

40|$|Aim The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to carry out morphometric measurements of the nose, in order to establish norms for the Indonesian as the representation of Asian, specifically for the Deutero Malay sub race. Method A cross sectional study was performed on 126 subjects, recruited from female students of Medical Faculty, the University of Indonesia, Jakarta. Subjects were restricted within Deutero Malay sub race (including ethnic groups of Aceh, Jawa, Sunda, Minangkabau, Riau and Bugis) in 3 generations. Subjects were photographed with digital camera in frontal, left lateral and basal view. Then from the photographs which were stored as JPEG files, linear as well as angular measurements were carried out. Results The intercanthal width is 3. 56 cm ±  0. 27, alar width 4. 14 cm ±  0. 28, length of the nose 4. 0 cm ±  0. 21, pronasion projection 2. 29 cm ±  0. 26 and tip angle 111. 50  ±  4. 4, nasofrontal angle 134. 60  ±  7. 3, nasofacial angle 36. 30  ±  4. 3, nasolabial angle 90. 40  ± 8. 3, and nasion projection 0. 43 cm ±  0. 22.   Conclusions The data collected from this study can be used as norms for Deutero Malay cases and will serve as a guide for quick reference, when planning aesthetic or reconstructive <b>rhinoplasties</b> for the Deutero Malay patient.

40|$|Context: The {{cleft lip}} type nasal {{deformity}} presents {{one of the}} most complex surgical challenges. The long-term postoperative results are still not satisfactory despite an emphasis on primary nasal correction. This is attributed to tissue memory and healing. Nasoalveolar molding is used effectively to reshape the nasal cartilage and to mold the maxillary arch before cleft lip repair. Aims: This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of presurgical nasoalveolar molding in correction of cleft lip nasal deformity for patients with unilateral and bilateral clefts of the lip. Settings and Design: Twenty-three cases of clefts of lip and palate with nasal deformity were subjected to present study from May 2004 to May 2006. These cases were initially treated on outpatient basis, and they were admitted at the time of operation. All of these patients were children of less than 1 year of age, belonging to north Indian population. Material and Methods: Study consisted of patients of cleft lip and palate who were given presurgical nasoalveolar splints at early age. Lip repair was done after at least 2 months of molding. These patients along with control group (without presurgical nasoalveolar molding) were followed up for 1 year. Measurements were taken at different intervals in study over dental cast and on patients. Data obtained from comparison of 2 groups were analyzed using “MSTAT” analysis software (developed by Dr Russel Freed, Professor & Director, Crop & Soil Sciences Department, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan). Results: In our study, we found that nostril height was more in patients of experimental group (P =. 18), while nostril width and alar perimeter were not changed significantly. Children with nasoalveolar molding had significant lengthening of columella (P =. 02). Patients of unilateral cleft lip had more reduction in alveolar gap (P =. 08) than bilateral group (P =. 15). Conclusions: Nasoalveolar molding can be a useful adjunct for treatment of cleft lip nasal deformity. It is a cost-effective technique that can reduce the number of future surgeries such as alveolar bone grafting and secondary <b>rhinoplasties...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{reconstructive}} <b>rhinoplasty,</b> the {{defects and}} deformities that the plastic surgeon encounters, and must restore to normal function, form, and appearance include broken and displaced nasal bones; disrupted and displaced nasal cartilages; a collapsed {{bridge of the}} nose; congenital defect, trauma (blunt, penetrating, blast), autoimmune disorder, cancer, intranasal drug-abuse damages, and failed primary <b>rhinoplasty</b> outcomes. <b>Rhinoplasty</b> reduces bony humps, and re-aligns the nasal bones after they are cut (dissected, resected). When cartilage is disrupted, suturing for re-suspension (structural support), {{or the use of}} cartilage grafts to camouflage a depression allow the re-establishment of the normal nasal contour of the nose for the patient. When the bridge of the nose is collapsed, rib-cartilage, ear-cartilage, or cranial-bone grafts can be used to restore its anatomic integrity, and thus the aesthetic continuity of the nose. For augmenting the nasal dorsum, autologous cartilage and bone grafts are preferred to (artificial) prostheses, because of the reduced incidence of histologic rejection and medical complications.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Freer, in 1902, and Killian, in 1904, {{respectively}} pioneered the Submucous Resection septoplasty (SMR) procedure for correcting a deviated septum; they raised mucoperichondrial tissue flaps, and resected the cartilaginous and bony septum (including the vomer bone and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), maintaining septal support with a 1.0-cm margin at the dorsum and a 1.0-cm margin at the caudad, for which innovations the technique became the foundational, standard septoplastic procedure. In 1921, A. Rethi introduced the open <b>rhinoplasty</b> approach featuring an incision to the columella to facilitate modifying {{the tip of}} the nose. In 1929, Peer and Metzenbaum performed the first manipulation of the caudal septum, where it originates and projects from the forehead. In 1947, Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981) endonasally resolved a septal deviation with a minimalist hemitransfixion incision, which conserved the septum; thus, he advocated for the practical primacy of the closed <b>rhinoplasty</b> approach. In 1957, A. Sercer advocated the “decortication of the nose” (Dekortication des Nase) technique which featured a columellar-incision open <b>rhinoplasty</b> that allowed greater access to the nasal cavity and to the nasal septum.|$|E

25|$|To {{determine}} the patient's suitability for undergoing a <b>rhinoplasty</b> procedure, the surgeon clinically evaluates {{him or her}} with a complete medical history (anamnesis) to determine his or her physical and psychological health. The prospective patient must explain to the physician–surgeon the functional and aesthetic nasal problems {{that he or she}} suffers. The surgeon asks about the ailments' symptoms and their duration, past surgical interventions, allergies, drugs use and drugs abuse (prescription and commercial medications), and a general medical history. Furthermore, additional to physical suitability is psychological suitability—the patient's psychological motive for undergoing nose surgery is critical to the surgeon's pre-operative evaluation of the patient. In the case of men, the surgeon must identify prospective patients presenting the mental traits denoted by the psychiatric acronym SIMON (single, immature, male, over-expectant, and narcissistic), which might indicate a man over-valuing the outcome of a <b>rhinoplasty.</b>|$|E
