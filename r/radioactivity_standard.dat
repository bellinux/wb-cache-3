5000|$|Enforcement of {{drinking}} water standards in small water systems is less consistent than enforcement in large systems. According to a New York Times analysis published in December 2009, more than 20 percent of public water systems in the U.S. providing water to 49 million people violated provisions of the SDWA over the previous five years. Violations involved arsenic, radioactive substances like uranium, tetrachloroethylene, and coliform bacteria. Fewer than 6 {{percent of the public}} water systems that broke the law were ever fined or punished by state or federal officials. According to David Uhlmann, a former Justice Department official, [...] "there is significant reluctance within the EPA and Justice Department to bring actions against municipalities, because there’s a view that they are often cash-strapped, and fines would ultimately be paid by local taxpayers". A longtime EPA enforcement official who was quoted in the report said [...] "The top people want big headlines and million-dollar settlements. That’s not drinking-water cases." [...] In light of this, state regulators have typically opted to provide technical assistance to help systems that violate the rules. However, the availability of aid for some public water systems did not fully close the gap and many systems remain ostensibly out-of-compliance. For over a quarter of systems that violated the arsenic or <b>radioactivity</b> <b>standards</b> in that 2009 analysis, there is no record that they were ever contacted by a regulator.|$|R

In 1924 H. Geiger and A. Werner first introduced the method of coincidence counting to determine the efficiencies of two observers who were counting the number of particles, from a source of radon, striking a zinc-sulfide screen in a given time. This was probably the first association of the coincidence method with scintillation counting and also the first application of coincidence counting. This application was made to give a precise value of the numbers of u particles striking the screen in a given time, whereas, nowadays, the coincidence method is used to determine the efficiencies of detectors, {{and is one of the}} most precise measuring methods in the field of radionuclide metrology. In 1977, the methods of scintillation detection and coincidence counting came together again to achieve a very precise international comparison of radioactivity measurements. In this intercomparison the radio-activity concentrations of split samples of a master solution of 134 CsC 1 were measured at four national laboratories using a liquid-scintillator as the s-particle detector.

40|$|Previous reports {{document}} a short latency {{of cancer}} onset {{in young children}} exposed to low doses of <b>radioactivity.</b> The <b>standard</b> mortality ratio (SMR) for cancer in children dying before age ten rose in the period 6 – 10 years after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents in populations most exposed to fallout. SMRs near most nuclear power plants were elevated 6 – 10 years after startup, particularly for leukemia. Cancer incidence in children under age ten living near New York and New Jersey nuclear plants increased 4 – 5 years after increases in average strontium- 90 in baby teeth, and declined 4 – 5 years after Sr- 90 averages dropped. The assumption that Sr- 90 and childhood cancer are correlated is best supported for a supralinear dose-response, meaning the greatest per-dose risks are at the lowest doses. Findings docu-ment that the very young are especially susceptible to adverse effects of radiation exposure, even at relatively low doses. The latency period between radiation exposure and the onset of cancer has been documented to be as long as several decades. However, some radiation-induced cancer occurs after a much shorter period. Perhaps the first evidence of a short latency was documented in the 1950 s, with high rates of thyroid and other cancers typically within 10 years of X-ray irradiation to infants and young children (1 – 3). Leukemia rates among Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors were elevated beginning 5 years after the 1945 bombings, reaching a peak 10 years after (4 – 6). Adults treated with therapeutic radiation for ankylosing spondylitis demon-strated increases in mortality from leukemia within 2 years, and prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and extracranial tumors, each after 5 years (7).

Cytotoxicity was determined using sensitive (A 2780, FM 3 A/ 0) and resistant (AG 6000, AraC resistant, deoxycytidine kinase deficient; FM 3 A/TK-, 5 FdU resistant, thymidine kinase deficient) cell lines. Circumvention of nucleoside transporter and activating enzymes was determined using specific inhibitors, HPLC analysis and <b>standard</b> <b>radioactivity</b> assays. AraC-L- 5 FdU was active (IC 50 : 0. 03 microM in both A 2780 and FM 3 A/ 0), had some activity in AG 6000 (IC 50 : 0. 28 microM), but no activity in FM 3 A/TK(-) (IC 50 : 18. 3 microM).

It is able to report Total Blood Volume (TBV), Plasma Volume (PV) and Red Cell Volume (RCV) using the indicator dilution principle, microhematocrit centrifugation and the Ideal Height and Weight Method. The indicator or tracer, is an I-131 albumin injection. An equal amount of the tracer is injected into a known and unknown volume. Clinically, the unknown volume is the patient’s blood volume, with the tracer having been injected into the patient’s blood stream and tagged to the blood plasma. Once the tracer is injected a technician takes five blood samples which undergo microhematocrit centrifugation to extrapolate true blood volume at time 0. The concentration of the I-131 in the blood is determined from the blood <b>radioactivity</b> against the <b>standard,</b> which has a known I-131 dilution in a known volume. The unknown volume is inversely proportional to the concentration of the indicator in the known volume; the larger the unknown volume, the lower the tracer concentration, thus the unknown volume can be calculated. The microhematocrit data along with the I-131 indicator data provide a normalized hematocrit number, more accurate than hematocrit or peripheral hematocrit measurements. Measurements are taken 5 times in 6 minute intervals so that the BVA-100 can calculate the albumin transudation time to understand the flux of liquid through capillary membranes.|$|R

Eluted solvents were analyzed via two detectors in series: a UV absorbance detector (Waters 2489) and a radiation detector (Raytest Gabi Star), which were connected to a chromatography data integration system (PeakSimple, using PeakSimple data analysis software, version 4.44). Using mobile solvent A (1 % CH 3 CN/H 2 O[*]+[*] 0.1 % TFA, 1 or 2 [*]mL/minute), samples were loaded onto an in-line refillable capture column (hand-packed with 20 [*]mg of Oasis HLB polymeric reverse phase sorbent) fitted with 2.5 [*]μm frits. The elution of biological macromolecules was monitored by UV absorbance (254 [*]nm) and radioactivity. When the UV signal returned to baseline, the solvent flow was switched to elute the capture column loaded sample onto the analytical column (Phenomenex Luna C 18, 250 [*]×[*] 4.6 [*]mm, 10 [*]μm) using mobile Solvent B (65 % CH 3 CN/H 2 O[*]+[*] 0.1 % TFA, 2 [*]mL/minute flow rate).

Although the liposomal formulation was less active than ETC-L-FdUrd in FM 3 A/ 0 cells (IC 50 : 19. 3  nM), resistance due to thymidine kinase (TK) deficiency was greatly reduced. The prodrugs inhibited thymidylate synthase (TS) in FM 3 A/ 0 cells (80 – 90 %), but to a lower extent in FM 3 A/TK− (10 – 50 %). FdUMP was hardly detected in FM 3 A/TK− cells.

II 304 / 2001) which implements exactly the European Drinking Water Directive 98 / 83 /EC. The minimum requirements {{on the quality of}} drinking water and water intended for human consumption are appointed in it. For <b>radioactivity</b> two indicative <b>standard</b> parameter limits are established ¿ tritium activity concentration of 100 Bq/l and total indicative dose TID (effective dose from radionuclides in drinking water except 3 H, 40 K, radon and radon progenies) of 0. 1 mSv/a. The appointment and the evaluation of the TID are specified in the Austrian Standard OENORM S 5251 : 2005. Generally only the radionuclides 226 Ra and 228 Ra, dose conversion factors for adults and a yearly water consumption of 730 l are taken into account for dose calculation. In the paper the estimation of the TID according to the drinking water directive and the OENORM standard is compared to dose estimations for other age groups and other nuclides based on measurements carried out in Upper Austria. The dose contributions of 210 Po and 210 Pb clearly preponderate the dose contributions of the radium isotopes. An alternative model for dose estimations has been developed, which takes into account a daily water intake and a continuous excretion of activity from the body. The presented dose assessment clearly yields lower annual effective doses for the population. Present regulations and guidelines for drinking water monitoring and surveillance are discussed and evaluated with regard to the results of this study.

Venous blood was withdrawn when the dose was given (to serve as a blank) and exactly 60 min later, and the counts were determined in a liquid scintillation counter.

This latter relationship then was used to correct the plasma <b>radioactivity</b> to a <b>standard</b> body weight of 65 kg, in which the volume of distribution of the dose was assumed to be 10 liters.

RESULTS: In the 100 volunteers, the mean value of the radiocalcium absorption rate (termed alpha 2, to distinguish it from our original calculation) was 0. 75 /hr, with 98 of the 100 values falling between 0. 30 and 1. 20. The value alpha 2 was significantly related to serum calcitriol in these 100 volunteers (r = 0. 29; p = 0. 003) and in 89 normal postmenopausal women (r = 0. 46; p < 0. 001). It also was significantly related to the 24 -hr urine calcium in the same 89 women (r = 0. 48; p < 0. 001) and to net calcium absorption corrected for intake in balance studies on another 103 postmenopausal women (r = 0. 44; p < 0. 001).
