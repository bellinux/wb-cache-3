5|$|The building, {{designed}} by James Lewis was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital {{which had been}} vacated following the hospital's relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by Lord Rothermere, who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely {{in order to provide}} a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, after Lord Rothermere's mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as '...a fine building, <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear'. The 'distinguishing dome' was added by Sydney Smirke in 1846 and housed the hospital's chapel. The museum was reopened by the Duke of York (later King George VI) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936.|$|E

Joshua Topolsky of Engadget said that [...] "for {{those of you}} who haven't yet made the leap, feel free {{to take a deep breath}} and dive in – the iPad 2 is as good as it gets right now.

500|$|The {{development}} of the graphics in Mysteries of the Sith {{was seen as an}} improvement with particular praise for the new colored lighting effects. However, not all new graphical developments were well received and some reviews highlighted that smoke effects from the carbonite weapon are particularly poor. Ryan criticized the whole graphical implementation of the weapon: [...] "The Carbonite gun was a long awaited weapon, but the effects and the resulting graphic for frozen foes are <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> bad." ...|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "Widmerpool" [...] {{was assumed}} by many critics {{to derive from}} Widmerpool a Nottinghamshire village. In a 1978 interview, Powell said he first came across the name in a 17th-century book, Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson, which {{features}} a Captain of Horse, Major Joseph Widmerpoole, who served in Cromwell's army under John Hutchinson during the English Civil War. Powell viewed this Widmerpoole as a mean-spirited and disagreeable character and [...] "had his name down for <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> a long time as a name I was going to use".|$|E
500|$|Coward {{continued}} to perform {{during most of}} the First World War, appearing at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in 1916 in The Happy Family and on tour with Amy Brandon Thomas's company in Charley's Aunt. In 1917, he appeared in The Saving Grace, a comedy produced by Hawtrey. Coward recalled in his memoirs, [...] "My part was reasonably large and I was <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> good in it, owing to the kindness and care of Hawtrey's direction. He took endless trouble with me... and taught me during those two short weeks many technical points of comedy acting which I use to this day." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{nominated}} {{in the category}} Best Original Song at the 51st Golden Globe Awards. In 2005, Bono said [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was [...] "perhaps the greatest U2 song," [...] saying it has the [...] "most extraordinary contour of a melody. It's <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> sophisticated. The lyric never misses," [...] and noting that they had [...] "never turned 'Stay' into the single it deserved to be." [...] He named {{it as one of}} his two favourite U2 songs, along with [...] "Please." [...] The Edge called it [...] "the stand-out track on the record." [...] Wenders described it as one of his favourite U2 songs.|$|E

500|$|Adult {{entertainment}} attorney Robert Apgood stated {{he agreed}} with the actions of Acworth and Randazza. Apgood pointed out he had observed {{a significant increase in}} applications to the USPTO that were rejected because their potential trademarks were deemed [...] "scandalous" [...] by the government. He stated, [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> unfortunate that the executive branch is now reaching deep into the machinations of government to further its 'legislation of morality' agenda. It is truly encouraging to see the likes of Acworth and Randazza take up this sorely needed fight." [...] The appeal was denied in April 2008 and the case was terminated. The application status was last listed as [...] "abandoned" [...] for failure to respond by the appealing party.|$|E

"It {{starts off}} {{with a bit of}} {{keyboards}} that lead to a series of rapid but somewhat quiet beats over which she sings softly, almost whispering, until she reaches the chorus and fulminating beats drop. [...] "What is life?" [...] she asks during the bilingual chorus, which simply ends with the word [...] "contrail." [...] After the chorus the beats quiet down again and she once again whisper-sings. It's <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> intoxicating, the way her airy vocals gently glide over the hypnotic but subtle beats. [...] "I didn't know then, what I know now," [...] a loud, robotic voice sings -- well, it's more like it just says the words about two thirds into the song. And that somehow makes it more intense when Namie sings the chorus again and asks [...] "What is life?" ...|$|E
500|$|Streep {{appeared}} with Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Winona Ryder in The House of the Spirits (1993), set during the military dictatorship of Chile. The film {{was not well}} received by critics. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote: [...] "This is <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> an achievement. It brings together Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Winona Ryder, Antonio Banderas, and Vanessa Redgrave and insures that, without exception, they all give their worst performances ever". The following year, Streep featured in The River Wild, {{as the mother of}} children on a whitewater rafting trip who encounter two violent criminals (Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly) in the wilderness. Though critical reaction was generally mixed, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone found her to be [...] "strong, sassy and looser than she has ever been onscreen".|$|E

500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|... 'Fly Like A Bird', is a kitchen-sink, hyper-produced gospel number, but is <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> moving. There is a real, human {{yearning for}} mercy in it — Mariah’s true {{cry for help}} from a place of near-suicidal despair: 'Sometimes this life can be so cold /(Lord) I pray you'll come and [...] carry me home'. But there’s {{a lot of hope}} and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, a firm grip on the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E
500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made me feel that I have known this man all my life and that I have never met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the election, Ann Romney {{received}} {{an offer to}} appear on the spring 2013 season of Dancing with the Stars, but although she was a fan of the show, she declined: [...] "I would've loved to have done it, and I am turning 64, and I started thinking about it. I'm not really as flexible as I should be." [...] She still mourned the election loss, perhaps more than her husband did. [...] In a late February 2013 interview, she said, [...] "And you know, the other part of it was an amazing thing, and it was <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of – {{a lot of people around}} us and all of a sudden, it was nothing," [...] then adding, [...] "But the good news is we like each other." [...] In October 2013, she published, and made promotional appearances for, The Romney Family Table: Sharing Home-Cooked Recipes & Favorite Traditions, a cookbook that made the New York Times Best Seller list.|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, {{following}} {{the hiring of}} former General Hospital executive producer Jill Farren Phelps onto the series, Francis was let go from the soap opera due to budgetary cuts from Sony Pictures Television and CBS. Phelps had previously stated {{that there would be}} cast changes to the series due to monetary reasons. When asked specifically about reports indicating Francis' dismissal, she said: [...] "Genie and I had a wonderful talk when I came to Y and I think we're <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> fond of each other. She's a magnificent actress." [...] Despite confirmations that the actress' dismissal was due to budgetary reasons, Jillian Bowe of Zap2it reported a rumor that [...] "the veteran's tenure on the show wasn't well-received by the brass at CBS and Sony". Sara Bibel of Xfinity reported another rumor about her dismissal, saying it was [...] "no secret" [...] that Francis and Phelps [...] "did not get along" [...] while both worked on General Hospital, and that [...] "few are surprised that the two were not eager to work together again".|$|E
500|$|Speaking to {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy about Sarah and Zoe's relationship, Lister explained: [...] "I don't {{think they do}} have feelings for each other in that way. Last year happened and Zoe put it down to history and experience — {{one of those things}} that teenagers get up to occasionally and she was quite happy to leave it there. They've got through a lot and their relationship is <b>really</b> <b>quite</b> special. There's a lot of love there but Zoe's not got anything sexual for Sarah — it's purely a deep friendship." [...] Meanwhile, Batley said: [...] "I think that for Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had — a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's always been there for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more — she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well." ...|$|E
