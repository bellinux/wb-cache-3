40|$|Ceramics can be defmed as a {{material}} consisting of hard brittle properties produced from inorganic and nonmetallic minerals made by firing at high temperatures. These materials are compounds between metallic and nonmetallic elements and are either totally ionic, or predominately ionic but having some covalent character. This definition {{allows for a}} large range of materials, not all applicable to refractory applications. As this report is focused on potential ceramic materials for high temperature, aggressive exposure applications, the ceramics reviewed {{as part of this}} report will focus on <b>refractory</b> <b>ceramics</b> specifically designed and used for these applications. Ceramic materials consist {{of a wide variety of}} products. Callister (2000) 1 characterized ceramic materials into six classifications: glasses, clay products, refractories, cements, abrasives, and advanced ceramics. Figure 1 shows this classification system. This review will focus mainly on <b>refractory</b> <b>ceramics</b> and cements as in general, the other classifications are neither applicable nor economical for use in large structures such as the flame trench. Although much work has been done in advanced ceramics over the past decade or so, these materials are likely cost prohibitive and would have to be fabricated off-site, transported to the NASA facilities, and installed, which make these even less feasible.

A review is in progress on materials and systems for prefabricated refractory ceramic panels, but this review is focusing more on typical refractory materials for prefabricated systems, which could make the system more economically feasible. <b>Refractory</b> <b>ceramics</b> are used for a wide variety of applications.

Note that the exposure temperatures for <b>refractory</b> <b>ceramics</b> are very similar to the exposure conditions for specialty ceramics (rocket nozzles, space vehicle re-entry fields, etc.) and yet the life expectancy or requirement is relatively low. Currently NASA is repairing the refractory lining in the flame trench after every launch - although this is not a direct indication of low life expectancy, it does indicate that the current system may not be sufficiently durable to maximize economy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dry {{grinding}} of pyrophyllite (Hillsboro, USA) {{has been}} studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), specific surface area measurements (BET) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At the beginning ofthe grinding process, ome ffects such as delamination, gliding and folding of the layers, and decrease in particle size were detected by SEM and XRD, resulting ina large increase inspecific surface area, up {{to a maximum of}} ~ 60 m 2. g- 1. Marked changes inthe structure take place between 30 and 32 mins grinding. Longer grinding times increase the degree of disorder and SEM and specific surface area data suggest that aggregation ccurs. XRD results indicate that some residual order persists in the degraded structure. Pyrophyllite isa relatively rare mineral and has scarcely been studied until quite recently. For this reason, it has generally been overlooked in commercial circles, but its high alumina content and physico-chemical properties make it useful in many industries, principally in <b>refractories,</b> <b>ceramics</b> and sundry uses (Harben, 1981).

40|$|The {{degradation}} of <b>refractory</b> <b>ceramics,</b> used to contain and thermally insulate molten aluminum, in many aluminum processing operations, decreases {{the efficiency of}} aluminum production. The decreased efficiency results from {{the erosion of the}} refractory ceramic by molten aluminum, which increases thermal losses, and, eventually leads to the stoppage of production when the refractory is replaced. There are two primary modes of refractory degradation; chemical reaction and infiltration. Chemical reaction leads to a steady decrease in the amount of refractory material. To study this phenomenon, tests were performed in which ceramic substrates were immersed in molten metals and the subsequent microstructural evolution was analyzed. Using thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanical considerations, the critical factors which govern the rate of reaction were identified. From these investigations, a model was developed to determine the equilibrium interfacial composition, and the rate of oxide dissolution. Also, the importance of the Pilling-Bedworth ratio, the ratio of reaction product to reactant molar volume, in the development of <b>refractory</b> <b>ceramics</b> which are resistant to chemical attack was demonstrated. Molten metal infiltration into the cracks and pores in refractory ceramic materials is the second mode of degradation. The infiltration of cracks with metal can lead to further cracking upon thermal cycling, and, if widespread infiltration occurs, the rate of degradation can be rapid. Two experimental methodologies were used to investigate the tendency for molten metals to infiltrate cracks. First, the classic sessile drop method was used to investigate several model metal-oxide systems, to determine the factors which affect the wetting and infiltration behavior of molten metals. Using these results, several parameters which can affect infiltration behavior were identified. Secondly, a new experimental method was developed, the dynamic capillary displacement method, to directly study the infiltration behavior of molten aluminum in <b>refractory</b> <b>ceramics.</b> The contact angles, calculated from the infiltration behavior of aluminum into alumina capillaries, are in good agreement with the contact angles reported in the literature, determined by other methodologies. Combining the investigation of the chemical reactions with the infiltration investigation, a framework was developed for the mechanisms by which molten metals degrade ceramics...|$|E

Determination of both apparent/measured and true thermophysical properties is discussed taking into account combined heat and mass transfer, latent heat effects during chemical and physical transformations, as well as structural changes. The approaches to the solution of these problems are demonstrated for a number of different classes of materials: Industrial <b>refractories,</b> <b>ceramics,</b> highly porous insulation; Moist materials and materials undergoing phase, chemical and structural transformations; Materials semitransparent for heat radiation. The approaches being used in the development of a thermophysical properties database consist in a combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The analysis, generalization, and extrapolation of available reference data can be conducted based on the models for classical (conduction, heat radiation, gas convection) and additional (novel) mechanisms and processes affecting the apparent thermophysical properties. The novel heat transfer mechanisms include: Heterogeneous heat and mass transfer processes occurring in pores existing at grain boundaries and in cracks, in particular, surface segregation and diffusion of impurities on pore surfaces and transport of gases produced from chemical reactions, evaporation, and sublimation. Microstructure changes due to non-uniform thermal expansion of particles and grains. These changes are caused by the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients of different phases in the material and anisotropic thermal expansion of crystals...|$|R

They found that TiO 2 NPs could translocate into cells and showed potential cell damage due to different physicochemical characteristics [20, 21]. Meanwhile, the toxicological data for ZrO 2 NPs was lacking. In our study, we regarded TiO 2 NPs as the control group and explored the toxicological effects of TiO 2 and ZrO 2 NPs on 3 T 3 -E 1 cells. Physicochemical properties of NPs, especially size and morphology, have been known to effectively impact biosafety. Some studies have shown that nanoscaled particles were significantly more toxic than microscaled particles [22, 23]. In most cases, particle morphology was also reported to affect the toxicity [24 – 26]. In our study, we showed that TiO 2 and ZrO 2 NPs were rod-shaped spheres. Compared with previous reports [5, 27, 28], our TiO 2 and ZrO 2 NPs had a relatively weaker agglomeration effect in water where the particles enlarged to 81.2 and 93.1  nm in size, while we also could observe some microscale materials in culture medium after NP exposure with concentration-dependent manner, which confirm the agglomeration effect in this study even after using ultrasonic dispersion technology. However, the agglomeration effect could not inhibit the NP translocation into the cytoplasm, due to potent NPs were detected in intracellular vesicles.
