R. Wang, D. Ramos, J. Fiérrez, "Latent-to-full palmprint comparison based on <b>radial</b> <b>triangulation</b> under forensic conditions" in International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB), Washington, D. C. (USA), 2011, 1 - 6. In forensic applications the evidential value of palmprints is obvious according to surveys of law enforcement agencies which indicate that 30 percent of the latents recovered from crime scenes are from palms. Consequently, developing forensic automatic palmprint identification technology is an urgent and challenging task which deals with latent (i. e., partial) and full palmprints captured or recovered at 500 ppi at least (the current standard in forensic applications) for minutiae-based offline recognition. Moreover, a rigorous quantification of the evidential value of biometrics, such as fingerprints and palmprints, is essential in modern forensic science. Recently, <b>radial</b> <b>triangulation</b> has been proposed as a step towards this objective in fingerprints, using minutiae manually extracted by experts. In this work we help in automatizing such comparison strategy, and generalize it to palmprints. Firstly, palmprint segmentation and enhancement are implemented for full prints feature extraction by a commercial biometric SDK in an automatic way, while features of latent prints are manually extracted by forensic experts. Then a latent-to-full palmprint comparison algorithm based on <b>radial</b> <b>triangulation</b> is proposed, in which <b>radial</b> <b>triangulation</b> is utilized for minutiae modeling. Finally, 22 latent palmprints from real forensic cases and 8680 full palmprints from criminal investigation field are used for performance evaluation. Experimental results proof the usability and efficiency of the proposed system, i. e, rank-l identification rate of 62 % is achieved despite the inherent difficulty of latent-to-full palmprint comparison. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) under grant agreement number 23880...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{multiannual}} {{series of}} high-resolution small-format aerial digital photography {{was employed to}} assess changes in the forest canopy density in a temperate forest. A combination of conventional and adapted techniques of photogrammetry and photo interpretation was used, establishing a specific method. This method has been proved in a twelve-year period (1999 - 2011) in the core zone of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, in the states of Mexico and Michoacán, in Mexico, employing orthorectified mosaics as base maps to evaluate biennial changes. Photographs were assessed through traditional photointerpretation marking changes on acetates, located over the paper prints, creating new polygons. These were transferred to the orthomosaic directly through the computer screen using the acetates and at least three control points, complying with the principle of <b>radial</b> <b>triangulation.</b> Forest was separated into the following canopy density classes: closed, semi-closed, semi-open, open, and deforested. Accuracy assessment in forest canopy density classification was estimated by field sampling, and employing error matrices being 95 %. Since 2003, this method {{has been used to}} determine appropriate payment for environmental services. This payment together with an intense interaction with the communities has led to a reduction in forest degradation and deforestation in the core zone...|$|E
40|$|Forensic palmprint recognition, which mainly {{deals with}} {{high-resolution}} palmprints and latent-to-full palmprint comparison, has aroused research highlights {{because of the}} increased use of the evidence of palmprints in forensics. There are some in-depth works on high-resolution palmprint preprocessing (i. e., segmentation and enhancement) and feature extraction. However, few works on latent-to-full palmprint comparison have been done. Recently, radial triangulation-based latent-to-full palmprint comparison algorithm was proposed as it has been proposed for forensic likelihood ratio computation using fingerprints, and proved to have identification usability and efficiency for palmprint comparison. In this work, we generalize point pattern comparison by relaxation to minutiae-based palmprint recognition and improve the latent-to-full palmprint comparison algorithm based on <b>radial</b> <b>triangulation.</b> Firstly, local minutiae comparison is modified according to novel point pattern comparison method and global minutiae comparison is based on centroid distribution. Then logistic regression learning is used for comparison score computation. Performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on forensic databases including 22 latent palmprints from real cases and 8680 full palmprints from criminal investigation field. Experimental results show the improvement on identification accuracy and efficiency of our approach. A rank- 1 identification rate of 69 % is achieved, compared with 63 % of previous radial triangulation-based. 1...|$|E
50|$|After Atkov's time in space, he {{dedicated}} most of {{his work}} towards the Russian railways and cardiology. Within the cardiology field, Atkov {{has been a part}} of 15 major projects that has helped advance the types of technology in cardiology research. He also holds several patents for inventions he produced or helped develop. One of his major inventions was a device for positioning a cardiograph sensor. This invention had seven other cardiology specialist involved. The main objective was to create something that could hold and maneuver an Echocardiograph and an Electrocardiograph at the same time while not being in the way of physicians. This device has paved the way towards greater and more advanced technology for better ultrasound techniques. Another notable invention was the Photogrammetrical plotting projector apparatus for <b>radial</b> nadir point <b>triangulation.</b> This invention was to make sure that a Photogrammetrical plotting projector could take what images it needs at the correct angles and explore new angles that images could be taken from. This device helped physicians and patients take difficult images that may not have been possible before. Attkov was not the patent holder for this device but he was the head for the design and prototype. Atkov {{has been a part of}} many other cardiology technology developments but most were small or did not impact the cardiology field as much as the device for positioning a cardiograph sensor or the Photogrammetrical plotting projector apparatus for <b>radial</b> nadir point <b>triangulation.</b>|$|R
