40|$|Introduction of <b>reporter</b> <b>groups</b> at {{designed}} RNA {{sites is}} a widely accepted approach to gain information about the molecular environment of RNAs in their complexes with other biopolymers formed during various cellular processes. A general approach to obtain RNAs bearing diverse <b>reporter</b> <b>groups</b> at designed locations is based on site-specific insertion of groups containing primary aliphatic amine functions (amino linkers) with their subsequent selective derivatization by appropriate chemicals. This article is a brief review on methods for site-specific introduction of amino linkers in different RNAs. These methods comprise: (i) incorporation of a nucleoside carrying an amino-linker or a function that can be substituted with it into oligoribonucleotides {{in the course of}} their chemical synthesis; (ii) assembly of amino linker-containing RNAs from short synthetic fragments via their ligation; (iii) synthesis of amino linker-modified RNAs using T 7 RNA polymerase; (iv) insertion of amino linkers into unmodified RNAs at functional groups of a certain type such as the 5 &# 039;-phosphates and N 7 of guanosine residues and (v) introduction of an amino linker into long highly structured RNAs exploiting an approach based on sequence-specific modification of nucleic acids.

40|$|Ultrafast {{spectroscopy}} {{was used}} to study vibrational energy transfer between vibrational <b>reporter</b> <b>groups</b> on different parts of a molecule in a liquid.

This review describes the development of metal-based receptors with regard to their anion-sensing properties, and is therefore divided into sections on electrochemical and optical anion sensing. Within these sections coverage has been given to the diverse range of metals and anion-binding groups that have been studied. Emphasis has been placed on recently described novel supramolecular, nanoscale and surface confined anion receptor systems that give added functionality.

5000|$|Building {{upon this}} finding, Westheimer et al. {{directly}} measured the pKa of Lys115 {{in the active}} site using 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde (5-NSA) [...] Reaction of 5-NSA with acetoacetate decarboxylase and subsequent reduction of the resulting Schiff base with sodium borohydride led to the incorporation of a 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzylamino reporter molecule in the active site (Figure 2). Titration of the enzyme with this attached <b>reporter</b> <b>group</b> revealed that the pKa of Lys115 is decreased to 5.9 in the active site. These results were {{the basis for the}} proposal that the perturbation in the pKa of Lys115 was due to its proximity to the positively charged ε-ammonium group of Lys116 in the active site. A nearby positive charge could cause unfavorable electrostatic repulsions that weaken the N-H bond of Lys115. Westheimer et al.'s proposal was further supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies. When Lys116 was mutated to cysteine or asparagine, the pKa of Lys115 was found to be significantly elevated to over 9.2, indicating that positively charged Lys116 plays a critical role in determining the pKa of Lys115. Although a crystal structure was not yet solved to provide structural evidence, this proposal was widely accepted and cited as a textbook example of how the active site can be precisely organized to perturb a pKa and affect reactivity.|$|E

40|$|A key {{advantage}} of nanomaterials for biomedical applications is {{their ability to}} feature multiple small <b>reporter</b> <b>groups</b> (multimodality), or combinations of <b>reporter</b> <b>groups</b> and therapeutic agents (multifunctionality), while being targeted to cell surface receptors. Here a facile combination of techniques for the syntheses of multimodal, targeted nanoparticles (NPs) is presented, whereby heat-induced-radiolabeling (HIR) labels NPs with radiometals and so-called click chemistry is used to attach bioactive groups to the NP surface. Click-reactive alkyne or azide groups were first attached to the nonradioactive clinical Feraheme (FH) NPs. Resulting "Alkyne-FH" and "Azide-FH" intermediates, like the parent NP, tolerated 89 Zr labeling by the HIR method previously described. Subsequently, biomolecules were quickly conjugated to the radioactive NPs by either copper-catalyzed or copper-free click reactions with high efficiency. Synthesis of the Alkyne-FH or Azide-FH intermediates, followed by HIR and then by click reactions for biomolecule attachment, provides a simple and potentially general path for the synthesis of multimodal, multifunctional, and targeted NPs for biomedical applications...|$|R

Phosphinimines, R₃P=NSiMe₃, undergo hydrolysis to form the phosphiniminiumcation, R₃P=NH₂+, which forms the ion pair [R₃P=NH₂+][X-] in the presence of an anion. Preliminary studies show that in the presence of TcO₄-, Ph₃P=NSiMe₃ forms [Ph₃P=NH₂+][TcO₄-] and [Ph₃P=NH₂+] is selective for TcO₄- over other anions. Technetium- 99 is present as environmental contamination in the form of ⁹⁹TcO₄-, which is extremely mobile. Currently available methods to measure this contamination are time consuming and tedious. A method to preconcentrate and measure ⁹⁹Tc environmental contamination in a quick and efficient manner is needed. The selectivity of the phosphiniminium cation for TcO₄- may make phosphinimines suitable for such preconcentration and possibly for measurement. Several phosphinimines were synthesized and characterized for their stability and selectivity with ⁹⁹TcO₄-, including Ph₃P=NSiMe₃, (9 -anthracenyl) Ph₂P=NSiMe₃, (1 -napthyl) Ph₂P=NSiMe₃, and (p-COOMe) C₆H₄Ph₂P=NSiMe₃.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{lanthanides}} and their luminescent properties, concentrating in particular on sensitized emission {{and the use}} of lanthanide chelates as <b>reporter</b> <b>groups</b> in assays, will be presented. Assays of the format where a target (analyte) uniquely and selectively complexes with a labelled probe (reagent) is discussed. The labelling of probes with efficient luminescent <b>reporter</b> <b>groups</b> or radioisotopes is also highlighted, this allows for the accurate determination of the concentration of target - probe conjugate. These types of assay systems can be categorized into two classes, homogeneous and heterogeneous assays. The specific application of both formats in nucleic acid assays are discussed. Most assay systems are of the heterogeneous type which tend to be complicated and error prone, thus the need for homogeneous methods will be stressed. The development of these systems, their current application to DNA assays and, more specifically, in the detection of nucleotide base sequences using lanthanide chelates as <b>reporter</b> <b>groups</b> is reviewed. The synthesis of two novel intercalator probes, their derivatives based on the known sensitizer ligand PDCA (1, 10 -phenanthroline- 2, 9 -dicarboxylic acid) and their luminescent complexes are presented. A novel homogeneous assay for the detection of the point mutation which occurs in the DNA of Cystic Fibrosis sufferers is also presented.
