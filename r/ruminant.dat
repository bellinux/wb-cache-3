The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin B.|$|E

The present study was carried out to investigate risk factors of PPRV in domestic small <b>ruminants</b> which {{were present in the}} vicinity of wildlife parks. A total of 265 sera samples (27 wild <b>ruminants</b> and 238 domesticated small <b>ruminants)</b> from apparently healthy animals from two different wildlife parks were collected and analysed for PPRV antibodies. Also, 20 nasal swabs from domestic small <b>ruminants</b> showing respiratory signs were collected to check for presence of PPRV antigen. Competitive ELISA revealed highest proportions of anti-PPRV antibodies in domestic small <b>ruminants</b> around the Wildlife Park at Lahore (35 %) as compared to Faisalabad (13 %), with no existence of PPRV antibodies in tested serum of wild <b>ruminants</b> at these parks. Higher seropositivity was observed in females (25. 6 %) than in males (5. 1 %) and in goats (34. 5 %) compared to sheep (11. 2 %). The results of N-gene based RT-PCR highlight the absence of PPRV due to lack of current PPR outbreak in the region during study period. Even though grazing was not a significant risk factor, there is still a possibility of wildlife-livestock interactions for feed and water reservoirs, resulting in spillover of PPR to wildlife. Keeping in view the high seropositivity and risk of PPR, vaccination should be adopted to avoid circulation of PPRV among wild and domestic small <b>ruminants</b> (sheep and goats) ...|$|R

5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a <b>ruminant,</b> the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and <b>ruminant</b> guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E
40|$|G duodenalis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common parasites found in <b>ruminants.</b> Most if not all <b>ruminants</b> become {{infected}} with G duodenalis at some point in their first few months of life. Giardiasis is chronic in <b>ruminants,</b> and, although it does not result in severe clinical signs, it does cause intestinal pathologic conditions that may result in malabsorption. Thus, giardiasis may be a production-limiting disease of <b>ruminants.</b> Studies employing molecular techniques demonstrate that the vast majority of <b>ruminants</b> are infected by a livestock-specific genotype of G duodenalis. Hence, although <b>ruminants</b> may serve as a potential reservoir for giardiasis in humans, they pose much less of a risk than was previously thought. C parvum remains an important cause of diarrhea in neonatal <b>ruminants.</b> Still, no treatment exists for cryptosporidiosis in North America. Recent research indicates that the parasite is much more common and important in dairy calves than in beef calves, and only young <b>ruminants,</b> generally less than 1 month of age, are infected with C parvum. Thus the zoonotic risk associated with C parvum infections in <b>ruminants</b> is limited to young animals and is easily managed. Less understood than intestinal cryptosporidiosis, abomasal cryptosporidiosis, caused by C andersoni, is an emerging disease in cattle that may have a significant impact on production in both beef and dairy cattle. In general, C andersoni infections are not common in cattle, but the prevalence can be high in some herds, and infections last months or even years.

40|$|Abstract The mean {{retention}} times (MRT) of solute or {{particles in the}} gastrointestinal tract and the forestomach (FS) are crucial determinants of digestive physiology in herbivores. Besides <b>ruminants,</b> camelids are the only herbivores that have evolved rumination as an obligatory physiological process consisting of repeated mastication of large food particles, which requires a particle sorting mechanism in the FS. Differences between camelids and <b>ruminants</b> have hardly been investigated so far. In this study we measured MRTs of solute and differently sized particles (2, 10, and 20 mm) and the ratio of large-to-small particle MRT, i. e. the selectivity factors (SF 10 / 2 mm, SF 20 / 2 mm, SF 20 / 10 mm), in three camelid species: alpacas (Vicugna pacos), llamas (Llama glama), and Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus). The camelid data were compared with literature data from <b>ruminants</b> and non-ruminant foregut fermenters (NRFF). Camelids and <b>ruminants</b> both had higher SF 10 / 2 mmFS than NRFF, suggesting convergence in {{the function of the}} FS sorting mechanism in contrast to NRFF, in which such a sorting mechanism is absent. The SF 20 / 10 mmFS did not differ between <b>ruminants</b> and camelids, indicating that there is a particle size threshold of about 1 cm in both suborders above which particle retention is not increased. Camelids did not differ from <b>ruminants</b> in MRT 2 mmFS, MRTsoluteFS, and the ratio MRT 2 mmFS/MRTsoluteFS, but they were more similar to ‘cattle-’ than to ‘moose-type’ <b>ruminants.</b> Camelids had higher SF 10 / 2 mmFS and higher SF 20 / 2 mmFS than <b>ruminants,</b> indicating a potentially slower particle sorting in camelids than in <b>ruminants,</b> with larger particles being retained longer in relation to small particles...|$|R
