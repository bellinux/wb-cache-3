5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{a fossil}} <b>rodent</b> from the Miocene of the United States, the only {{species in the}} genus Apeomyoides. It is known from fragmentary jaws and {{isolated}} teeth from a site in the early Barstovian, around 15–16 million years ago, of Nevada. Together with other species from scattered localities in the United States, Japan, and Europe, Apeomyoides is classified in the subfamily Apeomyinae of the extinct <b>rodent</b> family Eomyidae. Apeomyines are a rare but widespread group {{that may have been}} adapted to a relatively dry habitat.|$|E
5|$|Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis is an extinct <b>rodent</b> from northwestern Madagascar.

First described in 2010, it {{is placed in the}} genus Brachytarsomys together with two larger living species, which may differ in some details of molar morphology. The presence of B.mahajambaensis, a rare element in the local <b>rodent</b> fauna, suggests that the region was previously more humid.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, another <b>rodent</b> {{from the}} same group was described: Noronhomys, a {{recently}} extinct species from the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha. Michael Carleton and Storrs Olson, who described the animal, argued that Holochilus primigenus was probably outside the clade of Noronhomys and extant Holochilus and that H.primigenus should probably be excluded from the genus. When Ulyses Pardiñas described another extinct <b>rodent</b> from this group, Carletonomys from the Pleistocene of Argentina, he suggested that H. primigenus should be placed in its own genus because of its mosaic of Holochilus- and Lundomys-like features.|$|E

40|$|Reconstructing {{the body}} mass of a fossil animal is an {{essential}} step toward understanding its palaeoecological role. Length × width (L×W) of the first lower molar (m 1) is frequently used {{as a proxy for}} body mass in fossil mammals. However, among <b>rodents,</b> Muroidea have no premolar and an elongated m 1, whereas other groups have a premolar and a m 1 that is not elongated. This leads to an overestimation of body mass in muroids and/or an underestimation in other <b>rodents.</b> To solve this problem we assembled data of upper and lower tooth row length and body mass in extant <b>rodents,</b> and calculated regression equations for all <b>rodents,</b> <b>rodents</b> with premolars, <b>rodents</b> without premolars and for taxonomic groups at superfamily or family level.

40|$|<b>Rodents</b> {{comprise}} more species {{than any}} other mammal order. Most <b>rodents</b> are considered keystone species in their ecological communities, hence the survival of many other species in the ecosystem depend on them. From medical point of view, this is particularly important for rodent-dependent pathogens. In the particular case of tick-borne diseases, <b>rodents</b> are important as hosts for vector ticks and as reservoir hosts (Lyme borreliosis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Tick-borne relapsing fevers, tick-borne rickettsioses, babesiosis). Community and population ecology of <b>rodents</b> was shown to be correlated with disease ecology {{in the case of}} many tick-borne diseases. In Eastern Europe, several adult hard-tick species use <b>rodents</b> as their principal hosts: Ixodes apronophorus, I. crenulatus, I. laguri, I. redikorzevi, I. trianguliceps. However, the majority of ticks feeding on <b>rodents</b> are immature stages of ticks which as adults are parasitic on larger mammals. Larvae and nymphs of I. ricinus, the most abundant and medically important tick from Europe, are commonly found on <b>rodents.</b> This is particularly important, as many <b>rodents</b> are synanthropic and, together with other micromammals and birds are often the only available natural hosts for ticks in urban environments.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Hemorrhagic fever with renal {{syndrome}} (HFRS) is a rodent-borne {{zoonotic disease}} caused by hantavirus infection. Many HFRS {{cases have been}} reported in East Asia and North Europe, while the situation in Southeast Asia remains unclear. In this study, the prevalence of hantavirus infection in <b>rodents</b> and humans in Thousand Islands regency, which is close to the port of Jakarta, one of the largest historic ports in Indonesia, was investigated. A total of 170 <b>rodents</b> were captured in 2005, and 27 (15. 9 %) of the <b>rodents</b> were antibody-positive against Hantaan virus antigen in an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blotting. Despite the high prevalence in <b>rodents,</b> human sera collected from 31 patients with fever of unknown origin and 20 healthy volunteers in the islands in 2009 did not show positive reaction to the antigen in IFA.

40|$|The role of <b>rodents</b> in the {{regeneration}} {{of forest}} ecosystems. A review. Introduction. Seed dispersal {{is a key}} interaction influencing a number of ecological processes {{that are important to}} the maintenance of diversity in forest ecosystems. <b>Rodents,</b> mainly considered as seed predators, can carry, hide and discard seeds, often transporting them over considerable distances from the parent tree and thus leading to an enhanced germination rate. The role of <b>rodents</b> in forest regeneration therefore depends upon several environmental variables influencing their behavior. Literature. Many publications demonstrate that <b>rodents</b> are mostly seed predators for many species. Nevertheless, because it is hard to define their pattern of movement, the role of <b>rodents</b> in forest regeneration could be underestimated. Through scatter-hoarding, <b>rodents</b> may play a crucial role, particularly in those forests where anthropogenic pressures have led to a reduction in the density of large mammals. However, very few studies have been conducted in African moist forests where defaunation can be high, and the role of <b>rodents</b> has been very poorly studied. Conclusions. To understand the phenomenon, we recommend the further investigation of the interactions between seeds and <b>rodents</b> by employing methods that have been commonly used on other continents...|$|R
5|$|Barn owls {{living in}} {{tropical}} regions can breed {{at any time}} of year, but some seasonality in nesting is still evident. Where there are distinct wet and dry seasons, egg-laying usually takes place during the dry season, with increased <b>rodent</b> prey becoming available to the birds as the vegetation dies off. In arid regions, such as parts of Australia, breeding may be irregular and may happen in wet periods, triggered by temporary increases in the populations of small mammals. In temperate climates, nesting seasons become more distinct and there are some seasons of the year when no egg-laying takes place. In Europe and North America, most nesting takes place between March and June when temperatures are increasing. The actual dates of egg-laying vary by year and by location, being correlated with the amount of prey-rich foraging habitat around the nest site and often with the phase of the <b>rodent</b> abundance cycle. An increase in <b>rodent</b> populations will usually stimulate the local barn owls to begin nesting; thus, even in the cooler parts of its range, two broods are often raised in a good year.|$|E
5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues {{suggested that it}} is the primary host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis are the result of spillover between these two <b>rodent</b> species, which occur closely together. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as Sin Nombre virus, has never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species. Thus, there is a potential risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one hantavirus species had been identified in Mexico—El Moro Canyon virus from the small <b>rodent</b> Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E

50|$|Although {{lagomorphs}} {{are more}} closely related to <b>rodents</b> than any other mammals, the two orders still have some major differences.

Also, lagomorphs are almost strictly herbivorous, unlike <b>rodents,</b> many of which will eat both meat and vegetable matter. They resemble <b>rodents,</b> however, in that their incisor teeth grow continuously throughout their lives, thus necessitating constant chewing on fibrous food to prevent the teeth from growing too long.|$|R
