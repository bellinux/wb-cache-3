5|$|<b>Robbins</b> {{receives}} {{word that}} she has been given a grant to go to Malawi, and become a doctor there. In the end, Torres is shown to have accepted this as well and has decided to leave with <b>Robbins.</b> However, a fight at the airport results in <b>Robbins</b> leaving for Malawi without Torres, ending their relationship. She returns, hoping to rekindle her relationship with Torres, but is initially rejected. Eventually, Torres reveals that she is pregnant with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane)'s baby. <b>Robbins</b> accepts the situation, and she and Torres restart their relationship. Torres gifts <b>Robbins</b> with a weekend getaway, and <b>Robbins</b> proposes to Torres. After proposing, the two get in a car crash leaving Torres in critical condition. A series of surgeries follows, including the delivery of her premature baby, along with emotional breakdowns of both Sloan and <b>Robbins.</b> Upon the awakening of Torres, she accepts her marriage proposal, and the two are married by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). As the fifth year residents are coming close to the end of their residency, <b>Robbins</b> urges Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) to work under her. At the end of the Grey's Anatomy (season 8), <b>Robbins</b> is hurt badly in a plane crash, resulting in her left leg being amputated. In the aftermath of the plane accident, in which Sloan and Lexie Grey were killed, the hospital is sued and eventually found guilty of negligence. Each victim including Shepherd, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), and <b>Robbins</b> herself must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurances refuse to pay. Those doctors and Callie buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. <b>Robbins</b> is initially cold towards Callie because she was the one who decided for an amputation. She also struggles with body image issues, but they slowly reconcile as <b>Robbins</b> tries to adapt to her new life. When Dr. Lauren Boswell (Hilarie Burton) arrives at the hospital to reconstruct the face of a baby and flirts with <b>Robbins,</b> she is flattered that a stranger still finds her attractive despite knowing about her injury and the two have a one-night stand.|$|E
