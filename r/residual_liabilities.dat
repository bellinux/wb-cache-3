40|$|Economic {{models of}} tort law {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency of}} liability rules in terms of care and activity levels. A liability regime is optimal when it creates incentives to maximize the value of risky activities net of accident and precaution costs. The allocation of primary and <b>residual</b> <b>liability</b> allows policy makers to induce parties to undertake socially desirable care and activity levels. Traditionally, tort law systems have assigned <b>residual</b> <b>liability</b> either entirely on the tortfeasor or entirely on the victim. In this paper, we unpack the cheapest-cost-avoider principle to consider the virtues and limits of loss-sharing rules in generating optimal (second-best) incentives and allocations of risk. We find that loss sharing may be optimal {{in the presence of}} countervailing policy objectives, homogeneous risk avoiders, and subadditive risk, which potentially offers a valuable tool for policy makers and courts in awarding damages in a large number of real-world accident cases...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{structure}} of incremental liability rules. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for an incremental liability rule to be efficient. A liability rule, in the ordinary sense of the term, {{to be called a}} standard liability rule, is a rule which specifies the proportions in which the loss, in case of accident, is to be apportioned between the victim and the injurer as a function of their proportions of non-negligence. An incremental liability rule is a rule which specifies (i) which of the two parties, the victim or the injurer, is to be the non-residual liability holder; and (ii) the proportion of the incremental loss, which can be ascribed to the negligence of the non-residual party, to be borne by the non-residual liability holder. The necessary and sufficient conditions for an incremental liability rule to be efficient, derived in the paper, can be stated as follows: Let the party which is the <b>residual</b> <b>liability</b> holder when both parties are non-negligent be designated as r and the other party as nr. An incremental liability rule is efficient for every admissible application iff its structure is such that: (i) If party r is negligent and party nr is non-negligent, then party r must remain the <b>residual</b> <b>liability</b> holder. (ii) If party nr is negligent and party r is non-negligent, then party nr must either become the <b>residual</b> <b>liability</b> holder or liability of nr must be equal to the entire incremental loss which can be ascribed to the negligence of nr. ...|$|R

40|$|On 7 March 2014, Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Court (ICC) convicted Germain Katanga for {{war crimes}} and crimes against humanity. Katanga's {{conviction}} {{is based on the}} concept of common purpose liability as regulated in Article 25 (3) (d) of the Rome Statute. This liability theory establishes criminal responsibility for wilfully or knowingly contributing to the crimes of a group of persons who act together pursuant to a common purpose. The ICC regards commonpurpose <b>liability</b> as a <b>residual</b> <b>liability</b> theory, which provides for a lower level of blameworthiness than principal forms of criminal responsibility, such as joint perpetration. This article appraises the residual and inferior status of common purpose liability by comparing the ICC's application of common purpose liability and joint perpetration. The comparison makes clear that common purpose liability in theory stipulates lower actus reus and mens rea standards than joint perpetration. However, in practice the ICC applies the requirements of both these liability theories in a context-dependent way in interplay with the particular facts of individual cases. It can therefore not be concluded in general terms that common purpose liability by definition constitutes a less serious type of criminal responsibility than joint perpetration. Instead, it is preferable to adopt a flexible approach, which recognizes that common purpose liability covers a variety of conduct entailing different levels of blameworthiness...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{manufacturers}} {{should be}} liable if consumers, {{through the use}} of a product, cause harm to others. If consumers have deep pockets then consumeronly liability is socially desirable. With consumer insolvency, however, consumer-only liability leads to inadequate consumer precautions, inadequate safety features, and excessive economic activity. With homogeneous insolvent consumers, the best rule is "residual-manufacturer liability" where the consumer bears primary responsibility and the manufacturer bears the shortfall in damages. When consumers' willingness-to-pay is correlated with social harm they cause then residual-manufacturer liability distorts the market quantity. When consumers differ in their wealth then <b>residual</b> manufacturer <b>liability</b> creates an inefficient cross-subsidization and an overprovision of safety features. In both cases, consumer-only liability may be preferred to residual-manufacturer liability. Applications, including gun manufacturer liability, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A fully Bayesian {{analysis}} using Gibbs sampling and data augmentation in a multivariate model of Gaussian, right censored, and grouped Gaussian traits is described. The grouped Gaussian traits are either ordered categorical traits (with {{more than two}} categories) or binary traits, where the grouping is determined via thresholds on the underlying Gaussian scale, the liability scale. Allowances are made for unequal models, unknown covariance matrices and missing data. Having outlined the theory, strategies for implementation are reviewed. These include joint sampling of location parameters; efficient sampling from the fully conditional posterior distribution of augmented data, a multivariate truncated normal distribution; and sampling from the conditional inverse Wishart distribution, the fully conditional posterior distribution of the residual covariance matrix. Finally, a simulated dataset was analysed to illustrate the methodology. This paper concentrates on a model where <b>residuals</b> associated with <b>liabilities</b> of the binary traits {{are assumed to be}} independent. A Bayesian {{analysis using}} Gibbs sampling is outlined for the model where this assumption is relaxed...|$|R
40|$|This Chapter {{examines}} the existing structure of corporate criminal liability, providing empirical {{evidence on the}} types of firms convicted and the magnitude {{and nature of the}} sanctions imposed. It then examines whether existing U. S. enforcement practice is consistent with optimal corporate liability, especially for firms where ownership is separated from day-to-day control. The first part of this analysis determines the optimal structure of corporate liability. It shows that optimal corporate liability has different purposes, and thus a different structure, from individual criminal liability (Becker, 1968) whenever the optimal deterrence requires expenditures to detect and investigate corporate wrongdoing. This chapter also shows that the core purposes of corporate liability and optimal structure differ fundamentally from those articulated by the classic economic models of vicarious liability (Kornhauser, 1982; Sykes, 1984) and from analyses of corporate criminal liability that employ a similar model (Polinsky and Shavell, 1993). In contrast with these analyses, firms should not be strictly criminally liable for their employees’ crimes. Instead, corporate criminal liability should be duty-based, in that firms should be able to avoid criminal liability if they engage in optimal policing (monitoring, self-reporting, and cooperating). This structure is consistent with the current regime. Moreover, in contrast with classic analysis which holds that the state should reduce corporate criminal liability to reflect individual criminal liability and market sanctions, this Chapter shows, the state should not reduce the duty-based criminal sanction to reflect either sanctions imposed on individual wrongdoers or market-sanctions. The state generally should impose <b>residual</b> civil <b>liability</b> on all firms, even those that undertake optimal policing; the state should reduce (or eliminate) the residual civil sanction {{to the extent that the}} firm otherwise bears the full expected cost of crime as a result of individual liability or market sanctions. Finally, this Chapter {{examines the}} federal government’s current practice of using deferred and non-prosecution agreements to impose structural reforms on firms and discusses analysis showing that this practice can be consistent with optimal deterrence when corporate policing decisions are distorted by agency costs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Estimates of {{variance}} components for binary responses in presence of extreme case problems {{tend to be}} biased due to an under-identified likelihood. The bias persists even when a normal prior {{is used for the}} fixed effects. Methods A simulation study was carried out to investigate methods for the analysis of binary responses with extreme case problems. A linear mixed model that included a fixed effect and random effects of sire and <b>residual</b> on the <b>liability</b> scale was used to generate binary data. Five simulation scenarios were conducted based on varying percentages of extreme case problems, with true values of heritability equal to 0. 07 and 0. 17. Five replicates of each dataset were generated and analyzed with a generalized prior (g-prior) of varying weight. Results Point estimates of sire variance using a normal prior were severely biased when the percentage of extreme case problems was greater than 30 %. Depending on the percentage of extreme case problems, the sire variance was overestimated when a normal prior was used by 36 to 102 % and 25 to 105 % for a heritability of 0. 17 and 0. 07, respectively. When a g-prior was used, the bias was reduced and even eliminated, depending on the percentage of extreme case problems and the weight assigned to the g-prior. The lowest Pearson correlations between true and estimated fixed effects were obtained when a normal prior was used. When a 15 % g-prior was used instead of a normal prior with a heritability equal to 0. 17, Pearson correlations between true and fixed effects increased by 11, 20, 23, 27, and 60 % for 5, 10, 20, 30 and 75 % of extreme case problems, respectively. Conversely, Pearson correlations between true and estimated fixed effects were similar, within datasets of varying percentages of extreme case problems, when a 5, 10, or 15 % g-prior was included. Therefore this indicates that a model with a g-prior provides a more adequate estimation of fixed effects. Conclusions The results suggest that when analyzing binary data with extreme case problems, bias in the estimation {{of variance}} components could be eliminated, or at least significantly reduced by using a g-prior. </p...|$|R
