5000|$|During the Second World War, the {{marshalling}} yard of Massy-Palaiseau {{was considered a}} strategic rail junction. The bombardments of these infrastructures caused 88 victims and material damage throughout the town. In the post-war period, the reconstruction {{and development of the}} parisian agglomeration and its suburbs metamorphosed the town's geography. The housing crisis provoked an outrage, thus the [...] "castor" [...] movement established some residences in the east of the city. The establishment of a housing scheme on 145 hectares of the communes of Massy-Antony caused the population of Massy to double. The creation of a 'Priority Construction Zone' in Villaine 10 years later was intended to even out the town's urbanisation. This abrupt development of the town also modified its social structure: <b>rejuvenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> arrival of foreigners, etc. During the 1960s and 1970s, questions are raised about rapid urban development: housing problems and shantytowns, lack of public resources, requalification of certain factory sites, delinquency, etc. To satisfy the needs for this new population, many new infrastructures were created such as schools, hospitals, sports centres, swimming pools, arts centres, nurseries and parks. The establishment of a TGV station in 1991 is an asset for the economic development of the city. Nowadays, certain amenities have an influence which exceeds the communal and departmental circles, in particular opera and theatre. (Author: Municipal archives of Massy) ...|$|E

40|$|Peroxisomes are {{ubiquitous}} organelles {{characterized by}} a protein-rich matrix surrounded by a single membrane. In filamentous fungi, peroxisomes are crucial for <b>the</b> primary metabolism <b>of</b> several unusual carbon sources used for growth (e. g. fatty acids), but increasing evidence is presented that emphasize <b>the</b> crucial role <b>of</b> these organelles in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> a variety of secondary metabolites.

40|$|We use cosmological SPH {{simulations}} {{to study}} <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> mergers in <b>the</b> star formation history of galactic objects in hierarchical clustering scenarios. We find that during some merger events, gaseous discs can experience two starbursts: {{the first one}} during the orbital decay phase, due to gas inflows driven as the satellite approaches, and the second one, when the two baryonic clumps collide. A trend for these first induced starbursts to be more efficient at transforming the gas into stars is also found. We detect that systems which do not experience early gas inflows have well-formed stellar bulges and more concentrated potential wells, which seem {{to be responsible for}} preventing further gas inward transport triggered by tidal forces. Our results constitute the first proof that bulges can form as <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> collapse, collisions and secular evolution in a cosmological framework, and they are consistent with a <b>rejuvenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stellar <b>population</b> in bulges at intermediate z with, at least, 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars (in SCDM) being formed at high z.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the demographic development in the suburban zone of Prague, the territory most affected {{by the process of}} suburbanization. The aim of the thesis is to characterize the development of the demographic structure of monitored areas, to capture changes in the level of selected demographic indicators and to create a projection of the future development of the population. In the surveyed areas, the size of the population increased significantly during the period under review, mainly due to migration of specific age groups into the area. Immigration has led to a significant <b>rejuvenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> and has brought about changes in the population structure that have had a decisive influence on the further development of the surveyed demographic indicators...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} work is the {{understanding}} of the problems of regional development in recent times is becoming increasingly important socio - economic issue. The paper seeks to argue that the context and Regional Development provides an opportunity to resolve the paradox of development interpreted by many researchers. Issues of Regional Development of Montenegro {{for more than half a}} century did not have adequate theoretical or practical foundation. New current models of economic growth and development were based on sector priorities and policies, the short and medium term objectives. In order to slow down the aging process of the population of Montenegro and mitigate its effects, it is necessary to increase the birth rate, which would encourage the gradual <b>rejuvenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> The second group of measures relates to immigration, and the third to increase youth employment in order to prevent any more numerous emigrations. The problem employment/unemployment is one of the most socio - economic problems in Montenegro. Therefore, in the management regional development policy at EU level, special importance is given to finding adequate mechanisms and instruments that will contribute to the better functioning of labor markets, and thus to a more balanced regional development. In Montenegro, it is necessary to elaborate a new concept, a comprehensive regional development, which will be based on demographic, natural, economic and socio-cultural resources...|$|E

For 2011 – 2015 the population of Steppe Eagle in Kalmykia decreased by 23 % and is 404 – 720, at average 527 breeding pairs. In 2015 the average density of occupied breeding territories on {{the main part of the}} Steppe Eagle breeding ground in Kalmykia was about 1. 7 per 100 km 2, in the breeding ground of the high density of species, on Ergeninskaya hill, where about 20 % of Kalmyk Steppe Eagle population is nesting – 7, 9 / 100 km 2. In 2015 the density of successful pairs was 1. 3 (0. 98 – 1. 7) pairs/ 100 km 2 on the main areas, on Ergeninskaya hill – 7. 1 (4. 9 – 10. 4) pairs/ 100 km 2, observed breeding success in 2015 is 1. 58 ± 1. 11 nestlings per occupied breeding territory. The <b>rejuvenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> has been noted: among the birds on the breeding territories the proportion of partners younger than 5 years has increased by 3 times in 2 years – from 1. 75 to 5. 26 %. The main threats to the Steppe Eagle in the Republic of Kalmykia are death on power lines, steppe fires, destruction of nests by cattle or killing of nestlings by herding dogs, disturbance factor in grazing. It is likely that the decline of eagles’ population is due to increasing of negative factors on the migration routes and wintering grounds...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Therapy of renal anaemia in {{haemodialysis}} {{patients with}} chronic renal failure by application of recombinant human erythropoietin leads to an increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> haematocrit. <b>Rejuvenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> erythrocyte <b>population</b> results in a decrease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> median density (D 50), an increase of cell age-dependent enzyme activities, such as aspartate aminotransferase, and elevated concentrations of purine nucleotides in the erythrocytes.

40|$|A {{demographic}} {{study was}} carried out on Bertholletia excelsa, the Brazil nut tree, in two primary forest sites in Northern Bolivia where Brazil nuts have been harvested for several decades. In spite of the large proportion (93 €of seeds that are harvested, reasonable densities of recently emerged seedlings were found. Seeds of Bertholletia are contained in woody fruits that are primarily opened by agoutis. Most fruits are left untouched {{on the forest floor}} for 1 - 2 y before they are opened, possibly due to high energetic costs of fruit opening just after fruit fall. However, the proportion of viable seeds is strongly reduced in older fruits. Growth in diameter at breast height (dbh) was low for pole-sized trees ( 100 cm dbh) and peaked for intermediate-sized trees (30 - 60 cm). These trees often attained a growth rate of > 1. 5 cm y- 1, which is high compared with other non-pioneer tropical trees. This, and the strong growth response to increased light availability found for seedlings and saplings, suggest that Bertholletia excelsa can be classified as a gap-dependent species. Matrix population models were constructed for both study populations. Population growth rates (λ) were close to one, and were most sensitive to persistence in one size category. Age estimates revealed that age at first reproduction (at dbh > 60 cm) amounts to over 120 y, and age in the last category (dbh > 160 cm) to almost 300 y. Given the continuous <b>rejuvenation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> the stable population size, the high age at maturity and the long reproductive period, it is concluded that current levels of Brazil nut extraction may be sustained at least for several decades and perhaps for even longer periods...|$|E
