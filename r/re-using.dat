The plan was stopped after the reactor building was placed on the Washington Heritage Register, the state's list of historic buildings, a designation that was contested by the University of Washington. Preservationists suggested <b>re-using</b> the building as a museum dedicated to the state's nuclear history and continuing research. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, based on an application from UW architecture student Abby Inpanbutr (then Abby Martin) submitted in spring 2008.|$|E
40|$|Software Architecture {{has been}} {{established}} as a viable level of representation for <b>re-use</b> in practical software engineering efforts. The main {{reason for this is}} that an architectural view of software is sufficiently abstract to have many instantiations. Even with technologies such as CORBA and JavaBeans, which emphasize <b>re-use</b> of components, the realization of widespread <b>re-use</b> has been severely limited. While architectural <b>re-use</b> has been successful, it has thus far suffered from an ad-hoc semantics, and even savvy architecture practitioners are unsure precisely what is being <b>re-used.</b> We have been engaged in research into <b>re-use</b> of software documents, such as design documents, statements of work, contracts, etc., that capture and <b>re-use</b> archtectural level knowledge of software solutions. We have found that, given a sufficiently robust knowledge-based tool for maintaining documents, a formal ontology or meta-model for software architectures is required to achieve <b>re-use</b> of these architecture-level documents. We present such an ontology here...|$|R

However, there may be some older graves in a cemetery for whom there are local and vocal descendants who will mount a public campaign against <b>re-use.</b> One pragmatic strategy is to publicly announce plans to <b>re-use</b> older graves and invite families to respond if they are willing or not. <b>Re-use</b> then only occurs where there are no objections allowing the [...] "forgotten" [...] graves to be <b>re-used.</b> Sometimes the cemetery authorities request a further payment to avoid <b>re-use</b> of a grave, but often this backfires politically.|$|R

5|$|The {{main idea}} of the {{algorithm}} is to find pairs of clusters to merge by following paths in the nearest neighbor graph of the clusters. Every such path will eventually terminate at a pair of clusters that are nearest neighbors of each other, and the algorithm chooses that pair of clusters as the pair to merge. In order to save work by <b>re-using</b> {{as much as possible}} of each path, the algorithm uses a stack data structure to keep track of each path that it follows. By following paths in this way, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm merges its clusters in a different order than methods that always find and merge the closest pair of clusters. However, despite that difference, it always generates the same hierarchy of clusters.|$|E
5|$|Two Gemini-derived {{spacecraft}} {{were considered}} for unmanned resupply flights. The {{first of these}} would have involved a Gemini spacecraft, with all systems for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. The spacecraft would have docked using a port {{at the front of}} the spacecraft. Cargo would have been transferred through the nose of the spacecraft, where the re-entry attitude control system was located on the manned spacecraft. The spacecraft was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but <b>re-using</b> as many Gemini systems as possible. It would have had a higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E

40|$|We {{assess the}} {{quantitative}} {{implications of the}} <b>re-use</b> of collateral on financial market leverage, volatility, and welfare within an infinite-horizon asset-pricing model with heterogeneous agents. In our model, the ability of agents to <b>re-use</b> frees up collateral {{that can be used}} to back more transactions. <b>Re-use</b> thus contributes to the build-up of leverage and significantly increases volatility in financial markets. When introducing limits on <b>re-use,</b> we find that volatility is strictly decreasing as these limits become tighter, yet the impact on welfare is non-monotone. In the model, allowing for some <b>re-use</b> can improve welfare as it enables agents to share risk more effectively. Allowing reuse beyond intermediate levels, however, can lead to excessive leverage and lower welfare. So the analysis in this paper provides a rationale for limiting, yet not banning, <b>re-use</b> in financial markets...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} the new law regulation concerning the <b>re-use</b> of the public information, which has been introduced into the Polish Act on Access to Public Information from 2001. New regulation results from {{the implementation of the}} Directive 2003 / 98 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the <b>re-use</b> of public sector information into Polish legal order. <b>Re-use</b> means the use by persons or legal entities of documents held by public sector bodies, for commercial or non-commercial purposes other than the initial purpose within the public task for which the documents were produced. As a general rule, everyone has the right to <b>re-use</b> of public information. Moreover, the information is made available without conditions and no charges are made for the <b>re-use.</b> The exceptions to this general rule are made, as the public sector bodies may impose conditions of the <b>re-use,</b> determine the manner of <b>re-use,</b> charge a <b>re-use</b> fee, as well as refuse the e-use of the information.

50|$|Software <b>re-use</b> {{is also a}} {{major benefit}} of using Object classes. Classes {{facilitate}} <b>re-use</b> via inheritance and interfaces. When a new behavior is required it can often be achieved by creating a new class and having that class inherit the default behaviors and data of its superclass and then tailor {{some aspect of the}} behavior or data accordingly. <b>Re-use</b> via interfaces (also known as methods) occurs when another object wants to invoke (rather than create a new kind of) some object class. This method for <b>re-use</b> removes many of the common errors that can make their way into software when one program <b>re-uses</b> code from another.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, <b>re-use</b> is {{considered}} as a potential building block towards achieving more sustainable consumption of {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (EEE). A sustainability analysis demonstrates that EEE <b>re-use,</b> when adapted as part of national policy, can potentially benefit all sectors of society. For white goods <b>re-use,</b> a quantitative model permitted a comparative analysis of <b>re-use</b> and non-re-use scenarios to determine the environmental impacts. The model demonstrates the importance of considering user consumption profiles and the changing national electricity generation portfolio in determining the best end of life strategy; whether it should be <b>re-use</b> or recycling. The outcome of the model suggests that <b>re-use</b> of white goods whose energy rating is one below the cheapest available new product is environmentally preferable. Using domestic and international data, the thesis also argues that the development of a <b>re-use</b> sector provides an opportunity to make a significant contribution to social and economic growth by creating employment and enabling sustainable economic growth. The thesis concludes that <b>re-use</b> of electrical and electronic equipment is as an activity that must be regulated in order to develop in a sustainable fashion, avoiding sham <b>re-use</b> and promoting consumer confidence. A dedicated <b>re-use</b> body/organisation is proposed to ensure that only refurbishers who are recognised to be operating to the designated standards will {{be in a position to}} access supply and to have their activities reported as official <b>re-use.</b> The thesis also discusses how technological developments within the EEE industry, specifically RFID and the Internet of Things can potentially pave a new future for WEEE management. Results are presented for RFID trials on white goods and mixed WEEE at a civic amenity and identification rates of between 94 % and 50 % were achieved. An information technology infrastructure for EOL WEEE management is proposed incorporating identification and separation of WEEE suitable for different recovery avenues whether <b>re-use,</b> targeted spare parts recovery, recycling or possibly isolated decontamination...|$|R
