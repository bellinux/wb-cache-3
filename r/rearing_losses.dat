40|$|The {{potential}} and {{actual number of}} offspring of roe deer {{and the difference between}} these figures (prenatal and postnatal loss) significantly vary in each population yearly. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the {{potential and}} actual number of offspring, the number of losses, and to find a link between the most important biological characteristics of does (body weight – BW, condition – KFI) and the number of raised offspring on four territories on the Great Hungarian Plain. Where the number of corpora lutea (CL) is the highest, there the losses are the highest as well, and the number of raised offspring is the lowest (region I.). Here, the rearing loss is double that of the weakest territory (region IV.). <b>Rearing</b> <b>losses</b> can be associated with the fenotype of does (BW, KFI) but environmental factors also have determinative importance. Where the number of twin-calving does was the highest, I found four times more does without a fawn than where the number of twin-calving does was the lowest. The nursing success was the best (the losses were lowest) in the region where the potential offspring (number of CL) was also the lowest, but the coverage of the habitat and the proportion of forests were largest. The food supply for the animals in autumn and winter are not enough, the structure of the habitat has to be improved as well, so that it might become adequate for game protection in extreme weather conditions. The results have to be considered as preliminary ones. It is essential to continue and extend the research to increase the reliability of the results...|$|E
40|$|Vibrio splendidus is a {{pathogen}} {{that can}} cause major losses {{during the early stages}} of larval turbot rearing when live feed (rotifers or Artemia) is used. As haemolytic bacteria have often been associated with larval <b>rearing</b> <b>losses,</b> we studied the role of the V. splendidus haemolysin in infection of larvae. From a bank of over 10 000 transposon mutants of V. splendidus, two different types of haemolysin-negative mutants were obtained. Both had lost virulence for larval fish, and immunohistochemistry showed that the transposon mutant studied colonized the turbot larval intestinal tract at a similar level to the wild-type organism but did not cause damage or signs of enteritis found with the wild-type organism. One transposon insertion site was located within a gene with high homology to aerolysin, the cytolytic toxin produced by several Aeromonas spp. The haemolysin, which we have termed vibrioaerolysin, had properties similar to aerolysin and osmotic protection studies showed that it formed pores in the membranes of erythrocytes of similar diameter to those of aerolysin. The Tn 10 insertion site of the second transposon mutant was in an adjacent ToxR-like gene, suggesting that this might control expression of the vibrioaerolysin. The gastroenteritis caused by Aeromonas spp. in humans is considered to be due to production of aerolysin causing cyclic AMP-dependent chloride secretion in cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Damage to the intestinal tract of marine fish larvae could occur in a similar way, and it is possible that several Vibrio spp. found in the developing bacterial flora of the larval fish gut can secrete aerolysin-like toxins leading to death of larvae in the early rearing stages. Routine bacteriological screening on blood agar plates of live feed is recommended with measures to reduce the concentrations of haemolytic bacteria in rearing system...|$|E
50|$|Shaka {{was able}} to form an {{alliance}} with the leaderless Mthethwa clan and {{was able to}} establish himself amongst the Qwabe, after Phakathwayo was overthrown with relative ease. With Qwabe, Hlubi and Mkhize support, Shaka was finally able to summon a force capable of resisting the Ndwandwe (of the Nxumalo clan). Historian Donald Morris states that Shaka's first major battle against Zwide, of the Ndwandwe, was the Battle of Gqokli Hill, on the Mfolozi river. Shaka's troops maintained a strong position on the crest of the hill. A frontal assault by their opponents failed to dislodge them, and Shaka sealed the victory by sending his reserve forces in a sweep around the hill to attack the enemy's <b>rear.</b> <b>Losses</b> were high overall but the efficiency of the new Shakan innovations was proved. It is probable that, over time, the Zulu were able to hone and improve their encirclement tactics.|$|R

On the other hand, in the case of local Al-BSF formation with pure PVD Al, it is shown that the presence of Si on top of the rear dielectrics, coming from Si diffusion into the Al layer with alloying, leads to parasitic absorption which contributes almost entirely to the measured drop in rear reflectance...|$|R

40|$|A {{brief period}} of monocular {{deprivation}} in early postnatal life can alter the structure of neurons within deprived-eye-receiving layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. The modification of structure {{is accompanied by a}} marked reduction in labeling for neurofilament, a protein that composes the stable cytoskeleton and that supports neuron structure. This study examined the extent of neurofilament recovery in monocularly deprived cats that either had their deprived eye opened (binocular recovery), or had the deprivation reversed to the fellow eye (reverse occlusion). The degree to which recovery was dependent on visually-driven activity was examined by placing monocularly deprived animals in complete darkness (dark <b>rearing).</b> The <b>loss</b> of neurofilament and the reduction of soma size caused by monocular deprivation were both ameliorated equally following either binocular recovery or reverse occlusion for 8 days. Though monocularly deprived animals placed in complete darkness showed recovery of soma size, there was a generalized loss of neurofilament labeling that extended to originally non-deprived layers. Overall, these results indicate that recovery of soma size is achieved by removal of the competitive disadvantage of the deprived eye, and occurred {{even in the absence of}} visually-driven activity. Recovery of neurofilament occurred when the competitive disadvantage of the deprived eye was removed, but unlike the recovery of soma size, was dependent upon visually-driven activity. The role of neurofilament in providing stable neural structure raises the intriguing possibility that dark rearing, which reduced overall neurofilament levels, could be used to reset the deprived visual system so as to make it more ameliorable with treatment by experiential manipulations...|$|R

Fish reared in net pens at a density/feeding combination judged to be the economic optimum of those used during 1984 rearing trials exhibited good growth and smolt development. Size of fish averaged 112 fish/lb (4. 0 g/fish), ATPase activities ranged from 16. 4 to 29. 5 micromoles Pi/mg prot/hr at release and total mortality of fish was low among pens, ranging from 0. 3 to 1. 1 %. Poor growth and smolt development was observed in fish reared in a large barrier net, especially during the initial two weeks after stocking. In addition, mortality of fish in the barrier net was high (49 %) in relation {{to any of the}} other treatments tested thus far. The combined effects of generally poor condition of fish at stocking, low zooplankton densities during the initial two weeks of <b>rearing,</b> and <b>losses</b> to predation were thought to be the primary causes of the slow growth rates and high mortality. Unfed fish in pens utilized the available natural food base, but zooplankton densities were apparently not sufficient for growth, and may have been marginal for sustenance, especially at higher density. ATPase activities at release were significantly higher in low-density pens than in higher density pens, but development at all densities was retarded when compared with ATPase activities of fed fish. Preliminary cost estimates for producing fish-using the rearing strategies developed in the current pen-rearing study compared favorably with the average costs of rearing salmonids in a Northwest hatchery...|$|R

3000|$|Usage of thinner wafers and an {{effective}} reduction of surface recombination losses are increasingly important for low-cost highly efficient silicon solar cells. Hence the recent trend in silicon-wafer-based PV industries is toward thinner wafers (< 200  μm). But {{the use of}} thinner wafers increases the rear surface recombination [12] and consequently necessitates a well-passivated rear surface to keep the <b>rear</b> surface recombination <b>loss</b> in acceptable minimum. Moreover, the increasing demands for optical quality require a higher internal reflection as well. Therefore, all designs for high-efficiency silicon solar cells today use a dielectric passivation layer on the rear {{to meet the requirements}} of passivation quality and optical properties. Keeping in mind the above attributes a good number of rear surface passivation techniques were developed over the years; among them atomic layer deposition (ALD)-assisted Al 2 O 3, wet oxidation process using pyrogenic steam, passivation by stack of a-Si:H/SiO 2 or Al 2 O 3 /SiN x [...] and passivation by phosphorus-doped a-SiC x N y :H(n) alloys are the most notable rear side passivation techniques for crystalline silicon solar cells.

Conservation of the park started more than a century ago, and local people have often contested such efforts. This is mainly because indigenous people have been facing displacement and deprivation from resources, which they have been using for centuries. Besides deprivation, wild animals often damage their properties and paddy fields. This leads to resentment among local people and become potential cause of grudge in the form of encroachment, poaching, biodiversity loss, and excessive collection of forest products. As a result, conservation measures may fail to deliver desired outcome. This paper tries to examine the gains and losses for living around KNP and assess the park-people relation.

Over 60, 000 Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were reared in floating cages at four locations in Puget Sound, Washington, and were hand-counted {{at the beginning and}} end of 200 + d of <b>rearing.</b> Average unexplained <b>losses</b> were 8 - 38 % for individual locations (three to four cages each) and 2. 5 - 46. 5 % for individual cages. When cage netting remains intact, unexplained losses are probably the result of decomposition of carcasses (particularly during disease outbreaks); scavenging by birds, mammals, and fishes; and to a lesser extent, escapes. The economic consequences of losing fish can be important in terms of lost harvest and increased food costs, resulting in true food conversions 10 - 68 % higher than anticipated. It is widely known among commercial fish culturists that when fishes are held within nets in a body of water, a certain portion of fish assumed to be in cages disappears. Though this unexplained loss of fishes has been recognized for decades (Institute of Fisheries Economics 1971; Kennedy 1975; Secretan 1979), it has never been accurately documented.

Methods Breeding success of Great Tits Parus major, Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus and Coal Tits Periparus ater at TreswellWood, Nottinghamshire, England was examined, selecting only those nests which fledged at least one chick. Mortality during incubation (i. e. loss of eggs) or <b>rearing</b> (i. e. <b>loss</b> of chicks) was recorded per nest and annual means were calculated and used in the analysis, which examined relationships between year, first-egg date and species.

40|$|The {{gross product}} from sea culture in Japan was about USD 3. 4 billion in 2013 with kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus constituting 2 % {{of the total}} {{production}}. In recent years, annual shrimp production has reached about 1, 600 metric tons (MT) and 99 % of the species produced comprised of M. japonicus. Kuruma shrimp is highly traded at market price of USD 40 - 60 per kg. At present, 65 % of cultured kuruma shrimp are produced in Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures. To increase or maintain kuruma shrimp fishery in the natural environment, 200 million fry have been annually released into the sea {{along the coast of}} Japan. In addition, whiteleg shrimp Penaeus vannamei has also been produced in a private farm since 2007 with an annual production of approximately 40 MT. Recently, the number of farms that ventured into whiteleg shrimp culture has increased. The most serious obstacle faced by the kuruma shrimp industry in Japan in the 1990 s was the outbreaks of white spot disease (WSD) caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The seed production of kuruma shrimp has been dependent on captured wild broodstocks. However, broodstocks obtained from the wild could be carriers of WSSV that may vertically transmit the virus to fertilized eggs. To prevent the spread of WSD, measures for disinfecting WSSV-infected fertilized eggs of shrimp and detection of the causative virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed. Lately, with the application of an improved technology for broodstock <b>rearing,</b> production <b>losses</b> ascribed to WSD have significantly decreased because majority of the hatcheries have been using specific WSSV-free shrimps. In the last decade, in kuruma shrimp hatcheries and grow-out ponds, vibriosis due to Vibrio penaeicida has been frequently encountered. Fusariosis caused by Fusarium solani is also common. The first cases of vibriosis and fusariosis in Japan occurred in 1973 and 1972, respectively. Taking the case of Okinawa prefecture as example, production losses in 2005 due to vibriosis and fusariosis were 66 % and 34 %, respectively. Cleaning of the pond bottom prior to the commencement of grow-out culture has been recommended to prevent vibriosis. Some antibiotics have also been orally administered to reduce mortality of shrimps affected by vibriosis. However, farmers have been properly cautioned regarding their use as emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria could consequently arise. Because no practical treatment for fusariosis is currently available, farmers either dispose or harvest infected shrimps followed by disinfection of ponds with 10 ppm chlorine. Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) has not yet been detected in Japan. As kuruma shrimp is also susceptible to the disease, the Government of Japan plans to designate AHPND as Specific Disease. Under Japanese law, enlistment of AHPND as a quarantinable disease will also be instituted to prevent the introduction of this disease into Japanese hatcheries and grow-out facilities. However, in case an AHPND outbreak inadvertently occurs, Prefectural Fisheries Experimental Stations (PES) could immediately conduct preliminary diagnosis using the AP 4 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. In addition, confirmatory diagnosis using AP 4 nested PCR method and sequencing could be conducted at the National Research Institute of Aquaculture (NRIA), a central laboratory for aquatic animal health. NRIA s task is not only to perform confirmatory diagnosis but likewise disseminate diagnostic techniques to the staff of the National Quarantine and PES...|$|R
40|$|For many years, the {{photovoltaic}} {{industry has}} been using Al to form the back contact of crystalline silicon solar cells. The objective of this PhD is to reach {{a better understanding of}} the contact formation at the rear side of the Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC) type solar cell. This type of cell features at the rear side a stack of dielectrics as a passivation layer which is pre-opened in order to allow the subsequent metallization step. The way this dielectric stack is opened, by laser ablation, the deposition of the metal, with various techniques, and the high temperature step required for the formation of the Al-Si alloy which serves as a contact, will be investigated in this work. It will be demonstrated that Si dissolution in Al plays an important role in the formation of the contacts, giving on one hand the needed dopants to create an effective Back Surface Field (BSF) layer, and on the other hand forming a deep pyramidal shape in the contact region which might affect the reflection of the light inside in the cell, and increase the surface recombination velocity of the device. A novel method to characterize the local Al-Si alloy formation is introduced, allowing the in-situ observation of the high temperature step for the contact formation. By doing this, details of the process which cannot be taken into account once the device is finished, are studied and explained through hypotheses involving the phase diagram between both elements. The performance at cell level of the different combination of parameters affecting the formation of the BSF region has been evaluated. For this, changes in contact pitch, firing temperature and profile, Al thickness and composition are studied for the PERC cells. At the end, the <b>rear</b> reflectance <b>loss</b> mechanisms are also investigated by altering the dielectric layers used for passivation, together with the study of the effect of Si incorporation during the firing step, showing that this Si presence at the back side is the main responsible for the loss observed.
