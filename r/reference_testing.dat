40|$|Background: Studies {{investigating}} the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are typically performed using the clinical diagnosis or amyloid-β {{positron emission tomography}} as the <b>reference</b> <b>test.</b> However, neither {{can be considered a}} gold standard or a perfect <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> for AD.

50|$|Bruno {{continued}} in {{the research and development}} of Information <b>Reference</b> <b>Testing</b> by continuing to focus on measuring confidence and correctness in the workplace. The methodology was eventually automated to allow an individual to self-assess their knowledge (simultaneously measuring confidence and correctness) that led to feedback on how the learner was doing, what gaps exists in knowledge (based on confidence levels), and what the learner specifically needed to learn. The methodology for this simultaneous measurement of confidence and correctness was patented in 2005. Around that time, the name of the IRT process was changed to Confidence-Based Learning (CBL).|$|E

50|$|Bruno, a Professor of Education at UCLA, {{began his}} work on {{understanding}} the connection between knowledge, confidence, retention, {{and the quality of}} knowledge while consulting for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the RAND Corporation in the 1960s. Bruno eventually turned his focus to the K-12 market and packaged his developments into practical application for the K-12 educational market in the early 1990s.Bruno's research on the linkage between knowledge, confidence, and behavior led to the intuitive conclusion that knowledge alone is necessary but not sufficient to create behavior. Rather, it is the fusion of knowledge and confidence that leads to behavioral outcomes and empowers people to act. People who are confidently correct will take actions that are productive. The reverse is also true in that individuals who are confident about misinformation will take action, with consistently negative (and potentially dangerous) results.This measurement of knowledge quality was initially called Information <b>Reference</b> <b>Testing</b> (IRT). The IRT process uses a unique two-dimensional assessment process in which a single answer for each question generates two metrics simultaneously - correctness and confidence. Numerous research studies in the 1980s and 1990s established a link between correctness and confidence, but most of these testing approaches first asked learners to state what they believed to be the correct answer to a question, then asked them to state their confidence in the answer just selected. Even though these approaches help us understand the level of confidence a learner has in their answers, research shows that when learning and confidence measurements are two discrete actions, learners tend to overstate their confidence level. Confidence, in this setting, is a logical response to a question, not a spontaneous measurement of true emotion. While developing the IRT methodology, Bruno pointed out something other researchers failed to address. When evaluating the accuracy of testing and assessment outcomes, one must take into account the level of honesty in each learner's answers. If a person is provided with several answer choices and does not know the answer, their only option is to guess. If they happen to guess correctly, they get credit for knowledge they don't have. Bruno tested his IRT process among students, and claimed successes with juvenile offenders in the LA County Corrections System who, according to Bruno, had dropped out of mainstream society because they were unable to adapt and succeed in a traditional learning environment. He claims that with IRT, these juveniles were able to achieve academic success while enjoying the process. Bruno's focus on this audience led to the game-like simplicity of the IRT process, which encouraged honesty in the evaluation and learning process in a safe environment where the emphasis was on knowledge quality rather than a score. Bruno ultimately was able to develop a simple methodology for measuring knowledge quality that became the basis for Confidence-Based Learning (CBL).|$|E

As new rapid diagnostic tests become available, there is a continuous need to assess their performance and operational characteristics prior to use in clinical settings. Objectives: In this study, we evaluated {{the performance of the}} Chembio Dual Path Platform (DPP®) HIV–Syphilis Assay to accurately diagnose HIV, syphilis, and HIV/syphilis co-infection. Method: In 2013, 990 serum samples from the Georgia Public Health Laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia, United States were characterised for HIV and syphilis and used to evaluate the platform. HIV <b>reference</b> <b>testing</b> combined third-generation Enzyme Immunoassay and Western Blot, whereas <b>reference</b> <b>testing</b> for syphilis was conducted by the Treponema pallidum passive particle agglutination method and the TrepSure assay. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the DPP assay on this panel by comparing results with the HIV and syphilis <b>reference</b> <b>testing</b> algorithms. Results: For HIV, sensitivity was 99. 8 % and specificity was 98. 4 %; for syphilis, sensitivity was 98. 8 % and specificity was 99. 4 %. Of the 348 co-infected sera, 344 (98. 9 %) were detected accurately by the DPP assay, but 11 specimens had false-positive results (9 HIV and 2 syphilis) due to weak reactivity. Conclusion: In this evaluation, the Chembio DPP HIV–Syphilis Assay had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting both HIV and treponemal antibodies. Our results indicate that this assay could {{have a significant impact on}} the simultaneous screening of HIV and syphilis using a single test device for high-risk populations or pregnant women needing timely care and treatment. </p...|$|E

40|$|There is {{conflicting}} {{evidence about the}} accuracy of bone scintigraphy (BS) for the diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome 1 (CRPS 1). In a meta-analysis of diagnostic studies, the evaluation of test accuracy is impeded {{by the use of}} different imperfect <b>reference</b> <b>tests.</b> The aim of our study is to summarize sensitivity and specificity of BS for CRPS 1 and to identify factors to explain heterogeneity. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to model test accuracy and threshold, and we present different models accounting for the imperfect nature of the <b>reference</b> <b>tests,</b> and assuming conditional dependence between BS and the <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> results. Further, we include disease duration as explanatory variable in the model. The models are compared using summary ROC curves and the deviance information criterion (DIC). Our results show that those models which account for different imperfect <b>reference</b> <b>tests</b> with conditional dependence and inclusion of the covariate are the ones with the smallest DIC. The sensitivity of BS was 0. 87 (95 % credible interval 0. 73 - 0. 97) and the overall specificity was 0. 87 (0. 73 - 0. 95) in the model with the smallest DIC, in which missing values of the covariate are imputed within the Bayesian framework. The estimated effect of duration of symptoms on the threshold parameter was 0. 17 (- 0. 25 to 0. 57).

Experimental {{studies on}} <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> cases are of capital {{importance}} {{to support the}} development of models and coupling strategies for simulations on fluid-structure interaction problems. The need for experimental test cases specially addressed for the validation and diagnostic of numerical tools has triggered the present contribution to design and to study two-dimensional <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> cases both in laminar and turbulent flows. From the experimental view point, investigations on coupled unsteady flow and structure motions require specially adapted test rigs and measuring techniques to obtain accurate time-phase resolved results. Therefore a new experimental facility to be operated with a large range of viscous liquids was built exclusively for the present study. It made possible to perform measurements, using optical laser measurement techniques, in laminar and turbulent flows under very well controlled boundary and working conditions.

The indicators used in the evaluation include feasibility of integration, availability of country protocols, appropriate training, data quality, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, representativeness, timeliness, integration with AFP surveillance, simplicity and efficiency, acceptability, usefulness, flexibility, stability, and sustainability. The criteria and standards are based on WHO recommendations.
