Centrifugal impellers used in gas turbines are commonly made from titanium alloy forgings. Their flow-path blades are commonly flank milled or point milled on 5-axis milling machines. When tolerances and clearances are the tightest, these designs are completed as hot operational geometry and deflected back into the cold geometry as required for manufacturing.

This work is concentrated on the development of self-adaptive clearance control systems for gas turbine engines. Researchers have targeted the high-pressure turbine (HPT) blade tip seal location for following reasons: Current active clearance control (ACC) systems (e. g., thermal case-cooling schemes) cannot respond to blade tip clearance changes due to mechanical, thermal, and aerodynamic loads. As such they are prone to wear due to the required tight <b>running</b> <b>clearances</b> during operation.

40|$|In {{this study}} an {{investigation}} of heat transfer in air cooled Axial Flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) electrical machines is carried out. Efficiency of electrical machines is strongly influenced by an effective cooling which is provided by forced convection: air enters the generator through the opening in the machine enclosure and leaves it radially, as it is forced out by the rotating discs. The main goal is the enhancement of the heat transfer from the stator where heat is generated in the copper windings. On the other hand the heat transfer to the rotor needs to be minimised {{in order to keep}} the magnets' temperature as low as possible. The cooling can be improved by acting on design parameters, such as the distance between the stator and the rotors (commonly named <b>running</b> <b>clearance),</b> the magnet depth, and by acting on operational parameters, such as the rotational speed. The investigation is carried out by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software to model air flow and heat transfer inside the AFPM machines. The experimental validation of the numerical models confirmed the capability of the CFD software in predicting the air mass flow rate and the heat transfer in the AFPM machines. The thesis describes the effects of the above mentioned parameters on target quantities, such as the heat transfer coefficients on the generator surfaces, the air mass flow rate through the machine, and the resistive torque. General correlations in non-dimensional form are obtained for the calculation of the heat transfer on the generator surfaces in the AFPM machines as a function of the above parameters. General correlations have also been obtained for the calculations of the non-dimensional air mass flow rate through the machine and for the non-dimensional resistive torque. It was found that the corresponding relationships between the peripheral Reynolds number and local Nusselt numbers on the generator surfaces and the non-dimensional mass flow rate are linear. However, the dependency of Nusselt number on the non dimensional clearance and the magnet depth is non-linear. For the investigated range of the parameters the following was established: an increase in the peripheral Reynolds number results in higher Nusselt number on both the rotating and stationary surfaces of machines; an increase in the <b>running</b> <b>clearance</b> results in the reduction of the Nusselt number on the machine surfaces; the magnetic segments installed on the surface of the flat rotor act as blades of a radial compressor increasing the air mass flow rate and the corresponding Nusselt number on the stator surface. The combination of the non-dimensional <b>running</b> <b>clearance</b> equal to 9 10 - 3 and the non-dimensional magnet depth equal to 7. 3 10 - 2 was found to be the one which provides the maximum heat transfer from the stator. This piece of information can be used in the design stage for improving the cooling of AFPM electrical machines without increasing the windage losses and contribute in this way to the enhancement of the overall efficiency of this type of machines.

40|$|High energy-density turbomachines, {{like the}} SSME turbopumps, utilize {{labyrinth}} seals, {{also referred to}} as knife-edge seals, to control leakage flow. The pressure drop for such seals is order of magnitude higher than comparable jet engine seals. This is aggravated by the requirement of tight clearances resulting in possible unfavorable fluid-structure interaction of the seal system (seal flutter). To demonstrate these characteristics, a benchmark case of a High Pressure Oxygen Turbopump (HPOTP) outlet Labyrinth seal was studied in detail. First, an analytical assessment of the seal stability was conducted using a Pratt & Whitney legacy seal flutter code. Sensitivity parameters including pressure drop, rotor-to-stator <b>running</b> <b>clearances</b> and cavity volumes were examined and modeling strategies established. Second, a concurrent experimental investigation was undertaken to validate the stability of the seal at the equivalent operating conditions of the pump.

However, the use of Hydrogen gas at high inlet pressure provided good representation of the critical parameters affecting flutter especially the speed of sound. The flutter code predictions showed consistent trends in good agreement with the experimental data. The rig test program produced a stability threshold empirical parameter that separated operation with and without flutter. This empirical parameter was used to establish the seal build clearances to avoid flutter while providing the required cooling flow metering.

40|$|In {{the design}} of a gas turbine engine it is {{important}} to have a good prediction ofthe temperature distribution for components ofthe engine. This research work looks at the method ofpredicting air and metal temperatures of the lIP compressor disc drum. It is a common practice to supply cooling air for the turbine disc and blades by passing the air axially between the bores of adjacent discs in the lIP compressor. Some ofthe central axial throughflow is known to enter the compressor interdisc cavities and a parasitic temperature rise occurs in the throughflow air as a result ofthe convective heat transfer. It is important that the heat transfer mechanism within a compressor interdisc cavity is understood, as the engine designer needs to know the temperature ofthe cooling air and the disc temperatures in order to predict the stress and the life of the compressor, and also to predict the seal and blade tip <b>running</b> <b>clearances.</b> In this thesis, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to study the flow and heat mechanism experienced by a gas turbine lIP compressor rotor. A review ofprevious research work and knowledge in the field of rotational buoyancy-driven flow has shown that the flow within the compressor inter-disc cavities is highly three-dimensional and time dependent in nature. Two approaches in the numerical modelling ofthe flow can be considered; one is to use CFD as a tool to model a single inter-disc cavity with axial throughflow in full three dimensions with unsteady flow. Using this approach requires a huge amount ofcomputational memory and time to run the CFD models. A second approach is to break down this complex flow process into separate physical mechanisms and introduce approximate but computationally efficient models for these processes. The second approach has been taken in this thesis, with the aim ofproducing a method that can be incorporated into current design practice. Two underlying flow mechanisms may be identified for this complex flow; the first associated with the flow within the inter-disc cavities and the second associated with the axial throughflow under the compressor disc bores.

The overall program objectives are {{to reduce fuel consumption}} through increased engine efficiency, reduce engine exhaust emissions, and provide options for the use of alternative fuels. The program is administered with a balance of research contracts, university research grants, and focused in-house research. The Cummins Engine Company participates in the HDET program under a cost-sharing research contract. Cummins is researching and developing in-cylinder component technologies for heavy-duty diesel engines. An objective of the Cummins research is to develop technologies for a low-emissions, 55 -percent thermal efficiency (LE- 55) engine. The best current-production engines in this class achieve about 46 -percent thermal efficiency. Federal emissions regulations are driving this technology. Regulations for heavy duty diesel engines were tightened in 1994, more demanding emissions regulations are scheduled for 1998, and another step is planned for 2002. The LE- 55 engine emissions goal is set at half of the 1998 regulation level and is consistent with plans for 2002 emissions regulations. LE- 55 engine design requirements to meet the efficiency target dictate a need to operate at higher peak cylinder pressures. A key technology being developed and evaluated under the Cummins Engine Company LE- 55 engine concept is the spherical joint piston and connecting rod. Unlike conventional piston and connecting rod arrangements which are joined by a pin forming a hinged joint, the spherical joint piston and connecting rod use a ball-and-socket joint. The ball-and-socket arrangement enables the piston to have an axisymmetric design allowing rotation within the cylinder. The potential benefits of piston symmetry and rotation are reduced scuffing, improved piston ring sealing, improved lubrication, mechanical and thermal load symmetry, reduced bearing stresses, reduced <b>running</b> <b>clearances,</b> and reduced oil consumption. The spherical joint piston is a monolithic, squeeze-cast, fiber-reinforced aluminum piston. The connecting rod has a ball end that seats on a spherical saddle within the piston and is retained by a pair of aluminum bronze holder rings.

To improve BTRRC design, the optimum control-based probabilistic optimization of turbine casing radial deformation was implemented using time-varying least square support vector machine (T-LSSVM) by considering nonlinear material properties and dynamic thermal load. First the T-LSSVM method was proposed and its mathematical model was established. And then the nonlinear dynamic optimal control model of casing radial deformation was constructed with T-LSSVM.

On the basis of deeply investigating Extremum Response Surface Method (ERSM), the mathematical model of DCERSM was established based on quadratic polynomial function. As illustrated in BRRC transient probabilistic analysis with multiple components and multi-physics fields based on DCERSM, blade-tip radial static clearance δ = 1. 82 mm is advisable synthetically considering the reliability and working efficiency of gas turbine. The reliability, distribution characteristics and failure probability of BRRC are obtained. Besides, rotational speed ‰ and gas temperature T are the most important factors and expansivity coefficients and surface coefficients of heat transfer show also important influence on BRRC variation. Through the comparison of three methods (DCERSM, ERSM, Monte Carlo method), it is demonstrated that DCERSM reshapes the possibility of complex turbomachinery probabilistic analysis and improves computing efficiency while preserving the accuracy.

40|$|Developments in {{turbomachinery}} {{focus on}} efficiency and reliability enhancements, while reducing the production costs. In {{spite of the}} many noteworthy experimental and numerical investigations over the past decades, the turbine tip design presents numerous challenges to the engine manufacturers, and remains the primary factor defining the machine durability for the periodic removal of the turbine components during overhaul. Due to the hot gases coming from the upstream combustion chamber, the turbine blades are subjected to temperatures far above the metal creep temperature, combined with severe thermal stresses induced within the blade material. Inadequate designs cause early tip burnouts leading to considerable performance degradations, or even a catastrophic turbine failure. Moreover, the leakage spillage, nowadays often exceeding the transonic regime, generates large aerodynamic penalties which are responsible for about {{one third of the}} turbine losses. In this view, the current doctoral research exploits the potential through the modification and optimization of the blade tip shape as a means to control the tip leakage flow aerodynamics and manage the heat load distribution over the blade profile to improve the turbine efficiency and durability. ^ Three main design strategies for unshrouded turbine blade tips were analyzed and optimized: tight <b>running</b> <b>clearances,</b> blade tip contouring and the use of complex squealer-like geometries. The altered overtip flow physics and heat transfer characteristics were simulated for tight gap sizes as low as 0. 5 % down to 0. 1 % of the blade height, occurring during engine transients and soon to be expected due to recent developments in active clearance control strategies. The potential of fully 3 D contoured blade top surfaces, allowing to adapt the profile locally to the changing flow conditions throughout the camberline, is quantified. First adopting a quasi- 3 D approach and subsequently using a full 3 D optimization. For the industrial rub-safe squealer profiles featuring cavities separated by upstanding rims, a topology-like multi-objective 3 D optimization strategy is used to identify so far undiscovered, optimal blade tip profiles. Furthermore, the additional potential of the widely adopted shroud coolant injection just upstream of the rotor blade is examined. Specifically, the possibility of combining the beneficial effect of the purge flow in the overtip region while minimizing the detrimental influence on the upper passage vortex is explored. Eventually, a high-speed rotating turbine facility at the von Karman Institute was redesigned, allowing simultaneous testing of multiple distinct blade (tip) profiles mounted in separate sectors around the rotor annulus. Important considerations related with the balancing and precise clearance design are highlighted, arising from the complexity of such rainbow-rotor configuration. Moreover, approaches are described to integrate Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations to a priori estimate the errors induced by the finite spatial sampling and inherent limited sensor bandwidth. ^ This research effort provided new insights into the overtip flow topology and aerothermal characteristics, identified new design strategies to create future turbines with enhanced aerodynamic efficiencies and reduced thermal loads, and paved the way for an elaborate experimental validation in a rotating turbine facility, at engine-matched conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 151 The {{essential}} elements {{to be reviewed}} when considering a centrifugal pump application are highlighted. The purpose is to ensure the procurement and/or application of a centrifugal pump which optimizes reliability, energy usage, maintenance costs, and achieves this in a safe manner. The {{need to understand the}} system hydraulics and complete process requirements is emphasized, as is the impact each system parameter has on pump design. The test is broken into three basic areas: pump boundaries conditions, flow requirements, and pump specification ? key elements. Pump boundary conditions addressed NPSH considerations as they relate to flow requirements, potential for cavitation damage, suction specific speed, and mechanical seal temperature margin. This section also addresses system resistance variations, and addresses the effects of variations in dynamic and static system heads and the potential prime causes of variations in these heads. Flow requirements discusses the determination of normal, maximum (or rated), and minimum flow requirements. A method of approximation of a pump?s minimum acceptable flowrate is presented (based on the pump?s hydraulic specifications), which utilizes suction specific speed and moderating factors such as impeller head, NPSH margin, specific gravity, etc. Attention is paid to the effect of excessive specified flow on NPSHA, flow rangeability, and suction specific speed. Mechanical and hydraulic interrelationships are discussed to emphasize how flowrate variations affect radial and axial thrust, impeller suction and discharge recirculation, and potential for cavitation; also covered are the effect of variation in <b>running</b> <b>clearances</b> and changes in specific gravity. Critical aspects of both parallel and series pump application are addressed. The dangers of incorrect parallel pump application are highlighted and guidelines are offered for correct application of parallel pumps. Series pump operation is discussed primarily in terms of percentage split in pumps? combined total head, pump protection and system protection. Pump Specification ? Key Elements addresses communicating to prospective pump vendors the key parameters that may determine the metallurgy, mechanical seal design and mechanical seal peripheral?s design, and pump hydraulic design best suited to the user?s requirements. The liquid specification is highlighted, the important site and operating conditions are addressed, and the importance of clearly defining the key performance requirements in full is discussed. The wrong pump, operated incorrectly coupled with poor maintenance practices, results in unsatisfactory hydraulic performance, high energy costs, high maintenance costs, poor reliability, and increases the potential for an unsafe failure. Proper specification and selection principles, coupled with the implementation of correct operating and maintenance practices, will result in optimized centrifugal pump application. The net result will be a pumping application that meets all process demands, with a minimum of energy usage, and low frequency of repair (high reliability), low overall maintenance costs, and low process debits. Key hydraulic and Performance Criteria are addressed along with their effects on performance, energy, reliability, energy, reliability, maintenance costs, and safety. The interrelationships that exist between hydraulic characteristics and the mechanical reliability is highlighted to ensure that neither are treated separately...|$|R
40|$|Reliablemeans of {{predicting}} heat transfer in cavities adjacent to themain gas path {{are increasingly being}} sought by engineers involvedin the design of gas turbines. In this paper anup-dated analysis of the interim results from an extended researchprogramme, MAGPI, sponsored by the EU and several leading gasturbine manufactures and universities, will be presented. Extensive use ismade of CFD and FE modelling techniques to understand thethermo-mechanical behaviour and convective heat transfer of a turbine statorwell cavity, including the interaction of cooling air supply withthe main annulus gas. It {{is also important to}} establishthe hot <b>running</b> seal <b>clearances</b> for a full understanding ofthe cooling flow distribution and heat transfer in the cavity. The objective of the study has been to provide ameans of optimising the design of such cavities (see Figure 1) for maintaining a safe environment for critical parts, suchas disc rims and blade fixings, whilst maximising the turbineefficiency by means of reducing the fuel burn and emissionspenalties associated with the secondary airflow system.

40|$|To {{develop the}} high {{performance}} and high reliability of turbomachinery {{just like an}} aeroengine, distributed collaborative time-varying least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) (called as DC-T-LSSVM) method was proposed for the dynamic probabilistic analysis of high-pressure turbine blade-tip radial <b>running</b> <b>clearance</b> (BTRRC). For structural transient probabilistic analysis, time-varying LSSVM (called as T-LSSVM) method was developed by improving LSSVM, and the mathematical model of the T-LSSVM was established. The mathematical model of DC-T-LSSVM was built based on T-LSSVM and distributed collaborative strategy. Through the dynamic probabilistic analysis of BTRRC {{with respect to the}} nonlinearity of material property and the dynamics of thermal load and centrifugal force load, the probabilistic distributions and features of different influential parameters on BTRRC, such as rotational speed, the temperature of gas, expansion coefficients, the surface coefficients of heat transfer and the deformations of disk, blade and casing, are obtained. The deformations of turbine disk, blade and casing, the rotational speed and the temperature of gas significantly influence BTRRC. Turbine disk and blade perform the positive effects on the BTRRC, while turbine casing has the negative impact. The comparison of four methods (Monte Carlo method, T-LSSVM, DCERSM and DC-T-LSSVM) reveals that the DC-T-LSSVM reshapes the possibility of the probabilistic analysis of complex turbomachinery and improves the computational efficiency while preserving the accuracy. The efforts offer a useful insight for rapidly designing and optimizing the BTRRC dynamically from a probabilistic perspective. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} here quantifies the forces {{applied to the}} main bearings of three six-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines and reviews their exciting properties in both time and frequency domains. The engine structure response at the bearing supports and the outer surfaces are correlated. Vibration acceleration was measured, in the three different directions, at the engine main bearings and the outer surface. The liner vibrations were also measured. A theoretical model for calculating the bearing forces and estimating the bearing moment characteristics is proposed. The calculated bearing forces are investigated in both time and frequency domains. The characteristics of the forces driving the piston across the cylinder clearance are calculated. The characteristics of the forces acting on the liner by the piston are also calculated. Combining {{the results of the}} measurements with the theoretical model for force calculation, a technique for estimating the actual <b>running</b> <b>clearance</b> of the piston is presented. A technique for deriving the displacement from the measured acceleration is developed. By representing the engine response in terms of displacement it is possible to recognise the applied force time history and thus the identification of the specific parts of the engine structure primarily excited by moments and by direct force. It is shown that the engine structure response is a transient phenomenon and is maximum {{in the vicinity of the}} applied force. The displacement technique for quantifying engine response provides detailed information of the distortion of the running engine enabling the prediction of mechanical inputs which control the turbocharged engine noise...|$|E
40|$|Gasturbine engine {{performance}} requires effective and reliable internal cooling overthe duty {{cycle of the}} engine. Life predictions for rotatingcomponents subject to the main gas path temperatures are vital. This demands increased precision in the specification of the internalair system flows which provide turbine stator well cooling andsealing. This in turn requires detailed knowledge of the flowrates through rim seals and interstage labyrinth seals. Knowledge ofseal movement and clearances at operating temperatures is of greatimportance when prescribing these flows. A test facility has beendeveloped at the University of Sussex, incorporating a two stageturbine rated at 400 kW with an individual stage pressureratio of 1. 7 : 1. The mechanical design of the test facilityallows internal cooling geometry to be rapidly reconfigured, while coolingflow rates of between 0. 71 C W,ENT and 1. 46 CW,ENT, maybe set to allow ingress or egress dominated cavity flows.

40|$|Engine {{components}} are commonly {{exposed to air}} temperatures exceeding the thermal material limit {{in order to increase}} the overall engine performance and to maximise the engine specific fuel consumption. To prevent the overheating of the materials and thus the reduction of the component life, an internal flow system must be designed to cool the critical engine parts and to protect them. As the coolant flow is bled from the compressor and not used for the combustion an important goal is to minimise the amount of coolant in order to optimise the overall engine performance. Predicting the metal temperatures is of paramount importance as they are a major factor in determining the component stresses and lives. In addition, as modern engines operate in ever harsher conditions due to efficiency requirements, the ability to predict thermo-mechanical displacements becomes very relevant: on the one hand, to prevent damage of components due to excessive rubbing, on the other hand, to understand how much air is flowing internally within the secondary air system for cooling and sealing purposes, not only in the design condition but throughout the engine life-span. In order to achieve this aero-engine manufacturers aim to use more and more accurate numerical techniques requiring multi-physics models, including thermo-mechanical finite elements and CFD models, which can be coupled in order to investigate small variations in temperatures and displacements. This thesis shows a practical application and extension of a numerical methodology for predicting conjugate heat transfer. Extensive use is made of FEA (solids) and CFD (fluid) modeling techniques to understand the thermo-mechanical behaviour of a turbine stator well cavity, due to the interaction of cooling air supply with the main annulus. Previous work based on the same rig showed diffculties in matching predictions to thermocouple measurements near the rim seal gap. In this investigation, further use is made of existing measurements of hot <b>running</b> seal <b>clearances</b> in the rig. The structural deflections are applied to the existing model to evaluate the impact in flow interactions and heat transfer. Furthermore, for one test case unsteady CFD simulations are conducted in order {{to take into account the}} flow unsteadiness in the heat transfer predictions near the rim. In addition to a baseline test case without net ingestion, a case simulating engine deterioration with net ingestion is validated against the available test data, also taking into account cold and hot <b>running</b> seal <b>clearances.</b> Furthermore an additional geometry with a stationary deflector plate is modelled and validated for the same flow cases. Experiments as well as numerical simulations have shown that due to the deflector plate the cooling flow is fed more directly into the disc boundary layer, allowing more effective use of less cooling air, leading to improved engine efficiency. Therefore, the deflector plate geometry is embedded in a CFD-based automated optimisation loop to further reduce the amount of cooling air. The optimisation strategy concentrates on a flexible design parameterisation of the cavity geometry with deflector plate and its implementation in an automatic 3 D meshing system with respect of finally executing an automated design optimisation. Special consideration is given to the flexibility of the parameterisation method in order to reduce design variables to a minimum while also increasing the design space flexibility & generality. The parameterised geometry is optimised using a metamodel-assisted approach based on regressing Kriging in order to identify the optimum position and orientation of the deflector plate inside the cavity. The outcome of the optimisation is validated using the benchmarked FEA-CFD coupling methodology...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new Additive Manufacturing techniques helps to overtake design constrains characterizing the standard processes. This new reality can opens the space to the redesign of more efficient aircraft engine components. The engine turbine labyrinth seal honeycomb land is currently obtained shaping and welding a sheet metal to create an hexagon pattern. The employing of the DMLM additive manufacturing could led to the {{development of}} new geometries, different from the standard honeycomb land, able to increase the labyrinth sealing performances. In this research, innovative stator patterns, able to reduce the seal leakage mass flow rate, have been investigated. The identification of innovative lining pattern cell shapes has been performed by using numerical CFD analyses. The selection of the innovative lining pattern cell shapes has been performed among all numerical solutions investigated. The most promising solutions have been then experimentally verified. Firstly, a dedicated work has been accomplished, to verify whether ANSYS CFX code was capable of predicting labyrinth seal performances adequately in terms of mass flow leakage. Then, a dedicated simplified model has been developed, in order to explore the performances of new designs with a reasonable computational cost. An extended CFD analysis, on the honeycomb stepped labyrinth seal, has been performed, in order to investigate the stator part geometrical parameters affecting the discharge coefficient. A one-at-a-time approach has been employed, to investigate: cell wall thickness, cell depth, cell diameter and fin tip thickness. Moreover, the effect of varying the fin tip and cell relative position has been evaluated. Numerical results, for both convergent and divergent flow conditions, have been obtained and analyzed in terms of leakage variations. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data available in the literature. The analysis has highlighted the cell diameter as the most influencing geometrical parameter, for honeycomb labyrinth seal stator part. In order to define innovative stator lining cell shapes, some assumptions for the honeycomb labyrinth seal rubbing and thermal behaviors have been employed. Nineteen solutions have been numerically investigated, by leveraging on the knowledge in simulations acquired from the previous activity. A numerical model, of a double fin straight honeycomb labyrinth seal, able to reproduce engine conditions, has been implemented. CFD results have shown how the rhomboidal geometry could give a sensible improvement in the sealing performances. Two of the rhomboidal shapes analyzed have been flow tested, on a static rig, that was reproducing the same labyrinth seal geometry numerically investigated. The test samples have been manufactured by using the DMLM technique at 1 x scale. The measurements performed, for several <b>running</b> <b>clearances</b> and pressure ratios, are then compared with the standard honeycomb seal data and numerical pre-test predictions. The rhomboidal cells thermal response has been tested in a facility available at the Energy Department of the Politecnico di Torino. The test rig is able to reproduce the outer band static part of a low pressure turbine stage and the blade tip labyrinth seal. It is working at high temperature and has been dimensioned in order to reproduce, in engine similitude, the non-dimensional numbers ruling LPT turbines thermal phenomena. The test article has been designed by integrating the innovative cells into the complete stepped shroud design. The part has been manufactured by means of DMLM technique. The results of the heat transfer model, reproducing the low pressure turbine test rig thermal behavior, have been compared with experimental data. Finally, the rubbing behavior, of innovative solutions, has been verified performing a rubbing test and comparing measurements with standard solution data...|$|R
