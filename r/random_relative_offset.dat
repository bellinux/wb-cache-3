40|$|The {{collision}} channel without feedback (CCw/oFB) model {{introduced by}} Massey and Mathys, depicts a {{scenario in which}} M users share a thermal noise-free communication channel with <b>random</b> <b>relative</b> time <b>offsets</b> among their clocks. This paper considers an extension of this model, which allows the receiver to use successive interference cancellation (SIC) to iteratively cancel the interference caused by those collided packets that have been decoded by the receiver. As the main result of this paper, we derive the zero-error capacity region of this channel in the slot-synchronous case, and present a zero-error capacity achieving scheme by joint protocol sequences and channel coding design. It is shown that the {{negative impact on the}} zero-error capacity {{due to a lack of}} time synchronization can be removed by the help of SIC. Moreover, we characterize the protocol sequences that can be used to achieve zero-error capacity 1 [packets/slot] by proving new results on shift-invariant sequences and throughput-invariant sequences; these sequences have been known to achieve zero-error capacity for the basic CCw/oFB model without SIC. This characterization sheds light on the minimum sequence period required in order to attain zero-error capacity 1. Comment: 21 pages, 3 figures, submitted to IEEE Trans. Inf. Theor...|$|R

40|$|Accurate clock {{synchronization}} {{is essential in}} the operation of networks. In applications in which it can be performed frequently, the process generally relies upon the estimation of the <b>relative</b> <b>offset</b> of two different clocks. However, due to limited power resources in Wireless Sensor Networks, it cannot be performed often. Thus in order to obtain a longer lasting synchronization, the relative frequency of two clocks is also estimated. In the literature, there are estimators for <b>relative</b> <b>offset</b> and frequency based on a variety of techniques including graphical methods, maximum likelihood estimation, and least squares estimation. However, there has been no extensive study to compare the performance of these estimators. In this dissertation, the existing estimators are examined in detail and several alternative least squares-based estimators are developed and compared with the existing estimators in an exhaustive study. Although there is a large literature on estimating <b>relative</b> <b>offset</b> and frequency, there is little to no research regarding inference. This topic is of potentially great importance because it may possibly lead to limiting unneeded synchronization, resulting in better conservation of network power resources. Recent work has focused on the construction of confidence intervals for <b>relative</b> <b>offset</b> and while it does not address relative frequency, it is an important first step towards developing procedures that do. In this work, it has been assumed that the network delays that occur during the synchronization process are independent, but this may not be appropriate in all applications. The network delays are often modeled as independent exponential random variables. Thus to improve upon the existing confidence interval methodology, in this dissertation the use of bivariate exponential distributions is introduced to capture the anticipated correlation between the network delays. Moreover, an alternative confidence interval procedure for offset is developed and is then used to illustrate how the assumption of independent network delays can potentially lead to improper inference about <b>relative</b> <b>offset...</b>|$|R
