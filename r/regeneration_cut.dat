Management actions can have a detrimental effect on wildlife populations and ecosystem processes. Using woodland salamanders as model organisms, we investigated differences between mature, thinned, and clear cut forests in the summers of 2000, 2001, and 2005. In 2005 we added sites from a recent <b>regeneration</b> <b>cut</b> where residual leave had been intentionally left on the ground. We compared light intensity and temperature between four treatments: open, fenced, tree tops (a layer of woody debris), and wood piles and in the plots established in 2000. Mature forests had higher salamander counts than thinned forests, and thinned forests had higher salamander counts than clear cut forests. Daily light and temperature fluctuations in clear cut areas were significantly higher than in thinned plots. In the regeneration plots, daily light and temperature fluctuations decreased as level of ground cover increased. Open plots had the most variable conditions, whereas piles were the most moderate. Tree tops were found to be effective at moderating environmental conditions. The type of forest management affects environmental conditions and salamander populations.

In Italy, gap cutting has been successfully tested for introducing the natural regeneration of native species into softwood plantations, thus accelerating the transition towards climax hardwood stands. Depending on plantation types and conditions, gap cutting should be started at an age between 70 and 80 years and the system should include at least 12 to 15 gaps, {{in order to produce}} enough wood to cover costs. Generally, natural regeneration is firmly established within 5 - 7 years from treatment. Gap cutting also offers superior results to selection thinning, the latter producing about 35 % less value and incurring 25 % to 30 % more costs.

40|$|Increased forest {{vulnerability}} {{is being}} reflected as more widespread and severe drought-induced decline episodes. In particular, the Mediterranean area is revealing a high susceptibility to phenomena of loss in tree vitality across species. Within tree species, oaks (Quercus spp.) are experiencing extensive decline in many countries. However, {{in the wake}} of the so-called â 8 ̆ 09 ̆coak decline phenomenonâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆d, the attention on these species has generally been limited. In this paper, we review the current available literature on oakdecline cases reported within the Mediterranean Basin, with particular remark for those occurred in Italy and Spain. More specifically our main aims were to: (i) provide an update on the patterns and mechanisms of decline by focusing on tree-ring and wood-anatomical variables; (ii) provide some hints for improving the resistance and resilience of oak stands experiencing decline. Our review reveals that drought is reported as the main driver triggering oak decline within the Mediterranean Basin, although other causes (i. e., increasing temperature, pathogens attack or excessive stand density) could exacerbate decline. In most reported cases, drought induced a substantial reduction of growth and changes in some wood anatomical properties. Indeed, growth decline prior death is also indicated as an early-warning signal of impending death. In ring-porous oak species, declining trees were often characterized by a very low production of latewood and a decrease in lumen area of the widest earlywood vessels, suggesting a potential reduction of hydraulic conductivity. Moreover, hydraulic dysfunction is reported as the main cause of decline. Finally, regarding management actions that should be considered for improving the resilience of declining stands and preserve the species-specific stand composition, it could be useful to shorten the rotation period of coppice stands or promoting their gradual conversion towards high forests, and favoring more drought-resistant species should also be considered. In addition, regeneration prior to <b>regeneration</b> <b>cuts</b> should be improved by anticipating seed dispersal or by planting oak seedlings obtained from local germoplasm...|$|R

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. John R. Faaborg. Some late-successional birds shift habitat-use from mature forestbreeding habitat to early-successional habitat. Management efforts have primarily focused on breeding habitat for migratory songbirds, but the post-breeding period could be equally important given that birds can spend an equal or greater {{amount of time in}} this stage. More information is needed to determine how widespread this habitat shift is for mature forest-breeding birds. In species such as the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), and Worm-Eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum) all hatchyear birds appear to disperse to early-successional vegetation. Netting studies have captured other species of forest-breeding birds in <b>regeneration</b> <b>cuts</b> and report higher captures of mature forest species than early-successional species in this habitat in the post-breeding season. The presence of mature forest birds in early-successional habitat does not mean that it is a requirement during their annual cycle.

We measured understory light and crown openness and verified that our forest radiative transfer model well captured the variability of understory light among the studied stands (R 2 = 87 %).

At this age oligodendrocytes, myelin, and astrocytes develop and regeneration ceases to occur. The role of myelin-associated neurite growth-inhibitory proteins, which increase in concentration at 10 - 13 days, was investigated in culture by applying the antibody IN- 1, which blocks their effects. In the presence of IN- 1, 22 out of 39 preparations from animals aged 13 - 17 days showed clear outgrowth of processes into crushes. When 34 preparations from 13 -day-old animals were crushed and cultured without antibody, no axons grew into the lesion. The success rate with IN- 1 was comparable to that seen in younger animals but the outgrowth was less profuse. IN- 1 was shown by immunocytochemistry to penetrate the spinal cord. Other antibodies which penetrated the 13 -day cord failed to promote fiber outgrowth. To distinguish between <b>regeneration</b> by <b>cut</b> neurites and outgrowth by developing uncut neurites, fibers in the ventral fasciculus were prelabeled with carbocyanine dyes and subsequently injured. The presence of labeled fibers in the lesion indicated that IN- 1 promoted regeneration. These results show that the development of myelin-associated growth-inhibitory proteins contributes to the loss of regeneration as the mammalian central nervous system matures.

Different cells emanate different proteins, but the ones specific to the peripheral nervous system {{play a major role}} in <b>regeneration</b> of <b>cut</b> nerves in the peripheral nervous system.In relation to reinnervation, neurotrophic support is key in assisting with supporting the regeneration of axons. Some discussion has led investigators to believe that neurotrophic factors only led to more axonal sprouting rather than actually influencing the regeneration. The ability of neurotrophic factors to influence the sprouting of axons has been seen with electron microscopic images and in multiple studies extensively detailed in a review of the role of neurotrophic factors in regeneration. In addition to the ability of the factors to influence sprouting, Schwann cells in particular show a significant upregulation of a number of trophic factors after undergoing axotomy. One major difference in motor and sensory pathways is the difference in what trophic factors are upregulated by the Schwann cells of those pathways. Denervenated motor Schwann cells upregulate BDNF and p75, whereas sensory pathway Schwann cells upregulate a number of other varied trophic factors. This difference in trophic factor support is suspected to be a major influencer of preferential motor reinnervation.Though it is a major factor, inherent molecular differences do not alone determine the reinnervation pathway of the motor neurons, as demonstrated in a study done in a mouse femoral nerve, where the size of the pathways were manipulated, leading to incorrect motor axon pathway reinnervation.|$|R

To explore the putative causal link between Hox expression and craniofacial morphology, we produced a specific series of bilateral crest deletions in chick embryos and assessed branchial arch morphology, Hox gene expression, and patterning of skeletal structures in the postoperative embryo. Surprisingly, we found that deletion of the bulk of the rhombencephalic crest and substantial portions of the dorsal rhombencephalon did not prevent normal branchial arch morphogenesis and normal patterns of Hox gene (-A 3 and -B 4) expression 48 h after operation.

An appealing therapeutic option is induction of endogenous lung regeneration using retinoic acid (RA), demonstrated to stimulate alveolar regeneration in animal models of emphysema. However, clinical trials investigating retinoids for chronic lung diseases have been disappointing. Thus, there is a profound stimulus {{to understand how the}} regeneration-inducing effects of RA in animal models translate to man. The molecular regulation of RA signalling in emphysema has not been investigated hitherto, and the role of RA in repair of specific human alveolar cell types, alveolar type 2 cells and lung microvascular endothelial cells, is unknown. Work in this thesis was conducted to address these questions. We demonstrated that CYP 26 A 1, which breaks down RA, is enriched on an mRNA and protein level in emphysematous lung tissue. We also demonstrated using in vitro cell culture assays that RA is unlikely to directly regulate alveolar epithelial wound healing.

In some areas, forest managers {{may be able to}} benefit from loggers with experience in selective harvesting in other settings, such as exploitation cuttings that selectively removed only the highest value trees. Using inexperienced loggers and unsuitable machinery that is not designed for partial harvest operations increases the probability of inadequate prescription application and harvesting damage to residual trees (Jones and Thomas 2004; Putz et al. 2008), both outcomes that can reinforce a perception that alternative silvicultural approaches are inoperable. The damage to retained trees can be very high also in regions with a longer tradition of uneven-aged forest management (Nill et al. 2011). Moreover, advanced <b>regeneration</b> is often <b>cut</b> to improve the visibility for machine operators during harvest procedures or damaged during skidding or forwarding operations (Newton and Cole 2006).

However, there are notable exceptions, for example where logs are thrown downhill by forest workers through forests on steep slopes, as has been practiced in some parts of China (J.

In the present study we tested for physiological correlates of synaptic disruption. Anesthetized adult rats were studied 6 mo or more after a muscle nerve was severed and surgically rejoined. We recorded action potentials (spikes) from individual muscle afferents classified as IA like (*IA) by several criteria and tested for their capacity to produce excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in homonymous motoneurons, using spike-triggered averaging (STA). Nearly every paired recording from a *IA afferent and homonymous motoneuron (93 %) produced a STA EPSP in normal rats, but that percentage was only 17 % in rats with regenerated nerves. In addition, the number of motoneurons that produced aggregate excitatory stretch synaptic potentials (eSSPs) in response to stretch of the reinnervated muscle was reduced from 100 % normally to 60 % after nerve regeneration. The decline in functional connectivity was not attributable to synaptic depression, which returned to its normally low level after regeneration. From these findings {{and those in the}} companion paper, we put forward a model in which synaptic excitation of motoneurons by muscle stretch is reduced not only by misguided axon regeneration that reconnects afferents to the wrong receptor type but also by retraction of synapses with motoneurons by spindle afferents that successfully reconnect with spindle receptors in the periphery...|$|R

In Croatia, the research area consisted of forest administrations of Zagreb, Koprivnica, Karlovac, Plitvice Lakes National Park and Žumberak – Samoborsko Gorje Nature Park, and outside Croatia it included Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Slovakia and Slovenia (Fig. 1). This paper {{presents the results of}} research into small scale regeneration of common beech in the form of groups (Fig. 2, Table 1), using the example of a Dinaric montane beech forest (as. Lamio orvalae-Fagetum /Ht. 1938 / Borhidi 1963) and small-stand regeneration, using the example of a beech forest with sedge (as. Carici pilosae-Fagetum Oberforfer 1957). Natural regeneration in virgin beech stands begins in the form of clusters and groups (Fig. 3 and 4, Table 2). This regeneration method can be applied in special purpose forests and in protection forests, since it forms structurally diverse stands that will satisfy non-market forest goods and services of these forests. It is also suitable for private forest owners because not only does it enable the concentration of treatments in small areas, but also allows the planning of a continuous yield. Small scale <b>regeneration</b> with shelterwood <b>cuts</b> in large complexes of managed forests is both possible and desirable. Regeneration over small areas at the level of small (1 – 3 ha) and medium (3 – 5 ha) stands has proven successful (Fig. 5, Table 3). Compared with classical regular management over large areas, small scale management is a closer-to-nature and more intensive management method. It requires the construction of a silvicultural plan that contains a map of initial regeneration gaps and directions of its expansion. Silvicultural treatments are applied simultaneously, but {{in different parts of the}} regeneration area. This type of management alleviates the application and supervision of silvicultural treatments and enables long-term and continuous planning of the felling cut...|$|R
40|$|Since bellyache bush invaded to East Timor it has {{significantly}} reduced crop and animal production and consequential {{loss of income}} from farm enterprises. Methods of control of bellyache bush chosen should be appropriate to the poor economic position of the farmers. An integrated method of controlling bellyache bush involving slashing combined with mulching and or burning is low cost and is widely used by the Timorese farmers. Although these practices are commonly used to control weeds, {{there are still many}} problems that appear in the field during and after weed control. For instance, rapid <b>regeneration</b> of <b>cut</b> stems and production of less fuel than mixed stands to support burning management. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} investigate mechanical control such as cutting stems at different heights and cutting stems at different heights in combination with mulch, handpulling and mulching of small plants and mulching of seedlings. This study also investigates bellyache bush properties as a fuel for burning management in the late dry season to control its infestations. Mechanical control of bellyache bush plants was undertaken south of Darwin at Acacia (12 º 45 ’S, 131 º 09 ’E) which has an annual average rainfall of 1588. 1 mm and Channel Island (12 º 33 ’S, 130 º 51 ’E) which has annual rainfall of 1713. 9 mm. This study was conducted from January 2007 to February 2008. All bellyache bush plants were cut off at different heights according to treatment 0 cm (ground level), 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm and uncut plants considered as a control. The results indicated that all cutting treatments achieved 100 % mortality under low canopy cover, irrespective of season. While, under high canopy cover bellyache bush plants only achieved 100 % mortality if cut at 0 cm and 10 cm height. Stems cut at 20 cm, 30 cm and 40 cm heights re-sprouted in the dry season. Hand-pulling completely killed small plants while mulching did not. Mulching achieved a partial kill of seedlings however it stimulated seedling emergence in the wet season, irrespective of site. The use of bellyache bush as a fuel for burning management was studied. The study was undertaken at Channel Island, Acacia and Katherine (14 º 22 ’S, 132 º 09 ’E). The latter has a mean annual rainfall of 875 mm. All bellyache bush plants in the plot were cut in May. Five 1 m x 1 m quadrat samples were selected within a 10 m x 10 m plot to measure wet weight and dry weight for the curing rate calculation. In addition, 15 of the cut stems were randomly selected to measure re-sprouting. From five randomly selected 25 cm x 25 cm quadrat samples were taken to calculate the weight of fine fuel (less than 6 mm in diameter), medium (6 mm- 25 mm) and coarse (greater than 25 mm). Heat yield of fuel combustion of this material was calculated by using a bomb calorimeter (As 10 - 38. 5 leco 350 calorimeters). The results indicated that cut stems of bellyache bush from a low canopy cover site had 7 percent moisture content while stems from a high canopy cover site had a 66 percent moisture content by the end of the dry season. The proportion of these stems in the site with low canopy cover re-sprouted significantly less than those in the high canopy cover site. The fuel load at bellyache bush monoculture had less fine, medium and coarse fuel compared with tropical savanna fuel. However, results from this study indicated that it had a similar heat yield of combustion to other plants in the tropical savanna. A study of the use of fire as a control tool for bellyache bush was undertaken at Acacia and Katherine from May 2007 to February 2008. This study was carried out on established plants of bellyache bush. The experiment was undertaken in three 10 m X 10 m plots at each of the two sites. The experiment consisted of three treatments namely: cutting stems at 30 cm and followed by burning, uncut plants plus burning and unburnt plants considered as a control. Each of 20 pieces of bellyache bush stems were randomly selected for fine 0 - 6 mm, medium 6 - 25 mm and coarse 25 mm fuel. All these pieces were weighed before and after fire to calculate fuel consumption. Fire intensity was calculated by using Byram’s fire intensity equation. Fifteen soil temperature sensors were buried under uncut plants before burning. After burning all soil temperature sensors were dug out the temperature read and used to calculate fire temperature. Plant mortality was calculated by counting live bellyache bush plants before and after fire. Seed germination and seed recruitment was calculated by counting all seedlings within five 1 m x 1 m randomly chosen quadrats. The results show that fire consumed all bellyache bush stems in the late dry season burning. Fire intensity of bellyache bush fuels was quite low compared to other tropical savanna fuel. Soil temperatures ranged between 54. 17 ºC to 126. 13 ºC. All bellyache bush plants were completely killed by the fire treatment, but fire stimulated seedling emergence in the following wet season. It was concluded from the results of the experiments that mechanical control slashing system may provide a suitable fuel for the burning management if cut early in the dry season. By late in the dry season bellyache bush plants cut early in the dry season have a low moisture content are completely cured and able to support fire spread of adequate intensity to destroy the plants...|$|R
40|$|Die vorliegende Diplomarbeit ist eingebunden in das Projekt „Managementplan Wörschacher Moos und Ennsnahe Bereiche“ (THURNER et al. 2011), einer Zusammenarbeit des Büros für Ökologie und Naturschutz coopNATURA und der Universität Wien. Das Wörschacher Moos ist ein entwässertes sauer-oligotrophes Talbodenhochmoor im mittleren steirischen Ennstal und mit einer Ausdehnung von 284 ha das größte Hochmoor Österreichs. Die 2009 erfolgte Untersuchung der Vegetation und Moorlebensräume (Biotop- und FFH-Lebensraumtypenkartierung, Vegetationsaufnahmen) sowie sämtliche Ergebnisse der hy-drologischen Untersuchung (manuelle und automatische Wasserstandsmessungen, Entwässerungssystem auf Basis des digitalen Höhenmodells) gaben Aufschluss über den Ist-Zustand des Moores und wurden als Grundlage für ein Managementkonzept des Moores herangezogen. Außerdem wurden die bei der Freilandarbeit angewandten Methoden und Hilfsmittel (beispielsweise das digitale Höhenmodell, welches die Geländearbeit sowie die Untersuchung des Entwässerungssystems enorm erleichterte) bzw. die durchgeführten Auswertungen (z. B. Zeigerwertanalyse vs. hydrologische Ergebnisse) in Zusammenhang mit dem Thema Moorschutz bzw. Moorregeneration ausführlich diskutiert. Aus den hydrologischen Untersuchungen geht hervor, dass sich spontane Regenerationsstadien in Torfstichen und verlandenden Gräben einstellten, wo Wasserstände von 0 bis 20 cm u. F. gegeben sind. Die niedrigeren und stark schwankenden Wasserstände der offenen Hochmoorweite liegen für die Torfbildung zu niedrig (bis 59 cm u. F.) bzw. zeigen auch die Moorwasserstände der Latschenhochmoore im Osten des Moores (bis 34 cm u. F.) die hydrologische Beeinträchtigung an. Es werden jedoch alle Voraussetzungen für die Re-generationsmöglichkeit des Moores erfüllt: 1.) Die Ergebnisse der Zeigerwertanalyse bzw. Wasserstandsmessungen lassen darauf schließen, dass in den Moorbiotopen des Wörschacher Mooses durchwegs hochmoortypische Verhältnisse (niedrige pH-Werte, Nährstoffarmut, hohe Wasserstände in den Torfstichen) vorherrschen. 2.) Durch das geringe Gefälle des Moores kann durch Schließung der Hauptgräben sowie durch Entkusselungsmaßnahmen bei vergleichsweise geringem Aufwand der Moorwasserspiegel angehoben werden. 3.) Da das hochmoortypische Arteninventar über das gesamte Gebiet inselartig in den Regenerationskomplexen vorhanden ist, besteht eine gute Möglichkeit der Wiederbesiedelung der Hochmoorweite mit torfbildender Vegetation nach Wiedervernässungsmaßnahmen. Es wird nachdrücklich darauf hingewiesen, dass eine Maßnahmensetzung dringend notwendig ist, um den {{negative}}n Konsequenzen des nach wie vor hydrologisch wirksamen Entwässerungssystems entgegenzuwirken. Durch einmaliges Eingreifen (=Durchführung der vorgeschlagenen Maßnahmen) ist es möglich, die negative Entwicklung des Moores zu stoppen und eine natürliche Regeneration einzuleiten. {{thesis is}} part of a feasibility study about the rehabilitation of Woerschacher Moos, carried out by the environmental bureau “coopNATURA” in cooperation with the University of Vienna. Woerschacher Moos is a completely drained valley bog, located in {{the central part of the}} Enns valley, Styria, and with an extension of 284 ha the largest bog in Austria. Goal of the study was a management plan based on hydrological and vegetation data derived from a vegetation map of the area worthy of restoration measures in combination with automatic water level recordings and manually read out dipwell data and a digital terrain elevation model. Furthermore, the applied methods and materials (e. g. the facilitated field work due to the digital elevation model) as well as the data interpretation/analysis (e. g. indicator analysis vs. hydrological results) were discussed with regard to mire conservation and <b>regeneration.</b> In peat <b>cuts</b> and ditches where the water table is close to the surface (0 – 20 cm below surface) the vegetation has spontaneously developed into typical hollow vegetation with some peat accumulation, whereas in the central open part of the mire the low water table (59 cm below surface) combined with a high water table fluctuation caused heath vegetation with almost no mire plants and peat decomposition instead of peat accumulation. The water table of the pine bogs in the eastern part of the mire (34 cm below surface) also indicates a disturbed hydrology and the lack of peat accumulation. Due to the following aspects there is still a good chance for a successful rehabilitation: 1.) The results of the indicator analysis of the vegetation and the hydrological conditions of the peat cuts and drains indicate that the site has potential to rehabilitate if the hydrology can be repaired. 2) Due to the low inclination of the slope fewer efforts are necessary to rise the water level with restoration measures such as building dams into the ditches or removing trees and shrubs. 3.) There is still a reasonable amount of mire vegetation such as peat-mosses and sedges left in the whole area to recolonize the degraded mire surface after rewetting. Taking measures is strongly recommended to counter the negative consequences of the drainage system which is still effective. By taking the proposed measures once only it is possible to improve the hydrological conditions within the bog area and to initiate regeneration. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{item was}} {{digitized}} by the Internet Archive. Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe problem of regeneration {{has to do}} with the phenomenon of growth resulting in a restoration of an old form of a mutilated organism. The process, the stimuli and factors causing it, and the effect of agents upon regeneration in the lower metazoa were discussed. The sponger, the simpxest multicellular animals, can after dissociation reconstitute the whole organism again. The arcnaeocytes were found to have tne most important role in regeneration, differentiating into gonocytes, scieroblasts, colienocytes and desmacytes, thus giving rise to the mesenchyme ana skeleton of the new sponge. The pinacocytes formed the dermal membrane and lining of the canals, while the choanocytes gave rise to the flagellated chamoers. Aggregates were formed by the amoeboid activity of the arcnaeocytes within eighteen to twenty-four hours after dissociation. On the third day after dissociation the flagellated chambers appeared, and on the fourth and fifth aays, canals appeared. Development after dissociation was then completed. Dissociated cells from different species (Microciona and Clicna) coalesce and form aggregates only with cells of their own species. The dissociated cells will not coalesce and form aggregates in pure sodium or potassium chloride solutions. The cells were also found to be sensitive to increases in osmotic pressure. Hydra, turned inside out, will regain their normal organization of the rearrangement of endoaermal ana ectodermal cells migrating in opposite directions through the mesoglea. Ectodermal or endodermal layers of hydra cultured alone do not regenerate due to the inability of one cell type to differentiate into the cell type of the other layer. Dissociated cells of hydra will fuse and form aggregates only when the three body layers are present. The pieces of a hydra must measure more than one-sixth of a millimeter in diameter to regenerate. Size also determines the number of tentacles, and the size of the hypostome formed on the regenerant. Various sections of hydra and grafts also form regenerated individuals, although in some cases the results are abnormal. The determination and organization of new polarities depended upon the rate of metabolism incorporated in the regenerating mass. In Tubularia, removal of the perisarc stimulates <b>regeneration,</b> as the <b>cut</b> end is then cathed with more oxygen. The more coenosarc exposed to oxygen the greater is the activation to form hydranth tissue. When there is an increase in the oxygen consumption there is also an increase in the rate of regeneration. The hydranth forms in relation to the oxygen supply with the oral end of the regenerant at the point of highest oxygen tension. The rate of regeneration can be measured at any level under various conditions wnen the formula R=πr^ 2 n/t is used. Exposure of the coenosarc to sea water obliterates the already existing gradients in the stem and thus the regenerating coenosarc fragments form new polarities. The theory of dominance seems to be best explained by the transportation of substances theory, in whicn there are differences in the stem, "E", present in highest concentration at the distal end and lowest at the proximal end. There is also another factor in the stem "S", which may or may not inhibit regeneration depending on the rate of regeneration when "E" is forming new hydranths. Eudendrium and Pennaria cells fuse after dissociation in much the same manner as sponges and hydra. Light is essential for the regeneration of hydranths in Pennaria, but not for Eudendrium. Direct x-radiation inhibited regeneration of Pennaria, but screened colonies connected to those colonies radiated, did regenerate new hydranths. Podocoryne and Hydractinia are also capable of regenerating polyps. Gonionemus shows incomplete regeneration. Mnemiopsis leidyi, a ctenophore, regenerated plate rows, canal connections, and apical organs, depending on the manner in which they were cut. There was found to be no physiological gradient in Mnemiopsis. Polychoerus is the simplest flatworm to stimulate to regenerative activity as these worms have no central nervous system to influence regeneration. Many types of regeneration have been produced from stimulation of planarians to regenerate. The smallest and most irregular pieces have the capability of forming new individuals. The extensive powers of regeneration of this group are due to the localization and differentiation of the formative cells, which are found in the mesoderm. The polyclads will regenerate complete individuals from pieces taken from any part of the oody. The triclads will restore missing anterior parts onxy when the cephalic ganglia are present.
