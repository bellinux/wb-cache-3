50|$|Burke distinguishes {{man from}} other animals by drawing an analogy {{between man and}} birds. He argues that unlike birds, which cannot <b>use</b> <b>symbols</b> to communicate, man is able to use {{language}} towards pragmatic ends. To illustrate this point, Burke recalls seeing a bird trapped inside a college classroom. The windows were open, but the bird kept flying upwards to the ceiling, rather than through the window. If the bird could <b>use</b> <b>symbols</b> to communicate then one could simply inform the bird of the open windows and it could fly out to freedom. Its natural instinct to fly up coupled by its inability to <b>use</b> <b>symbols,</b> however, prevents its escape. Burke, also argues that not only does man <b>use</b> <b>symbols,</b> but concedes that man makes and misuses symbols as well.|$|R
