The problem has a large number of complex constraints, many of which contain a large number of non-linear decision boundaries. It is a NP-hard problem that is rarely addressed in its full form. The model put forth by SNCF <b>railway</b> <b>body</b> in France encompasses a very realistic form of the problem from a business, environmental, and efficiency perspective. A hyper-heuristic approach was taken to tackle the problem, and a solver was designed and implemented using a multi-Stage hyper-heuristic.

The solver produced a good number of feasible solutions using a small set of low-level-heuristics. The results were compared to those of other solvers competing in the ROADEF 2014 challenge organized by SNCF.

In present time there is the modern trend in this domain the build-up and extend the quality safety and functional cycle paths and routes which should contribute to support at the progressive cycle transport intensity increase. The evident key question of the next cycle transport development is sufficient financial means for the build-up of cycle paths and cycle routes. Classical home sources are public and regional budgets though limited and mostly are not managing financing all costs. But they are acceptable as one of several financial services. The most notable home source is the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure which provides a year considerable finance means for the build-up of cycle paths and cycle routes. In 2009 SFTI budget proposition is set 180 million crowns aside for these purposes the contribution can be provided for project up to 65 % of relevant costs. The rules {{make it possible to}} co financing the projects which have received grants from EU Structural Funds. The foreign source is first of all EU Structural Funds.

Alike as in last period there are set similar conditions of the grant namely that of these ROP there can be financing maximum 85 % of relevant costs. Except for the financial scope the cycle support can be even a layout cycle paths and cycle routes at railway bodies after cancelled railway´s tracks whose parameters are similar as cycle paths or (if you like) routes parameters and then the reconstruction of <b>railway</b> <b>body</b> is not so financially demanding. Next possibility is to build-up cycle paths and cycle routes along water streams, but the build-up can be made as roads for more categories of transport because the roads are used even for the River-Basins vehicles.

40|$|There is {{a desire}} to design {{lightweight}} <b>railway</b> vehicle <b>bodies</b> for future high speed trains. Previously, suppression of structural vibration of the flexible lightweight vehicle body was attempted via use of active suspensions (conventional actuators) or by structural damping via piezoelectric actuators, with the aim being to improve the ride quality. In a railway vehicle the typical active suspension setup comprises front and rear suspension conventional actuators, while adding more macro-actuator elements to minimise structural vibrations can substantially impact vehicle weight and location considerations. In this paper, we show that piezoelectric actuator control can provide complementary action to active suspensions. Decentralized control is adopted for combined active structural damping and active suspension design via Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) method and modal control with skyhook damping respectively. The side-view model of a flexible-bodied railway vehicle integrated with piezoelectric actuators and appropriate sensor outputs is derived and {{the placement of the}} piezoelectric actuators and sensors is addressed via structural norms. It is shown that vibrations of both the flexible modes and rigid modes are suppressed effectively. This suggests that with the combined approach, control by both piezoelectric actuators and suspension actuators could be used in a more efficient way to address vibrations in light <b>railway</b> vehicle <b>bodies...</b>|$|R
