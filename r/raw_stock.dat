500|$|Mehboob Khan had {{the idea}} for the film and the title as early as 1952, five years after India's independence; in October that year, he {{approached}} the import authorities of the Indian government to seek permission for importing <b>raw</b> <b>stocks</b> for the film. In 1955, the ministries of External Affairs and Information-and-Broadcasting learned of the title of the forthcoming film and demanded that the director send them the script for review, suspicious that it was based on the book and thus a possible threat to national interest. The film team dispatched the script along with a two-page letter on 17 September 1955 saying: ...|$|R
50|$|Besides giving {{entertainment}} {{the flagship}} of KCN always vouched for quality and morality in its selection of subjects and film making. The luxury {{found in other}} languages {{he always wanted to}} bring it on Kannada screen. In the days of KCN Gowda the infrastructural facilities were not so good and there was struggle for shaping good quality films. For producing color films the <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> was not available. Using his strength he was responsible in importing <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> for color film production directly from foreign countries. He took challenges to boost up the quality of films in the Kannada Film Industry.|$|E
50|$|During {{continuous}} contact printing, the <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> and {{the negative}} are placed next to one another around the sprocket wheel of the printer. The negative, which is the closer of the two to the sprocket wheel (thus creating a slightly shorter path), must have a marginally shorter pitch between perforations (0.1866 in pitch); the <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> has a long pitch (0.1870 in). While cellulose nitrate and cellulose diacetate stocks used to shrink during processing slightly enough to have this difference naturally occur, modern safety stocks do not shrink at the same rate, and therefore negative (and some intermediate) stocks are perforated at a pitch of 0.2% shorter than print stock.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} camera negative (OCN) is {{the film}} in a traditional film-based movie camera which captures the original image. This is the film from which all other copies will be made. It is known as <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> prior to exposure.|$|E

50|$|During the Second World War (1939-1945), the British India {{government}} imposed severe {{restrictions on}} the film industry due to shortage of <b>raw</b> film <b>stock</b> and other materials. A producer was allotted only 44,000 feet of picture negative, {{and there was a}} restriction that no feature film could exceed 11,000 feet in length.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{the first}} {{secretary}} of the then expanded Eastern India Motion Picture Association (EIMPA) and was instrumental in opening the EIMPA offices in Patna and Guwahati. In this period the uncertainties of war led to severe shortage of <b>raw</b> film <b>stock</b> in the country. A Film Advisory Committee was formed under the Government of India, and was given control of <b>raw</b> film <b>stock</b> distribution. EIMPA {{played an important role}} as a trade representative, negotiating materials for the film industry of eastern India and much of Diptendu's efforts were directed for the same. During his tenure he also served as the Secretary of Film Federation of India (1953-1954) [...] and the Jt. Treasurer of the Federation of Film Societies of India (FFSI) (1959) presided by Satyajit Ray, [...] during which Indira Gandhi {{was a member of the}} FFSI (till 1964).|$|R
50|$|The {{reasons for}} The MPPC's decline are manifold. The first blow came in 1911, when Eastman Kodak {{modified}} its exclusive {{contract with the}} MPPC, to allow Kodak, which led the industry in quality and price, to sell its <b>raw</b> film <b>stock</b> to unlicensed independents. The number of theaters exhibiting independent films grew by 33 percent within twelve months, to half of all houses.|$|R
50|$|Adhesives are {{typically}} {{organized by the}} method of adhesion. These are then organized into reactive and non-reactive adhesives, which refers to whether the adhesive chemically reacts in order to harden. Alternatively they can be organized by whether the <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> is of natural, or synthetic origin, or by their starting physical phase.|$|E
5000|$|This {{process begins}} with <b>raw</b> <b>stock,</b> known as billet, and cuts it very roughly to {{shape of the}} final model. In milling, the result often gives the {{appearance}} of terraces, because the strategy has {{taken advantage of the}} ability to cut the model horizontally. Common strategies are zig-zag clearing, offset clearing, plunge roughing, rest-roughing.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} {{to bring the}} tool in rapidly to a [...] "safe" [...] point that {{is close to the}} part—in this case 0.1" [...] away—and then start feeding the tool.

50|$|In the beginning, {{do-it-yourself}} boat builders crafted every piece, {{formed and}} assembled all the hardware from <b>raw</b> metal <b>stock,</b> and even sewed their own sail. Boats {{built in the}} Alcort shop received a sail obtained through Old Town Canoe Co., made by sailmaker Ratsey & Lapthorn. Eventually, Alcort had Ratsey-Lapthorn make a sail specifically for the Sailfish, eliminating the middleman and establishing Ratsey-Lapthorn as Alcort's regular sail provider, a status they retained until 1979.|$|R

50|$|Vericut is {{standalone}} software but also integrates with CAD, CAM, and PLM systems including TopSolid, CATIA, Siemens NX, PowerMILL, EdgeCAM, Mastercam and Hypermill. It uses a three-axis through five-axis simulation motion to simulate milling and drilling operations. The simulation is {{displayed on a}} graphics screen as a solid 3D model of the <b>raw</b> <b>stock,</b> simulating the programmed cutting motions and then displaying the finished part.|$|E
50|$|Visible ink is {{sometimes}} utilized to imprint {{on the edge}} of the film - again in manufacturing - at the time of perforations. The ink, which is not affected by photographic chemicals, is normally printed onto the base surface of the film. The numbers are visible on both the <b>raw</b> <b>stock</b> (unexposed) and processed (exposed and developed) film. This method is primarily utilized for black & white negative film.|$|E
40|$|Hempel Coatings Company have into {{products}} assortment a {{group of}} paints {{which is based on}} isocyanate pre-polymer resins which cure with moisture forming a coating based on polyurea. These paints are called 1 component polyurethanes (1 K PU) or moisture curing polyurethanes (MCU). The principal function of these paints is the protection of substrates providing durability to the assets. This project was proposed by Protective Coatings R&D Department due to two reasons: - The resins and water scavengers used for 1 K PU are used only for these products so it is really important to have as reduced <b>raw</b> materials <b>stock</b> as possible. In addition these coatings represent {{a small percentage of the}} overall Hempel’s Coatings production. - Recently REACH (Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) has included all the products containing MDI isocyanate monomer/oligomer in the risk sentence R 40, limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect, and two 1 K PU coatings existing in Hempel contain this isocyanate. Thus this project was thought to study the isocyanate resins and water scavengers available in Hempel’s <b>raw</b> materials <b>stock</b> to reformulate the existing products. When reformulating the existing products the aim is improve 1 K PU performance, reduce <b>raw</b> materials <b>stock</b> and, if possible, avoid the use of MDI isocyanates. The project planning consists of the reformulation of all the possible alternatives of the existing standard products using the raw materials available. Afterwards the products formulated must be produced by vacuum dissolver in order to avoid the moisture incorporation. Finally these products have to be applied on the panels for the final testing. The main properties that 1 K PU products need to present have been tested and the best combination of isocyanate resins and water scavengers should be found out...|$|R
50|$|Ben-Dov first {{encountered}} film in 1911 when British Zionist Murray Rosenberg filmed his visit and visited Bezalel Academy. He was enchanted {{but it took}} him several years to obtain a camera and <b>raw</b> film <b>stock.</b> At the outbreak of World War I, he joined the Ottoman Imperial Army and obtained a commission as a medical photographer in the Austrian army in Jerusalem. In 1917, he finally acquired the equipment he needed probably through his Austrian military connections.|$|R
50|$|However, the MPPC also {{established}} {{a monopoly on}} all aspects of filmmaking. Eastman Kodak, which owned the patent on <b>raw</b> film <b>stock,</b> {{was a member of}} the Trust and thus agreed to sell stock only to other members. Likewise, the Trust's control of patents on motion picture cameras ensured that only MPPC studios were able to film, and the projector patents allowed the Trust to make licensing agreements with distributors and theaters - and thus determine who screened their films and where.|$|R
