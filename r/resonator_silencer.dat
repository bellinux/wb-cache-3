40|$|An adaptive-passive quarter-wave tube <b>resonator</b> <b>silencer</b> was {{experimentally}} tested using recorded in-duct recipro-cating {{engine exhaust}} noise. The exhaust noise was re-played through a loudspeaker attached to {{one end of}} a duct, and the adaptive passive system was able to track changes in engine speed and provide attenuation of the noise at the fundamental firing frequency of the engine and the third harmonic. The control system used a novel method of de-termining the phase angle of the transfer function between the pressure in the quarter wave tube and the main duct by using a sliding-Goertzel algorithm to calculate the Fourier coefficients.

40|$|Active <b>resonator</b> <b>silencers</b> are {{particularly}} effective in attenuating low-frequency noise, practically applied since {{more than ten}} years. The essential electroacoustic components such as loudspeaker, microphone and electronics are moderately priced. But regarding the complete products, such as silencers in ducts of ventilation systems mostly produced in small series, it often leads to uneconomical solutions caused by {{the costs of the}} necessary cabinets. Usually the cabinets are manufactured from metal sheets to comply with the requirements of sound insulation as well as to enclose the air volume as one of the crucial resonator elements. In or-der to reduce the manufacturing expenses small or flat cabinets are required. But a small volume contradicts the performance of the active silencers. Thus, the applicability of lean active silencer was investigated with respect to lean transducers and optimized volume of the cabinets. Starting from the point of an application with standard active resonator cassettes, the specific requirements and restrictions of this type of silencers are presented. The scope of appropriate designed transducers is discussed. A concept of a lean active silencer array is presented together with first prototypes and completed by measurements in terms of noise attenuation...|$|R
