40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} collectively delivering some message from a specified source to a designated target location in a graph, using multiple mobile agents. Each agent has a limited energy which constrains the distance it can move. Hence multiple agents need to collaborate to move the message, each agent handing over {{the message to the}} next agent to carry it forward. Given the positions of the agents in the graph and their respective budgets, the problem of finding a feasible movement schedule for the agents can be challenging. We consider two variants of the problem: in non-returning delivery, the agents can stop anywhere; whereas in <b>returning</b> <b>delivery,</b> each agent needs to return to its starting location, a variant which has not been studied before. We first provide a polynomial-time algorithm for <b>returning</b> <b>delivery</b> on trees, which is in contrast to the known (weak) NP-hardness of the non-returning version. In addition, we give resource-augmented algorithms for <b>returning</b> <b>delivery</b> in general graphs. Finally, we give tight lower bounds on the required resource augmentation for both variants of the problem. In this sense, our results close the gap left by previous research. 1998 ACM Subject Classification F. 2. 2 Nonnumerical Algorithms and Problem...|$|R

The target is achieved because the device with complex system for heat utilization and reduction of hazardous air emissions has additionally an assembly tank for mixing flue gases, ventilation emissions and atmospheric air, heat pump.
