40|$|Animal social {{networks}} and animal communication networks are key disciplines for understanding animal social behavior, yet these disciplines remain poorly integrated. In this review, we show how communication and {{social networks}} are inherently linked, with social signals <b>reflecting</b> and <b>affecting</b> social networks. Signals carry key {{information on the}} quality and direction of social connections and reveal social connections over long distances. Moreover, social signals can directly affect proximity among conspecifics, by facilitating social attraction and repulsion. Social signals thus mediate many of the social networks we observe. Throughout, we discuss {{a broad range of}} signal types and interactions, yet with a focus on acoustic signals and show how they <b>reflect</b> and <b>affect</b> social relationships. With this review we aim to inspire further integration of the social network and communication network disciplines, expecting that it will lead to new insights into the dynamics and evolution of animal social behavior. </p...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{reports on}} the use of ICT tools for {{tracking}} young respondents in a panel study that faced two major challenges. First, the difficulties in tracking youth respondents were highly conditioned by the life course. Respondents were high school students {{at the time of the}} first wave and were followed after they graduated. They experienced rapid changes in their lives and often gained a sense of autonomy and self-determination. Second, the aid of ICT tools is still embedded in the Chinese social understanding of “closeness” and “distance.” Although China has witnessed an individualization process that unties individuals from traditional family and kinship institutions (Yan 2011), the importance of social connections still remains, not only for achieving instrumental goals but also <b>reflecting</b> <b>affect</b> and morality (Osburg 2013). Without such connections, respondents can easily turn down requests from those they neither know nor trust. These are the challenges that longitudinal designs have to take into consideration.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Code smells are {{manifestations of}} design flaws that can degrade code maintainability. As such, the {{existence}} of code smells seems an ideal indicator for maintainability assessments. However, to achieve comprehensive and accurate evaluations based on code smells, {{we need to know}} how well they <b>reflect</b> factors <b>affecting</b> maintainability. After identifying which maintainability factors are reflected by code smells and which not, we can use complementary means to assess the factors that are not addressed by smells. This paper reports on an empirical study that investigates the extent to which code smells <b>reflect</b> factors <b>affecting</b> maintainability that have been identified as important by programmers. We consider two sources for our analysis: (1) expert-based maintainability assessments of four Java systems before they entered a maintenance project, and (2) observations and interviews with professional developers who maintained these systems during 14 working days and implemented a number of change requests.

40|$|Industrial {{design is}} in {{transition}} {{and there is}} a pressure to deal with even more intangible concepts. This leads to the introduction of new skill bases into the education. However, with inclusion of new skill bases the question is what needs to go? Using an action research framework we investigated how a university industrial design module changed when introducing more input on research and service design. We analysed the projects from two different years and asked whether the students had managed to integrate the input and if this led to more informed processes or a better result. The projects from one year had less novel solutions and less complexity than the previous year. While the students appreciated new skills that were learned, they found that their process was rushed. Lack of time to iterate and <b>reflect</b> <b>affected</b> the final outcome. Exploration develops industrial designers’ sensibility and ability to facilitate experiences, but an emphasis on formalised research led to less time to explore. In our eagerness to ‘professionalise’ the industrial design education, are we about to leave out our core skills...|$|R

The idea that a person's self-concept is related to what that person perceives as another's opinion usually holds more weight with significant others.

30|$|The {{principle}} component {{method was}} applied to calculate the factor loading matrix. The number of factors were defined according to the criterion that only factors that account for variances > 1 (eigenvalue-one criterion) should be included. The rationale for this criterion is that any component should account for more variance than any single variable in the standardized test score space (de Andrade et al. 2008). Varimax procedure (Carroll 1953) {{was used for the}} rotation of the retaining factors to yield an insight and informative interpretation or a more “simple structure” of the factor loading matrix. The terms ‘strong’, ‘moderate’, and ‘weak’ as applied to factor loadings refer to absolute loading values of ≥ 0.75, 0.75 – 0.50 and 0.50 – 0.30, respectively (Liu et al. 2003). The factor scores were computed by the regression method which has the advantage of being the simplest technique and is easy to apply (Hardle and Simar 2007). Dalton and Upchurch (1978) have shown that factor scores for each sample could be related to intensity of the process described by the factor. It is pointed out that extreme positive factor scores (≥ 1) <b>reflected</b> areas most <b>affected</b> and negative scores (≤− 1) reflected areas unaffected by the process represented by the factor, while near-zero scores <b>reflected</b> areas <b>affected</b> to an average degree of the process.|$|R
