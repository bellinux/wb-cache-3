STUDY DESIGN This prospective study includes 8 cases, which were managed by the intraoral approach using the endoscope. SUBJECT These 8 parapharyngeal tumour cases includes 6 benign and 2 malignant. All cases had intraoral manifestation and were operated intraorally using endoscope. The pathology, length of hospitalisation, postoperative complications, and advantages were evaluated. RESULTS Excellent results were obtained in all cases except one malignant case. DISCUSSION The external approach is more invasive and morbid. It is cosmetically not appealing. Endoscope offers better visualisation, focus, and magnification with end on view thereby decreasing the postoperative morbidity.
