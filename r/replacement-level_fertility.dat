40|$|The {{performance}} of pay-as-you-go old-age insurance under different demographic conditions {{can be estimated}} from a metric consisting of the implicit rate of return to successive cohorts. We show a positive return for the prospective population {{over the next few}} years, but for cohorts born {{after the end of the}} century returns will become sharply negative. A decline in returns is typical of pay-as-you-go schemes as they mature, and a change to negative returns is typical in particular as the birth rate falls under fixed economic conditions. The return can be kept positive by greatly increased fertility or immigration. Taking labour-force participation rates into account, and supposing entitlement independent of contribution, gives much larger negative rates of return, however. The main calculations considered here are for schemes with a constant pension. If the contribution rather than the pension is kept constant then the disparities between cohorts with respect to their returns are smaller, and although the negative returns for future generations then set in earlier they are smaller.

5000|$|As a result, {{mainly of}} {{differential}} birthrates, {{with most of}} the European nationalities moving toward sub-replacement fertility and the Central Asian and other nationalities of southern republics having well-above <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility,</b> the percentage who were Russians was gradually being reduced. According to some Western scenarios of the 1990s, if the Soviet Union had stayed together it is likely that Russians would have lost their majority status in the 2000s (decade). [...] This differential could not be offset by assimilation of non-Russians by Russians, in part because the nationalities of southern republics maintained a distinct ethnic consciousness and were not easily assimilated.|$|E
50|$|A {{population}} that maintained a TFR of 3.8 {{over an extended}} period without a correspondingly high death or emigration rate would increase rapidly (doubling period ~ 32 years), whereas a {{population that}} maintained a TFR of 2.0 over a long time would decrease, unless it had a large enough immigration. However, it may take several generations for a change in the total fertility rate to be reflected in birth rate, because the age distribution must reach equilibrium. For example, a population that has recently dropped below <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility</b> will continue to grow, because the recent high fertility produced large numbers of young couples who would now be in their childbearing years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is {{frequently}} assumed {{by the general}} public and also by some population experts that the value of <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility</b> is everywhere an average of 2. 1 lifetime births per woman. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The global variation in replacement fertility is substantial, ranging by almost 1. 4 live births from less than 2. 1 to nearly 3. 5. This range is due almost entirely to cross-country differences in mortality, concentrated in the less developed world. Policy makers need to be sensitive to own-country replacement rates. Failure to do so could result in fertility levels that are below replacement and lead to long-run population decline. For example, the current replacement total fertility rate for the East Africa region is 2. 94. Lowering fertility to 2. 10 would, under current mortality conditions, result in a regional birthrate 29 percent below replacement. It {{is frequently}} assumed {{by the general public}}, the media, and even by some demographers that the value of <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility</b> is universally 2. 1. For example, in an article about recent dramatic declines in fertility in some developing countries, Crossette (2002 : D 8) notes, “Today, village women and slum families in some of the poorest countries are beginning to prov...|$|E

Revised guidelines for the United Nations 2002 Revision for the projection of fertility in today’s intermediate-fertility countries are proposed based on the recognition that <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility</b> is not necessarily hard-wired in the evolution of populations.

40|$|I {{propose that}} {{the primary goal of}} twenty-first-century {{population}} policies should be to strengthen the human resource base for national and global sustainable development. I discuss the shortcomings of the three dominant twentieth-century population policy rationales: acceptance of <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility</b> as a demographic goal; realizing a "demographic dividend" from the changing age structure; and filling the "unmet need" for family planning. I demonstrate that in all three cases the explicit incorporation of education into the model changes the picture and makes female education a key population policy priority. Population policies under this new rationale could be viewed as public human resource management. I argue that 20 years after the Cairo ICPD the international community needs a new rationale for population policies in the context of sustainable development and that a focus on human capital development, in particular education and health, is the most promising approach...|$|E
40|$|Approximately {{half the}} world's {{population}} now has <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility</b> or below. The UK experience in accommodating to a changing dependency ratio provides some generalizable insights. A mechanistic approach assuming a fixed retirement age {{and a need}} to raise fertility or increase immigration {{in order to maintain}} pensions at a fixed proportion {{of the gross domestic product}} (GDP) is overstated and wrong. It needs to be replaced by a welfare optimizing model, which takes into account the increasing years of healthy life, a slow rise in the pensionable age, capital inheritance and wider welfare considerations of population density that are not reflected in GDP measures. A combined replacement ratio (CRR) is suggested for developed countries combining the impact of the fertility rate and immigration rate. A CRR above 2 implies continued population growth. The current UK CRR of 2. 48 is higher than needed for pension reasons, and it is suggested that it exceeds the welfare maximizing level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{formerly}} socialist {{countries of}} Eastern Europe {{and the former}} Soviet Union have experienced a remarkable demographic transformation in the past twenty years. On many dimensions of fertility and family formation, much of the region now looks like Western Europe: below-replacement fertility rates, rising age at first marriage and first birth, and high and increasing out-of-wedlock birthrates characterize many countries formerly distinguished by <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility</b> and early, near-universal marriage and childbearing. The other facet of this demographic transformation is nearly unprecedented changes in adult mortality rates. An upsurge of cardiovascular and external cause mortality caused a massive premature loss of life among working-age men in the former Soviet Union in the 1990 s. In contrast, cardiovascular mortality has fallen at a rapid rate across Eastern Europe since 1989. This paper discusses the dimensions and most likely causes of these demographic changes and assesses the possible consequences of the changing fertility and mortality patterns. Much remains unknown about the underlying reasons for the demographic transformation of the region; {{directions for future research}} in this area are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Childbearing {{behavior}} in East Asian countries has changed rapidly {{during the past}} half century from an average of five to seven children per family, to <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility,</b> and subsequently to unprecedentedly low levels, the lowest in the world. This article analyzes fertility trends in Hong Kong, Japan, singapore, south Korea, and Taiwan using cohort fertility data and methods, then examines social and economic causes of the childbearing trends, and surveys policies pursued to reverse the fertility trends. Postponement of childbearing started in the 1970 s with continuously fewer delayed births being "recuperated," which resulted in ultra-low fertility. A rapid expansion of education and employment among women in a patriarchal environment has generated a stark dilemma for women who would like to combine childbearing with a career. Policy responses have been slow, with a more serious attempt to address issues in recent years. Thus far public and private institutions are not devoting sufficient attention to generating broad social change supportive of parenting. Copyright (c) 2010 The Population Council, Inc [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{a set of}} propositions on {{fertility}} transition, Peter McDonald recently {{proposed that}} the decline from <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility</b> to low fertility {{is associated with a}} combination of high levels of gender equity in individual-oriented institutions, such as education and market employment, and low levels of gender equity in the family and family-oriented institutions. Similarly, the "second shift," or the share of domestic work performed by formally employed women, forms a critical piece of current cross-national explanations for low fertility. Building on this scholarship, the authors explore whether there is empirical evidence at the "individual" level for a relationship between gender equity at home, as indicated by the division of housework among working couples with one child, and the transition to a second birth. Results, based on a sample of US couples, indicate a U-shaped relationship between gender equity and fertility. Both the most modern and the most traditional housework arrangements are positively associated with fertility. This empirical test elaborates the family-fertility relationship and underscores the need to incorporate family context, including gender equity, into explanations for fertility change.

40|$|Demographic {{interest}} in the explanations of the first fertility transition has receded considerably during the last decade. Despite the empirical evidence of global convergence in fertility, {{there is still no}} consensus on the factors which explain the swiftness of the change in some contexts and its deceleration in some others. From the policy perspective, it remains pivotal to locate the factors that affect the momentum of fertility transition. In this essay the fast decline to below replacement-level period Total Fertility Rate in South India will be examined as an example of fertility transition despite slow social and/or economic development. The analysis is based on a literature review of empirical studies on the determinants of regional fertility differentials in India. Some southern states, most particularly Andhra Pradesh, manifest below <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility</b> (TFR 1. 79) despite low average age at marriage even in Indian terms, the resilience of womens universal marriage, and heavy reliance on a terminal family planning method, female sterilization. The case of Andhra Pradesh shows that below-replacement level fertility can occur despite slow social development, widespread poverty and gender asymmetries. Geographical and social diffusion effects are partly responsible of the speed of the decline, although they are difficult to measure or test in the level of fertility decision-making...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{discussion has}} postulated that low fertility in advanced countries {{is attributable to}} low levels of gender equity. Low gender equity is evidenced in {{the lack of support}} for women to combine paid employment and childrearing; tax-transfer systems that remain based on the male-breadwinner model of the family; and the retention of gender-oriented roles within the family. Hence, it is argued that an increase in gender equity is a precondition of a rise in fertility from very low levels. At the same time, theorists argue that, in less developed countries, higher levels of gender equity are a necessary condition for achieving lower fertility. The article addresses this apparent contradiction by distinguishing two types of gender equity: gender equity in individual-oriented institutions and gender equity in family-oriented institutions. The argument is made that the transition from very high fertility to <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility</b> has been associated with a gradual increase in gender equity primarily within the family itself. In contrast, the further movement to very low fertility is associated with a rapid shift toward high levels of gender equity in individual institutions such as education and market employment, in combination with persistent low levels of gender equity within the family and in family-oriented institutions.

40|$|This {{examination}} of the fertility of immigrants moving to the United States from high fertility countries tests several hypotheses {{about the process of}} assimilation and the impact of selectivity using microdata from the 1980 U. S. Census and ag-gregate data from the sending countries. Unlike previous assimilation studies that focus on integration into the destination society, this study emphasizes the dy-namic nature of the assimilation process by modeling the declining impact of the origin cultural setting. Although part of the variability among immigrant groups can be attributed to compositional differences, sending-country fertility levels con-tinue to exert a positive influence on immigrant fertility behavior. However, this influence is considerably weaker among immigrants who are positively selected with respect to their sending-country populations, presumably because they adapt more rapidly to the destination society. Additional evidence suggests that in gen-eral, as immigrants adapt to the U. S., they are less and less influenced by their origin social environments. In recent years the United States has experienced a dramatic rise in the volume of immigration as well as a shift in its sources. Since the mid- 1960 s increasing numbers of immigrants have come to the U. S. from Asia and Latin America—regions characterized by high fertility levels. At the same time the United States experienced a fertility decline that has stabilized at a record low rate. With barely <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility,</b> the prospects for continued population growth now depend to a large extent on the influx of new immigrants and their subsequent fertility.

40|$|Population {{projections}} for all countries are prepared annually by the Bank's Population and Human Resources Department. They are published first in summary {{form in the}} Bank's World Development Report and later in greater detail as technical notes or working papers and, in alternate years, as a book. Separate papers cover the six Bank regions: (1) Africa (sub-Saharan); (2) Latin American and the Caribbean (and Northern America); (3) East Asia and Pacific region and South Asia region combined; and (4) Europe and Central Asia region and Middle East and North Africa region combined. Among trends observed: In Asia, most countries have begun the transition from high to low fertility, with declines in many countries starting {{before and during the}} 1970 s. In East and Southeast Asia, fertility has already reached a low level of 2. 5 children per woman. South Asia, at 4. 1 children per woman, has progressed less far in this process, and Southwest Asia has still further to go. But each subregion of the Asian continent includes countries at different stages of the fertility transition: each subregion has at least one country with a total fertility rate of 6 or greater and one country with <b>replacement-level</b> <b>fertility.</b> The projections of when replacement fertility will be reached in the region as a whole are determined by the trends in individual countries with the slowest decline; the Asian subregion aggregates will therefore be late in achieving this. South Asia has the worst mortality conditions of the Asian subregions, but improvement has been quite rapid since the mid- 1970 s, with life expectancy increasing from 49 to 59 years currently. Life expectancy in Southwest Asia is near the world's average, while it is well above that in East and Southeast Asia at 70 years. East and Southeast Asia contains some of the countries (Japan and Hong Kong) with the highest measured life expectancies in the world. The most populous country in the world is China, with a population of 1. 2 billion. Its population growth rate, 1. 5 percent in the early 1990 s, is low for a low-income country and is due to the low level of fertility achieved in the last two decades. India, the second most populous country, has an estimated population of 883 million in 1992. Because of its higher total fertility rate, it is growing faster than China - 2. 0 percent a year - despite higher mortality. The population of India is projected to surpass the 1 billion mark in the year 2000 and to surpass China in total population by 2120.
