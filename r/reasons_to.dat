Although the Royal Artillery consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The Royal Logistic Corps and Intelligence Corps are not corps-sized, but consist of several battalions or regiments.|$|E

50|$|Practical reason, in philosophy, {{is the use}} of <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> {{decide how}} to act.

Noticeable additions were Anderson, Léo and Nélson to the back four; Karagounis and Miccoli to the offence. The departures included Miguel, the biggest loss.|$|E
5|$|After Mao Zedong purged Peng in 1959, Mao {{appointed}} Marshal He Long to {{the head}} of an office to investigate Peng's past in order to find additional <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> criticize Peng.

Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's Great Leap Forward had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng.|$|E
5|$|Although fortifications {{could still}} be {{valuable}} in times of war, they had played only a limited role during the Wars of the Roses and, when Henry VII invaded and seized the throne in 1485, he had not needed to besiege any castles or towns during the campaign. Henry rapidly consolidated his rule at home and had few <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> fear an external invasion from the continent; he invested little in coastal defences {{over the course of}} his reign. Modest fortifications existed along the coasts, based around simple blockhouses and towers, primarily in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but they were very limited in scale.|$|E

40|$|Transmission {{principles}} concern {{how some}} reasons for action {{are grounded in}} the fact that the action in question is a means to something else we have <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> do. A widely accepted transmission principle: Necessary Means Transmission: If A has a <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> φ, and ψ-ing is a necessary means for A to φ, then A has a <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> ψ. 1 A more controversial proposal: Liberal Transmission (LT) : If A has an intrinsic <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> φ, and ψ-ing is a means for A to φ, then A has a <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> ψ. 2 • φ-ing is a means to ψ-ing iff φ-ing helps to bring it about that one ψ-s. • p is an intrinsic <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> φ iff p is a <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> φ that is not grounded {{in the fact that}} φ-‐ing is a means to another action that one has <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> perform. Why Liberal Transmission is of philosophical interest: • It is important to know whether we can rely on LT in practical deliberation. • J. Raz uses LT in his argument against the wide-scope account of instrumental rationality. • M. Schroeder’s account of means/end-incoherence presupposes LT. • J. Way relies on LT in his argument for scepticism about ‘wrong kind reasons’. ...|$|R

An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees torn paper by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it. The pawnshop is adjacent to a restaurant, where clients are drawn on the wall. On the crime's night, Leverett and Cullman were sketched and Leverett tried to destroy the evidence.|$|E
5|$|Levodopa and {{proteins}} use {{the same}} transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access. When they are taken together, {{this results in a}} reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar <b>reasons.</b> <b>To</b> minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.|$|E

Also, though the words [...] "Brown <b>Reason</b> <b>to</b> Live" [...] did not appear on the original album's packaging, 'A BROWN REASON FOR LIVING' was etched into the run-out grooves of early pressings of this release and 'Brown <b>Reason</b> <b>To</b> Live' was included below the band's name on later Alternative Tentacles printings (see image).

5|$|The growing {{consensus}} about the endothermy of dinosaurs (see dinosaur physiology) helps {{to understand their}} full extinction in contrast with their close relatives, the crocodilians. Ectothermic ("cold-blooded") crocodiles have very limited needs for food (they can survive several months without eating) while endothermic ("warm-blooded") animals of similar size need much more food to sustain their faster metabolism. Thus, under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned, non-avian dinosaurs died, while some crocodiles survived. In this context, the survival of other endothermic animals, such as some birds and mammals, could be due, among other <b>reasons,</b> <b>to</b> their smaller needs for food, related to their small size at the extinction epoch.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040.
