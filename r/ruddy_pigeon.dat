50|$|The <b>ruddy</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Patagioenas subvinacea) is a largish pigeon which breeds from Costa Rica {{south to}} western Ecuador, Bolivia, and central Brazil. It {{belongs to a}} clade of small and rather plain species of Patagioenas with {{characteristic}} calls that constitute the subgenus Oenoenas. Like the other New World pigeons, it was formerly united with their Old World relatives in Columba, but today the New World genus Patagioenas is recognized as distinct again.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ruddy</b> <b>pigeon</b> is 28 cm (11 in) {{long and}} weighs 170 g. It is unpatterned and mainly wine-purple in colour, {{becoming}} more rufous on the back. The tail and primary flight feathers are dark brown, {{the bill is}} black, and the legs are purple-red. The iris is typically red, but can, {{at least in the}} Amazon basin, sometimes be dull yellow (however, due to the red eye-ring, the iris never appears as conspicuously white as in adults of the sympatric subspecies of the plumbeous pigeon, P. plumbea). The female is slightly duller and browner than the male, and the juvenile bird has a greyish brown head, neck and breast, with cinnamon or rufous scaling on the head and upperparts.|$|E
5000|$|Colombia holds 18% of the worldâ€™s bird species. The Andes {{alone is}} one of the most diverse areas in the world. [...] However, bird species {{specifically}} in the San Lucas Andean mountain ranges are endangered. The absence of government protection from armed conflict in San Lucas has facilitated the cultivation of coca crops and deforestation, which has resulted in local biodiversity loss. In some areas in the Western Andes concentrations of endemic threatened birds reached 46 species in certain areas. Neotropical birds especially from higher elevations are more prone to extinction. A study done in a 3000 ha reserve in Los Andes that conserves an extensive amount of endemic and small ranged bird species found 227 species in the region nine that pronounced threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature four of these are endemic species to Colombia: the Munchique Wood-wren, the Chestnut-bellied Flowerpiercer, the Yellow-eared Parrot, the Magdalena Tapaculo, the Bicoloured Antvireo, the Tanager Finch, the <b>Ruddy</b> <b>Pigeon,</b> the White-capped Tanager, and Red-bellied Grackle.|$|E
5000|$|In Central America, the <b>ruddy</b> <b>pigeon</b> is {{replaced}} at lower altitudes by its close relative, the very similar short-billed pigeon (P. nigrirostris). The two species are best separated by call, which is faster and less complex in P. subvinacea.In Central America {{it is found}} in highland forest canopy and semi-open woodland from 1500 m (5000 ft) ASL to the timberline. In South America it occurs in the canopy of humid forest from near sea-level to 1500 m (5000 ft) ASL, occasionally higher; exceptionally, they may range up to 3000 m ASL or more. It is not uncommon across its wide range and thus classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN.It is normally seen in pairs as it forages in the tree tops for fruits and berries - being particularly fond of mistletoe fruit [...] - [...] but may occasionally be seen on tracks and roadside seeking grit. It builds a rudimentary platform nest out of twigs 5 m high in a small tree, and lays one white egg.|$|E
