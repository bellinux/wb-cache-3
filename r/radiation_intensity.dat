40|$|Accidental {{fires and}} their effects on the {{structural}} integrity of buildings are responsible for significant loss of human lives, economic assets, and environmental resources in the United States and across the globe. One cause {{of the collapse of}} the World Trade Center and the collapse of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico was the failure of structural materials under large heat loads from fires. Flame impingement or flame structure interaction studies are essential for understanding the effects of fire on the structural integrity of buildings. Radiation is an important mode of heat transfer to the structural element, and measurements of <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities</b> from the flame are useful for improving the understanding of heat transfer from the flame to the structure. This study investigates the <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities</b> and <b>radiation</b> heat flux from flames with and without impingement on a flat steel plate based on plate location relative to burner, fuel mass flow rate, and fuel type. The quantitative comparison between measured <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities</b> of impinging and non-impinging flames shows significant increases in <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities</b> near the surface of the plate. The radiation heat flux to the environment is lower for impinging flames, indicating high heat transfer to the plate. Quantitative knowledge gained from this study can be used to estimate structural integrity under large heat loads and to manufacture structural elements that are more resistant to fire...|$|R

25|$|Ozone in {{the ozone}} layer filters out {{sunlight}} wavelengths from about 200nbsp&nm UV rays to 315nbsp&nm, with ozone peak absorption at about 250nbsp&nm. This ozone UV absorption is important to life, since it extends the absorption of UV by ordinary oxygen and nitrogen in air (which absorb all wavelengths < 200nbsp&nm) through the lower UV-C (200–280nbsp&nm) and the entire UV-B band (280–315nbsp&nm). The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone's effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290nbsp&nm, which has a <b>radiation</b> <b>intensity</b> 350 million times as powerful {{at the top of}} the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of UV-B radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of vitamin D in humans.|$|E
500|$|Lanthanum-140 {{was chosen}} because it emits gamma rays in the desired energy range (1.60megaelectronvolts (MeV), with {{fraction}} of 0.49MeV), and has very high specific activity, thus providing sufficient <b>radiation</b> <b>intensity</b> to produce usable signals from the ionization chambers. After a test, dispersed La-140 rapidly decays into stable cerium-140, reducing the radiation hazard for the operators after several half lives. It was also potentially available in larger quantities because its parent nuclide barium-140 is an abundant fission product of uranium. As a consequence, lanthanum-140 samples contained traces of barium-140, caesium-140, and especially strontium-90, which still presents a radioactive contamination problem {{in the area of}} the tests. Lanthanum-140 has a specific activity of 5.57×105Ci/g (20.6PBq/g); a [...] La-140 source therefore equals about 1.8mg of lanthanum.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{estimating}} temperatures and gas species concentrations (CO 2 and H 2 O) in a laminar flame is reported. The path-integrated, spectral <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities</b> emitted from a laminar flame at multiple wavelengths and view angles are calculated using a narrow band radiation model. Synthetic data, {{in the form of}} radial profiles of temperature and gas concentrations, are used in these calculations. The calculations mimic measurements that would theoretically be obtained using a mid-infrared spectrometer with a scanner. The path integrated spectral <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities</b> are deconvoluted using a maximum likelihood estimation method in conjunction with an iterative scheme. The deconvolution algorithm accounts for the self-absorption of radiation by the intervening gases, and provides the local temperature and gas species concentrations. The deconvoluted temperatures and gas concentrations are compared with the synthetic data used for calculating the spectral <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities.</b> The deconvoluted temperatures and gas species concentrations are within 0. 5 % of the synthetic data.

40|$|Turbulent {{premixed}} flames {{were originally}} used only in spark ignition engines. Their use is increasing in {{other types of}} engines, most notably power generation gas turbines for low NOx emissions and no particulate emissions. Motivated by these applications, turbulent premixed flames have been studied for different configurations. Past work {{has focused on the}} flame structure, and on chemical mechanisms and analyses of pollutant emissions. Studies are lacking on the radiation characteristics of turbulent premixed flames. ^ In the present study, the spectral <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities</b> from laminar lean premixed flat flames were measured to evaluate an existing narrow band radiation model. The spectral <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities</b> leaving diametric paths at different axial locations in the turbulent premixed jet flames were measured over the wavelength range 2. 5 to 5. 0 μm, using a monochromator and a liquid nitrogen cooled InSb detector. Measurements of the probability density functions (PDF) of the spectral <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities</b> were compared with Gaussian distributions. ^ Predictions of the spectral <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities</b> from turbulent premixed jet flames can be made if the temperature and radiating species concentration distributions are known. A novel narrow band thin filament pyrometry (TFP) technique was established in the present work to make precise temperature measurements in turbulent lean premixed jet flames. A laminar lean premixed flat flame, stabilized on a McKenna burner, combined with the narrow band radiation model based emission spectroscopy was used to calibrate the TFP system. Two other laminar lean premixed flat flames were used to evaluate the calibration procedure, and they yielded accuracy estimates within 20 K or 1 % approximately. The narrow band TFP was then used to measure the radial temperature time series of two turbulent lean premixed jet flames. ^ A stochastic spatial-temporal series analysis technique was developed for the treatment of turbulence-radiation interactions. The predictions of the spectral <b>radiation</b> <b>intensities</b> from the turbulent lean premixed jet flames using this technique show excellent comparisons with the measurements provided the integral length scales at different axial locations are prescribed correctly. Independent evaluation of the integral length scales is recommended in future work. ...|$|R

[...] To address this problem, Rossi and Staub carried out a careful analysis of the pulses that result when individual charged particles create ions within an ionisation chamber. [...] They realised that the high mobility of free electrons removed from ionised atoms means that the pulses produced by single particles can be very brief. [...] With James S. Allen, Rossi found gas mixtures of high electron mobility and low electron attachment.
