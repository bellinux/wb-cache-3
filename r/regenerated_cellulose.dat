The {{purpose of this}} research is to extract cellulose from mahang (Macaranga gigantea) wood and convert the extracted cellulose (MCC) to nanocellulose using ionic liquid pretreatment. 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) was used to treat cellulose that has been extracted from mahang wood.

Recrystallization of cellulose was found to hinder the further hydrolysis particularly with the high DP. The effect of recrystallization can be reduced by the decrease of DP of RCs.

By another way the preparation of nano-scaled cellulose was conducted by hydrolysis and following mechanical treatment of hydrolyzed cellulose with Ultra-Turrax™ and MICROFLUIDIZER™. A further alternative was given by the mechanical treatment of aqueous dispersions of low substituted cellulose derivatives. For example methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and oxidized cellulose gave nano-scaled materials with interesting properties.
