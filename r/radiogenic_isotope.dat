50|$|For <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes</b> that decay slowly enough, or {{that are}} stable isotopes, a {{primordial}} fraction is always present, since all sufficiently long-lived and stable isotopes {{do in fact}} naturally occur primordially. An additional fraction {{of some of these}} isotopes may also occur radiogenically.|$|R
50|$|Secondary {{radionuclides}} are <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes</b> {{derived from}} the decay of primordial radionuclides. They have shorter half-lives than primordial radionuclides. They arise in the decay chain of the primordial isotopes thorium-232, uranium-238 and uranium-235. Examples include the natural isotopes of polonium and radium.|$|R
50|$|An isotopic {{signature}} (also isotopic fingerprint) is {{a ratio of}} non-radiogenic 'stable isotopes', stable <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes,</b> or unstable radioactive isotopes of particular elements in an investigated material.

5000|$|Isotopic tracers {{are usually}} {{subdivided}} into two categories: stable isotope tracers and <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotope</b> tracers. Stable isotope tracers involve only non-radiogenic isotopes and usually are mass-dependent. In theory, any element with two stable isotopes {{can be used}} as an isotopic tracer. However, the most commonly used stable isotope tracers involve relatively light isotopes, which readily undergo fractionation in natural systems. See also isotopic signature. A <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotope</b> tracer [...] involves an isotope produced by radioactive decay, which is usually in a ratio with a non-radiogenic isotope (whose abundance in the earth does not vary due to radioactive decay).|$|E

50|$|However, {{the natural}} {{abundance}} {{of a given}} isotope is also affected by the probability of its creation in nucleosynthesis (as {{in the case of}} samarium; radioactive 147Sm and 148Sm are much more abundant than stable 144Sm) and by production of a given isotope as a daughter of natural radioactive isotopes (as in the case of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes</b> of lead).|$|R

50|$|All {{forms of}} {{isochron}} dating {{assume that the}} source of the rock or rocks contained unknown amounts of both radiogenic and non-radiogenic isotopes of the daughter element, along with some amount of the parent nuclide. Thus, at the moment of crystallization, the ratio of the concentration of the <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotope</b> of the daughter element to that of the non-radiogenic isotope is some value independent of the concentration of the parent. As time goes on, some amount of the parent decays into the <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotope</b> of the daughter, increasing the ratio of the concentration of the <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotope</b> to that of the daughter. The greater the initial concentration of the parent, the greater the concentration of the radiogenic daughter isotope will be at some particular time. Thus, the ratio of the daughter to non-radiogenic isotope will become larger with time, while the ratio of parent to daughter will become smaller. For rocks that start out with a small concentration of the parent, the daughter/non-radiogenic ratio will not change quickly as compared to rocks starting with a large concentration of the parent.|$|E
50|$|Radiogenic {{isotopes}} provide powerful tracers {{for studying}} the ages and origins of Earth systems.

50|$|An {{alternative}} approach {{used to measure}} the relative abundance of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes</b> when working with a solid surface is secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). This type of ion-microprobe analysis normally works by focusing a primary (oxygen) ion beam on a sample in order to generate a series of secondary positive ions that can be focused and measured based on their mass/charge ratios.|$|R
50|$|Most stable {{isotopes}} in {{the earth}} {{are believed to have}} been formed in processes of nucleosynthesis, either in the Big Bang, or in generations of stars that preceded the formation of the solar system. However, some stable isotopes also show abundance variations {{in the earth}} as a result of decay from long-lived radioactive nuclides. These decay-products are termed <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes,</b> in order to distinguish them from the much larger group of 'non-radiogenic' isotopes.|$|R
50|$|His {{early career}} {{was focused on}} the {{behaviour}} of trace metals in oceans and their sediments, and on fluid flow through the oceanic crust and sediments under the influence of off-axis hydrothermal circulation. He {{became one of the first}} low-temperature geochemists to appreciate how <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes</b> might be used to solve the problems of marine geochemistry, developing the seawater strontium isotope curve for the Cenozoic - now the most reliable isotopic record available for the Phanerozoic.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} with the quantity of a non-radiogenic isotope of the same element, the quantity of the <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotope</b> is used to define its isotopic signature (e.g. 206Pb/204Pb). This technique is discussed in more detail under the heading isotope geochemistry.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} has two different {{applications in the}} earth and environmental sciences. The analysis of 'stable isotopes' is normally concerned with measuring isotopic variations arising from mass-dependent isotopic fractionation in natural systems. On the other hand, <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotope</b> analysis involves measuring the abundances of decay-products of natural radioactivity, and is used in most long-lived radiometric dating methods.|$|E
5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of the dinosaur fossils discovered by the AAOD Museum are from the earliest Late Cretaceous period and are approximately 98-95 million years old.

Measuring <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes</b> within individual zircon grains taken from the [...] "Matilda site" [...] confirmed an Early Cenomanian age meaning that the sites in that area are at least as young as 95 million years.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe intraplate {{volcanic}} {{suite of}} the Chaîne des Puys (French Massif Central) shows a complete petrologic range, from alkali basalts to trachytes. The significant variations of trace elements and <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes</b> along the series strongly support {{the occurrence of}} crustal assimilation associated with fractional crystallization (AFC). The least contaminated basalts are clearly related to a HIMU-type reservoir (206 Pb/ 204 Pb > 19. 6; 87 Sr/ 86 Sr + 4). The behavior of <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes</b> suggests that the most likely crustal contaminants are meta-sediments located in the lower crust. The Li isotopic compositions of the lavas range from high δ 7 Li (> + 7 ‰) in basalts to lighter values in more evolved lavas (down to δ 7 Li ≈ 0 ‰). The mantle component, expressed in the least evolved lavas, has a heavy Li isotopic signature, in good agreement with previous δ 7 Li measurements of OIB lavas with HIMU affinities. The evolution of Li isotopic compositions throughout the volcanic series is {{in agreement with the}} AFC model suggested by the Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic systems. Although the behavior of Li isotopes during assimilation processes is currently poorly constrained, our calculations suggest that at least a portion of the lower crust beneath the Chaîne des Puys is characterized by a light Li isotopic composition (δ 7 Li < − 5 ‰) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes</b> (Sr, Nd) in Ice Rafted Debris (IRD) sediments {{from the}} Lomonosov Ridge and Fram Strait Arctic areas {{are used to}} {{document}} changes in Arctic sea-ice sources and trajectories since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The two records provide evidence for enhanced sea-ice production in the Beaufort Sea and its subsequent export through Fram Strait during the Younger Dryas (YD) interval. This pattern, exclusive to the YD, followed an LGM-Bølling-Allerød interval, when multiyear and/or reduced sea-ice mobility resulted in sedimentary hiatuses in the Central Arctic. Meanwhile, IRD from Svalbard-Barents ice-sheet margin source were still deposited in the Fram Strait area. The "isotopic excursion" of the YD points to enhanced sea-ice production in the Beaufort Sea, which we link to the Lake Agassiz (?) /Laurentide ice sheet drainage event through the Mackenzie route. Following this event, the Holocene depicts a 5 -fold reduction in IRD rates with a shift towards prominent sea-ice production along Russian shelves. From a methodological viewpoint, we demonstrate that <b>radiogenic</b> <b>isotopes</b> must {{be used in a}} multi-proxy approach to better constrain IRD and sea-ice sources and routes. From a paleoceanographic perspective, we conclude that an Arctic freshwater/sea-ice export route should now be seen as the most likely mechanism for an AMOC reduction during the YD in accordance with more recent improved model experiment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
