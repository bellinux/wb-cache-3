5|$|In most patients, {{the direct}} {{cause for the}} {{cerebral}} sinus thrombosis is not <b>readily</b> <b>apparent.</b> Identifying a source of infection is crucial; it is common practice to screen for various forms of thrombophilia (a propensity to form blood clots).|$|E
5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G. Baker, {{is a form}} of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, {{cheating}} pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not be <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> as members of the same species may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae.|$|E
5|$|Moderate easterly {{wind shear}} {{that had been}} {{affecting}} the developing system began to relax almost immediately after formation, allowing upper-level outflow to expand in most directions and the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Adrian. A small central dense overcast materialized early on June19, followed shortly thereafter by hints of an eye-like feature. Thus, in accordance with increasing satellite intensity estimates, Adrian was upgraded to the season's first hurricane by 00:00UTC on June20 while located about 485mi (780km) south-southeast of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The storm further organized to attain its peak as a Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (160km/h) as the aforementioned eye-like feature became <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> in satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{calculation}} of Taylor series {{of a large number}} of functions. One can attempt to use the definition of the Taylor series, though this often requires generalizing the form of the coefficients according to a <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> pattern. Alternatively, one can use manipulations such as substitution, multiplication or division, addition or subtraction of standard Taylor series to construct the Taylor series of a function, by virtue of Taylor series being power series. In some cases, one can also derive the Taylor series by repeatedly applying integration by parts. Particularly convenient is the use of computer algebra systems to calculate Taylor series.|$|E
5|$|Traumatic {{pneumothorax}} {{most commonly}} {{occurs when the}} chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises {{the integrity of the}} involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not <b>readily</b> <b>apparent)</b> in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} low tail dock and {{generally}} unimproved anatomy, Jacob ewes are widely {{reputed to be}} easy-lambing. Jacobs are seasonal breeders, with ewes generally cycling in the cooler months of the autumn. They will begin to cycle during the first autumn following their birth and most often the ewe's first lamb is a single. Subsequent gestations will typically bear one or two lambs in the spring, and triplets are not unusual. The lambs will exhibit their spotting and horn characteristics at birth, with the horn buds more <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> on ram lambs. Lambs may be weaned at two months of age, but many shepherds do not separate lambs and allow the ewe to wean the lamb at about 4months of age. Jacob ewes are instinctively attentive mothers and are protective of their lambs. They are included in commercial flocks in England because of their ease of lambing and strong mothering instincts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the five}} {{months prior to}} the riots, nativist groups had been {{spreading}} a rumor that Catholics were trying to remove the Bible from public schools. A nativist rally in Kensington erupted in violence on May 6 and started a deadly riot that would result in the destruction of two Catholic churches and numerous other buildings. Riots erupted again in July, after it was discovered that St. Philip Neri's Catholic Church in Southwark had armed itself for protection. Fierce fighting broke out between the nativists and the soldiers sent to protect the church, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Several Catholic churches were burned. Nationally, the riots helped fuel criticism of the nativist movement, despite denials from nativist groups of responsibility. The riots made deficiencies in law enforcement in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts <b>readily</b> <b>apparent,</b> influencing various reforms in local police departments and the eventual consolidation of the city in 1854.|$|E
5|$|The Committee set itself several {{rules and}} over the years {{developed}} many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they had to have a pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> to anyone interested, whether railwayman or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection of names for a class had to provide some form of class identity. Another rule was not to use names of people who were still alive at the time, and some on the Committee had a strong dislike of names or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to an absurd extent was discouraged.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera follows other {{traditional}} Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers {{is to put}} beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, {{but this does not}} mean that other actions should cease. Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more <b>readily</b> <b>apparent.</b>|$|E
5|$|The period did {{lead to some}} {{reform of}} {{internal}} Society statutes, such as in 1823 and 1831. The most important change there was the requirement that the Treasurer publish an annual report, along {{with a copy of}} the total income and expenditure of the Society. These were to be sent to Fellows at least 14 days before the general meeting, with the intent being to ensure the election of competent Officers by making it <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> what existing Officers were doing. This was accompanied by a full list of Fellows standing for Council positions, where previously the names had only been announced a couple of days before. As with the other reforms, this helped ensure that Fellows had a chance to vet and properly consider candidates. The Society's financial troubles were finally resolved in 1850, when a government grant-in-aid of £1,000 a year was accepted. This was increased to £4,000 in 1876, with the Society officially acting merely as the trustee for these funds, doling them out to individual scientists. This grant has now grown to over £47million, some £37million of which is to support around 370 fellowships and professorships.|$|E
25|$|Burns had a {{significant}} influence on Alexander McLachlan and some influence on Robert Service. While {{this may not be}} so obvious in Service's English verse, which is Kiplingesque, it is more <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> in his Scots verse.|$|E
25|$|Image:Mission San Juan Capistrano bells.JPG|Two of the {{original}} bells (San Vicente and San Juan) sit on display within the footprint of {{the original}} bell tower at Mission San Juan Capistrano. Damage to the smaller bell (San Juan), sustained during the 1812 earthquake, is <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> in this view.|$|E
25|$|In Ethiopic (where {{the term}} abugida originates) the {{diacritics}} have been fused to the consonants {{to the point}} that they must be considered modifications of the form of the letters. Children learn each modification separately, as in a syllabary; nonetheless, the graphic similarities between syllables with the same consonant is <b>readily</b> <b>apparent,</b> unlike the case in a true syllabary.|$|E
25|$|As subject {{distance}} is decreased, the subject magnification increases, and eventually becomes large {{in comparison with}} the hyperfocal magnification. Thus the effect of focal length is greatest near the hyperfocal distance, and decreases as {{subject distance}} is decreased. However, the near/far perspective will differ for different focal lengths, so the difference in DOF may not be <b>readily</b> <b>apparent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Signs {{of acute}} {{tendinitis}} include swelling, heat, and pain when {{the affected area}} is palpated. If mild, swelling may not be <b>readily</b> <b>apparent,</b> although {{there will still be}} heat and pain in the area, as well as mild lameness. If more severe, the injury is usually accompanied by moderate lameness (2-3 on a scale of 5) with obvious swelling.|$|E
25|$|Warning {{signs are}} often used where sight {{distance}} is insufficient. The US MUTCD requires Stop Ahead, Yield Ahead or Signal Ahead signs at intersections where the traffic control device is not visible from a distance equal to the stopping sight distance at speed of approaching traffic. Hill Blocks View signs can be used where crest vertical curves restrict sight distance. However, many jurisdictions still expect drivers to use ordinary care regarding conditions <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> to a driver, without the prompting of a sign. The care and focus ordinarily required of a driver against certain types of hazards may be somewhat amplified on roads with lower functional classification. The probability of spontaneous traffic increases proportionally to the density of access points, and this density should be <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> to a driver even when a specific access point is not. For this reason, full corner sight distance is almost never required for individual driveways in urban high-density residential areas, and street parking is commonly permitted within the right-of-way.|$|E
25|$|Treating {{the story}} of Dong Hai Chuan and Guo Yunshen as allegory, however, reveals a common {{training}} protocol among Xing Yi Quan and Bagua Zhang practitioners. Often, because Bagua Zhang requires significantly more time for a practitioner's skill to mature, it is acceptable to learn Xing Yi Quan first or simultaneously. Such a practitioner develops a tactical vocabulary that is more <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> than the core Bagua Zhang movements.|$|E
25|$|A <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> {{external}} {{feature of}} the Silverliner IV is a windowed body panel plug {{in the middle of}} the cars on each side, a provision for high-platform-only center doors which have never been installed, in contrast with New Jersey Transit's similar, contemporary Arrow II and III cars which were built with such doors. Internally, pairs of seats occupy this partitioned area which was intended for passenger flow.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} principle is not <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience. So {{it is helpful}} to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the {{uncertainty principle}}. The wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formulates {{it in a way that}} generalizes more easily.|$|E
25|$|This {{instance}} {{illustrates the}} complexity of assessing differences between the LXX and the Masoretic Text {{as well as the}} Vulgate. Despite the striking divergence of meaning here between the Septuagint and later texts, nearly identical consonantal Hebrew source texts can be reconstructed. The <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> semantic differences result from alternative strategies for interpreting the difficult verse and relate to differences in vowelization and punctuation of the consonantal text.|$|E
25|$|While {{discrimination}} against Dalits has declined {{in urban areas}} and in the public sphere, it still exists in rural areas and in the private sphere, in everyday matters such as access to eating places, schools, temples and water sources. Some Dalits successfully integrated into urban Indian society, where caste origins are less obvious. In rural India, however, caste origins are more <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> and Dalits often remain excluded from local religious life, though some qualitative evidence suggests that exclusion is diminishing.|$|E
25|$|Two {{questionnaires}} were devised by Cloninger {{to measure the}} temperaments and characters of individuals. RD can be measured using both the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) personality test and by the newer and refined version of the personality test called Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and its revised version (TCI-R). Owing to the limitations encountered in the TPQ, in that the three dimensions’ clinical utility was not <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> to many clinicians, Cloninger revamped the questionnaire and produced the TCI scale, which incorporates four dimensions of “temperament” and three dimensions of “character”.|$|E
25|$|Greater New York, {{unlike most}} other cities, fared much better {{due to the}} fact that day-to-day life was built upon the {{commuter}} culture mentality. Both its subway and commuter rail systems continued to be heavily used despite years of neglect. As Long Island's population increased dramatically after World War II it became <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> that the public parkway and highway system would prove to be totally inadequate for the population. The LIRR was looked to as the solution to the problem, however, the railroad was in a sad state of neglect.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, leaking {{aviation}} gasoline accumulating {{in the forward}} elevator pit began vaporising and soon permeated {{the upper and lower}} hangar decks. The danger this posed to the ship was <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> to the damage control crews but, whether through inadequate training, lack of practice (only three months had passed since the ship's commissioning) or general incompetence, their response to it proved fatally ineffectual. Efforts to pump out the damaged elevator well were bungled and no one thought to try to cover the increasingly lethal mixture with foam from the hangar's fire suppression system.|$|E
25|$|The Jahn–Teller {{effect is}} {{manifested}} in the UV-VIS absorbance spectra of some compounds, where it often causes splitting of bands. It is <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> in the structures of many copper(II) complexes. and Its Implications for Rack-Induced Bonding in Blue Copper Protein Active Sites | url = | journal = Inorganic Chemistry | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1922–1933 | doi = 10.1021/ic0400639 }} Additional, detailed information about the anisotropy of such complexes {{and the nature of}} the ligand binding can be however obtained from the fine structure of the low-temperature electron spin resonance spectra.|$|E
25|$|Psychosis {{as a sign}} of a {{psychiatric}} disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion. That is, a new-onset episode of psychosis is not considered a symptom of {{a psychiatric}} disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded. Medical and biological laboratory tests should exclude central nervous system diseases and injuries, diseases and injuries of other organs, psychoactive substances, and toxins as causes of symptoms of psychosis before any psychiatric illness can be diagnosed. In medical training, psychosis {{as a sign of}} illness is often compared to fever since both can have multiple causes that are not <b>readily</b> <b>apparent.</b>|$|E
25|$|With Germany's {{occupation}} of the Pas-de-Calais region in Northern France, the possibility of closing the Strait of Dover to Royal Navy warships and merchant convoys {{by the use of}} land-based heavy artillery became <b>readily</b> <b>apparent,</b> both to the German High Command and to Hitler. Even the Kriegsmarines Naval Operations Office deemed this a plausible and desirable goal, especially given the relatively short distance, , between the French and English coasts. Orders were therefore issued to assemble and begin emplacing every Army and Navy heavy artillery piece available along the French coast, primarily at Pas-de-Calais. This work was assigned to the Organisation Todt and commenced on 22 July 1940.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Army Air Service had a {{brief but}} {{turbulent}} history. Created during World War I by executive order of 28th President Woodrow Wilson after American entrance in April 1917 as {{the increasing use of}} airplanes and the military uses of aviation were <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> as the war continued to its climax, the U.S. Army Air Service gained permanent legislative authority in 1920 as a combatant arm of the line of the United States Army. There followed a six-year struggle between adherents of airpower and the supporters of the traditional military services about the value of an independent Air Force, intensified by struggles for funds caused by skimpy budgets, as much an impetus for independence as any other factor.|$|E
25|$|The {{route of}} the canal south from Kendal is still <b>readily</b> <b>apparent,</b> {{with most of the}} bridges {{remaining}} in place. Although severed by the motorway construction, it was not drained because the channel was used to supply water to a pipeline which ran from the canal near Garstang to a chemical works near Fleetwood. As a result, this section can still be used by small boats. In 1976, the Lancaster Canal Trust mounted a campaign for the construction of slipways on this section, to make the launching of boats easier, which proved to be successful, as they were used at Easter 1978, when a boat rally was held on the upper reaches.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people living}} in Haiti {{are at high risk}} for major {{infectious}} diseases. Food or water-borne diseases include bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, typhoid fever and hepatitis A and E; common vector-borne diseases are dengue fever and malaria; water-contact diseases include leptospirosis. Roughly 75% of Haitian households lack running water. Unsafe water, along with inadequate housing and unsanitary living conditions, contributes to the high incidence of infectious diseases. There is a chronic shortage of health care personnel and hospitals lack resources, a situation that became <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> after the January 2010 earthquake. The infant mortality rate in Haiti in 2013 was 55 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to a rate of 6 per 1,000 in other countries.|$|E
25|$|Jung's {{theory of}} {{neurosis}} {{is based on}} the premise of a self-regulating psyche composed of tensions between opposing attitudes of the ego and the unconscious. A neurosis is a significant unresolved tension between these contending attitudes. Each neurosis is unique, and different things work in different cases, so no therapeutic method can be arbitrarily applied. Nevertheless, there is a set of cases that Jung especially addressed. Although adjusted well enough to everyday life, the individual has lost a fulfilling sense of meaning and purpose, and has no living religious belief to which to turn. There seems to be no <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> way to set matters right. In these cases, Jung turned to ongoing symbolic communication from the unconscious in the form of dreams and visions.|$|E
25|$|Post-glacial rebound (also called either {{isostatic}} rebound or crustal rebound) is {{the rise}} of land masses that were depressed by the huge weight of ice sheets during the last glacial period, through {{a process known as}} isostatic depression. Post-glacial rebound and isostatic depression are different parts of a process known as either glacial isostasy, glacial isostatic adjustment, or glacioisostasy. Glacioisostasy is the solid Earth deformation associated with changes in ice mass distribution. The most obvious and direct effects of post-glacial rebound are <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> in parts of Northern Eurasia, Northern America, Patagonia, and Antarctica. However, through processes known as ocean siphoning and continental levering, the effects of post-glacial rebound on sea level are felt globally far from the locations of current and former ice sheets.|$|E
25|$|Persistent {{wind shear}} {{displaced}} convection {{from the center}} of Winston, leaving its circulation partially exposed. As a result, the system degraded below severe tropical cyclone status by 00:00UTC on 15 February. Conditions became more favourable for development on 16 February when shear relaxed over the cyclone. A prominent banding feature wrapped into the circulation that day, marking the start of reintensification. An eye reformed later that day within increasing convection, and Winston regained severe tropical cyclone intensity by 18:00UTC. The storm's core became increasingly compact and defined as it strengthened, and a central dense overcast became established on 17 February. Later that day, Winston entered a region of weak steering currents and the storm became nearly stationary. The storm's eye became more <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> late on 17 February as it doubled back to the west.|$|E
25|$|Age {{relations}} among structural features are not <b>readily</b> <b>apparent.</b> In the Bach region, the youngest craters cut by a scarp are of c4 age; the oldest crater to superpose a scarp is a c3. These relations suggest that scarp formation occurred in c3 to c4 time. Very smooth plains material flanks some scarps and ridges and, if {{the material is}} ponded extrusives or mass-wasted products, may postdate the structures. Scarps and ridges are abundant in intercrater, intermediate, and smooth plains units, {{but they are not}} embayed by intermediate and intercrater plains materials. These relations suggest that the structures began to form after emplacement of these two oldest plains units. Some of the oldest craters and basins, such as Cervantes, have polygonal shapes at least as marked as more recent craters, suggesting that some structural lineaments are older than c1 craters.|$|E
25|$|Until the mid-20th century, {{it was not}} <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> at {{the time}} of {{discovery}} whether a body has been buried in a bog for years, decades, or centuries. But, modern forensic and medical technologies (such as radiocarbon dating) have been developed that allow researchers to more closely determine the age of the burial, the person's age at death, and other details. Scientists have been able to study the skin of the bog bodies, reconstruct their appearance and even determine what their last meal was from their stomach contents since peat marsh preserves soft internal tissue. Their teeth also indicate their age at death and what type of food they ate throughout their lifetime. Subsurface radar can be used by archaeologists to detect bodies and artifacts beneath the bog surface before cutting into the peat. Radiocarbon dating is also common as it accurately gives the date of the find, most usually from the Iron Age.|$|E
25|$|The Italian stiletto, {{originally}} a purely offensive weapon {{used to kill}} an unsuspecting or wounded adversary, was later embraced throughout Italy as a fighting knife for close combat confrontations. The popularity of the stiletto in the Kingdom of Sicily resulted {{in the development of}} the scherma di stiletto siciliano (Sicilian school of stiletto fighting). The stiletto was purely a thrusting or stabbing weapon, and the scherma di stiletto siciliano accordingly taught fighting movements designed to avoid the tip of the opponent's blade (scanso). Techniques characteristic of the scherma di stiletto siciliano include sbasso (bending to ground), in quarto tagliata (tacking to left or right), and the balzo (leap to evade the enemy’s blade). A person skilled in the use of a stiletto would thrust the knife deep into the victim, then twist the blade sharply in various directions before retracting it, causing the sharp point to inflict severe internal damage not <b>readily</b> <b>apparent</b> when examining the entrance wound.|$|E
