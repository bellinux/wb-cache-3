500|$|Hayes's {{success in}} Ohio {{immediately}} elevated {{him to the}} top ranks of Republican politicians under consideration for the presidency in 1876. The Ohio delegation to the 1876 Republican National Convention was united behind him, and Senator John Sherman did all {{in his power to}} bring Hayes the nomination. In June 1876, the convention assembled with James G. Blaine of Maine as the favorite. Blaine started with a significant lead in the delegate count but could not muster a majority. As he failed to gain votes, the delegates looked elsewhere for a nominee and settled on Hayes on the seventh ballot. The convention then selected Representative William A. Wheeler of New York for vice president, a man about whom Hayes had <b>recently</b> <b>asked,</b> [...] "I am ashamed to say: who is Wheeler?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, after Zhong Hui {{secretly}} accused Deng Ai {{of plotting}} a rebellion, Sima Zhao wanted {{to lead his}} forces to station at Chang'an. Shao Ti told Sima Zhao {{that there was no}} need for him to go to Chang'an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng Ai. Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go (to Chang'an) now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong <b>recently</b> <b>asked</b> me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?' I replied, 'If I send you on a mission today, do you think I doubt you?' He could not respond to my reply. Everything will be settled when I arrive in Chang'an." [...] By the time Sima Zhao reached Chang'an, Zhong Hui had already been killed in the mutiny, just as Sima Zhao foresaw.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{retirement}} of President Ulysses S. Grant after two terms, the Republicans had to settle on a new candidate for the 1876 election. Hayes's success as Governor of Ohio immediately elevated him to the top ranks of Republican politicians under consideration for the presidency, alongside James G. Blaine of Maine, Senator Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, and Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. Despite {{the strength of the}} other candidates, the Ohio delegation to the 1876 Republican National Convention was united behind Hayes, and Senator John Sherman did all in his power to aid the nomination to his fellow Ohioan. In June 1876, the convention assembled in Hayes's hometown of Cincinnati with Blaine as the favorite. Hayes did not see himself as the favorite to win the presidential nomination, but made an effort to position himself as a potential compromise candidate. Hayes placed fifth on the first ballot of the convention, behind Blaine, Morton, Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow, and Conkling. After six ballots, Blaine remained in the lead, but on the seventh ballot, Blaine's adversaries rallied around Hayes, granting the presidential nomination to the latter. The convention then selected Representative William A. Wheeler of New York for Vice President, a man about whom Hayes had <b>recently</b> <b>asked,</b> [...] "I am ashamed to say: who is Wheeler?" [...] Hayes's views were largely in accord with the party platform, which called for equal rights for all (including women), continued Reconstruction, the prohibition of public funding for sectarian schools, and the resumption of specie payments. Hayes's nomination was well received by the press, with even Democratic papers describing Hayes as honest and likable. In a public letter accepting the nomination, Hayes vowed to support civil service reform and pledged to serve for only one term.|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} time–dependent {{cosmological constant}} can be recovered for higher– order theories of gravity by extending to these ones the no–hair conjecture. The results {{are applied to}} some specific cosmological models. Fundamental issues as the determination of gravity vacuum state, the mechanism which led the early universe to the today observed large scale structures, and the prediction {{of what will be}} the fate of the whole universe are all connected to the determination of cosmological constant. Besides, from several points of view, it seems that Einstein’s theory of gravity must be generalized to higher–order or scalar–tensor theories in order to overcome shortcomings of fundamental physics and cosmology. Both topics have to be connected so {{that a lot of people}} is, <b>recently,</b> <b>asking</b> for the recovering of a sort of cosmological constant in extended theories of gravity. With this fact in mind, it is possible to enlarge the cosmic no–hair conjecture to scalar–tensor 1 and higher–order theories by taking into consideration an ”effective ” time–dependent cosmological constant which has to become asymptotically the ”true ” one yielding...|$|R
