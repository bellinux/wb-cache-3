40|$|There are {{currently}} diverse approaches to researching learning in e-Learning contexts, as {{is to be}} expected in an emergent field of practice. Current approaches focus on return on investment, technologies and implementation, the comparative effectiveness of different environments, student participation <b>and</b> perceptions, course <b>design,</b> evaluation <b>and</b> delivery, and online collaboration and community building. In this paper, we have chosen some reports of such approaches, which we analyse for their worth in making particular aspects of learning explicit. Using these examples as a frame of reference, we then propose our own approach to meeting the challenges of researching learning in e-Learning contexts: an approach that derives from a biologically based generative view of learning. We outline the core tenets and characteristic features of such a research approach, including the nature of the <b>research</b> <b>designs</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodologies</b> that might derive from it, and describe how it is being enacted to study learning in a postgraduate e-Learning subject. We conclude by foreshadowing some implications of these kinds of <b>research</b> <b>designs</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodologies</b> for student learning online and in higher education generally...|$|R

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{management}} and diffusion of HIV/AIDS information in {{institutions of higher learning}} in South Africa. The HIV/AIDS Policy for Educators, Learners and Students provided a strong foundation on government involvement on HIV/AIDS management in Higher Education. Both Qualitative <b>and</b> quantitative <b>research</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodologies</b> were employed largely through survey, observation and document analysis. The findings reveal that the response of the higher education sector to HIV/AIDS is not uniform, but there is a positive move towards strong management of HIV/AIDS and information diffusion. The study recommends further research on feasibility, applicability and effectiveness of the centralized coordination of the higher education HIV/AIDS response. Other hidden issues have been unearthed and a model for effective HIV/AIDS management and information diffusion in the sector suggested. Information Scienc...|$|R

40|$|Although genetic discoveries affect nursing education, practice, and research, the use {{of genetic}} {{principles}} in <b>research</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodologies</b> is a recent approach in nursing science.

A Delphi survey was conducted with attendees at a nursing genetics research consensus meeting. Understanding genetics, need for sensitive measures, limited resources, and difficulties in networking were major themes identified as barriers. Key strategies include educational preparation, appropriate research methods, institutional support, and research collaboration. Nurses must understand genetics in order to participate in knowledge discovery regarding relationships between genetics, health, and nursing. Integration of genetic concepts into nursing science requires development of collegial relationships among nursing researchers, {{as well as with}} those in genetics and related disciplines...|$|R

This study aims to address this gap by reviewing 63 SNA papers published in eight peer-reviewed journals from 1997 to 2015 to ascertain the status of this research area and identify future research directions.

40|$|The {{first issue}} of Psychology & Marketing was {{published}} in 1984.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} now exists to substantiate the long-held idea that musicians&# 39; brains differ structurally and functionally from nonmusicians&# 39; brains. These differences include changes in volume, morphology, density, connectivity, and function across many regions of the brain. In addition to the extensive literature that investigates these differences cross-sectionally by comparing musicians and nonmusicians, longitudinal studies have demonstrated the causal influence of music training on the brain across the lifespan. However, {{there is a large}} degree of inconsistency in the findings, with discordance between studies, laboratories, and techniques. A review of this literature highlights a number of variables that appear to moderate the relationship between music training and brain structure and function. These include age at commencement of training, sex, absolute pitch, type of training, and instrument of training. These moderating variables may account for previously unexplained discrepancies in the existing literature, and we propose that future studies carefully consider <b>research</b> <b>designs</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodologies</b> that control for these variables...|$|R

30|$|In {{response}} to Ferris’ (2003) challenge {{to define the}} parameters of the <b>research</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodology</b> and in order to isolate the effectiveness of feedback, Guenette (2007) examined whether feedback is pedagogically correct. In her 2007 article, issues about whether the experiment considered the proficiency level of the participants, the type of treatment whether the feedback is focused on form or focused on content, on whether the corrections were direct or indirect, on whether the experiment was a one-time-occurrence or longitudinal and lastly, Guenette questioned whether there was any incentive or motivation provided to the participants. After reviewing numerous experiments, she argues that a generalized conclusion may not be arrived at as yet, because these studies seem to have not considered other variables that {{may have contributed to the}} conflicting results gleaned from these investigations. These variables include <b>research</b> <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodology.</b> From this standpoint, Guenette (2007) suggests creating an ideal experiment scenario where students, belonging to almost the same proficiency level in terms of speaking and writing in the second language, are given ample time to learn from the corrections given by their teachers. Other variables that stand to confound the result of this experiment may be the type of feedback given, whether content-focused or form-focused, and the classroom context. Lastly, Guenette emphasized the importance of motivation of the students in wanting to improve their writing skills in a study that questions the pedagogical correctness of feedback at the same time discussing the research design issues in studies of feedback writing.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{explore the}} {{psychological}} phenomenon of rivalry, {{defined as a}} competitive relationship that increases the psychological stakes of competition independent of the objective stakes. In particular, I investigate the consequences of rivalry for motivation, performance, and unethical behavior. I examine these questions {{with a variety of}} <b>research</b> <b>designs</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodologies,</b> including laboratory experiments, surveys, a field experiment, and an archival data analysis. Overall, this work represents the first systematic exploration of rivalry as a psychological phenomenon, and my findings suggest that it can be a double-edged sword, with both positive and negative consequences. Further, this research suggests a view of competition as relationally-dependent - that is, the behavior of actors within competitive settings depends upon whom they are competing against, and the relationships they have with these competitors. Beyond these two broad contributions, this research speaks to the literatures on motivation and ethical decision-making, and also suggests some important practical implications. In addition, a wide range of important and interesting directions exist for future research on rivalry...|$|R
