50|$|In {{the case}} of a railway bridge, when the railway track and ties are {{supported}} on load carrying elements of the superstructure (floor beams, stringers or girders), it is called an open deck. When the track rests upon ballast, which is then carried by the superstructure of the bridge, it is called a ballasted deck. A third type of <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> is direct fixation, where ties are not used and the rails are anchored directly to the superstructure of the bridge.|$|E
50|$|The Blue Line's Operations and Maintenance Facility (OMF) {{is located}} between the Cedar/Riverside and Franklin Avenue stations.

The second variant is the Mk 1L, with the same features as the Mk 1S, but with a 140 mm long cylinder to fit special-purpose grenades such as tear gas canisters and less-lethal impact rounds that are too long to fit in the other models' shorter cylinder. The Mk 1L also features a sliding buttstock.|$|E
50|$|In June 2014 Alliance {{successfully}} concluded {{negotiations with}} Network Rail for access paths to run between Euston and Blackpool/Huddersfield and Leeds from 2017 using Pendolino trains. However, in January 2015 and despite Network <b>Rail</b> <b>support,</b> the Office of Rail Regulation refused all proposed GNWR {{services and the}} application for reasons that included protection of the revenues of Virgin Trains (the incumbent operator of the InterCity West Coast franchise) and thence payments to the Department for Transport. Also because of capacity issues. This followed a proposed in December 2013 to run services between King's Cross and Skipton via Garforth and Keighley, but was rejected in 2014, by the Office Rail of Regulation.|$|E
50|$|The points/switches are {{different}} from those on the lignes classiques. Every LGV set of points incorporates a swingnose crossing (coeur à pointe mobile or 'moveable point frog'), which eliminates the gap in <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> that causes shock and vibration as wheels of a train pass over the 'frog' of conventional points. Eliminating these gaps makes the passage of a TGV over LGV switches imperceptible to passengers, reduces stresses on wheels and track, and permits much higher speeds, 160 km/h. At junctions, such as the junction on the TGV Atlantique where the line to Le Mans diverges from the line to Tours, special points designed for higher speeds are installed which permit a diverging speed of 220 km/h.|$|E

50|$|In June 2014, GNWR {{successfully}} concluded {{negotiations with}} Network Rail for access paths from London Euston to Blackpool, Huddersfield and Leeds from 2017 using Pendolino trains. However, in January 2015 and despite Network <b>Rail</b> <b>support,</b> the ORR refused these proposed GNWR services citing capacity issues and failing the not primarily abstractive test, meaning {{most of its}} revenue {{would be at the}} expense of existing others rather than new custom. In 2010, it was proposed that services be operated by dual-mode (diesel + electric) Polaris trains, capable of 140 mph. Sixteen trainsets were expected to be ordered, with a capacity of up to 350 passengers each. However, the Polaris deal was not finalised and Alliance indicated that it was investigating purchasing Pendolinos from Alstom.|$|E
50|$|Spalding {{railway station}} is {{situated}} on the Lincoln Central - Peterborough railway line, operated by East Midlands Trains. The service is irregular, {{and it does not}} run at night or on Sundays. It does provide convenient access to Peterborough for employment and shopping. The service to Peterborough was withdrawn by BR in October 1970 as part of the closure of the East Lincolnshire route from Grimsby and Boston, but reinstated in June 1971 with a grant from Spalding Urban District Council. This {{was one of the first}} examples of this type of <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> in the UK, and was not advocated in the Beeching Report. The section of the Great Northern & Great Eastern 'Joint' line from March, which carried the 'Boat Train' between Harwich and Sheffield, closed in 1982. The trackbed has largely been built over at the south of the town for housing. There has been encroachment towards Cowbit for new road construction. Spalding was also on the east-west Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, which had Bourne to the West and Holbeach to the east. It closed in February 1959, ending through passenger services from Leicester to Great Yarmouth via King's Lynn and Norwich. Local freight, mainly farm produce, continued to be carried between Bourne and Sutton Bridge until 1964. On 4 May 2002, Spalding had the honour of having a main line diesel locomotive named after it. Class 31 diesel No. 31106, in immaculate condition after a major works overhaul, hauled the ‘St James Tripper’ excursion to Peterborough from Preston via Doncaster, Lincoln and Sleaford, and made a brief stop at the station to have its ‘Spalding Town’ nameplates unveiled by Colin Fisher, Chairman of South Holland District Council. No. 31106 is the property of Cambridgeshire businessman and author Howard Johnston, who was born at nearby Cowbit and educated in the town. In 2012, the locomotive was still on hire to Rail Vehicle Engineering Limited and employed on Network Rail track measurement trains all over the United Kingdom. A replica 'Spalding Town' nameplate has been presented to SHDC for public display.|$|E
30|$|Discrete <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> {{model and}} {{continuous}} <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model are two classical {{models for the}} traditional mechanical analysis of railway track [1, 2]. In the discrete <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model, the stiffness of fastener supporting track is a spring constant, while in the continuous <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> model, it is denoted by track modulus, which is calculated with the spring constant divided by the spacing between centers of discrete supports. The stiffness measurement method based on the Winkler elastic foundation model uses track modulus to characterize the overall track stiffness.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus is an {{important}} factor in safety of railway track. This parameter is defined as support force imposing on rail length unit per rail unit displacement in vertical direction. <b>Rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus is important because it affects track performance and maintenance requirements. Both low and large modulus is undesirable. Low modulus of the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> has been shown to cause differential settlement that then increases maintenance needs. On the other hand, higher value of <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> causes axle load to be distributed on fewer sleepers and therefore received dynamic loads for any sleeper and rail-sleeper fastening will be increased. Sandy desert areas are critical regions about the contamination of ballast. In these areas, flowing sand grains influence between ballast aggregates and increase the stiffness of ballast layer and the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus. In this paper, the results of a field investigation about the effect of ballast contamination on the values of the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> modulus in sandy desert areas are presented...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle–track {{interaction}} {{for a new}} resilient {{slab track}} designed to reduce noise and vibration levels was analysed, {{in order to assess}} the derailment risk on a curved track when encountering a broken rail. Sensitivity of the <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> spacing of the relative position of the rail breakage between two adjacent rail supports and of running speed were analysed for two different elasticities of the rail fastening system. In none of the cases analysed was observed an appreciable difference between either of the elastic systems. As was expected, the most unfavourable situations were those with greater <b>rail</b> <b>support</b> spacing and those with greater distance from the breakage to the nearest <b>rail</b> <b>support,</b> although in none of the simulations performed did a derailment occur when running over the broken rail. When varying the running speed, the most favourable condition was obtained for an intermediate speed, due to the superposition of two antagonistic effects...|$|E
