50|$|Benefits of <b>rotary</b> <b>systems</b> {{are even}} development, and very low {{solution}} requirements in some cases. However, {{they can also}} {{require the use of}} more chemistry than normally needed when only a couple sheets are processed in a tube that has the capacity to hold more sheets because the a minimum amount of chemistry is required for the tube to work properly. Processing can be accomplished with the lights on with almost all <b>rotary</b> tube processing <b>systems</b> because they have light-tight covers. The photographer can also generally keep his/her hands free of chemistry, since the solutions are enclosed in the tubes. Also, since many <b>rotary</b> <b>systems</b> have or use a water bath, the bath can be temperature-controlled, resulting in very consistent results across different processing runs.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Rotary</b> <b>system</b> {{had been}} {{proposed}} for London by Bell (Western Electric) engineers, who had developed the Panel and Rotary {{systems in the}} 1900s; manufactured in the United States and Europe respectively. The Panel system with large switches was more suitable for a densely populated area like New York, and with outer areas of London having smaller exchanges they had proposed the <b>Rotary</b> <b>system</b> (initially to be manufactured in Antwerp) for London. However the Director system {{had the advantage of}} using equipment items similar to the SXS exchanges being used in smaller British cities and towns, and would be manufactured in Britain from the outset.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{increase}} of the root canal area after instrumentation with EndoSequence or ProTaper <b>rotary</b> <b>systems.</b> Methods: Twenty-two mesial root canals from mandibular molars were instrumented. Teeth were mounted on a base, numbered, and divided into 2 groups; teeth from 1 - 11 (PT group) were instrumented by using the ProTaper system, and teeth from 12 - 22 (ES group) were instrumented by using the EndoSequence system. Cone beam computed tomography was performed on all teeth before and after instrumentation. Measurements at 3, 5, and 7 mm as well as differences in instrument performance were statistically compared by the Student t test at 5 % significance level. Results: Both systems increased significantly the root canal area (P <. 05) at all levels. Comparison between the <b>rotary</b> <b>systems</b> showed significantly greater increase (P <. 05) for EndoSequence at 3 mm, with no statistically significant difference (P <. 05) at the other levels.

40|$|Computed {{tomography}} {{evaluation of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>systems</b> on the root canal transportation and centering ability Abstract: The endodontic preparation of curved and narrow root canals is challenging, with {{a tendency for}} the prepared canal to deviate away from its natural axis. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate, by cone-beam computed tomography, the transportation and centering ability of curved mesiobuccal canals in maxillary molars after biomechanical preparation with different nickel-titanium (NiTi) <b>rotary</b> <b>systems.</b> Forty teeth with angles of curvature ranging from 20 ° to 40 ° and radii between 5. 0 mm and 10. 0 mm were selected and assigned into four groups (n = 10), according to the biomechanical preparative system used: Hero 642 (HR), Liberator (LB), ProTaper (PT), and Twisted File (TF). The specimens were inserted into an acrylic device and scanned with computed tomography prior to, and following, instrumentation at 3, 6 and 9 mm from the root apex. The canal degree of transportation and centering ability were calculated and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s tests (α = 0. 05). The results demonstrated no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in shaping ability among the <b>rotary</b> <b>systems.</b> The mean canal transportation was:- 0. 049 ± 0. 083 mm (HR);- 0. 004 ± 0. 044 mm (LB);- 0. 003 ± 0. 064 mm (PT);- 0. 021 ± 0. 064 mm (TF). The mean canal centering ability was:- 0. 093 ± 0. 147 mm (HR);- 0. 001 ± 0. 100 mm (LB);- 0. 002 ± 0. 134 mm (PT);- 0. 033 ± 0. 133 mm (TF). Also, there was no significant difference among the root segments (p> 0. 05). It was concluded that the Hero 642, Liberator, ProTaper, and Twisted File <b>rotary</b> <b>systems</b> could be safely used in curved canal instrumentation, resulting in satisfactory preservation of the original canal shape...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} use micro-computed {{tomography}} (micro-CT) imaging {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of the reciprocating and <b>rotary</b> <b>systems</b> for the removal of root filling materials in comparison with hand files.

Micro-CT was used to scan the specimens before and after each treatment step. Percentage of volume of residual root filling was measured. The operating time was recorded.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{straightening}} of root canal curvature, the apical transportation, {{the loss of}} working length and the working time using two <b>rotary</b> <b>systems.</b> Study design: Sixty buccal root canals with angles of curvature between 30 to 99 º were instrumented with Mtwo and Twisted File rotary instruments.

50|$|From 1912, the British General Post Office, {{which also}} {{operated}} the British telephone system, installed several automatic telephone exchanges from several vendors in trials at Darlington on 10 October 1914 (<b>rotary</b> <b>system),</b> Fleetwood (relay exchange from Sweden), Grimsby (Siemens), Hereford (Lorimer) and Leeds (Strowger). The BPO selected the Strowger switches for small and medium cities and towns.

The Director systems used SXS switches for destination routing and number translation facilities similar to the register used in common-control exchanges.
