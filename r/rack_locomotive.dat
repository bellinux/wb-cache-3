25|$|In 1812, Matthew Murray's {{successful}} twin-cylinder <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> Salamanca first {{ran on the}} edge-railed rack-and-pinion Middleton Railway. Another well-known early locomotive was Puffing Billy, built 1813–14 by engineer William Hedley. It {{was intended}} {{to work on the}} Wylam Colliery near Newcastle upon Tyne. This locomotive is the oldest preserved, and is on static display in the Science Museum, London. George Stephenson built Locomotion No. 1 for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, north-east England, which was the first public steam railway in the world. In 1829, his son Robert built in Newcastle The Rocket which was entered in and won the Rainhill Trials. This success led to the company emerging as the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives used on railways in the UK, US and much of Europe. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened a year later making exclusive use of steam power for passenger and goods trains.|$|E

50|$|Modern steam locomotives, {{such as the}} <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives</b> of Brienz-Rothorn railway and DLM's modernised class 52.80 locomotive, are {{fitted with}} {{internal}} electric heaters.This allows keeping the well insulated boiler warm overnight or even to start heating automatically in the early morning.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} its {{advanced}} features, the CSAR <b>Rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> was a failure and was outperformed by the older and much smaller predecessor Class G <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive.</b> As a result, the rack mechanisms of both locomotives were removed {{within a year of}} their entering service, converting them to ordinary two-cylinder tank locomotives. Owing to their failure, the old 32 Tonners remained in service until 1908, when a new alignment with easier gradients, including a new tunnel, was constructed and the rack section could be abandoned.|$|E

50|$|The Abt {{system was}} devised by Roman Abt, a Swiss {{locomotive}} engineer. Abt worked for Riggenbach at his works in Olten and later at his IGB <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> company. In 1885, he founded his own civil engineering company.|$|E
50|$|The {{rack railway}} section near Mount Morgan was closed in 1952 after a {{conventional}} line {{was built to}} bypass it, with grades of 1 in 50 (2%). This occurred because the <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives</b> were due for replacement and the rack section was becoming a bottleneck in the haulage of coal from Callide Coalfields.|$|R

50|$|The trains for the Lausanne-Ouchy line {{consisted}} of 2 unpowered passenger cars and a locomotive in push-pull configuration. There were 3 <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives</b> numbered 121-123, designated He 2/2, rated at 622 hp, 6.25 m {{in length and}} weighing 18.1 tons, with {{a top speed of}} 32 km/h. They were built by Swiss Lokomotivfabirk Winterthur using electrical components from Maschienefabrik Oerlikon in 1958.|$|R
50|$|This gearing {{is part of}} the {{machinery}} within the locomotive and {{should not be confused with}} the pinion that propels a <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> along the rack between the rails. The geared steam locomotives that have been built have been for conventional track, relying on the adhesion between wheels and rail.|$|E
50|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{steam locomotive}} was Matthew Murray's <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> Salamanca {{built for the}} narrow gauge Middleton Railway in Leeds in 1812.

50|$|In 1881 {{the first}} <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> was {{designed}} and built. Its customer was the industrial railway of a Hungarian steelworks. This engine {{was designed as a}} narrow gauge locomotive (790 mm rail gauge). Because they were the only licence holders for the Abt rack system in the Danube monarchy, orders for locomotives for the Erzbergbahn and the Bosnia-Hercegovina State Railways (760mm gauge) went to Floridsdorf.|$|E

50|$|In 1928 {{the rack}} railway section was {{replaced}} with a funicular section, and the <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives</b> by cable tractors. However, the original four-wheel trams continued running until 1935, when they were replaced by new bogie cars. The extension to Villa Opicina station was closed in 1938. After nearly 60 years of private ownership, the line {{was taken over by}} the municipality of Trieste in 1961.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} opened in 1902, and as built {{incorporated}} a rack railway section between Piazza Scorcola and Vetta Scorcola. Conventional four-wheel tramcars operated {{the full length}} of the line, being assisted up and down the rack section by three small <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives.</b> In 1906 the line was extended at its top end from the village of Villa Opicina to Villa Opicina station, a distance of 1.2 km.|$|R
50|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{steam locomotive}} was Matthew Murray's <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive,</b> Salamanca, {{built for the}} narrow gauge Middleton Railway in 1812. This was followed in 1813 by the Puffing Billy built by Christopher Blackett and William Hedley for the Wylam Colliery Railway, the first successful locomotive running by adhesion only. Puffing Billy is now {{on display in the}} Science Museum in London, the oldest locomotive in existence.|$|E
50|$|The line {{provides}} some 15 return services per day, with services every 40 minutes and a journey time of 52 minutes. Any given service may be {{operated by a}} convoy {{of more than one}} train, with each train usually comprising an electric <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> and two coaches. The locomotive always operates {{at the lower end of}} the train, pushing the train up the mountain and leading it down.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lines were}} {{constructed}} to a gauge of [...] and electrified from the outset. Presently it operates on 900 V DC, overhead contact. Train services were offered from Vevey to Chamby and Châtel-St-Denis, where the CEV {{connected to the}} MOB and GFM (now tpf). The electric motor coach from Vevey to Chamby conveyed coaches to Blonay, where they were taken over by a <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> and brought up to Les Pléiades.|$|E
50|$|A {{parallel}} line {{of development}} was {{the return to}} steam power of the old Lake Geneva paddle steamer Montreux that had been refitted with a diesel-electric engine in the 1960s. Economic aims similar to those achieved with the <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives</b> were pursued through automatic control of the light-oil-fired boiler and remote control of the engine from the bridge, enabling the steamship to be operated by a crew {{of the same size}} as a motor ship.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 {{production}} {{of a wide range}} of rail vehicles including trams, diesel <b>locomotives,</b> underground and <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives,</b> and mineral wagons was underway, with 60% of the production for export. In 1960 the factory began to undertake the {{production of}} ultra-pure metals by electron beam furnace. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the factory produced new classes of electric locomotive for the Deutsche Reichsbahn including the DR Class 250 (1974), the DR Class 243 (1982).|$|R
50|$|The {{line from}} Delagoa Bay {{and up the}} {{escarpment}} to Waterval Boven was completed on 20 June 1894. To work on the rack section, the Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg-Maatschappij (NZASM) ordered three 0-4-2 <b>rack</b> tank <b>locomotives</b> from Emil Kessler's Maschinenfabrik Esslingen. The three locomotives were delivered in 1894, numbered {{in the range from}} 991 to 993. A fourth locomotive, no. 994, was ordered in 1897 and was identical to the other three, except that it had a coal bunker and water tanks with larger capacities, which made it heavier. Since the NZASM classified its locomotives according to their weight, the <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives</b> were known as 32 Tonners. In addition to being numbered, they were all named as well, with the names and numbers cast in brass and mounted on their tank sides.|$|R
50|$|The four rack {{locomotives}} {{were all}} shedded at Waterval Onder. When working a train up to Waterval Boven, a 32 Tonner would be coupled {{to the rear}} end of a train as banking engine. When working a descending train, the order of assembly was reversed, with the train's locomotive at the rear end and the <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> in front to act as brake. Loads of 120 to 140 lt t could be handled in this manner.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> had plate frames, {{arranged}} {{outside the}} coupled wheels, and {{was equipped with}} the Heusinger von Waldegg version of Walschaerts valve gear. The pinion for the rack was mounted between the coupled wheels, just forward of the driving axle. The pinion axle was coupled to the drivers through side rods, with the connecting rods coupled directly to crank disks which were mounted {{on the ends of}} the axle, outside the frames. These crank disks were grooved to act as brake drums.|$|E
5000|$|Salamanca is {{probably}} the locomotive {{referred to in the}} September 1814 edition of Annals of Philosophy: [...] "Some time ago a steam-engine was mounted upon wheels at Leeds, and made to move along a rail road by means of a rack wheel, dragging after it a number of waggons loaded with coals." [...] The item continues to mention a <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> about a mile north of Newcastle (Blücher at Killingworth) and one without a rack wheel (probably Puffing Billy at Wylam).|$|E
5000|$|The later {{class of}} four 32 Tonner <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives,</b> built by Esslingen in 1894 and 1897, was {{equipped}} with pinions for use on the rack railway section between Waterval Onder and Waterval Boven in the eastern Transvaal. They survived through the Imperial Military Railways (IMR) and CSAR eras and, even though the rack section was removed in 1908, {{they were still in}} service in 1912 when they were taken onto the SAR roster as obsolete unclassified locomotives.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the railway}} was being planned, only the Swiss had {{significant}} experience in building <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives,</b> {{so it was}} they who won the contract to build the engines for the line. In comparison with some Swiss railways the line is not very steep, and this {{is reflected in the}} design of the engines, which are all classified 0-4-2T. [...] The boilers of the locomotives are set at an angle of 9°, to keep the water level over the tubes when the locomotive is ascending the mountain.|$|R
50|$|The {{rack railway}} was closed in 1952 after a {{conventional}} line diversion was built, with grades of 1 in 50 (2%) {{able to handle}} ~750 ton trains, partly because the <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives</b> were due to be replaced but mainly because the development of export coal mines at Callide and Moura {{would not have been}} able to be provided with adequate rail service with the bottleneck that the rack section created. A concrete retaining wall from the line remains at the top of the Razorback Ranges on the entry to Mount Morgan. A short section of the rack centre rail has been retained in Morgan Street, Mount Morgan, opposite the town museum.|$|R
50|$|Three {{generations of}} rolling stock {{exist on the}} line. The {{original}} stock consisted of passenger cars hauled by four six wheeled electric locomotives, numbered E1-E4, built by SLM and BBC in 1930-31. They were supplemented by four two-car electric trains numbered A5-A8, built by SLM and BBC in 1985. The final generation is represented by two low-floor electric motor coaches of type Stadler GTW and numbered A10-A11, built by Stadler Rail in Switzerland in 2003. The line also owns a diesel <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive,</b> D9, used on works trains and to push the snow plough.|$|E
50|$|The {{next stage}} to Moongan was a 2315-metre Abt rack system to {{negotiate}} grades as steep as 1 in 16.5 (6%). The rack system consisted of 2 parallel toothed vertical bars fixed between the rails which connected with specially built locomotives. The <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> pushed {{from the rear}} of the train during ascent to prevent runaways if a coupling broke, and the front during descent, as the rack provided part of the braking force. Kirkhall, Baree and Walterhall (which was the junction for the branch to the mine itself) were sidings above the rack section. The line to Mount Morgan railway station opened on 26 November 1898.|$|E
5000|$|Blüchers {{performance}} {{was described in}} the second 1814 volume of the Annals of Philosophy. The item started by recording a <b>rack</b> <b>locomotive</b> at Leeds (probably Salamanca) and continued: [...] "The experiment succeeded so well at Leeds, that a similar engine has been erected at Newcastle, about a mile north from that town. It moves {{at the rate of}} three miles an hour, dragging after it 14 waggons, loaded each with about two tons of coals; so that in this case the expense of 14 horses is saved by the substitution of the steam-engine". The item continues to mention a locomotive without a rack wheel (probably Puffing Billy at Wylam).|$|E
5000|$|Counter-pressure brakes {{were found}} {{especially}} on steam engines that worked long inclines and on <b>rack</b> railway <b>locomotives</b> (e.g. on the Vienna Kahlenberg Railway (Kahlenbergbahn), relieving brake blocks and tyres from {{high levels of}} wear and tear that they would otherwise be subjected to.|$|R

50|$|Soon, {{the company}} was looking for {{alternatives}} to the staff and cost-intensive rack railway operations (which with {{the maintenance of the}} Prussian T 26 <b>rack</b> <b>locomotives</b> and the toothed rack sections, particularly in winter, were complex and expensive). As early as 1923, both class 94.5-17 and class 95 locomotives were tested. However, the class 95 locomotives proved to be too heavy because they damaged the rail track superstructure. The experiments with class 94.5-17 locomotives however proved satisfactory and thus the changeover to adhesion operations occurred in 1927 with steam locomotives that could operate on the rack sections (with Riggenbach counter-pressure brakes), which now also hauled the trains while facing uphill because of the comprehensive introduction of fail-safe air brakes and more powerful locomotives.|$|R
