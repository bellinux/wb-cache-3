40|$|A time-domain {{numerical}} simulation method is {{applied for the}} investigation of parametric <b>roll</b> <b>resonance</b> in regular head waves for {{two different types of}} vessels, namely a fishing vessel and a RoRo ship. The employed mathematical model captures satisfactorily most of the parameters relevant to the problem hence enables an improved reproduction and understanding of the complicated non-linear parametric roll phenomenon. The coupling between the induced roll and pitch motions along with the nonlinear character of the restoring moment associated with large amplitude wave induced motions {{have been found to be}} the determinant factors of the observed <b>roll</b> <b>resonance</b> phenomenon.

Nowadays, linear and non-linear time domain seakeeping codes represent the two main standards for direct calculation of ship motion and structural loads in waves.

40|$|Potentially {{dangerous}} zones {{corresponding to}} dynamical stability phenomena, possibly encountered by ships sailing in rough sea, are estimated nowadays {{with the use}} of the method recommended by IMO in the guidance coded MSC. 1 /Circ. 1228. In this IMO method the parameter governing the natural period of roll is the initial metacentric height. Some earlier studies revealed that the initial metacentric height which is commonly in use on-board ships for the purpose of performing the MSC. 1 /Circ. 1228 -recommended calculations, may significantly vary from the so called equivalent metacentric height obtained for large amplitudes of ship’s roll. In the light of such ascertainment, the paper deals with resultant <b>resonance</b> <b>roll</b> zones locations with regard to the equivalent metacentric height concept remaining appropriate for large amplitudes of roll. The noteworthy transfer of the resonance zones location is disclosed which reflects the distinct configurations of potentially dangerous ship’s course and speed configurations than could be predicted on the basis the initial metacentric height...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and compares}} three 1 -DOF {{models for the}} description of roll dynamics in beam waves. Two models have a nonlinear restoring, while the third model is a linear model in restoring. All models are characterised by nonlinear damping. The two nonlinear models are different in the way restoring and excitation terms are implemented. One nonlinear model {{is based on a}} relative angle approach which incorporates the wave excitation into the ship roll restoring. The second nonlinear model is based on an absolute angle approach which separates the nonlinear restoring from the forcing term. Simulation results according to the three models are compared under two types of wave excitations: bi-frequency excitation and excitation generated according to specified sea spectra. The behaviour of the considered models is shown to be significantly different in some cases if nonlinearities of restoring are large. In particular, the restoring nonlinearities in the relative angle modelling introduce mixing frequencies effects which {{seem to be able to}} promote <b>roll</b> motion at <b>resonance</b> also when the excitation frequency is far from the roll natural frequency if roll restoring nonlinearities are sufficiently large...|$|R
40|$|Finned {{projectiles}} {{that are}} meant to be unspun could acquire small roll rates in flight due to slight configurational asymmetries. If the roll rate matches the natural yawing frequency of the projectile, a resonance phenomenon takes place resulting in yaw amplification, and possible loss of stability. To avoid this, finned projectiles are deliberately spun to a roll rate well beyond the resonance value. This gives rise to a passage-through-resonance phenomenon in the flight of finned projectiles. Finned projectiles passing through resonance are known to exhibit the phenomena of <b>roll</b> lock-in, transient <b>resonance,</b> and catastrophic yaw. Projectiles locked in at the resonance condition experience large yaw and are likely to lose the desired flight path. On the other hand, transient resonance is a milder phenomenon where the projectile locks in at resonance briefly before continuing to build-up to the design value. However, the yaw amplification during the brief period of resonance may be sufficient to destabilize the projectile. The problem of passage through resonance of finned projectiles with a center-of-mass offset is considered in this paper. Roll lock-in and transient resonance at normal and reverse resonance is shown. It is observed that the yaw amplification at transient resonance is much lower than that at lock-in. The lack of yaw amplification can be understood based on the bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations reported in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Parametric <b>roll</b> <b>resonance</b> is a {{dangerous}} resonance phenomenon affecting several kinds of ships, such as cruise ships, fishing vessels and container ships. In a worst case scenario parametric <b>roll</b> <b>resonance</b> may lead to roll angles of up to 50 degrees, capsizing of the vessel, or damage of goods and ship for {{tens of millions of}} dollars, citep{Ginsberg 1998 }. Accurate equations in the model for the ship motion are important because they are directly related to the observer design. There has been done allot of mathematical investigations on the problem. In this work, we use a standard model for parametric roll, and express it in state-space form. We establish an augmented state-space model by adding wave-induced forces to the nonlinear state-space model. We revise Lie Derivatives, and use an observability check for nonlinear systems, to derive conditions for nonlinear observability of our system. A Matlab/Simulink model is implemented, and shows that the state space modelis good for simulation of a ship exhibiting parametric roll. The main goal of this thesis has been to investigate different observers for state estimation of a ship exhibiting parametric roll. The wave encounter frequency is estimated by implementing an extended Kalman filter, and in turn an unscented Kalman filter. By comparing the two filters, we conclude that the unscented Kalman filter has better empirical results for estimation of the states of a ship in parametric <b>roll</b> <b>resonance</b> condition.

The paper has two main foci: first, the establishment of Susceptibility Criteria {{that can be used to}} determine if there is danger of parametric roll and, second, a description of methods for calculating amplitude of parametric roll in longitudinal waves that serves as a Severity Criterion. Verification of the both criteria has been done using the Large Amplitude Motions Program (LAMP), one of the most sophisticated general seakeeping simulation codes available.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this Master thesis is to provide {{insights}} about thesensitivity of parametric roll occurrence. Parametric <b>roll</b> <b>resonance</b> may leadto large roll angles experienced by the ship typically in longitudinal waves. Itis related to the periodic change of stability when the ship's wave encounterfrequency is approximately twice the rolling natural frequency and the dampingof the ship to dissipate the parametric roll energy is not sucient to avoidthe onset of a resonant condition. This study contains a brief description ofthis physical phenomenon and presents {{the state of the}} art in terms of theoretical,numerical and physical modeling.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is sea keeping and {{stability}} of a fishing vessel in regular waves, with focus on parametric <b>roll</b> <b>resonance.</b> Parametric <b>roll</b> <b>resonance</b> is resonance in roll due to time variation of a parameter, {{in this case the}} metacentric height or the restoring term. This variation is caused by the ship moving in waves, and is hence a function of heave, roll, pitch roll and time. We have made a mathematical model based on strip theory that can calculate the linear ship motions. The restoring term in roll has been modified to be non-linear and to vary with time, and we have added a viscous damping term in roll due to bilge keels. We look at any wave heading, and the equations of motions are coupled in terms of heave-pitch and sway-roll-yaw. The two dimensional added mass and damping coefficients are calculated beforehand by a separate program and used as input to this model. The linear ship motions are presented in the frequency domain in terms of transfer functions and the simulations of parametric <b>roll</b> <b>resonance</b> are presented by polar diagrams as function of forward speed and wave heading in terms of safe and unsafe domains with respect to resonance. We may get resonance both in head and bow sea as well as following and quartering sea. For head and bow sea, the dangerous forward speeds and headings are the ones giving a ratio of the period of encounter and the natural period in roll in the vicinity of T e /T n ≈ 0. 5. For the following and quartering sea case this ratio is in the vicinity of T e /T n ≈ 1 for the sea states analyzed here. The speed range giving resonance decreases for head or bow sea when the wave period is increasing and increases for following and quartering sea. The roll amplitude is small close to the lower speed limits of the speed range for head sea, but increases rapidly when T e /T n approaches 0. 51 - 0. 52, and a general trend seems to be that the roll amplitude increases with increasing forward speed. During parametric resonance, the vessel will oscillate in roll with its natural frequency, even though the wave excitation moment in roll oscillates with the frequency of encounter. The vessel analyzed here, a 90 ft purse seiner, has natural periods in coupled heave-pitch that are close to or equal to half the natural period coupled sway-roll-yaw. The vessel will then have its maximum vertical motions and hence maximum change of metacentric height when there is danger of parametric resonance. This makes this kind of vessel particularly vulnerable to parametric resonance in roll. It is not sufficient that the vessel complies the intact stability rules in order to avoid parametric resonance. If parametric resonance has occurred, an effective way to escape it is to slow down and increase the heading relative to the waves.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Parametric <b>roll</b> <b>resonance</b> is a {{nonlinear}} resonance {{phenomenon that}} can cause roll angles of up to 40 for ships. Modern container ships are especially prone to parametric roll due to their particular hull shape, bow flare and stern overhang. Control strategies {{have been developed to}} control parametric <b>roll</b> <b>resonance.</b> An especially promising control strategy seems to be speed control. However this control strategy uses both the speed of the ship and the wave encounter frequency and while generally the speed of the ship is known, the wave encounter frequency is not, since this is not trivial to measure at sea. In this work a state-space model to describe the ship will be derived. For this model observability will be checked using two different techniques. Furthermore the model will be used to design a state observer for the wave frequency and wave encounter frequency. Observability will first be checked using the nonlinear observability rank condition, which proves local observability if the observation space of the model has full column rank. A second technique uses the observability Grammian for the linearized system to determine local observability. Using a particular model structure it will be shown that it suffices to analyze the Grammian of a reduced order model. This technique can also only prove local observability since it depends on the particular linearization of the system. After observability of the model is investigated a state observer is designed. However first the theory of Kalman filtering is presented. The first state observer that is then designed is an extended Kalman filter. An unscented Kalman filter to reduce linearization errors is also developed. These two types of Kalman filters are tested and their behavior with respect to initial conditions is analyzed. Finally a fixed gain observer is designed and tested in simulation. This fixed gain observer still requires a mathematical proof of stability. An attempt to prove stability for this observer is made by using Lyapunov methods based techniques...|$|E

Intermittent resonance occurs precisely when the random parametric excitation pushes the system into the instability region, causing an extreme magnitude response.

Numerical simulations are performed for a hull with hardening restoring and relatively low metacentric heights. Two cases are considered in the simulations: an archetypal two-harmonics forcing and the case of irregular waves.

40|$|A Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) {{numerical}} {{method has}} been employed {{in conjunction with}} a chimera domain decomposition approach for time-domain simulation of large amplitude ship roll motions. For the simulation of arbitrary roll motions, it is convenient to construct body-fitted numerical grids for the ship and ambient flow domain separately. The ship grid block is allowed to roll with respect to its center of rotation under either forced or free roll conditions. The roll moments are computed every time step by a direct integration of the hull surface pressure and shear stresses obtained from the chimera RANS method. The simulations for prescribed roll motions of a full-scale motor vessel clearly show that the bilge keels at the mid-ship produced large roll damping but generated very little waves. On the other hand, the ship skag acts like a wavemaker during the roll motion and produced large wakes in the stem region.

40|$|Parametric <b>roll</b> <b>resonance</b> is a {{dangerous}} resonance phenomenon affecting several types of ships, such as destroyers, RO-RO paxes, cruise ships, fishing vessels and especially container ships. Worst case, parametric roll is capable of causing roll angles of at least 50 degrees, and damage {{in the tens of}} millions of US dollars. Empirical and mathematical investigations have concluded that parametric roll occurs due to periodic changes in the waterplane area of the ship. If the vessel is sailing in longitudinal seas, with waves of approximately the same length as the ship, and encounter frequency of about twice the natural roll frequency, then parametric resonance can occur. While there is a significant amount of literature on the hydrodynamics of parametric roll, there is less on controlling and stopping the phenomenon through active control. The main goal of this thesis has been to develop controllers capable of stopping parametric roll. Two main results on control are presented. To derive, analyze and simulate the controllers, it proved necessary to develop novel models. The thesis thus contains four major contributions on modeling.

40|$|Extreme {{roll motion}} of ships {{can be caused}} by several phenomena, one of which is {{parametric}} <b>roll</b> <b>resonance.</b> Several incidents occurred unexpectedly around the millennium and caused vast fiscal losses on large container vessels. The phenomenon is now well understood and some consider parametric roll a curiosity, others have concerns. This study employs novel signal-based detection algorithms to analyse logged motion data from a container vessel (2800 ~TEU) and a large car and truck carrier (LCTC) during one year at sea. The scope of the study is to assess the performance and robustness of the detection algorithms in real conditions, and to evaluate the frequency of parametric roll events on the selected vessels. Detection performance is scrutinised through the validation of the detected events using owners' standard methods, and supported by available wave radar data. Further, a bivariate statistical analysis of the outcome of the signal-based detectors is performed to assess the real life false alarm probability. It is shown that detection robustness and very low false warning rates are obtained. The study concludes that small parametric roll events are occurring, and that the proposed signal-based monitoring system is a simple and effective mean to provide timely warning of resonance conditions.

40|$|An {{inconvenience}} in {{the experimental}} set-up of a FPSO in regular waves highlighted occurrence of parametric-roll events promoted by yaw-roll coupling and motivated a combined physical and numerical analysis on the relevance of this phenomenon on the <b>roll</b> <b>resonance,</b> {{as well as on}} the water shipping. The model tests examine the ship in head- and bow-sea waves in the zone of the first parametric resonance. Numerically, it is adopted a 3 D Domain-Decomposition (DD) strategy combining a weakly-nonlinear potential-flow solver based on the weak-scatterer theory with a shallow-water approximation for the shipped liquid and with a bottom-slamming solution. Detailed comparisons against these and other seakeeping experiments validated the numerical method in its different aspects with global success. At first, a 2 -dof equivalent linearized yaw-roll coupled system is examined and the measurements are used to estimate hydrodynamic coefficients required to complete the mathematical model of the problem. Then the DD method is applied to verify the instability occurrence and compared against the experiments. From the analysis, the parametric-roll instability does not occur if all nonlinearities in the roll restoring load are not accounted for. However the amplitude of the resonant roll is affected by the coupling with the other degrees of freedom. Especially the coupling with yaw tends to increase the steady-state roll amplitude. It also affects the water shipping with the trend in reducing its severity for the vessel, this is opposite to the influence of the parametric roll in head-sea waves on the water on deck, as documented in Greco et al.

40|$|For modern ship design — as {{confirmed}} by {{many examples of}} ship design and operation — the current intact stability code (IMO (2002)) {{does not provide a}} reliable basis for the assess-ment of ship safety in rough seas. In ship design the applica-tion of the IS-Code is not supporting design decisions towards increased safety in rough seas (Cramer and Krüger (2001)), and ship operators find their cargo and/or vessels endangered by large roll angles and accelerations (France et al.

This paper presents innovative deterministic seakeeping test procedures which are used to identify the physical mechanism endangering intact ships by evaluating cause-reaction relations of wave/structure interaction. Rogue wave sequences are embedded in severe seas for computer controlled capsizing tests of different vessels at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin. The model test results are used as a basis for the development of non-linear numerical methods to simulate ship motions in extreme seas with the target to design safer ships with reduced capsizing risk. Polar plots following from the non-linear simulations allow the evaluation of ship safety in severe seas with reference to course, speed and trim.

The DWSC, basically a stepped classic spar with a catamaran as its deck, because of certain unique features, may be susceptible to parametric excitation. This thesis examines the phenomenon of parametric excitation with respect to roll motion in head seas, using time-domain simulation and stability analysis. It examines the DWSC's susceptibility to parametric instability using the same methods of analysis and the effect of damping (especially viscous drag) on parametric excitation and instability. The thesis uses Mathieu's equation as the basis for stability analysis and time-simulates the coupled heave-sway-roll EOM. Time-domain simulation is done for two reasons: firstly for determining the variation in roll stiffness because of a regular wave (the variation in roll stiffness is an input to the stability analysis) and secondly for simulating the coupled heave-sway-roll EOM. Both time-domain analysis and stability analysis are done for sea states of interest and for examining interesting phenomena like <b>roll</b> <b>resonance</b> (due to body-wave interaction) and parametric instability. Results highlight: 1) a "cancellation frequency" in the heave wave exciting force; 2) the effect of viscous drag on coupled heave-sway-roll motions; 3) time-simulations validating the stability analysis; 4) the trend of stability with increasing sea states, wave periods and amplitudes; 5) characteristics of parametric instability; 6) the methodology used to predict or detect parametric instability and 7) the effect of viscous drag on parametric instability...|$|E
40|$|Part I: We {{examine a}} {{nonlinear}} diffusion equation that arises {{in the study}} of a number of physical problems, where the equation is nonlinear because the diffusion coefficient is proportional to a power of the concentration. Previous authors have proven using similarity solutions, that this dependence produces fronts (interfaces between regions of zero and nonzero concentration) which propagate with finite speed, as well as waiting-time behavior, where the fronts remain stationary for a finite amount of time before beginning to move. These similarity solutions provide limited information about the solution for general initial conditions, however. To alleviate this deficiency, we construct approximate solutions for the above nonlinear diffusion equation using singular perturbation theory. We do so by considering the equation in the limit of nearly linear diffusion, but the analysis reveals the basic qualitative behavior outside this limit as well. The basic behavior follows from the leading-order approximation of a transformed equation, and propagating and waiting fronts are due to the formation (in this approximation) of what we call corner shocks. This enables us to determine for which initial conditions waiting time behavior will occur. The transformed equation must be solved to first order to find the solution of the original equation to leading order, and when corner shocks occur at a point of nonzero concentration, this first order analysis shows that they become rounded (which we call a corner layer). When a corner shock occurs at a point of zero concentration, this rounding does not take place, and the corner shock remains sharp. This allows us to give a simple procedure for constructing approximate solutions of the nonlinear diffusion equation when corner shocks occur only at points of zero concentration. Part II: We study a model of reentry <b>roll</b> <b>resonance,</b> a situation encountered when an almost axially symmetric vehicle reenters the earth's atmosphere, using the method of near identity transformations. This method allows us to extend previous results for the case of sustained resonance, when roll buildup occurs. In particular, we give necessary conditions both for entrainmeat to sustained resonance and for sustained resonance to continue. These conditions imply that it is possible for sustained resonance to last for a finite time and then for unlocking of the resonance to occur. In addition, from the analysis we make a conjecture concerning sufficient conditions for sustained resonance...|$|E
