40|$|Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling of {{ring-shaped}} trenches (<b>ring</b> <b>drilling)</b> induces controlled gradual {{strain relief}} {{at the surface}} of residually stressed samples, with the central "island" approaching the unstressed state. Strain change was measured at sample surface via Digital Image Correlation analysis of SEM micrographs of a regular pattern of dots deposited on the sample surface prior to <b>ring</b> <b>drilling.</b> FE modeling of strain evolution with <b>ring</b> <b>drilling</b> depth agrees with experimental observations. The technique proposed represents a substantial improvement over prior attempts, constituting an efficient semi-destructive method for accurate residual stress evaluation at the (sub) micron scale. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Drilling {{constitutes}} {{an important part}} of the production process in sublevel stoping method and up to 50 % of the total costs can be attributed to this element. With the advent of recently developed sophisticated and expensive drilling machines, sublevel stoping has gained renewed advantage over other similar methods. The use of these machines, however, substantially increases the capital cost of the whole operation and hence choosing the optimum drilling system can produce significant savings in costs. In this paper, drilling patterns have been designed for various conditions of the physical characteristics and geometrical conditions of an ore body. Total costs of some 150 different patterns have been compiled. Based on these empirical data, a practical model has been devised that determines drilling costs in all different feasible situations in sublevel stoping. The model shows that parallel drilling is the most efficient alternative in all workable conditions. As well the break-even orebody thickness in <b>ring</b> <b>drilling</b> between one or two production drifts in sublevels is, in most cases, about 30 meters. The prescribed drilling methods in different circumstances and the model introduced, can serve as useful tools to the mining design engineer in choosing the most economical drilling system when designing a stope...|$|E

5000|$|There are {{approximately}} two hundred short climbs at Harrison's Rocks, ranging widely in difficulty. Climbing is exclusively protected {{by means of}} a [...] "top rope". This is the same as at all Southern Sandstone outcrops. Lead climbing is prohibited for two main reasons. Firstly, it is dangerous because the rock is too friable; any gear placed in the sandstone cracks would easily rip out {{in the event of a}} leader fall. Lead-climbing is also discouraged for reasons of conservation - it is unacceptable for climbers to risk further damage to the thin rock crust on the surface of the crags. Unconsolidated and friable sand lies beneath this crust. Deep rope-grooves can be seen in places at Harrison's Rocks and are testament to the fragility of the rock. All of the climbs are quite short, with the highest at approximately 30 ft and the lowest at 15 ft. Most climbs have a <b>ring</b> <b>drilled</b> and set into the rock at the top for setting up a top rope, but some rely on the use of tree trunks for protection.|$|R

The Riflemans gimmick was a modified Winchester Model 1892 rifle, with a large <b>ring</b> lever <b>drilled</b> and tapped for a set screw. The lever design allowed him to cock the rifle by spinning it around his hand. In addition, the screw could be positioned to depress the trigger every time he worked the lever, allowing for rapid fire, emptying the magazine in under five seconds during the opening credits on North Forks main street.|$|R

Guy helps Wendy/Chance investigate and they discover that Father is using a sharp signet <b>ring</b> to <b>drill</b> into the skulls and draw nectar from their brains of the orphans (and his own children). The nectar is harvested and shipped to the mainland, and also used to extend Mother's youth. She becomes twenty years younger, and hopes to eventually return to infancy, but the effects are daily reversed by the age-ifying efforts of keeping Sis and the other children in line and properly repressed. Sis being the biggest problem, Mother sends her for additional nectar-harvesting, but the over-harvesting causes Sis to murder Father in self-defense.|$|R
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was hot, and {{the roar of}} the river in the depths below emphasized the drowsy stillness of the hillside and climbing bush, when Brooke stood on the little jutting crag above the cañon. Two hundred feet above him rose a wall of fissured rock, but a gully, down which the white thread of a torrent frothed, split through that grim battlement, and already a winding strip of somewhat perilous pathway had been cut out of and pinned {{against the side of the}} chasm. Men with hammers and shovels were busy upon it, and the <b>ringing</b> of the <b>drills</b> broke sharply through the deep pulsations of the flood, while several more were clustered round the foot of an iron column, which rose from the verge of the crag, where the rock fell in one tremendous sweep to the dim green river.|$|R

50|$|The {{evacuator}} is {{a simple}} passive device. It consists of a <b>ring</b> of holes <b>drilled</b> into the barrel, surrounded by a cylindrical pressure reservoir. As the shell moves down the barrel during firing, it creates a high pressure {{in front of the}} projectile and the evacuator is filled with high pressure air, it reaches a point where the base of the shell passes the set of holes. The high-pressure is then released through these holes. As the shell continues down the barrel the pressure begins to drop, and then suddenly returns to near atmospheric pressure as the shell leaves the barrel. During this process the high-pressure air in the reservoir begins to blow back into the barrel towards the front of the gun tube. By aiming these holes forward, their exhaust causes the pressurized air to be blown forward and out of the barrel extracting fumes from the barrel.|$|R

30|$|Direct and {{indirect}} loadings were studied on a composite tibia bone model (3 rd generation sawbones®) with a mid-diaphyseal defect 3.5  mm in size. A universal test machine (UTS®, Germany) {{linked to a}} multichannel measuring system (MGC-Plus with ML 55, HBM®) {{was used for the}} study. In the set-up for the direct loading, both bone ends were attached to the test machine. For the indirect loading, the struts were distally extended, leaving the distal bone end levitating with no direct contact to the base plate of the test machine (Fig.  3). The attachment to the test machine allowed a solely axial loading parallel to the mechanical axis of the composite bone. The bone was stabilised in a standard Ilizarov frame consisting of 4  ×  160 -mm rings and four connecting struts (Smith&Nephew®, Memphis). Two 1.8 -mm wires on each <b>ring</b> were <b>drilled</b> through the tibia in an anatomical position (60 ° angulation, new wires for every test series), and the tibia was placed more anteriorly in relation to the inner diameter of the ring to more realistically mimic the clinical application. The mid-diaphyseal defect was created with an oscillating saw. At the site of the defect, the distance between the bone and the inner diameter in the anterior-posterior direction was 4.5  cm anterior and 8.0  cm posterior. The wires were tensioned to 1, 100  N using the tensioning device that comes with the Ilizarov set and were attached to the rings with slotted bolts.|$|R
60|$|For {{three days}} they toiled with pick and shovel and clinking drill, and {{the roar of}} the {{blasting}} charges shook the wet hillside, but while the trenches deepened slowly the water rose. By night the big fires snapped and sputtered, and the feeble lanterns blinked through the rain, while wild figures, stained with mire and dripping water, moved amidst the smoke, and those who dragged themselves out of the workings lay down on the wet ground for a brief hour's sleep. Brooke, however, so far as he could afterwards remember, did not close his eyes at all, and where his dripping figure appeared the shovels swung more rapidly, and the <b>ringing</b> of the <b>drills</b> grew a trifle louder. The pace was, however, too fierce to last, and, though even the men who work for another toil strenuously in that land, it was evident to him that while their task was less than half-done, they could not sustain it long.|$|R
5000|$|In {{absence of}} a major {{exhibition}} facility, the adjacent military drill hall had long been used as the major exhibition hall. The special relationship between the Defence Force and TPA & I Association was reinforced though Memorial Day sports and demobilisation events {{in support of the}} returned local men who had fought during World War I. To acknowledge their efforts the Association Committee resolved to admit free of charge any soldiers in uniform, with no charge for machinery exhibits for returned soldiers engaged in agricultural pursuits. In 1918, Alfred Barton Brady, Government Architect for Queensland, oversaw the design of the Defence force Drill Hall. The name of Andrew Irving - a successful architectural draftsman with the Queensland Public Works Department - appears on the drawings. The new Drill hall was constructed around 1919 within the former defence force reserve of four acres to be used [...] "... for horticulture, preserves, arts and crafts, children's section, caged birds and district exhibits". An open parade ground was located between the show <b>ring</b> and the <b>Drill</b> Hall.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{soldering}} of melt-textured YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -d -based (MT-YBCO) superconductive blocks using a TmBaCu 3 O 7 -d (Tm 123) powder has been suggested. The method excludes stages of slow cooling during soldering and preparation of auxiliary layers. To estimate the critical current density (jc) through the obtained junction, we have <b>drilled</b> <b>rings</b> from single-domained MT-YBCO blocks, cut into two pieces along the diameters and soldered using a Tm 123 powder. The critical current density, jc, (estimated using vibrating sample magnetometer) through the soldered ring was 34 kA/cm^ 2 in 0 T field at 77 K, {{which turned out}} to be even higher by a factor of approximately 1. 5 than that through the single-domained material. The increase in jc through the soldered ring has been observed up to the 2. 5 T field, while in the higher fields some decrease of jc took place. As a result of the field mapping of the trapped magnetic flux in soldered ring using a Hall probe, we obtained a regular truncated cone and the maximal level of trapped field for the ring 8 and 4 mm in outer and inner diameters was about 80 mT.

30|$|The air {{injection}} connector system {{is also known}} as parasitic pipe joints. In the past, underbalanced drilling was usually realized by the principle of the “U-tube”, which means another injection well must be made first to form a “U-tube” with the production well to inject high-pressure air when the production well is being drilled. In order to reduce the budget of drilling and to eliminate hazards with few engineering work, the injection well was replaced by the {{air injection}} connector system, which is connected on the production casing at a predetermined position down {{into the bottom of the}} well with the casing. It will then open a valve to inject air into the casing <b>ring</b> space during <b>drilling</b> to realize underbalanced drilling (Xian et al. 2009). In order to meet the technical requirements of the above process, the air injection connector system must consist of a non-return valve to eliminate backflow. It must be sent downhole together with the casing and be cemented disposable with the casing. After completion of the first phase of drilling process, the air injection connector could be used to inject high-pressure air in the next phase of drilling process. The pressurized air mixed with the drilling mud would help to increase the performance of underbalanced drilling (Fried et al. 1996; Bennion et al. 1998; Misselbrook et al. 1991; Oyatomari et al. 2002).|$|R
