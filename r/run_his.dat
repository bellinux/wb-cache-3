5|$|After this débâcle {{the rest}} of Richardson's stage career was at the National, with one late exception. He played Lord Touchwood in The Double Dealer (1978), the Master in The Fruits of Enlightenment (1979), Old Ekdal in The Wild Duck (1979) and Kitchen in Storey's Early Days, {{specially}} written for him. The last toured in North America after the London <b>run.</b> <b>His</b> final West End play was The Understanding (1982), a gentle comedy of late-flowering love. Celia Johnson was cast as his co-star, but died suddenly just before the first night. Joan Greenwood stepped into the breach, but {{the momentum of the}} production had gone, and it closed after eight weeks.|$|E

5|$|Chad was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2016 Games in athletics – Bachir Mahamat in the 400 metres. Mahamat competed on 12 August in the second heat. He placed seventh, {{with a time of}} 48.59 seconds, some 3.44 seconds behind the winner, Bralon Taplin of Grenada. The only runner he placed ahead of in his heat was Anas Beshr of Egypt, who had been disqualified for exiting his lane on the track. Only the first three athletes from each heat progressed to the next round, and so Mahamat's Olympics ended after that single <b>run.</b> <b>His</b> time placed him in 48th place out of 50 athletes overall, based on times in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Charles Alfred Cruft (28 June 1852 – 10 September 1938) was a British showman {{who founded}} the Crufts dog show. Charles first became {{involved}} with dogs {{when he began to}} work at Spratt's, a manufacturer of dog biscuits. He rose to the position of general manager, and whilst working for Spratt's in France he was invited to <b>run</b> <b>his</b> first dog show at the 1878 Exposition Universelle. After running dog shows in London for four years, he ran his first Cruft's dog show in 1891, and continued to run a further 45 shows until his death in 1938, as well as running two cat shows in 1894 and 1895. He was involved in a range of dog breed clubs, including that for Schipperkes, Pugs and Borzois. He and his wife upheld a story that they never owned a dog, and instead owned a cat, however Cruft admitted to owning at least one Saint Bernard in his memoirs, published posthumously.|$|E

5|$|During the U.S. Navy carrier {{air attack}} on Kure on 24 July 1945, Settsu was {{attacked}} by 30 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters near Etajima. She was struck by one bomb that killed two men and wounded another two; five near misses started a serious leak in the starboard engine room. Captain Masanano Ofuji decided to <b>run</b> <b>his</b> ship aground on Etajima to prevent her from sinking. All of Settsus 25mm guns were subsequently removed and the ship {{was used as a}} floating barracks. Four days later, the ship was again attacked by carrier aircraft that hit her twice more with bombs. She was abandoned the next day. Settsu was stricken from the navy list on 20 November and her hulk was raised in June 1946 and towed to Kure where scrapping was completed in August 1947.|$|E
5|$|Frank Fetter {{was born}} in Peru, Indiana to a Quaker family {{during the height of}} the American Civil War. Fetter proved an able student as a youth, as {{demonstrated}} by his acceptance to Indiana University in 1879 when he was only sixteen years old. At Indiana, he joined the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. Fetter was on track to graduate with the class of 1883, but left college to <b>run</b> <b>his</b> family's bookstore upon news of his father's declining health. Working in the bookstore offered an opportunity for the young man to acquaint himself with some of the economic ideas that would later prove formative. Chief among the intellectual influences Fetter encountered at this time was Henry George's Progress and Poverty (1879).|$|E
5|$|He {{opened his}} 2011 {{season with a}} run in the 150m {{straight}} race at Manchester's Great City Games and timed 14.51 seconds (the second fastest after Bolt's 2009 <b>run).</b> <b>His</b> season's best run of 9.79sec for the 100m came in June in Clermont, Florida and ranked it him as the third fastest {{in the event that}} year. Gay was defeated by Steve Mullings at the adidas Grand Prix in New York – Mullings failed a doping test later that month and was banned for life. A nagging hip injury led to Gay's withdrawal from the 2011 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships and in July he underwent acetabular labrum surgery; almost a year passed until the next time he competed.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{retained}} Chotiner as {{a consultant}} to his first congressional campaign in 1946. In an era when the perceived threat of communism was a major domestic issue, Chotiner advised the future president to link his liberal opponent, Representative Jerry Voorhis, to a political organization which was believed to be communist-dominated. Nixon was elected, and hired Chotiner to <b>run</b> <b>his</b> 1950 Senate campaign against Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas. Chotiner used a similar strategy in that campaign, stressing Douglas' liberal voting record and printing the accusations on pink paper to hint at communist sympathy. Congressman Nixon easily defeated Douglas, and Chotiner next managed Nixon's 1952 vice presidential campaign and counseled Nixon through allegations of antisemitism and revelations that there were privately run funds to pay Nixon's political expenses—revelations that the candidate decisively overcame with his televised Checkers speech.|$|E
5|$|O'Hara {{married her}} third husband, Charles F. Blair, Jr., 11 years her senior, on 12 March 1968. Blair, an immensely popular figure, {{was a pioneer}} of transatlantic aviation, a former brigadier general of the US Air Force, a former chief pilot at Pan Am, and founder {{and head of the}} U.S. Virgin Islands airline Antilles Air Boats. A few years after her {{marriage}} to Blair, O'Hara, for the most part, retired from acting. In the special features section to the DVD release of The Quiet Man, a story is recounted that O'Hara retired after longtime collaborators John Wayne and John Ford teased her about being married but not being a good, stay-at-home housewife, though Blair himself wanted her to retire from acting and help <b>run</b> <b>his</b> business. Blair died in 1978 while flying a Grumman Goose for his airline from St. Croix to St. Thomas, crashing after an engine failure. O'Hara was elected CEO and president of the airline, with the added distinction of becoming the first woman president of a scheduled airline in the U.S.|$|E
