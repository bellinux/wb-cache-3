40|$|Most of {{the things}} we use in our daily life is welded or made by {{equipment}} that is welded. Welders build products from coffeepots to automobiles, from bridges to skyscrapers and millions of other products which are produced for the use of people. Because of welding technology is widely used, especially in the manufacturing and services industries, therefore most of technical institutions and higher learning institutions that offer technical and engineering courses will include welding technology {{as a part of the}} curriculums. From the educational perspective, welding technology is one of the foremost skills that have to be mastered by students who are going to involve in the area of engineering as well as technical education. But yet, learning the welding skill is not easy for students. For teachers, teaching students to master the skills is even tougher. Therefore, the main purpose of this product-based research is to design and produce a multi-position welding table which is able to help students to weld in various positions such as flat, overhead, vertical and horizontal positions. Apart from that, this product also can be used as a work piece holder for welding circular work pieces such as cylinder, <b>rod,</b> <b>tube</b> and pipe. The Crawford’s six-stage product development model will be used as a guideline in this research. The final product will be assessed in terms of user friendliness as well as the effectiveness of the product in teaching and learning process. It is expected that the use of the multi-position table will be able to smoothen the teaching and learning process, where students can use it to master the gas and arc welding skills easily and teachers can use it to demonstrate the welding technique effectively...|$|E
