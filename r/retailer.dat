40|$|Available literatures have {{confirmed}} that there are unstable and complex relationship between manufacturers and large <b>retailers</b> especially in the growing strength of retail organizations in the global context. This study thus examines the impacts of <b>retailer’s</b> satisfaction dimensions on its commitment, and the moderating effect of the manufacturer brands’ strength on the relationships between <b>retailer’s</b> satisfaction dimensions, and its commitment. This quantitative study presents the empirical findings from a survey of 140 large <b>retailers</b> using partial least squares (PLS). The results indicate that <b>retailer’s</b> economic and social satisfaction have strong positive influence on <b>retailer’s</b> commitment, and surprisingly, the <b>retailer’s</b> social satisfaction is more influential on its commitment than <b>retailer’s</b> economic satisfaction. The {{study also found that}} the strength of manufacturer’s brands enhances the relationship between <b>retailer’s</b> economic satisfaction and its commitment, but not the relationship between <b>retailer’s</b> social satisfaction and its commitment. Theoretical and managerial implications are extracted from these findings...|$|R

40|$|Supply chain {{coordination}} as {{an effective}} tool {{plays an important role}} in improving supply chain performance. In this article, a two-level supply chain with one manufacturer and two <b>retailers</b> is considered. The order quantity that <b>retailers</b> are faced with depends on the amount of advertisements and both <b>retailers</b> compete with each other on advertising. The Stackelberg game is established between manufacturer and <b>retailers</b> such that the manufacturer and the <b>retailers</b> play the leader and the follower roles, respectively. First, the manufacturer determines the wholesale prices for <b>retailers</b> and instead, the <b>retailers</b> determine the order quantity and advertising level, simultaneously. The manufacturer produces one kind of product and delivers it to <b>retailers</b> before the beginning of selling season. <b>Retailers</b> can affect the order quantity regarding the demand dependency on advertising level through the incurred costs from the advertising. In this paper, we show that we can achieve the desirable supply chain coordination through using combined quantity discount and advertising cost sharing contracts. We also consider the win-win situation for all the members of the supply chain...|$|R

Neighbourhood <b>retailers</b> include stores such as; Food shops/marts, dairies, Pharmacies, Dry cleaners, Hairdressers/barbers, Bottle shops, Cafés and take-away shops [...] Destination <b>retailers</b> include stores such as; Gift shops, Antique shops, Pet groomers, Engravers, Tattoo parlour, Bicycle shops, Herbal dispensary clinics, Art galleries, Office Supplies and framers. The neighbourhood <b>retailers</b> sell essential goods and services to the residential area they are located in. There can be many groups of neighbourhood <b>retailers</b> in different areas of a region or city, but destination <b>retailers</b> are often part of shopping malls where the numbers of consumers is higher than that of a neighbourhood retail area. The destination <b>retailers</b> are becoming more prevalent as they can provide a community with more than the essentials, they offer an experience, and a wider scope of goods and services.|$|R

Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage.
