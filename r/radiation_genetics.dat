40|$|Male transgenerational {{epigenetic}} {{effects have}} been discovered in the discipline of mouse <b>radiation</b> <b>genetics,</b> using genetic and non-genetic readouts. The mechanism to explain {{the origin of the}} transmission of epigenetic and genetic instability is still unknown. In a search for a hypothesis that could satisfy the data, we propose that regulation of chromosome structure in the germline, by the occupancy of matrix/scaffold associated regions, contains molecular memory function. The male germline is strikingly dynamic as to chromatin organization. This could explain why experience of irradiation stress leaves a persistent mark in the male germline only. To be installed, such memory requires both S-phase and chromatin reorganization during spermatogenesis and in the zygote, that likely also involves reorganization of loop domains. By this reorganization, another layer of information is added, needed to accommodate early embryonic development. Observations point at the involvement of DNA repair as inducer of transgenerational epigenetic modulation. Nuclear structure, chromatin composition and loop domain organization are aspects of human sperm variability that in many cases of assisted reproduction is increased due to inclusion of more incompletely differentiated/maturated sperm nuclei. Adjustment of loop domains in early embryo development can be anticipated and zygotic and cleavage stage S-phase repair activity {{will have to deal with}} potential paternal DNA lesions. Therefore, by changing male nucleus structure due to reproduction from impaired spermatogenesis, the transgenerational information content could be changed as well. We discuss aspects of male reproductive performance in the context of this hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|The {{relatively}} {{high incidence of}} Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in Queensland provides a valuable opportunity to examine links with other cancers. A retrospective cohort study was performed {{using data from the}} Queensland Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to approximate the relative risk of being diagnosed with another primary cancer either following or prior to MCC. Patients with an eligible first primary MCC (n= 787) had more than double the expected number of subsequent primary cancers (SIR= 2. 19, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 84 - 2. 60; P< 0. 001). Conversely, people who were initially diagnosed with cancers other than MCC were {{about two and a half}} times more likely to have a subsequent primary MCC (n= 244) compared with the general population (SIR= 2. 69, 95 % CI= 2. 36 - 3. 05; P< 0. 001). Significantly increased bi-directional relative risks were found for melanoma, lip cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, myelodysplastic diseases, and cancer with unknown primary site. In addition, risks were elevated for female breast cancer and kidney cancer following a first primary MCC, and for subsequent MCCs following first primary colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or lymphoid leukemia.

Unfortunately, these are only considered as the discrete analogs of differential equations. It is a well-known fact that difference equations appeared much earlier than differential equations and were instrumental in {{paving the way for}} the development of the latter. It is only recently that difference equations have started receiving the attention they deserve. Perhaps this is largely due to the advent of computers where differential equations are solved by using their approximate difference equation formulations. The theory of discrete dynamical systems and difference equations developed greatly during the last twenty-five years of the twentieth century. The theory of difference equations occupies a central position in applicable analysis. There is no doubt that the theory of difference equations will continue to play an important role in mathematics as a whole. Nonlinear difference equations of order greater than one are of paramount importance in applications. It is very interesting to investigate the behavior of solutions of a system of higher-order rational difference equations and to discuss the local asymptotic stability of their equilibrium points. Systems of rational difference equations have been studied by several authors. Especially there has been a great interest in the study of the attractivity of the solutions of such systems.

A thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Science at Virginia Commonwealth University. Virginia Commonwealth University, 2017 Major Director: Dr. Xiang-Yang (Shawn) Wang, Ph. D., Professor, Department of Human and Molecular <b>Genetics</b> <b>Radiation</b> therapy (RT) is restricted by toxic effects on adjacent normal tissue, which limits RT efficacy in cancer treatment. Damage to normal tissue, such as radiosensitive intestine and bone marrow compartments, results in acute radiation damage. To reduce normal tissue injury {{in the setting of}} RT, we examine the potential radioprotectant, Flagrp 170, a chimeric protein. Flagrp 170 is comprised of glucose-regulated protein- 170 (Grp 170) and a NF-κB activating sequence derived from flagellin. We show that Flagrp 170 can protect normal tissues post irradiation, indicated by TUNEL and clonogenic assays. However, treatment with Flagrp 170 does not influence tumor response to RT. Studies indicate that Flagrp 170 activates the transcription factor NF-κB, a strong pro-survival signal. In addition, Flagrp 170 can induce production of radioprotective cytokines as well. Data suggests that Flagrp 170 has potential as a novel radioprotectant in the setting of RT. The combination of Flagrp 170 therapy and RT may lead to improved treatment outcomes...|$|R

Tobacco use and alcohol consumption are regarded as the primary risk factors for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and betel use, other chemicals, <b>radiation,</b> environmental, and <b>genetics</b> are reported as relevant risk factors for oral carcinogenesis. The human papillomavirus infection is an independent risk factor. Traditional epidemiology studies have revealed that environmental carcinogens are risk factors for OSCC. Molecular epidemiology studies have revealed that the susceptibility to OSCC is influenced by both environmental and genetic risk factors. However, the details and mechanisms of risk factors involved in OSCC are unclear. Advanced methods and techniques used in human genome studies provide great opportunities for researchers to explore and identify (a) the details of such risk factors and (b) genetic susceptibility involved in OSCC. Human genome epidemiology is a new branch of epidemiology, which leads the epidemiology study from the molecular epidemiology era into the era of genome-wide association study.

In the current study, we analyzed the incidence of thyroid cancer and breast cancer in 50 US states and in the District of Columbia to ascertain how often these two diseases are associated. Methods: Data on the incidence of thyroid cancer were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute and data on the incidence of breast cancer were from the American Cancer Society. Data on the average number of children per family with children and mean household income were sourced from the US Bureau of the Census and prevalence of obesity by state is determined from a paper published in 2010 on state-specific obesity prevalence among US adults by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: There was a significant association between breast and thyroid cancer (P= 0. 002). Since the incidence of breast cancer increases with increasing income and obesity, while decreasing with parity, multiple linear regression was performed. Breast cancer incidence was significantly related to thyroid cancer incidence (β= 0. 271, P= 0. 039), inversely related to average number of children per family with children (β=- 0. 271, P= 0. 039), unrelated to adult obesity (β= 0. 134, P= 0. 369), and significantly related to family income (β= 0. 642, P< 0. 001).

40|$|Ozone {{decrease}} implies more ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation {{reaching the}} surface of the Earth. Increased UV-B radiation triggers responses by living organisms. Despite the large potential impacts on vegetation, little is known about UV-B effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Long-term ecological studies are needed to quantify the effects of increased UV radiation on terrestrial ecosystems, asses the risks, and produce reliable data for prediction. Screening pigments are part of one of the protective mechanism in plants. Higher concentrations of screening pigments in leaves may be interpreted as a response to increased UV radiation. If the screening effect is not sufficient, important molecules will be disturbed by incoming <b>radiation.</b> Thus, <b>genetics,</b> photosynthesis, growth, plant and leaf shape and size, and pollen grains may be affected. This {{will have an impact on}} ecosystem dynamics, structure and productivity. It is necessary to monitor selected terrestrial ecosystems to permit detection and interpretation of changes attributable to global climate change and depleted ozone shield. The objectives of this project are: (1) To identify and measure indicators of the effects of increased solar UV-B radiation on terrestrial plants; (2) to select indicators with the greatest responses to UV-B exposure; (3) to test, adapt or create ecosystem models that use the information gathered by this project for prediction and to enhance our understanding of the effects of increased UV-B radiation on terrestrial ecosystems. As a first step to achieve these objectives we propose a three-year study of forest and steppe vegetation on the North slope of the Brooks Range (within the Arctic circle, in Alaska), in the Saguaro National Monument (near Tucson, Arizona) and in the forests and steppes of Patagonia (Argentina). We selected (1) vegetation north of the Polar Circle because at 70 N there is 8 % risk of plant damage due to increased UV-B radiation; (2) the foothills of Catalina Mountains because there is anecdotal evidence of plant damage on the saguaros that has been linked to increased UV radiation, and (3) the forests of Nothofagus spp. and the steppe of Patagonia where the risk of plant damage at 35 S is 5 % and increases to as much as 15 % at 55 S due to increased UV-B radiation. Measurements of UV-B radiation impinging on the surface at 55 S largely exceed the predicted UV-B radiation values at 50 latitude and 0 % ozone depletion. Preliminary HPLC analyses of UV-B absorbing compounds in Nothofagus antartica, N. pumilio, N. betuloides and Rumex sp. in natural conditions show species-specific patterns. The spectrum of N. antartica grown at 38 S differs significantly from that of N. antartica in natural conditions in Ushuaia (55 S). These results suggest that the selected main area (Patagonia) is appropriate for assessing the problem and its magnitude and that Nothofagus is appropriate for our study...|$|R
40|$|Health {{physicists}} {{and knowledgeable}} clinicians {{have the responsibility}} to counsel women of reproductive age about the reproductive risks of ionizing radiation exposure before conception or during pregnancy. It is important to realize that lay individuals have many misconceptions about the reproductive risks of ionizing radiation. Many patients who have already had or will undergo some type of radiological test are apprehensive about the reproductive and developmental risks of diagnostic radiological procedures. Epidemiological studies and animal studies indicate that high exposures of ionizing radiation can cause miscarriage, congenital malformations, growth retardation, stillbirth, and cancer. With the exception of cancer, there are threshold exposures for those outcomes, with exposures below certain radiation doses not increasing the reproductive or developmental risks. The threshold exposure for birth defects at the most sensitive stage of development is 0. 2 Gy, and the threshold for growth retardation and miscarriage is even higher. However, embryonic loss can occur from low exposures during the preimplantation and presomite stages of development (“the all or none period”). This is a stage when the embryo is more likely to die than survive malformed. The most sensitive period for the induction of mental retardation is from the 8 th week to the 15 th week of gestation. The threshold for deterministic effects increases after early organogenesis and also as the exposure is protracted, e. g., with radionuclides or multiple radiological procedures. Awareness that the threshold dose for developmental effects increases as the fetus develops complicates counseling because we do not have definitive data on threshold exposures at all stages of gestation. Ionizing radiation exposures prior to pregnancy represent a very low risk for the increased incidence of genetic disease in the offspring of the parents who have had radiation exposures to the ovary or testes. Counseling patients requires knowledge of embryology, <b>genetics,</b> <b>radiation</b> teratology, and the principles of teratology in order for the counselor to provide sympathetic, accurate, scholarly advice...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} the phylogeography of Sandelia capensis and S. bainsii (family Anabantidae), two freshwater fish species endemic to Cape coastal rivers of South Africa. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b gene (S. capensis) and control region (S. capensis and S. bainsii) {{were used as}} genetic markers. Sandelia capensis has a wide distribution, and occurs in most river systems of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR). Therefore, by studying the genetic variation within the species we could investigate the drainage history of this region. Two major historically isolated lineages were identified within this species, one comprising west coast populations and the other south coast populations. Genetically unique lineages were also identified within each of these two major clades. The split between the two major clades dated back to the Pliocene, while divergence times for lineages within them dated back to the Pleistocene. River capture events and sea level changes in the CFR {{played a major role}} in shaping the genetic variation that we observe within S. capensis today. Sandelia bainsii is restricted to a few Eastern Cape coastal rivers, and is classified as endangered. Within this species two divergent clades were identified, a Great Fish/Kowie lineage and a Buffalo/Gulu lineage. Sandelia capensis is also of conservation importance since certain populations are declining as a result of many different threats. In identifying these genetically unique lineages, certain areas (rivers/populations) could be prioritized for conservation management. The two major lineages identified within each of the two species should be conserved as separate units and not be intermixed. Two genetically very unique populations identified within S. capensis, the Heuningnes and Diep, are under severe pressure and should also be prioritized for management. In addition, a preliminary phylogenetic study was performed on the Anabantidae using mtDNA 16 S rRNA sequences. This was done to investigate the phylogenetic relationships between the two Sandelia species (classified as sister taxa) and also their relationships with the other anabantids. The phylogenetic relationships between the anabantids were largely unresolved, probably due to an ancient <b>radiation.</b> Dissertation (MSc (<b>Genetics))</b> [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|The human tRNA methyltransferase 9 -like (TRM 9 L) gene is a homolog of yeast Trm 9 {{and human}} ALKBH 8 {{and it has}} an {{important}} function in suppressing tumor growth in colorectal cancer. Loss of heterozygosity events on the Chromosome 8 p 22 loci, where TRM 9 L is located, are overrepresented {{in a wide variety}} of cancers, including prostate cancer, breast carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma; downregulation of TRM 9 L expression is also observed in many different types of cancer. These findings implicate a general role potentially played by TRM 9 L in tumor suppression. A mechanistic understanding of TRM 9 L would have a broad impact in oncology. The broad objective of my thesis research is to connect mechanistically the biochemical function of TRM 9 L to its tumor suppressing activity. Of my special interest is TRM 9 L is regulated at the protein level. In this thesis, I demonstrated that TRM 9 L is a phosphoprotein, with phosphorylation dynamics at serines S 214, S 255, S 279, S 291, S 306, and S 380 correlated with protein-protein interactions and tumorigenicity. Phosphorylation levels were found to be modulated by stressors to which cells become resistant when TRM 9 L is silenced. For example, oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide (H 202) exposure increased phosphorylation on S 255, S 291, and S 380, but phosphorylation was unchanged in response to ionizing <b>radiation.</b> Using chemical <b>genetics</b> approaches, I showed that phosphorylation of S 380 is downstream of ribosomal protein S 6 kinase (RSK), which is downstream of H 202 -activated extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK). TRM 9 L mutations S 214 A, S 255 A and S 380 A significantly enhanced tumor growth, while S 214 A and S 255 A mutations also abolished a direct interaction between TRM 9 L and certain 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms. The results revealed a novel oxidative stress phosphosignaling regulatory mechanism underlying TRM 9 L's tumor suppressor behavior. I also demonstrated that TRM 9 L altered the ability of colorectal cancer cells to respond to stresses caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Results supported the idea that TRM 9 L reduces the cell's capacity to detoxify harmful reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and effectively makes them more toxic. Finally, my finding supported the notion that TRM 9 L expression downregulates the hypoxia-induced cell migration, presumably by controlling an aspect of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT). by Chen Gu.
