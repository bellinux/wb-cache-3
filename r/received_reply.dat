30|$|We {{define the}} cost of a routing path as the sum of loads on each {{component}} of the routing path. In order to generate the less congested path between a service provider and a service requester, we implement the following technique: after a service request is propagated to the desired RI and handled by the elected leader. A service provider is chosen and a unique reply is generated. In the LocVSDP, the unique reply is unicast to the service requester through the first path returned. In our QoS-based LocVSDP, the unique reply is geocast to the service requester from the elected RR leader. An intermediate RR forwards the <b>received</b> <b>reply</b> message if and only if, (i) the RR is closer to the service requester than the RR from which it has received the reply message and; (ii) the cumulated cost of the routing path of a request ReqID until the current RR is less than a previously cumulated cost of a routing path for the same request ReqID.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients are {{traditionally}} advised {{to refrain from}} exposing their ears to water after most otological procedures. However, recent evidence suggests that water does not adversely affect the outcome for children with tympanostomy tubes. The evidence behind the potential harmful effects {{of water on the}} outcome of other otological procedures is scarce. OBJECTIVE: The study was done to determine the current practice of otolaryngology consultants in the UK on the advice given to patients regarding swimming, diving and bathing in soapy water after myringotomy and tympanostomy tube insertion, mastoidectomy and myringoplasty. METHOD: Questionnaire based survey mailed to 382 members (consultants only) of the British Association of Otolaryngologists [...] Head & Neck Surgeons in the UK. RESULTS: A total of 195 responses were <b>received</b> (<b>reply</b> rate 51 per cent). In all, 95. 6 per cent of the respondents allowed their patients to swim after insertion of tympanostomy tubes, with 32. 9 per cent insisting on the use of earplugs until extrusion of the tympanostomy tubes. However, 61. 6 per cent of the respondents restricted diving in these patients. In comparison, the respondents were more conservative with water precautions following myringoplasty and mastoidectomy. More than half the respondents recommended earplugs for bathing after all three operations. CONCLUSION: This study reveals current national practice among UK otolaryngologists. There is no general consensus in post-operative advice following otolaryngological procedures, indicating a need for national guideline...|$|E

Adopting {{a social}} network {{analysis}} approach, the present study examined social capital and network dynamics of online support seeking and support provision in a depression forum.

The findings showed a consistently reciprocal pattern between users’ replies sent to others and <b>replies</b> <b>received</b> from others. Forum users’ bridging social capital was positively associated with the source diversity of their <b>received</b> <b>replies</b> and negatively associated with the average length of their <b>received</b> <b>replies.</b> Furthermore, forum users’ bonding social capital was positively associated with the average length of their <b>received</b> <b>replies</b> and negatively associated with the source diversity of their <b>received</b> <b>replies...</b>|$|R

30|$|In Algorithm 1, start_time and arrival_time are {{the local}} clock {{times at which}} a test is started and the {{corresponding}} reply arrives at the tester, respectively. Variable test_time corresponds to the time a tester takes to <b>receive</b> a <b>reply.</b> Variable mean maintains the weighted mean of the time to <b>receive</b> <b>replies.</b> The dispersion of the time to <b>receive</b> a <b>reply</b> is kept in variance and is also computed as a weighted mean. The higher the variance, the larger the timeout. Constants α and β were assigned 0.9 and 4, respectively, which are frequently used as approximations of the original values proposed by Jacobson [52]. Variable threshold is computed by adding the timeout to a factor defined by the user. This factor is frequently added to avoid false positives, i.e., incorrect suspicions.|$|R

50|$|First called ShareNet or S-Net, {{this network}} {{operating}} system (NOS) was later called Novell NetWare. NetWare {{was based on the}} NetWare Core Protocol (NCP), which is a packet-based protocol that enables a client to send requests to and <b>receive</b> <b>replies</b> from a NetWare server. Initially NCP was directly tied to the IPX/SPX protocol, and NetWare communicated natively using only IPX/SPX.|$|R
50|$|The client uses a {{database}} connection to send commands to and <b>receive</b> <b>replies</b> from the server. A database is stored as a file or {{a set of}} files on magnetic disk or tape, optical disk, or some other secondary storage device.

30|$|Secondly, {{and more}} critical, during the State Machine Replication (SMR) {{protocols}} execution at the client [16, 34], the <b>replies</b> <b>received</b> from the servers {{may be different}} since the OP fields use a non-deterministic algorithm. In fact, the cryptograms resulting from some computation at the servers may differ among them, although they refer to the same decrypted value. These aspects impact the SMR protocols, which require f+ 1 identical replies to terminate by returning some of these replies. In order to circumvent this problem, {{it is necessary to}} decrypt the OP fields prior to count the number of <b>received</b> <b>replies.</b>|$|R
