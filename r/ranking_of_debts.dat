40|$|Simulation-based cost-risk {{analysis}} of the interest expenditure is increasingly used for policy evaluation <b>of</b> public <b>debt</b> strategies by governments around the world. This paper is a first attempt to empirically evaluate this approach by comparing its implications for the maturity structure <b>of</b> public <b>debt</b> with those derived from the optimal taxation theory <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> management. To this end, we simulate the time path {{of the distribution of}} the interest expenditure for stylized portfolios of different maturities using simple stochastic models of the evolution of the term structure of interest rates, and examine the performance of such portfolios with standard cost-risk indicators. We find that: i) the <b>ranking</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> portfolios by expenditure risk may depend on the length of the simulation period; to obtain the same policy conclusions as the optimal taxation theory, the time horizon must extend up to the redemption date of the longest maturity bond issued over the simulation period; ii) in sharp contrast with optimal taxation theory, a cost-risk trade off naturally emerges when a risk premium on long term bonds is considered, but this may not be sufficient to identify the optimal maturity structure. Our analysis points to the danger of assuming the cost-risk minimization of the interest expenditure as the main objective <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> management. A policy that either aims to minimize the interest expenditure over a too short horizon or does not consider that risk premiums may reflect a fair price for insurance may lead to sub-optimal debt strategies. debt management, maturity structure, interest costs, interest rate risk, optimal taxation, simulation models, term structure,...|$|R

40|$|Recent survey {{evidence}} suggests that managers try to time financial markets in making their financing decisions. We examine a sample of more than 14, 000 new issues <b>of</b> corporate <b>debt</b> to test for evidence of timing <b>of</b> new <b>debt</b> issues. We focus our attention on interest rates {{in terms of their}} decile rankings relative to historical rates, and we identify differences in the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> issued in light of the decile levels. We find evidence of interest rate timing in that the number <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> issues and the amounts <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> issued are higher when interest rates are in low deciles. Debt maturity choices, call features, and put features are affected by the decile <b>ranking</b> <b>of</b> interest rates. Bond ratings tend to be lower when interest rates are in higher deciles, and the fraction of speculative grade issues also increases. Cross-sectional evidence shows that firms with greater financial flexibility have a greater tendency to time. We also examine the effects of refinancing transactions, and we find that timing is present whether debt is issued for the purpose <b>of</b> refinancing existing <b>debt</b> or as an increment to outstanding debt. Finally, we test for whether the average debt issue would have been more costly had the decision to issue been postponed...|$|R
