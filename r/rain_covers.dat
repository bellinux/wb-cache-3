TheronAutor no autoriza el acceso a texto completo de su documentoA {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of rain protective covers on the vegetative and reproductive development and fruit quality of sweet cherry trees. The trial was conducted in the 2010 - 2011 season in a commercial orchard in Collipulli, Chile, with gabled (Vöen®) crop covers on 10 rows. In half of each row, trees were protected with <b>rain</b> <b>covers</b> from bud-burst, {{and the other half}} was protected from first red colour development of the fruit onwards; a treatment without protective rain cover served as control. The following variables were assessed: temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, phenology, intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR), fruit development, foliar area, flower bud differentiation, fruit set, vegetative growth and fruit quality at harvest and after conventional cold storage were measured. The protective covering filtered approximately 40 % of incident PAR. Crop cover at budburst advanced tree phenology and increased shoot length. Fruits of cherry trees protected during the colour development phase showed less colour. Protective covering installed at bud-burst increased fruit size, weight and soluble solids concentration, but with more cracking at the style-end scar of the fruit and with reduced fruit firmness. Flower bud differentiation was advanced by both treatments...|$|E
40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Ergonomics in 2004, available online: [URL] accumulation in sleeping bags during extended periods of use is detrimental to thermal comfort of the sleeper, and in extreme cases may lead to sleep loss and hypothermia. As sub-zero temperatures were expected to affect vapour resistance of microporous membranes, the effect of using semipermeable and impermeable <b>rain</b> <b>covers</b> for sleeping bags on the accumulation of moisture in the bags during 6 days of use at − 7 °C and 5 days at − 20 °C were investigated. In addition, the routine of shaking off hoarfrost {{from the inside of}} the cover after the sleep period as a preventive measure for moisture accumulation was studied. Moisture accumulation (ranging from 92 to 800 grams) was found {{to be related to the}} vapour resistance of the materials used. The best semipermeable material gave the same moisture build-up as no cover at − 7 °C, though build-up increased substantially at − 20 °C. Shaking off the hoarfrost from the inside of the cover after each use was beneficial in preventing a high moisture build-up. It was concluded that semi-permeable cover materials reduce moisture accumulation in sleeping bags at moderate sub-zero temperatures, but in more extreme cold (− 20 °C) the benefits are reduced in comparison to routinely shaking frost from impermeable covers. Compared to fixed impermeable covers, the benefits of all semi-permeable covers are large. For long-term use without drying facilities, the differences observed do favour the semi-permeable covers above impermeable ones, even when regularly removing the hoar frost from the inside in the latter...|$|E
