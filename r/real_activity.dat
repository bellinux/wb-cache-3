40|$|In {{the first}} essay, I examine the {{association}} between auditor industry specialization and earnings management choices. Prior research suggests that industry specialist auditors constrain accounting-based earnings management. But such actions may cause client companies to seek alternative means to manage earnings. Specifically, companies that hire industry specialist auditors may alter operating decisions to meet earnings targets, referred to as <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> manipulation. This essay investigates whether clients of industry specialist auditors that {{have an incentive to}} manage earnings are constrained from managing earnings through accruals manipulation and, therefore, are {{more likely to engage in}} <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> manipulation. Further, I examine whether operating performance declines for firms suspected of <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> manipulation. My findings indicate that clients of industry specialist auditors with incentives to manage earnings have lower absolute value of accruals relative to firms with incentives to manage earnings that do not hire industry specialist auditors. These clients of industry specialist auditors are also more likely to engage in <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> manipulation, suggesting this is a possible unintended consequence of hiring an industry specialist auditor. I also document evidence that firms suspected of <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> manipulation have lower future operating performance relative to firms not suspected of <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> manipulation. In the second essay, I examine {{the association between}} the tightness of accounting standards and earnings management choices. Prior studies suggest that managers switch from accounting-based earnings management to <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> manipulation in response to tightening accounting standards. My study investigates this line of reasoning. I develop an analytical model and conduct an experimental examination of the effect of flexibility of accounting standards under different institutional environments. I find that managers switch from accounting-based earnings management to <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> manipulation with tightening accounting standards only when the institutional investors have a short-term investment horizon. In contrast, when managers are monitored by institutional investors with a long-term investment horizon, they do not engage in such behavior. Ph. D.

First, the thesis investigates the effect of corporate reputation as an external governance mechanism on <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> manipulation as managerial myopia, finding that there is a significantly negative relationship between corporate reputation ranking as disclosure and both <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> manipulation through sales, overproduction and discretionary expenditures and the two aggregate measures of real actions, and that corporate reputation really matters for the market response to <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> management as myopic behaviour. Second, the thesis examines the impact of media coverage on <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> management, finding that there is significantly negative association between the level of media coverage and both real earnings management through sales, overproduction and discretionary expenditures and the one aggregate measures of real actions; that positive news reduces <b>real</b> <b>activities</b> management through the three ways; and that the greater positive of news tone, the greater degree of reducing real earnings management. Third, the thesis explores how media coverage affects investment efficiency. It finds comprehensive and robust evidence that media coverage improves investment efficiency. Specifically, media coverage reduces information asymmetries, alleviates financial constraints, improves external monitoring, and, by doing so, facilitates project acceptance and abandonment. The effect of media coverage on investment efficiency is more pronounced for firms characterised by more severe information and agency problems, when firms depend on external financing, and when media reports contain original news about corporate fundamentals. These findings suggest that media coverage improves investment efficiency by mitigating information asymmetries and agency problems. <br/...|$|R
