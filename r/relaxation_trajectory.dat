40|$|We address {{optimization}} of {{the spin}} current intensity profile {{needed to achieve}} spin torque switching of a nanomagnet. For systems with Ohmic dissipation we prove that the optimal current drives the magnetization along the trajectory, which is exact time-reversed replica of the <b>relaxation</b> <b>trajectory</b> towards the equilibrium. In practice {{it means that the}} optimal current is very nearly twice the minimal critical current needed to switch the magnet. Pulse duration of such an optimal current is a slow logarithmic function of temperature and the required probability of switching. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{wide range}} of cost functionals that {{describe}} the criteria for designing optimal pulses {{can be reduced to}} two basic functionals by the introduction of product spaces. We extend previous monotonically convergent algorithms to solve the generalized pulse design equations derived from those basic functionals. The new algorithms are proved to exhibit monotonic convergence. Numerical tests are implemented in four-level model systems employing stationary and/or nonstationary targets in the absence and/or presence of <b>relaxation.</b> <b>Trajectory</b> plots that conveniently present the global nature of the convergence behavior show that slow convergence may often be attributed to "trapping" and that relaxation processes may remove such unfavorable behavior...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Two {{generalized}} trajectory {{methods are}} combined {{to provide a}} novel and powerful numerical procedure for systematically finding multiple local extrema of a multivariable objective function. This procedure can form part of a strategy for global optimization in which the greatest local maximum and least local minimum {{in the interior of}} a specified region are compared to the largest and smallest values of the objective function on the boundary of the region. The first trajectory method, a homotopy scheme, provides a globally convergent algorithm to find a stationary point of the objective function. The second trajectory method, a relaxation scheme, starts at one stationary point and systematically connects other stationary points in the specified region by a network of trjectories. It is noted that both generalized trajectory methods actually solve the stationarity conditions, and so they {{can also be used to}} find multiple roots of a set of nonlinear equations. Key Words. Homotopy, <b>relaxation,</b> <b>trajectory</b> tracking, global optimization, roots, nonlinear equations. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{have studied}} the {{dynamics}} of defects (disclinations and walls) which appear in a thin nematic cell with planar anchoring, after a quench from the isotropic phase. The transient texture can be analyzed in terms of ± 1 / 2 disclinations and surface π-walls (corresponding to a π-rotation of the director in {{the plane of the}} cell). We determine the structure of the walls and explain the main features of the dynamics. The relaxation of the texture is largely dominated by surface effects, which control the <b>relaxation</b> <b>trajectories</b> and velocities of the disclinations, as well as the dynamics of π-walls...|$|R
40|$|A Langevin {{equation}} whose deterministic part {{undergoes a}} saddle-node bifurcation is investigated theoretically. It is found that statistical properties of <b>relaxation</b> <b>trajectories</b> {{in this system}} exhibit divergent behaviors near a saddle-node bifurcation point in the weak-noise limit, while the final value of the deterministic solution changes discontinuously at the point. A systematic formulation for analyzing a path probability measure is constructed {{on the basis of}} a singular perturbation method. In this formulation, the critical nature turns out to originate from the neutrality of exiting time from a saddle-point. The theoretical calculation explains results of numerical simulations. Comment: 18 pages, 17 figures. The version 2, in which minor errors have been fixed, will be published in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|In mean-field theory, i. e. infinite-range interactions, the {{transition}} between metastable and unstable states of a thermodynamic system is sharp. The metastable and the unstable states {{are separated by}} a spinodal curve. For systems with short-range interaction {{the transition}} between metastable and unstable states has been thought of as gradual. We show evidence, that one can define a sharp border between the two regions. We have analysed the lifetimes of states by considering the <b>relaxation</b> <b>trajectories</b> following a quench. The average lifetimes, {{as a function of}} the quench depth into the two-phase region, shows a very sharp drop defining a limit of stability for metastable states. Using the limit of stability we define a line similar to a spinodal in the two-phase region...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{calculation of}} rare-event kinetics in complex dynamical systems, {{such as the}} rate and pathways of ligand dissociation from a protein, is a generally unsolved problem. Markov state models can systematically integrate ensembles of short simulations and thus effectively parallelize the computational effort, but the rare events of interest {{still need to be}} spontaneously sampled in the data. Enhanced sampling approaches, such as parallel tempering or umbrella sampling, can accelerate the computation of equilibrium expectations massively - but sacrifice the ability to compute dynamical expectations. In this work we establish a principle to combine knowledge of the equilibrium distribution with kinetics from fast "downhill" <b>relaxation</b> <b>trajectories</b> using reversible Markov models. This approach is general as it does not invoke any specific dynamical model, and can provide accurate estimates of the rare event kinetics. Large gains in sampling efficiency can be achieved whenever one direction of the process occurs more rapid than its reverse, making the approach especially attractive for downhill processes such as folding and binding in biomolecules.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} {{simulations of}} myoglobin after ligand photodissociation {{show that the}} out-of-plane motion of the heme iron has a rapid subpicosecond phase followed by a slower nonexponential process involving more global protein <b>relaxation.</b> Individual <b>trajectories</b> show rather different behavior, suggesting there is an inhomogeneous component to the relaxation. The calculated time dependence of the iron motion over 100 ps is in excellent agreement with the frequency shift of band III of the heme group [see Lim, M., Jackson, T. A. & Anfinrud, P. A. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 5801 - 5804]. If that the barrier to rebinding depends on the out-of-plane iron position, the time dependence obtained from the simulation can explain the nonexponential room-temperature geminate recombination of NO...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} maximize the ma-nipulability index of a redundant industrial manipulator while solving the Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem as an optimization problem. Even though the IK problem is a widely studied topic, {{the integration of the}} manipulability index into IK has rarely been taken into account. As the relation between this index and the joint variables of the robot is not straightforward, we have tested different formulations using approximated derivatives. Obstacle avoidance has also been considered and the effect of modifying the Cartesian trajectory during the execution of a task has been thoroughly analyzed. Different scenarios have been conducted in simulation and have proven that our modified inverse kinematics solver is efficient to maximize the manipulability index, even with the additional constraint of obstacle avoidance. Moreover, the <b>relaxation</b> of the <b>trajectory</b> constraints leads to a greater manip-ulability while ensuring the motion smoothness and satisfying the robot physical limitations...|$|R
40|$|Recently we have {{presented}} a hidden variable model of measurements for a qubit where the hidden variable state space dimension is one-half the quantum state manifold dimension. The {{absence of a}} short memory (Markov) dynamics is the price paid for this dimensional reduction. The conflict between having the Markov property and achieving the dimensional reduction was proved in [A. Montina, Phys. Rev. A, 77, 022104 (2008) ] using an additional hypothesis of <b>trajectory</b> <b>relaxation.</b> Here we analyze in more detail this hypothesis introducing the concept of invertible process and report a proof that makes clearer {{the role played by}} the topology of the hidden variable space. This is accomplished by requiring suitable properties of regularity of the conditional probability governing the dynamics. In the case of minimal dimension the set of continuous hidden variables is identified with an object living an N-dimensional Hilbert space, whose dynamics is described by the Schrödinger equation. A method for generating the economical non-Markovian model for the qubit is also presented. Comment: Added a lemma on the dynamical properties of the set S that solves some bugs in the proof of the theorem in section I...|$|R
40|$|We report single-molecule {{measurements}} on the folding and unfolding conformational equilibrium distributions and dynamics of a disulfide crosslinked {{version of the}} two-stranded coiled coil from GCN 4. The peptide has a fluorescent donor and acceptor at the N termini of its two chains and a Cys disulfide near its C terminus. Thus, folding brings the two N termini of the two chains close together, resulting in an enhancement of fluorescent resonant energy transfer. End-to-end distance distributions have thus been characterized under conditions where the peptide is nearly fully folded (0 M urea), unfolded (7. 4 M urea), and in dynamic exchange between folded and unfolded states (3. 0 M urea). The distributions have been compared for the peptide freely diffusing in solution and deposited onto aminopropyl silanized glass. As the urea concentration is increased, the mean end-to-end distance shifts to longer distances both in free solution and on the modified surface. The widths of these distributions indicate that the molecules are undergoing millisecond conformational fluctuations. Under all three conditions, these fluctuations gave nonexponential correlations on 1 - to 100 -ms time scale. A component of the correlation decay that was sensitive to the concentration of urea corresponded to that measured by bulk <b>relaxation</b> kinetics. The <b>trajectories</b> provided effective intramolecular diffusion coefficients {{as a function of}} the end-to-end distances for the folded and unfolded states. Single-molecule folding studies provide information concerning the distributions of conformational states in the folded, unfolded, and dynamically interconverting states...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{simulated}} locomotion allows {{rich and}} varied interactions with environments and other characters. However, control is di cult due to {{factors such as}} a typical character's numerous degrees of freedom and small stability region, discontinuous ground contacts, and indirect control over the centre of mass. Previous academic work has made signi cant progress in addressing these problems, but typically uses simulation time steps much smaller than those suitable for games. This project deals with developing control strategies using larger time steps. After describing some introductory work showing the di culties of implementing a handcrafted controller with large physics time steps, three major areas of work are discussed. The rst area uses trajectory optimization to minimally alter reference motions to ensure physical validity, {{in order to improve}} simulated tracking. The approach builds on previous work which allows ground contacts to be modi ed as part of the optimization process, extending it to 3 D problems. Incorporating contacts introduces di cult complementarity constraints, and an exact penalty method is shown here to improve solver robustness and performance compared to previous <b>relaxation</b> methods. <b>Trajectory</b> optimization is also used to modify reference motions to alter characteristics such as timing, stride length and heading direction, whilst maintaining physical validity, and to generate short transitions between existing motions. The second area uses a sampling-based approach, previously demonstrated with small time steps, to formulate open loop control policies which reproduce reference motions. As a prerequisite, the reproducibility of simulation output from a common game physics engine, PhysX, is examined and conditions leading to highly reproducible behaviour are determined. For large time steps, sampling is shown to be susceptible to physical inva- lidities in the reference motion but, using physically optimized motions, is successfully applied at 60 time steps per second. Finally, adaptations to an existing method using evolutionary algorithms to learn feedback policies are described. With large time steps, it is found to be necessary to use a dense feedback formulation and to introduce phase-dependence in order to obtain a successful controller, which is able to recover from impulses of several hundred Newtons applied for 0. 1 s. Additionally, it is shown that a recent machine learning approach based on support vector machines can identify whether disturbed character states will lead to failure, with high accuracy (99 %) and with prediction times in the order of microseconds. Together, the trajectory optimization, open loop control, and feedback developments allow successful control for a walking motion at 60 time steps per second, with control and simulation time of 0. 62 ms per time step. This means that it could plausibly be used within the demanding performance constraints of games. Furthermore, the availability of rapid failure prediction for the controller will allow more high level control strategies to be explored in future...|$|R
