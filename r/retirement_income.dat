40|$|Chapter 3 of the book, Markets, {{rights and}} power in Australian social policy, edited by Gabrielle Meagher and Susan Goodwin, and {{published}} by Sydney University Press. Australian governments have shifted the focus of public policy onto {{the private sector in}} recent decades. <b>Retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> policy offers an important case study of this shift as a major target of efforts to privatise social provision. Rather than involving cutbacks to public provision, the introduction of compulsory occupational superannuation represents the largest transfer of social provision to the private sector in recent memory. The unprecedented growth of private super has stimulated debate about the economic and distributive impacts of private <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> policy. This chapter, by Adam Stebbing, explores both the fiscal impact and distributive effects of private <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> policy to better understand the strengths and limitations of recent developments. The fiscal impact of private <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> policy is gauged by surveying the available evidence on its capacity to meet key policy goals. The distributive effect of private <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> policy is examined by analysing current policy settings and the impact of private super on the risk profile of <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes.</b> The chapter concludes by canvassing the prospects for reform in this critical policy domain.   Chapters in Markets, rights {{and power in}} Australian social policy: Introduction: Capturing marketisation in Australian social policy 1) The politics of market encroachment: policymaker rationales and voter responses 2) The marketisation of human services and the expansion of the not-for-profit sector 3) The devil 2 ̆ 7 s in the detail: the hidden costs of private <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> policy 4) Social benefit bonds: financial markets inside the state 5) 2 ̆ 7 Which bank? 2 ̆ 7 Competition and community service obligations in the retail banking sector 6) Community aged care providers in a competitive environment: past, present and future 7) Home security: marketisation and the changing face of housing assistance in Australia 8) Money and markets in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s healthcare system 9) Marketisation of immigrant skills assessment in Australia 10) Markets in education: 2 ̆ 7 School choice 2 ̆ 7 and family capital 11) Conditional income transfers and choice in social services: just more conditions and more markets...|$|R

The {{results show that the}} recession will reduce average annual incomes at age 70 by 4. 3 percent, or $ 2, 300 per person. This drop results almost entirely from the anemic wage growth that occurred during the recession, which the model assumes will permanently reduce future wages.

40|$|Individual pension {{accounts}} are growing in importance as {{a pillar of}} <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> policy in the developed world. Policy-makers have generally assumed that by introducing pre-funded pension schemes, they can increase household wealth and thereby raise <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes.</b> However, there has been relatively little empirical work to confirm this. This paper focuses {{on the effect of}} Australia’s system of compulsory pension accounts, the ‘Superannuation Guarantee’, on household saving behaviour. Microeconomic data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, are used to explore three related questions: i. Have compulsory pension accounts increased household wealth? ii. What effect do compulsory pension accounts have on voluntary saving for retirement? iii. Do compulsory pension accounts influence the timing of retirement? This paper finds that Australia’s compulsory pension accounts increased household wealth. Voluntary saving for retirement in pension accounts also appeared to increase slightly, possibly due to the added convenience of being able to make contributions directly into these pension accounts. Finally, {{there is no evidence of}} a significant effect on retirement intentions. Overall, the results suggest that Australia’s compulsory pension accounts have increased household wealth and raised self-funded <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes.</b> superannuation; household saving; pension reform; HILDA...|$|R
40|$|Australia’s {{approach}} to <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> policy has three pillars: the means-tested age pension; compulsory superannuation; and voluntary saving, including saving via superannuation {{over and above}} that mandated by the superannuation guarantee. This paper examines the economic case for compulsory superannuation contributions and questions whether compulsory super {{is the most effective}} way of promoting household and national saving and reducing future demands on the federal budget from an ageing population when compared to alternative policy options. Most of the economic arguments for compulsory superannuation are second-best arguments made on the assumption that first-best outcomes are unattainable. There is considerable scope for public policy to address adverse interactions between the three pillars, the tax system and public expenditure that will increase voluntary saving, improve <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> and reduce future demands on the budget without relying on further increases in compulsory superannuation contributions. The paper recommends a shift in compulsion from the accumulation to the decumulation stage of retirement saving through the mandatory annuitisation of superannuation benefits. The second and third pillars of <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> policy should be merged into a single pillar based on a politically robust regime of tax-advantaged long-term voluntary saving via housing and superannuation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} a modification to the Pension Loan Scheme {{intended to help}} boost the <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> {{of a large number}} of current retirees. Summary The Australian government is currently willing to boost the <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> of wealthy Australians by providing low cost ‘reverse mortgages’ through Centrelink. The Pension Loan Scheme (PLS) allows eligible Australians to receive payments equivalent to the full age pension paid into their bank account on a fortnightly basis, borrowed from the government and secured against the value of property owned by the recipient. These government-issued loans allow wealthy older Australians to boost their own incomes by converting equity in their home into a fortnightly flow of cash from the government. Remarkably, to qualify for the PLS you must be too wealthy to be eligible for the full age pension. Retirees who are on the full age pension and who own their own homes are unable to boost their income via the PLS. This paper {{suggests a}} simple modification to the PLS that would, in making it fairer, significantly help to boost the <b>retirement</b> <b>incomes</b> {{of a large number of}} current retirees. We propose that the PLS payments be made available to all citizens of pension age.  ...|$|R
