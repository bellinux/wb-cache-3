5|$|A July 1966 {{report by}} the New York Academy of Medicine Committee on Public Health cautioned that New York City's air-pollution problem made it {{susceptible}} to acute and lethal episodes and <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> reduction of air pollution. Further, the report concluded that scientists had likely not identified {{the full range of}} harmful pollutants or health effects caused by air pollution.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Science Council of Canada during the 1970s, Franklin chaired an {{influential}} study on conserving resources and protecting nature. The study's 1977 report, Canada as a Conserver Society, <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> wide range of steps aimed at reducing wasteful consumption and the environmental degradation that goes with it. The work on that study helped shape Franklin's ideas about the complexities of modern technological society.|$|E
5|$|As the TF33 {{overhaul}} cost tripled in a decade, a joint Boeing/USAF study in 2003 <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> $4–4.7 billion re-engining, allowing $11–15 billion cost savings while increasing B-52H combat range by 22% and tripling loiter time on station, proposing a {{competition between the}} RB211, PW2000, and eight CFM56 engines financed by an Energy Savings Performance Contract.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{a report}} on {{religious}} life at Lafayette College was compiled. This report <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> review of the college's formal relationship with the Presbyterian church. To date, however, this affiliation remains in place, although the college is {{not a member of}} the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, Stonehenge <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> {{cross between}} a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He found the crossbreed {{to be a good}} worker, silent and obedient, but it had the {{drawback}} that it was small and could barely carry a hare.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NASA {{initiated}} the Discovery Program, which {{was intended to}} be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the Dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review and construction proceeded.|$|E

5|$|Knox, in his 1866 report, had <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> {{thorough}} {{revision of}} the laws pertaining to the Mint, and in January 1870, Secretary Boutwell instructed him to prepare a draft. In this, Knox had the assistance of former Mint Director Henry Linderman, who then held a roving commission for the Treasury Department; Linderman would in 1873 become the first director of the Bureau of the Mint.|$|E
5|$|On November 8, 2010, {{the jury}} {{returned}} with a recommendation that Hayes be executed. The jury <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> death sentence {{on each of the}} six capital felony counts for which Hayes was convicted. In the sentencing phase, the jury had deliberated for about 17 hours, over the course of three and a half days, before reaching a decision.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} Washington's death, a Congressional {{committee}} <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> {{different type of}} monument. John Marshall, a Representative from Virginia (who later became Chief Justice of the United States) proposed that a tomb be erected within the Capitol. However, a lack of funds, disagreement over what type of memorial would best honor the country's first president, and the Washington family's reluctance to move his body prevented progress on any project.|$|E

5|$|The Samyukta Maharashtra {{movement}} {{to create a}} separate Maharashtra state including Bombay was at its height in the 1950s. In the Lok Sabha discussions in 1955, the Congress party demanded that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state. The States Reorganisation Committee <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> bilingual state for Maharashtra–Gujarat with Bombay as its capital in its 1955 report. Bombay Citizens' Committee, an advocacy group of leading Gujarati industrialists lobbied for Bombay's independent status.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} {{shortcomings of}} the mass housing movement led to efforts to create cost-effective housing solutions that were more varied, more integrated with natural surroundings, and above all more customized to families' needs. In 1973, the Parliament of Norway <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> shift toward small residential houses rather than large apartment buildings. The Norwegian State Housing Bank (Husbanken) provided citizens {{with the ability to}} fund construction of their homes, and an entire construction industry formed to build these needs.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{inspired}} by various experiences from the lives of Janowitz and Mayer, both pacifists who were left distrustful of authority after their experiences with the military during World War I.

5|$|With {{the rapid}} {{suburban}} expansion of Guelph in the 1950s and 1960s, a revised transportation plan was conceived {{to handle the}} increasing traffic load. The Guelph Area Transportation Study was completed in 1967, and <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> new controlled-access highway to allow through-traffic on Highway6 to bypass the city. Route planning, engineering and design began on October2, 1967 and was subsequently completed in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{promoted}} {{many public}} educational institutions. Chiefly at meetings {{in connection with}} these {{he spoke of the}} need for better schooling. A collection of his speeches was published in 1857. Recognised as a supporter of education and technological progress, he was invited to speak at scientific meetings, such as the memorable address he delivered as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when it met at Aberdeen in 1859. His espousal of science met with clerical opposition; he and Palmerston unsuccessfully <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> knighthood for Charles Darwin, after the publication of On the Origin of Species, which was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was {{established}} in 1960 {{to look at the}} matter again. Also it <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> tunnel and a central station. However, it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Skøyen, and build a second station at Frogner. The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station was passed unanimously.|$|E

5|$|Pregnant and {{breastfeeding}} women, {{who require}} 66% more daily iodine requirement than non-pregnant women, may still not be getting enough iodine. The World Health Organization <b>recommends</b> <b>a</b> daily intake of 250µg for pregnant and breastfeeding women. As many women will not achieve this from dietary sources alone, the American Thyroid Association <b>recommends</b> <b>a</b> 150µg daily supplement by mouth.|$|R

5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and {{came to rest on}} the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E
5|$|Broun's scheme had envisaged the {{cemetery}} running along {{both sides of}} the LSWR main line and divided by religion, with separate private railway halts on the main line, each incorporating a chapel, to serve each religion's section. The new consulting engineer to the company, William Cubitt, rejected this idea and <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> single site to the south of the railway line, served by a private branch line through {{the cemetery}}. The company also considered Broun's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic, arguing that relatives would not want the coffins to be shipped separately from the deceased's family.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the debates over church government, the Assembly framed other {{documents}} which did not cause open rifts. The Directory for Public Worship, which was to replace the Book of Common Prayer, was swiftly written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3January 1645. The Directory, accepted by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians {{for the most part}} preferred a fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer. The Directory consisted of an order for services with sample prayers. The Assembly also <b>recommended</b> <b>a</b> psalter, translated by Francis Rous for use in worship.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} methods for medical abortion: the drug {{mifepristone}} followed by misoprostol, methotrexate followed by misoprostol, and misoprostol alone. The World Health Organization (WHO) <b>recommends</b> <b>an</b> evidence-based mifepristone-misoprostol combination regimen for medical abortion; where mifepristone {{is not available}} it <b>recommends</b> <b>a</b> misoprostol-only regimen. A methotrexate-misoprostol regimen can also be used; however, because methotrexate may be teratogenic to the fetus in cases of incomplete abortion, the WHO does not <b>recommend</b> <b>a</b> methotrexate-misoprostol combination regimen for medical abortion. Mifepristone-misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate-misoprostol combination regimens. Mifepristone-misoprostol and methotrexate-misoprostol combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone.|$|R
