We installed several proton precession magnetometers for continuous observation andset up tens of observation sites for <b>repeated</b> <b>survey</b> in the geothermal area at Kuju-Iwoyama, Kyushu Island,Southwest of Japan, after the vapor eruption (phreatic explosion) event in October of 1995.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To review <b>repeated</b> <b>surveys</b> of {{the rising}} {{prevalence}} of obstructive lung disease among {{children and young adults}} and determine whether systematic biases may explain the observed trends. DESIGN: Review of published reports of <b>repeated</b> cross sectional <b>surveys</b> of asthma and wheezing among children and young adults. The <b>repeated</b> <b>surveys</b> used the same sampling frame, the same definition of outcome variables, and equivalent data collection methods. SETTING: <b>Repeated</b> <b>surveys</b> conducted anywhere in the world. SUBJECTS: All <b>repeated</b> <b>surveys</b> whose last set of results were published in 1983 or later. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime and current prevalences of asthma and current prevalence of wheezing. The absolute increase (yearly percentage) in the prevalences of asthma and wheezing was calculated and compared between studies. RESULTS: 16 <b>repeated</b> <b>surveys</b> fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 12 reported increases in the current prevalence of asthma (from 0. 09 % to 0. 97 % a year) and eight reported increases in the current prevalence of wheezing (from 0. 14 % to 1. 24 % a year). Changes in labelling are likely to have occurred for the reporting of asthma, and information biases may have occurred for the reporting of wheezing. Only one study reported an increase in an objective measurement. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for increased prevalences of asthma and wheezing is weak because the measures used are susceptible to systematic errors. Until <b>repeated</b> <b>surveys</b> incorporating more objective data are available no firm conclusions about increases in obstructive lung disease among children and young adults can be drawn...|$|R

40|$|Estimates {{of species}} {{richness}} {{for a given}} area require that <b>repeat</b> <b>surveys</b> be taken, so that the statistical robustness of the estimate can be assessed. But how should these <b>repeat</b> <b>surveys</b> be organized in time? Here we present {{a case study of}} Australian woodland birds, surveyed using the `active timed area search' method, which has become the standard unit for the Australian Bird Atlas, a continental-scale bird survey. To date, there has been no assessment of how estimates of species richness derived from this method are affected by the temporal organization of the <b>repeat</b> <b>surveys.</b> For instance, can conducting the <b>repeat</b> <b>surveys</b> in sequence on the same day effectively capture richness, or will additional species be obtained by <b>repeating</b> the <b>surveys</b> on different days within a season? If so, does the spacing of the repeat visits throughout the season have an effect? To answer these questions, we surveyed woodland birds in the Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia, during late spring [...] summer 1999 [...] 2000, and compared the performance of two different temporal configurations of repeat visits to sites: (i) six <b>repeat</b> <b>surveys</b> performed on the same day; and (ii) three <b>repeat</b> <b>surveys</b> on different days. For both, we calculated the average number of species actually sighted and also estimated total species richness. The data supported our hypothesis that the sameday surveys would yield fewer species and underestimate total species richness. The different-day repeats captured significantly more species per unit of survey effort, and yielded a higher richness estimate. However, the timespan over which different-day surveys were conducted within a season did not have a significant influence on species richness estimates, evincing a qualitative advantage to surveying on different days, re [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>repeated</b> <b>surveys</b> can be approached using model-based inference, utilising {{the methods of}} time series analysis. On a long run of <b>repeated</b> <b>surveys</b> it should then be possible to enhance the estimation of a survey parameter. However, many <b>repeated</b> <b>surveys</b> that are suited to this approach consist of variables that are proportions, and hence are bounded between 0 and 1. Furthermore interest is often in a multinomial vector of these proportions, that are sum-constrained to 1, i. e., a composition. A solution to using time series techniques on such data is to apply an additive logistic transformation to the data and then to model the resulting series using vector ARMA models. Here the additive logistic transformation is discussed which requires that one variable be selected as a reference variable. Its application to compositional time series is developed, which includes the result that the choice of’reference variable will not affect any final results in this context. The discussion also includes the production of forecasts and confidence regions for these forecasts. The method is illustrated by application to the Australian Labour Force Survey...|$|R
