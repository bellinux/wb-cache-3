60|$|Promising {{himself that}} he would <b>re-stow</b> the goods on the gig, putting his father's with those {{belonging}} to himself and Teddy, {{as soon as this}} message had been delivered, he descended the companion-way after glancing rapidly around the horizon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank 'ee, friend," [...] {{said the}} amateur surgeon, as he {{proceeded}} to <b>re-stow</b> his materials in the medicine chest; [...] "you know that the Fishermen's Mission never asks a rap for its services, but neither does it expect to receive a rap without asking. Come, David, you mustn't flourish it about like that. We all know you're a plucky fellow, but it'll never splice properly {{if you go on}} so." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{stowage plan}} shows crossections {{of the ship}} bay by bay, to {{indicate}} where all the containers should be loaded. The plans change with each port of call as container are discharged or <b>re-stowed</b> and new containers are taken on board.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Umm,' said Kim thoughtfully, {{considering}} the past. 'It {{may be that}} I have acquired merit also ... At least she did not treat me like a child.' He hitched {{the front of his}} robe, where lay the slab of documents and maps, <b>re-stowed</b> the precious food-bag at the lama's feet, laid his hand on the litter's edge, and buckled down to the slow pace of the grunting husbands.|$|R
50|$|The LCM-1E {{incorporates}} a stern gate, allowing the {{loading and unloading}} of vehicles onto all landing craft within the dry stern dock, without having to open the gate to swap landing craft around. In turn, this saves having to dock down the landing platform, and allows <b>re-stowing</b> of vehicles while the landing platform is underway. There is a maximum limit of 12 tons for the transfer of vehicles in this configuration.|$|R
5000|$|Panzerschnellbrücke 2: This vehicle, {{created by}} MAN Mobile Bridges GmbH, is an {{armoured}} vehicle-launched bridge {{developed from the}} Leopard 2 tank chassis. It is designed to carry a folding mobile bridge, which it can [...] "launch" [...] across a river. Once emplaced, the bridge is sturdy enough to support most vehicles, even Leopard tanks. When the crossing is complete, the bridge-layer simply hooks up to the bridge and <b>re-stows</b> it.|$|R
50|$|The Aerovel Flexrotor {{unmanned}} aerial system (UAS) {{is designed}} for maritime and land-based operations, day and night, and combines endurance and expeditionary capabilities. It needs a 20’ by 20’ area for launch and recovery. Flexrotor takes off and lands vertically (VTOL) and then transitions into horizontal wing-borne flight. It flies completely automatically after takeoff, with no pilot intervention needed. Flexrotor quickly assembles for flight, can be rapidly <b>re-stowed</b> in its compact case for storage and transported on a small flatbed truck.|$|R
5000|$|After that, {{planners}} get discharge lists/plans in {{the form}} of an EDI file (the COPRAR) and send information to the container terminals for all the <b>re-stows</b> (discharging containers and re-loading them) which may be required for completing the discharge process. Planners will also classify the loading data according to the kind of cargo in the containers as well as the size and shape of the containers and their destinations. Each container is marked with a series of numbers and codes to identify the container's operator, specifications and what kind of cargo it may hold. The parameters are: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] drily {{answered}} Cap; [...] "escape is {{the proper}} word. We ran below and hid ourselves, and so discreetly, {{that we might have}} remained in the hole to this hour, {{had it not been for}} the necessity of <b>re-stowing</b> the bread lockers. You burrowed on that occasion, Quartermaster, as handily as a fox; and how the d---l you knew so well where to find the spot is a matter of wonder to me. A regular skulk on board ship does not trail aft more readily when the jib is to be stowed, than you went into that same hole." ...|$|R
60|$|The others {{agreed and}} soon {{afterwards}} got to work. When the negroes Montgomery sent arrived all the cargo worth salving was <b>re-stowed,</b> and {{he bought the}} hulk for a floating store. Then, one night when the moon and tide were full, Terrier steamed slowly across the lagoon. Two massive ropes trailed across her stern and Arcturus' high dark bow towered above her phosphorescent wake. The land breeze blew behind her and the surf had not the fury the sea breeze gives by day, but when Terrier plunged into the turmoil Brown watched the tow ropes with anxious eyes.|$|R
500|$|Royal Edward {{was able}} to get off an SOS before losing power, and Soudan arrived on the scene at 10:00 after making a 180° turn and rescued 440 men in six hours. Two French destroyers and some {{trawlers}} rescued another 221. According to authors James Wise and Scott Baron, Royal Edwards death toll was 935 and was high because Royal Edward had just completed a boat drill and the majority of the men were below decks <b>re-stowing</b> their equipment. Other sources report different numbers of casualties, from 132 [...] to 1,386 [...] or 1,865. An admiralty casualty list, published in The Times in September 1915, named 13 officers and 851 troops as missing believed drowned, a total of 864 lost.|$|R
500|$|While {{en route}} to Samoa {{on the night of}} 2324 March 1899, Cormoran ran aground on the Whirlwind Reef, north of the western tip of New Pomerania. She was stuck on the reef amidships, so that her bow was {{sticking}} about a meter out of the water. The crew attempted to lighten the ship by removing coal and ammunition, but she remained grounded on the reef. The ship's commander, Korvettenkapitän Hugo Emsmann, sent the steam pinnace and a dinghy with two officers and eleven men, towing a load of coal, to Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen, some [...] away. There, they met the steamer , which arrived on the scene on 29 March. Emsmann then decided to remove all unnecessary coal and ammunitionsome of which was put ashore and the rest simply thrown overboardto cut away the fore and mainmast, and to move the stern guns forward. These measures allowed the ship to float free from the reef. The crew then <b>re-stowed</b> the supplies that had been sent ashore before returning to Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen. There, her seaworthiness was inspected, and additional supplies were brought aboard. Cormoran then steamed to Sydney for dry-docking; a full inspection of her hull revealed that it had only been slightly damaged. Repairs lasted until early June.|$|R
