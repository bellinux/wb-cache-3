5|$|In 1954, Romeo Guest, a {{building}} contractor, {{met with the}} North Carolina state treasurer, Brandon Hodges, {{and the president of}} Wachovia, Robert Hanes, to discuss building a research park in North Carolina to attract new industries to the region. They obtained support for the concept of <b>Research</b> <b>Triangle</b> Park from state governor Luther Hodges and the three universities that form the research triangle: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University and North Carolina State University. The <b>Research</b> <b>Triangle</b> Institute (now RTI International) was formed as the research park's first tenant in 1958 by the park's founders. The following January they announced that $1.425 million had been raised by the <b>Research</b> <b>Triangle</b> Foundation to fund the park and that $500,000 of it had been set aside for RTI.|$|E

5|$|The coin, {{known as}} the Eisenhower dollar, proved unpopular with the public, and {{very few of the}} coins were found in circulation. In 1976, the <b>Research</b> <b>Triangle</b> Institute {{conducted}} a survey of United States coinage. Among other things, they recommended the half dollar, which also saw little use, be entirely eliminated from production, {{and the size of the}} dollar be reduced. Their report read in part: A conveniently-sized dollar coin would significantly broaden the capabilities of consumers for cash transactions, especially with machines. Members of the automatic merchandising industry have expressed a strong interest in a smaller dollar, indicating their willingness to adapt their machinery to its use. Numismatic historian David L. Ganz suggested that Eisenhower, a Republican, was chosen as a means of balancing the half dollar, depicting Democrat John F. Kennedy. In a 1977 paper, he agreed with the findings of the Institute, suggesting that both coins should be eliminated; the half dollar production ceased entirely, and the dollar replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design. Treasury officials desired the small dollar coin as a cost-saving measure; Mint Director Stella Hackel estimated that replacing half of the issued dollar bills with small dollars would save $19 million ($ today) in annual production costs.|$|E

40|$|Many {{libraries}} share regional, statewide, or even {{national union}} or consortium catalogs to enable consolidated search and display of participant holdings. These catalogs typically duplicate search capabilities provided by individual libraries’ local catalogs. Search TRLN is a discovery layer built to support both group and individual library catalog interfaces {{for the four}} member institutions of the <b>Triangle</b> <b>Research</b> Libraries Network. In 2010, the Shared Records Pilot Task Group extended this shared catalog concept to the individual bibliographic record level. In this model, individual member libraries assume responsibility for build-ing and maintaining record sets for commonly held electronic collections {{on behalf of the}} consortium. Today the program includes more than 220, 000 shared records representing 765, 000 individual library holdings. This has resulted in consider-able savings in staff costs, processing costs, and metadata storage and suggests an evolving model for catalogers as managers, rather than as creators and curators, of metadata. This article discusses the evolution of this project, the development of staff trust necessary to let go of proprietary metadata, and the systems logic needed for implementation. The article closes with criteria for assessing the suc-cess of the program, including improvements in catalog display, throughput and timeliness, time savings, and elimination of duplicated maintenance activities.

40|$|A three-dimensional, {{primitive}} equation, ocean {{general circulation}} model {{is used to}} study {{the response of the}} Gulf of Mexico to Hurricane Camille (1969). The free-surface dynamics and the mixed-layer features are included in the model. The numerical model incorporates the realistic coastline and bottom topography. The sigma coordinate model bas eighteen levels in the vertical and 0. 2 ° x 0. 2 ° horizontal resolution for the entire gulf. The study focuses on nonlinear interaction between hurricane induced currents and the Loop Current. The numerical simulations show that there is a strong nonlinear interaction between the hurricane and the Loop Current in the southern and central parts of the eastern gulf. The surface currents due to nonlinear interaction obtain a maximum of over 1 m s· 1 in the southern gulf. The numerical results also show that the hurricane interaction with the Loop Current strongly affects current, mixed-layer depth, and elevation fields. There is a strong current response to Hurricane Camille in the surface layer on the shelf with a peak velocity approximately 2. 2 m s- 1 • There is a definite right band bias in the mixed-layer depth field with a maximum of about 90 m.
