50|$|A high {{pressure}} grinding roll, {{often referred to}} as HPGRs or <b>roller</b> <b>press,</b> consists out of two rollers with the same dimensions, which are rotating against each other with the same circumferential speed. The special feeding of bulk material through a hopper leads to a material bed between the two rollers. The bearing units of one roller can move linearly and are pressed against the material bed by springs or hydraulic cylinders. The pressures in the material bed are greater than 50 MPa (7,000 PSI). In general they achieve 100 to 300 MPa. By this the material bed is compacted to a solid volume portion of more than 80%.|$|E

5000|$|The mill {{is usually}} divided into {{at least two}} {{chambers}} (although this depends upon feed input size - mills including a <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> are mostly single-chambered), allowing the use of different sizes of grinding media. Large balls are used at the inlet, to crush clinker nodules (which can be over 25 mm in diameter). Ball diameter here is in the range 60-80 mm. In a two-chamber mill, the media in the second chamber are typically in the range 15-40 mm, although media down to 5 mm are sometimes encountered. As a general rule, the size of media has to match the size of material being ground: large media can't produce the ultra-fine particles required in the finished cement, but small media can't break large clinker particles.

50|$|The {{original}} laundry {{consisted of}} a single-storeyed section at {{the eastern end of}} the dormitory building containing ironing and mangling rooms, and a southern wing which housed the sorting room and washhouse. In 1899 a northern wing in brick with a timber verandah was added. It was designed as a model ironing room equipped with a purpose-built recess which housed tiered stoves capable of heating sixty-eight irons. Large <b>roller</b> <b>presses</b> were in use by 1902 and electric irons were installed in 1917. From the outset the laundry employed steam-driven facilities, initially powered by a gas-operated boiler. An oil burner was installed in the 1980s, and the old boiler-room chimney was demolished.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} types of {{large-scale}} pellet mills: flat die mills and ring die mills. Flat die mills use a flat die with slots.

A cutter on the other side of the die cuts the exposed pellet free from the die. In the ring die there are radial slot throughout the die. Powder is fed into the inside of the die and spreaders evenly distribute the powder. Two rollers then compress the powder through the die holes. Two cutters are used to cut the pellets free from the outside of the die.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} methods of comminution. Comminution of solid {{materials}} requires {{different types of}} crushers and mills depending on the feed properties such as hardness at various size ranges and application requirements such as throughput and maintenance. The most common machines for the comminution of coarse feed material are the jaw crusher (1m > P80 > 100 mm), cone crusher (P80 > 20 mm) and hammer crusher. Primary jaw crusher product in intermediate feed particle size ranges (100mm > P80 > 20mm) can be ground in Autogenous or Semi-Autogenous (AG or SAG) mills depending on feed properties and application requirements. For comminution of finer particle size ranges (20mm > P80 > 30 μm) machines like the ball mill, vertical roller mill, hammer mill, <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> or high compression roller mill, vibration mill, jet mill and others are used. For yet finer grind sizes (sometimes referred to as [...] "ultrafine grinding"), specialist mills such as the IsaMillTM are used.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, in {{continental}} Europe, France readopted machine made {{coins in}} 1639. Both machine made and hammered coins {{continued through the}} recoinage of French silver in 1641, but this time machine made coinage’s time had come and hammered French coinage ended in 1645. [...] Zurich and Heidelberg experimented with coinage machinery in 1558 and 1567 respectively and the Hall mint in Tirol permanently adopted coinage machinery in 1567. Unlike the screw press used in France and England, Hall used a <b>roller</b> <b>press.</b> Here two cylindrical dies impressed designs on bullion which rolled between them. Coins were then cut from the rolled and impressed metal. This technique spread from Hall to Cologne in 1568, Dresden in 1574, Kremnica in 1577, Danzig in 1577, and other small mints. Its most significant impact occurred when Philip II of Spain used his personal funds to build a mint at Segovia which used this technique to convert silver from the Americas to coins efficiently. This allowed the king to pay his debts at a better rate than he otherwise could. The Segovia mint was owned by the King’s Royal House but other Spanish mints, which were run by the National Treasury, continued hammered coinage for decades.|$|E
40|$|Roller {{compaction}} is {{a continuous}} dry granulation process for producing free flowing granules {{in order to}} increase the bulk density and uniformity of pharmaceutical formulations. It is a complicated process due to the diversity of powder blends and processing parameters involved. The properties of the produced ribbon are dominated by a number of factors, such as the powder properties. friction, roll speed, roll gap, feeding mechanisms and feeding speed, which consequently determine the properties of the granules (size distribution, density and flow behaviour). It is hence important to understand the influence of these factors on the ribbon properties. in this study, an instrumented <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> developed at the University of Birmingham is used to investigate the effect of lubrication on the density distribution of the ribbons. Three different cases are considered: (1) no lubrication, (2) lubricated press. in which the side cheek plates of the <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> are lubricated, and (3) lubricated powder, for which a lubricant is mixed into the powder. In addition, how the powders are fed into the entry region of the <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> and its influence on ribbon properties are also investigated. It is found that the method of feeding the powder into the <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> plays a crucial role in determining the homogeneity of the ribbon density. For the <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> used in this Study, a drag angle (i. e., the angle formed when the powder is dragged into the <b>roller</b> <b>press)</b> is introduced to characterise the powder flow pattern in the feeding hopper. It is shown that a sharper drag angle results in a more heterogeneous ribbon. In addition, the average ribbon density depends upon the peak pressure and nip angle. The higher the peak pressure and nip angle are, the higher the average ribbon density is. Furthermore, the densification behaviour of the powder during roller compaction is compared to that during die compaction. It has been shown that the densification behaviour during these two processes is similar if the ribbons and the tablets have the same thickness. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|E

The present mill inlet chute can be used for the two compartment ball mills only in which primary and finish grinding both are takes place. It may be a closed or open circuit grinding systems. In recent days, the Ball mill grinding systems are used with the <b>Roller</b> <b>press</b> and it is developing very fastly. The primary grinding is done by the <b>Roller</b> <b>press</b> and finish grinding takes place in Ball mill. Because of this, we can increase the Ball mill capacity as well as the Cement production. Also the feed materials which are coming from <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> to the ball mill are powdery form instead of Clinker material. The feed chute for this application requires more area to direct the material and more air allowing area to achieve the required air flow inside the mill to transmit the grounded material. The replacement of the liner plates/mill components and access during maintenance is difficult in the present UMS mills since the mill inlet is fixed with the foundation. This can be avoided by implementing the new designed movable truck assembly at inlet chute. In this design, the Inlet chute will be fixed on the movable truck assembly which can be easily removable along with chute during the maintenance and liner plate replacement.

30|$|On the contrary, in R 2 P NIL, a <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> {{mechanism}} {{is used to}} provide the imprinting force onto a rigid surface as shown previously in Figure  3.
