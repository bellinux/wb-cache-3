Following an overture by the UK in the early 1970s, when <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> were warming, China became interested in the aircraft as it sought to modernise its armed forces; British Prime Minister James Callaghan noted significant hostility from the USSR over the sales bid.

As Simeon the Great during the first empire, Ivan Asen II expanded the territory to the coasts of three seas (Adriatic, Aegean and Black), annexed Medea - the last fortress before the walls of Constantinople, unsuccessfully besieged the city in 1235 and restored the destroyed since 1018 Bulgarian Patriarchate.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, China began {{normalizing}} its <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>West,</b> particularly the U.S., and reevaluating {{its relations with}} North Korea.

In response, Kim Il-sung began severing ties with China and reemphasizing national and economic self-reliance enshrined in his Juche Idea, which promoted producing everything within the country. By the 1980s the economy had begun to stagnate; it started its long decline in 1987 and almost completely collapsed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, when all Russian aid was suddenly halted. The North began reestablishing trade relations with China shortly thereafter, but the Chinese could not afford to provide enough food aid to meet demand.|$|E

25|$|The {{reunification of}} Korea could see similar {{economic}} effects {{to that of}} Vietnamese reunification.

Meanwhile, North Vietnam's state-run economy mirrored that of North Korea, with large collective farms, urban industrialization, and trade relations with the Soviet Union and China.
