60|$|I <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter,</b> dearest friend, and {{hasten to}} write a few brief words to save the post.|$|E
60|$|I feel {{it a great}} tribute, therefore, to <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter.</b> It is {{most welcome}} and {{acceptable}} to me. I thank you for it heartily, and am proud of the approval of one who suffered in his youth, even more than my poor child.|$|E
60|$|I am {{delighted to}} <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter,</b> {{and to look}} forward with {{confidence}} to having such a successor in August. I can honestly assure you that I never have been so pleased at heart in all my literary life, as I am in the proud thought of standing {{side by side with}} you before this great audience.|$|E
60|$|First, I have {{to report}} that I <b>received</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> with much pleasure.|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR GENERAL:--I {{have just}} <b>received</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> of the 25th of June.|$|R
60|$|I have <b>received</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> of yesterday's date, {{and shall}} content {{myself with a}} brief reply.|$|R
60|$|I {{was glad}} at heart to <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter,</b> {{and still more}} gladdened by the reading of it. The {{exceeding}} kindness which it breathed was literally medicinal to me, and I firmly believe, cured me of a nervous rheumatic affection, the acid and the oil, very completely at Patterdale; {{but by the time}} it came to Keswick, the oil was all atop.|$|E
60|$|My dear Mrs. Jameson,--I <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter,</b> as I must {{do every}} sign of your being near and {{inclined}} to think of me in kindness, gladly, and assure you at once that whenever you can spend a half-hour on me you will find me enough myself to have a true pleasure in welcoming you, say any day except next Saturday or the Monday immediately following.|$|E
60|$|Sir,--I had {{the honor}} to <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> of the 17th of November last, in which, with some exceptions, you {{are pleased to}} {{consider}} favorably the letter I have written on the affairs of France. I shall ever accept any mark of approbation attended with instruction with more pleasure than general and unqualified praises. The latter can serve only to flatter our vanity; the former, whilst it encourages us to proceed, may help to improve us in our progress.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--I <b>received</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> and proof to-day, and {{was greatly}} {{delighted with the}} last.|$|R

6000|$|... "MY DEAR EDWARD,--I {{was very}} glad to <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>Letter,</b> which showed me that you have learned {{something}} since I left home. If you knew how much pleasure it gave me to see your handwriting, I am sure you would take pains {{to be able to}} write well, that you might often send me letters, and tell me a great many things which I should like to know about Mamma and your Sisters as well as yourself.|$|E
60|$|My dearest Fanny,--I {{this moment}} <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter,</b> and hasten {{to answer it}} lest I should {{be too late for}} you in Paris. Dear Fanny, you seem in a chronic {{transitional}} state; it's always crisis with you. I can't advise; but I do rather wonder that you don't go at once to England and see your friends till you can do your business.... You can get at pictures in England and at artistic society also if you please; and making a slancio into Germany or to Paris would not be impossible to you occasionally.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was delighted}} to <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> yesterday, and was well pleased with its contents. I {{anticipated}} objection to Carlyle's[18] letter. I called particular attention to it for three reasons. Firstly, because he boldly said what all the others think, and therefore deserved to be manfully supported. Secondly, because it is my deliberate opinion that I have been assailed on this subject in a manner in which no man with any pretensions to public respect or with the remotest right to express an opinion on a subject of universal literary interest would be assailed in any other country.

60|$|Dear Dave: I <b>received</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> {{in answer}} to mine, which you never got till {{sometime}} after you had written.|$|R
60|$|I {{have this}} moment <b>received</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter,</b> and have {{scarcely}} {{more than a}} moment to answer it by return of post.|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} from home, {{and did not}} <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> until my return the other day. What shall I say to comfort you, my much-valued, much-afflicted friend! I can but grieve with you; {{consolation}} I have none to offer, except that which religion holds out {{to the children of}} affliction--children of affliction!--how just the expression! and like every other family, they have matters among them which they hear, see, and feel in a serious, all-important manner, of which the world has not, nor cares to have, any idea. The world looks indifferently on, makes the passing remark, and proceeds to the next novel occurrence.|$|E
6000|$|You do {{not answer}} me about H.'s book; I {{want to write}} to him, and not to say {{anything}} unpleasing. If you direct to Post Office, Portsmouth, till called for, I will send and <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter.</b> You never told me of the forthcoming critique on 'Columbus' [1] which is not too fair; and I do not think justice quite done to the 'Pleasures', which surely entitles the author to a higher rank than that assigned to him in the 'Quarterly'. But I must not cavil at the decisions of the invisible infallibles; and the article is very well written. The general horror of [...] "fragments" [...] [2] makes me tremulous for [...] "The Giaour;" [...] but you would publish it--I presume, by this time, to your repentance. But as I consented, whatever be its fate, I won't now quarrel with you, even though I detect it in my pastry; but I shall not open a pye without apprehension for some weeks.|$|E
6000|$|... "M. le President,--I {{have had}} the honor to <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>Letter.</b> You inform me that you are well; that your {{strength}} is entirely returned; and that, if I publish La Beaumelle's Letter [private Letter of his, lent me by a Friend, which proves that YOU set him against me], you will come and assassinate me. What ingratitude to your poor medical man Akakia!... If you exalt your soul so as to discern futurity, {{you will see that}} if you come on that errand to Leipzig, where you are no better liked than in other places, and where your Letter is in safe Legal hands, you run some risk of being hanged. Poor me, indeed, you will find in bed; and I shall have nothing for you but my syringe and vessel of dishonor: but so soon as I have gained a little strength, I will have my pistols charged CUM PULVERE PYRIO; and multiplying the mass by the square of the velocity, so as to reduce the action and you to zero, I will put some lead in your head;--it appears to have need of it. ADIEU, MON PRESIDENT. AKAKIA." [...] [Duvernet, pp. 186, 187;--OEuvres de Voltaire,--lxi. 55-60.] ...|$|E

6000|$|By an {{accident}} I did not <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> till this evening. I would {{that you had}} added to the account of your indisposition the probable causes of it. It has left me anxious whether or no you have not exposed yourself to unwholesome influences in your chemical pursuits. There are [...] "few" [...] beings both of hope and performance, but few who combine the [...] "are" [...] and the [...] "will be." [...] For God's sake, therefore, my dear fellow, do not rip open the bird that lays the golden eggs. I have not received your book. I read yesterday a sort of medical review about it. I suppose Longman will send it to me when he sends down the [...] "Lyrical Ballads" [...] to Wordsworth. I am solicitous to read the latter part. Did there appear to you any remote analogy between the case I translated from the German Magazine and the effects produced by your gas? Did Carlisle[1] ever communicate to you, or has he in any way published his facts concerning [...] "pain", which he mentioned when we were with him? It is a subject which [...] "exceedingly interests" [...] me. I want to read something by somebody expressly on [...] "pain", if only to give an [...] "arrangement" [...] to my own thoughts, though if it were well treated, I have little doubt it would revolutionize them. For the last month I have been trembling on through sands and swamps of evil and bodily grievance. My eyes have been inflamed {{to a degree that}} rendered reading and writing scarcely possible; and strange as it seems, the act of metre composition, as I lay in bed, perceptibly affected them, and my voluntary ideas were every minute passing, more or less transformed into vivid spectra. I had leeches repeatedly applied to my temples, and a blister behind my ear--and my eyes are now my own, but in the place where the blister was, six small but excruciating boils have appeared, and harass me almost beyond endurance. In the meantime my darling Hartley has been taken with a stomach illness, which has ended in the yellow jaundice; and this greatly alarms me. So much for the doleful! Amid all these changes, and humiliations, and fears, the sense of the Eternal abides in me, and preserves unsubdued my cheerful faith, that all I endure is full of blessings! ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR AND KIND WEG,--It was {{a lesson}} in {{philosophy}} that would have moved a bear, to <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> in my present temper. For I am now well and well at my ease, both by comparison. First, my health has turned a corner; it was not consumption this time, though consumption {{it has to be}} some time, as all my kind friends sing to me, day in, day out. Consumption! how I hate that word; yet it can sound innocent, as, e.g., consumption of military stores. What was wrong with me, apart from colds and little pleuritic flea-bites, was a lingering malaria; and that is now greatly overcome, I eat once more, which is a great amusement and, they say, good for the health. Second, many of the thunderclouds that were overhanging me when last I wrote, have silently stolen away like Longfellow's Arabs: and I am now engaged to be married to the woman whom I have loved for three years and a half. I do not yet know when the marriage can come off; for there are many reasons for delay. But as few people before marriage have known each other so long or made more trials of each other's tenderness and constancy, I permit myself to hope some quiet at the end of all. At least I will boast myself so far; I do not think many wives are better loved than mine will be. Third and last, in the order of what has changed my feelings, my people have cast me off, and so that thundercloud, as you may almost say, has overblown. You know more than most people whether or not I loved my father.[27] These things are sad; nor can any man forgive himself for bringing them about; yet they are easier to meet in fact than by anticipation. I almost trembled whether I was doing right, until I was fairly summoned; then, when I found that I was not shaken one jot, that I could grieve, that I could sharply blame myself, for the past, and yet never hesitate one second as to my conduct in the future, I believed my cause was just and I leave it with the Lord. I certainly look for no reward, nor any abiding city either here or hereafter, but I please myself with hoping that my father will not always think so badly of my conduct nor so very slightingly of my affection as he does at present.|$|E
6000|$|My dearest Mrs. Martin,--I {{hope you}} are very angry indeed with us for not writing. We are as {{penitent}} as we ought to be--that is, I am, for I believe I am the idle person; yet not altogether idle, but procrastinating and waiting for news rather more worthy of being read in Rome than any which even now I can send you.... And now, my dear Mrs. Martin, I mean to thank you, as I ought to have done long ago, for your kindness in offering to procure for me the Archbishop of Dublin's[13] valuable opinion upon my 'Prometheus. I am sure {{that if you have}} not thought me very ungrateful, you must be very indulgent. My mind was at one time so crowded by painful thoughts, that they shut out many others which are interesting to me; and among other things, I forgot once or twice, when I had an opportunity, to thank you, dear Mrs. Martin. I believe I should have taken advantage of your proposal, but papa said to me, 'If he criticises your manuscript in a manner which does not satisfy you, you won't be easy without defending yourself, and he might be drawn into taking more trouble than you have now any idea of giving him.' I sighed a little at losing such an opportunity of gaining a great advantage, but there seemed to be some reason in what papa said I have completed a preface and notes to my translation; and since doing so, a work of exactly the same character by a Mr. Medwin has been published, and commended in Bulwer's magazine.[14] Therefore it is probable enough that my trouble, excepting as far as my own amusement went, has been in vain. But papa means to try Mr. Valpy, I believe. He left us since I began to write this letter, with a promise of returning before Christmas Day. We do miss him. Mr. Boyd has made me quite angry by publishing his translations by rotation in numbers of the 'Wesleyan Magazine,' instead of making them up into a separate publication, as I had persuaded him to do. There is the effect, you see, of going, even for a time, out of my reach! The readers of the 'Wesleyan Magazine' are pious people, but not cultivated, nor, for the most part, capable of estimating either the talents of Gregory or his translator's. I have begun already to insist upon another publication in a separate form, and shall gain my point, I dare say. I have been reading Bulwer's novels and Mrs. Trollope's libels, and Dr. Parr's works. I am sure you are not an admirer of Mrs. Trollope's. She has neither the delicacy nor the candour which constitute true nobility of mind and her extent of talent forms but a scanty veil to shadow her other defects. Bulwer has quite delighted me. He has all the dramatic talent which Scott has, and all the passion which Scott has not, and he appears to me to be besides a far profounder discriminator of character. There are very fine things in his 'Denounced.' We subscribe to the best library here, but the best is not a good one. I have, however, a table-load of my own books, and with them I can always be satisfied. Do you know that Mr. Curzon has left Ledbury? We were glad to <b>receive</b> <b>your</b> <b>letter</b> from Dover although it told us that you were removing so far from us. Do let us hear of your enjoying Italy. Is there much English society in Rome, and is it like English society here? I can scarcely fancy an invitation card, 'Mrs. Huggin-muggin at home,' carried through the Via Sacra. I am sure my 'little hand' has done its duty to-day. I shall leave the corners to Henrietta. Give our kindest regards to Mr. Martin, and ever believe me, my dear Mrs. Martin, ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1847, Merewether was a strenuous {{opponent}} of the election of Renn Dickson Hampden as Bishop of Hereford.

Let me remind you that my order in question was given in obedience to yours assigning General Magruder to the command of a department (Trans-Mississippi), and directing him to report for instructions. Your order was positive and unconditional. I had no option, but was bound to obey it. If injustice has been done it was not by me. If an improper order has been given it is not mine. Mine, therefore, permit me to suggest, is not the one to be recalled or modified.Obedience to the order contained in your letter would place me in a false position in relation to Major-General Magruder and to the Army. I therefore respectfully ask you to recall it.Most respectfully, your obedient servant,J. E. JOHNSTON,General.|$|E
