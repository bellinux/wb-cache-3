The maximal <b>rate</b> of <b>torque</b> development and integrated EMG (percentage of total EMG burst) at peak <b>rate</b> of <b>torque</b> development during fast contractions were lower in elderly than young adults by 48 % (P < 0. 05) and 16. 5 % (P < 0. 05), respectively.

These age-related changes during fast voluntary contractions were accompanied by a decline (P < 0. 001) in motor unit discharge frequency (19, 28, and 34 % for first 3 interspike intervals, respectively) and in the percentage of units (45 %; P < 0. 05) that exhibited double discharges (doublets) at brief intervals (< 5 ms). Because aging decreased the maximal <b>rate</b> of <b>torque</b> development of fast voluntary contractions to a greater extent (approximately 10 %) than that of an electrically evoked twitch, collectively the results indicate that the age-related decline in maximal motor unit discharge frequency likely limit, in addition to the slowing of muscle contractile properties, the performance of fast voluntary contractions.

Methods: Thirty-one women volunteered to participate in the study and were assigned in one of the groups according to the number of falls over the 12 months that preceded the present Then, participants with no fall history (Cl; n = 13; 67. 6 [7. 5] years-old), one fall (GII; n = 8, 66 0 [4 91 years-old) and two or more falls (GIII, n = 10; 67. 8 [8. 8] years-old) performed a number of lower limb maximal isometric voluntary contractions from which peak <b>torque</b> and <b>rate</b> of <b>torque</b> development were quantified Findings. Primary outcomes indicated no peak torque differences between experimental groups in any lower limb joint. The <b>rate</b> of <b>torque</b> development of the knee flexor muscles observed in the non-fallers (Cl) was greater than that observed in the fallers (P < 0. 05) and had a significant relationship with the number of falls (P < 0 05) Interpretation.

50|$|The {{two main}} types of AC motors are {{classified}} as induction and synchronous. The induction motor (or asynchronous motor) always relies on a small difference in speed between the stator rotating magnetic field and the rotor shaft speed called slip to induce rotor current in the rotor AC winding.

In contrast, the synchronous motor does not rely on slip-induction for operation and uses either permanent magnets, salient poles (having projecting magnetic poles), or an independently excited rotor winding. The synchronous motor produces its <b>rated</b> <b>torque</b> at exactly synchronous speed.
