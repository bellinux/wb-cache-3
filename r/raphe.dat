5|$|The {{input to}} the {{hippocampus}} (from varying cortical and subcortical structures) {{comes from the}} entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures {{as well as with}} the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the <b>raphe</b> nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.|$|E
5|$|There {{are dozens}} of other {{chemical}} neurotransmitters {{that are used in}} more limited areas of the brain, often areas dedicated to a particular function. Serotonin, for example—the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids—comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the <b>raphe</b> nuclei. Norepinephrine, which is involved in arousal, comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus. Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.|$|E
5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or <b>raphe</b> (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E

5000|$|Diatoms are {{traditionally}} {{divided into two}} main groups that are primarily distinguished by frustule structures: the centrics and the pennates. Centric diatoms are radially symmetrically and are composed of upper and lower valves (epitheca and hypotheca); each consisting of a valve and a girdle band that can easily slide underneath each other and expand to increase cell content over the diatoms progression. The Centric diatom's cytoplasm is located along the inner surface of the shell and provides a hollow lining around the large vacuole located {{in the center of}} the cell. This large, central vacuole is filled by a fluid known as [...] "Cell sap" [...] which is similar to seawater but varies with specific ion content. The cytoplasmic layer is home to several organelles, like the chloroplasts and mitochondria. Before the Centric begins to expand, its nucleus can be found at the center of one of the valves and will begin to move towards the center of the cytoplasmic layer before division is complete. This type of diatom can be found with a variety of shapes and sizes which heavily depends on how which axis the shell extends from and if spines are added to the Centrics. Unlike Centric diatoms, Pennate diatoms are bilaterally not radially symmetric. Each one of their valves have openings that are slits along the <b>raphes</b> and their shells are typically elongated parallel to these <b>raphes.</b> They generate cell movement through cytoplasm that streams along the <b>raphes,</b> always moving along solid surfaces.|$|R

25|$|The periaqueductal gray is {{the gray}} matter located around the {{cerebral}} aqueduct within the tegmentum of the midbrain. It projects to the nucleus <b>raphe</b> magnus, and also contains descending autonomic tracts.

5000|$|It {{should be}} noted that some of the [...] "pain fibers" [...] in the ALS deviate from their pathway towards the VPL. In one such deviation, axons travel towards the reticular {{formation}} in the midbrain. The reticular formation then projects to a number of places including the hippocampus (to create memories about the pain), the centromedian nucleus (to cause diffuse, non-specific pain) and various parts of the cortex. Additionally, some ALS axons project to the periaqueductal gray in the pons, and the axons forming the periaqueductal gray then project to the nucleus <b>raphes</b> magnus, which projects back down to where the pain signal is coming from and inhibits it. This helps control the sensation of pain to some degree.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe {{bicuspid}} {{aortic valve}} (BAV) {{is the most}} common congenital heart defect. Children with BAV {{are more likely to have}} valve dysfunction and to require intervention during childhood. According to the subtype of BAV, the prognosis and the treatment may be different. ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of 3 D echocardiography (3 DE) in order to diagnose BAV and to depict accurately the leaflets morphology. Methods 40 consecutive children with suspicion of BAV were included in a prospective monocentric study. 2 DE and 3 DE views were recorded by the same investigator. Images were reviewed separately by two confirmed pediatric cardiologists in order to assess BAV. Then, we compared 2 DE and 3 DE for the description of the spatial position of cusps and <b>raphes.</b> The association with aortic aneurysms, aortic valve insufficiency or stenosis and other cardiac malformation were also reported. ResultsThe median age was 4. 8 years (± 7. 3). For 19 patients (47 %), 3 DE allows a better visualization of the leaflets morphology leading to a reclassification of the BAV. <b>Raphes</b> are better distinguished by 3 D live (sensitivity= 100 % [CI 95 %, 88 – 100], specificity= 100 % [CI 95 %, 67 – 100]) or biplane echocardiography (sensitivity= 96 % [CI 95 %, 80 – 99], specificity= 63 % [CI 95 %, 35 – 85]) than 2 DE (sensitivity= 86 % [CI 95 %, 62 – 96], specificity= 28 % [14 – 50]). Inter-observer variability is almost null. Conclusion 3 D live and biplane echocardiography is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis and the accurate description of BAV in children.

25|$|Sagittal {{division}} reveals more morphological distinctions. The <b>raphe</b> nuclei form a ridge in {{the middle}} of the reticular formation, and, directly to its periphery, there is a division called the medial reticular formation.

The lateral RF is close to the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, and mostly mediates their function.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the three basic seed parts, some seeds have an appendage, an aril, a fleshy outgrowth of the funicle (funiculus), (as in yew and nutmeg) or an oily appendage, an elaiosome (as in Corydalis), or hairs (trichomes). In the latter example these hairs {{are the source of}} the textile crop cotton. Other seed appendages include the <b>raphe</b> (a ridge), wings, caruncles (a soft spongy outgrowth from the outer integument {{in the vicinity of the}} micropyle), spines, or tubercles.|$|E
25|$|This {{effect of}} {{descending}} inhibition {{can be shown}} by electrically stimulating the periaqueductal grey area of the midbrain. The periaqueductal grey in turn projects to other areas involved in pain regulation, such as the nucleus raphes magnus which also receives similar afferents from the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis (NPG). In turn the nucleus <b>raphe</b> magnus projects to the substantia gelatinosa region of the dorsal horn and mediates the sensation of spinothalamic inputs. The periaqueductal grey also contains opioid receptors which explains one of the mechanisms by which opioids such as morphine and diacetylmorphine exhibit an analgesic effect.|$|E
40|$|A graph {{method was}} {{employed}} to analyse spatial neuronal patterns of pontine nuclei with ascending aminergic projections to the forebrain (nucleus centralis superior (NCS), <b>raphes</b> dorsalis (NRD) and locus coeruleus (LC)), in Alzheimer disease (AD), Huntington disease (HD), and vascular (VD) as well as “mixed‐type” (VA) dementia, compared with non‐demented controls (CO) and {{a small sample of}} brains from schizophrenics (“dementia praecox” (DP)). The quantitative evaluations by the “minimal spanning tree (MST) ” were complemented by rough neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) counts and by semiquantitative immunohistochemical assessment of amyloid deposition, neuritic plaque formation, and cellular gliosis. The AD cases showed a significant decline of neuronal density in all nuclei examined, as compared with controls and DP. Neuronal loss was not significant in VD, while the mixed cases with both vascular and Alzheimer‐type pathology exhibited pronounced changes of neuronal density. Amyloid deposition occurred almost exclusively in AD and VA, as a rule, being of moderate degree, except for two presenile AD cases where it was marked. NFT were significantly increased in all nuclei in AD and in the VA cases, while they only occasionally appeared beyond age 55 in HD, DP and CO. The four HD cases showed in the NCS and NRD neuronal loss as severe as in AD. This neuronal loss implicates impairment of serotoninergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation as one basic mechanism promoting dementia in AD, VA and perhaps in HD...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPax 6 {{has been}} implicated in {{cerebellar}} granule cell development, however the neonatal lethality of the Sey/Sey mutant has precluded a more detailed study of this late developing neuronal type. In this study we use experimental mouse chimeras made from wildtype and Pax 6 -null embryos to circumvent early lethality and assess the developmental potential of mutant cells {{in the construction of}} the cerebellum. We have identified the granule cell as a direct target of mutant gene action, with glia and Purkinje cells being affected in what is largely a non-cell autonomous manner. Most dramatically, in postnatal day 21 (P 21) chimeras, mutant cells are largely absent in the anterior and posterior cerebellum while present in central lobules, but amidst disorganized cerebellar architecture. Analysis of P 0 / 1 and P 10 chimeras demonstrates a profound temporally based defect where mutant cells colonize the anterior and posterior EGL but fail to migrate to the IGL. Mutant granule cells in the central lobules can reach the IGL in an abnormal manner, with large streams of cells forming <b>raphes</b> through the molecular layer. These studies provide new insights into the role of Pax 6 in postnatal cerebellar development that pinpoint the granule cell as an intrinsic target of the mutant gene and key events in the life of the developing granule cell that depend upon normal Pax 6 expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebellum}} is {{a highly}} conserved structure in the Central Nervous System (CNS) of vertebrates, and {{is involved in the}} coordination of voluntary motor behaviour. Supporting this function, the cerebellar cortex presents a layered structure which requires a precise spatial and temporal coordination of proliferation, migration and differentiation events. One of the characteristics of the developing cortex is the formation of the external granule cell layer (EGL) in the outermost part. The EGL {{is a highly}} proliferative transient layer which disappears when cells migrate inwards to form the inner granule cell layer. The balance between proliferation and migration leads to changes in EGL thickness, and might be related to "indentations" observed in the surface of the developing chick cerebellum. We have extended the observation of this feature to quail and mouse, supporting the idea that this phenomenon forms part of the mechanisms of cerebellar morphogenesis. Different factors involved in both mitotic activity and migration were analyzed in this study. Our results indicate that proliferation, more than formation of <b>raphes</b> for cell migration, is involved in the formation of indentations in the EGL. In addition, we show that vessels penetrating from the pial surface divide the EGL into regular regions {{at the time of the}} appearance of bulges and furrows. We conclude that indentations are the result of a coincidence in time of both the increase in thickness of the EGL and the establishment of the embryonic vascular pattern, which confers a characteristic transitory morphology to the surface of folia. 2. 856 JCR (2010) Q 2, 18 / 38 Developmental biolog...|$|R

25|$|The endocannabinoid system {{appears to}} play a {{significant}} role in the mechanism of action of clinically effective and potential antidepressants and may serve as a target for drug design and discovery. The endocannabinoid-induced modulation of stress-related behaviors appears to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of the serotoninergic system, by which cannabinoid CB1 receptors modulate the excitability of dorsal <b>raphe</b> serotonin neurons. Data suggest that the endocannabinoid system in cortical and subcortical structures is differentially altered in an animal model of depression and that the effects of chronic, unpredictable stress (CUS) on CB1 receptor binding site density are attenuated by antidepressant treatment while those on endocannabinoid content are not.|$|E
25|$|The reticular {{activating}} system {{consists of}} three groups of neurons in the brain stem: pedunculopontine nucleus, locus caeruleus and <b>raphe</b> nucleus. When awake, it receives all kinds of non-specific sensory information and relays them to the cortex. It also modulates fight or flight responses and is hence linked to the motor system. During sleep onset, it acts via two pathways. The first is the cholinergic pathway that clears the way for thalamocortical transmission; {{the second is the}} monoaminergic pathway (which starts in the upper brain and projects to the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex) that can cause wakefulness if inactive. It is also predicted {{to play a role in}} REM sleep by modulating muscle tone, causing the muscle atonia characteristic of REM sleep. During NREM sleep this system is blocked by the preoptic nucleus neurons.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{aimed to}} clarify the {{clinical}} anatomy of the pulmonary root. Background. Many descriptions of valvular anatomy {{have focused on the}} annulus, leading to varied interpretations of abnormal valves. Methods. Twenty-two heart specimens with isolated pulmonary valvular stenosis were examined to analyze the gross structure of the pulmonary root. For comparison, we examined a normal series of a similar age range together with nine adult hearts. Serial histologic sections were prepared from five specimens. Results. The normal pulmonary valve is enclosed in a proximal sleeve of free-standing right ventricular infundibulum supporting the fibroelastic walls of the pulmonary sinuses at the anatomic ventriculoarterial junction. The valvular leaflets are attached in semilunar fashion across this junction, delimiting the extent of the valvular sinuses. The stenotic valves were separated into dome-shaped valves, dysplastic valves and a third group of less typical cases. In the dome-shaped valves, which had a relatively circular origin of their leaflets, three <b>raphes</b> were tethered to the arterial wall at the sinutubular junction, producing a waistlike narrowing. The leaflets of the dysplastic valves were attached in a relatively normal semilunar fashion, but stenosis was caused by thickening of the leaflets at their free edges. Serial histologic sections through normal and abnormal valves failed to demonstrate any well defined fibrous “annulus” that could be of clinical relevance. Conclusions. Unlike the normal and the dysplastic valves, the dome-shaped valves have circular rather than semilunar lines of attachment of the valvular leaflets. Liberation of the fused zones of apposition of the leaflets within the dome is unlikely to restore such abnormal valves to normal structure, even if this procedure relieves the stenosis...|$|R
40|$|The afferent-efferent {{connections}} of {{the pigeon}} dorsomedial forebrain, which {{is composed of}} the "hippocampus" (Hp) and "parahippocampus" (APH), presumed homologues of the mammalian hippocampal complex, were studied. Afferent projections were identified by wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and efferent projections were identified by 3 H-proline and WGA-HRP. In addition to identified intrinsic connections within Hp and APH, both Hp and APH {{were found to be}} in receipt of ipsilateral forebrain afferents from each other, the hyperstriatum accessorium, nucleus of the diagonal band, nucleus taeniae, and area corticoidea dorsolateralis. Only Hp received input from the contralateral Hp while only APH received input from the ipsilateral hyperstriatum dorsale and archistriatum, pars ventralis. Both Hp and APH received ipsilateral diencephalic afferents from the nucleus mamillaris lateralis, stratum cellulare internum, nucleus lateralis hypothalami, and nucleus paramedianus internus thalami. Only APH received bilateral input from the nucleus superficialis parvicellularis (this nucleus may send a small projection to Hp) and nucleus dorsolateralis anterior thalami, pars medialis, and an ipsilateral projection from the nucleus subrotundus. Brainstem afferents to Hp and APH included ipsilateral projections from the area ventralis (Tsai) nucleus reticularis pontis oralis, nucleus <b>raphes,</b> nucleus subceruleus dorsalis, and nucleus centralis superior of Bechterew, and bilateral projections from the nucleus linearis caudalis and locus ceruleus, of which the nucleus subceruleus dorsalis, nucleus centralis superior of Bechterew, and locus ceruleus projected to APH only. Forebrain efferents from both Hp and APH were found to project ipsilaterally to the septum, the area of the fasciculus diagonalis Brocae, nucleus taeniae, and area corticoidea dorsolateralis. Only Hp appeared to send efferents to the contralateral septum and Hp, while only APH sent efferents to the hyperstriatum dorsale and the archistriatum. A hypothalamic projection from Hp and APH was found to partially terminate near the nucleus mamillaris lateralis. At the level of pathway connections, the results demonstrate a striking similarity between the avian dorsomedial forebrain and the dorsomedial cortex of reptiles and the mammalian hippocampus...|$|R
40|$|In the tecto-reticular {{system of}} plethodontid salamanders, ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -, glycine (gly) -, and {{glutamate}} (glu) -like immunoreactivity (ir) of neurons was studied. Combined tracing and immunohistochemical experiments {{were performed to}} analyze the transmitter content of medullary nuclei with reciprocal connections with the tectum mesencephali as well as tectal neurons with descending projections to the medulla oblongata. Immunogold double-labelling experiments for biocytin and GABA, glycine or 5 -HT were carried out to study synaptic contacts between medullary afferents and tecto-bulbar projection neurons in the tectum mesencephali. In the medulla oblongata, the distribution of transmitters differed significantly between the rostral and caudal part of the medulla; dual or triple localization of transmitters was present in somata throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the medulla. Regarding the rostral medulla, {{the largest number of}} GABA-, gly-, and glu-ir neurons was found in the medial zone. Neurons of the nucleus reticularis medius (NRM) retrogradely labeled by tracer application into the tectum revealed predominantly gly-ir, often colocalized with glu-ir. The NRM appears to be homologous to the mammalian gigantocellular reticular nucleus, and its glycinergic projection is mostlikely part of a negative feedback loop between the medulla and tectum. Neurons of the dorsal and vestibular nucleus projecting to the tectum were glu-ir, and neurons of the vestibular nucleus often revealed GABA- and/or gly-ir in addition. Regarding the caudal medulla, the highest densitiy of GABA-, gly- and glu-ir cells was found in the lateral zone. Differences in the neurochemistry of the rostral versus the caudal medulla correlate with the different projection patterns of these regions: Only nuclei of the rostral medulla are involved in the tecto-reticular system. In the tectum mesencephali, the distribution of transmitters differed significantly between the rostral/central and caudal part of the tectum; dual or triple localization of transmitters was present in somata throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the tectum. Regarding the rostral and central tectum, the largest number of GABA-, gly-, and glu-ir cells was found in the deep cellular layer 8 of the tectum mesencephali, which is characterized by a large amount of GABAergic interneurons. In contrast, in the caudal tectumthe distribution of single, dual or triple localization of transmitters is predominantly found in the superficial cellular layer 6 of the tectum. Differences in the neurochemistry of the rostral or central versus the caudal tectum appear to result from different functional processes by the representation of the visual field. The rostral and central tectum is mainly involved in the processes of object recognition and localization in the binocular field, whereas the caudal tectum processes visual information of the lateral monocular field. Neurons with descending projections to the ipsi- or contralateral medulla were predominantly localized in the cellular layer 6 of the tectum, and were mostly glu-ir. About 50 % of these neurons revealed additional GABA-ir. Type TO 2 and TO 4 projection neurons, the axons of which descend in the ventrolateral tract, were mainly glutamatergic, whereas many neurons of the type TO 1 and TO 3, the axons of which descend in the ventromedial tract, were immunoreactive for glutamate and GABA. The tectal inhibitory system consists of GABAergic tecto-bulbar projection neurons and a great amount of GABAergic interneurons. These GABAergic cells affect neighboring tectal projection neurons or interneurons via dendro-dendritic or axo-dendritic contacts and thus, are able to modulate intratectal processing of visual and multimodal input. These intratectal processes are influenced by glycinergic projections from the NRM or serotonergic afferents of the nuclei <b>raphes</b> (NR), which are involved in the control of vigilance and attention. Both nuclei most likely inhibit intratectal inhibitory interactions. This disinhibition results in a selective activation of tectal neurons involved in the processing of relevant objects (up-regulation). In addition, serotonergic afferents of the NR influence the tecto-bulbar transmission via direct inhibition of projection neurons (down-regulation). The results likewise underline the role of the NRM and NR in visual object selection and orientation, as suggested by behavioral studies and electrophysiological recordings from tectal neurons...|$|R
