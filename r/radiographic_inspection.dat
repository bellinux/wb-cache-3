Traditionally, <b>radiographic</b> <b>inspection</b> is time and manpower consuming.

40|$|Abstract: Radiographic {{simulation}} of thick components represents a particular challenge, since the Monte-Carlo methods generally applied to obtain accurate scattering predictions are inherently slow, {{and as such}} not suited to applications for inspection procedure qualification, where {{a large number of}} parameter variations has to be studied in a reasonable time. We present a generic radiographic modeling code, which overcomes this impediment by combining a Monte-Carlo approach with a simple straight-line attenuation model and an analytical film-foil model. The code MODERATO has been thoroughly validated and is now used to perform parametric studies for performance demonstration purposes. Introduction: When modeling <b>radiographic</b> <b>inspections</b> for thin components, scattered radiation can often be entirely ignored. In the intermediate thickness range, a commonly used approach accounts for scattered radiation with tabulated build-up factors, often obtained previously with Monte-Carlo codes. For these situations, straight line attenuation models are sufficient to obtain reasonably accurate results. Another approach which has recently attracted interest in th...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} in modelling <b>radiographic</b> <b>inspections</b> concerns the film characteristics as the last step in the radiographic modelling chain, throughout which the energy deposited by the incoming radiation is to be converted to a grey value. This conversion depends not only on the total dose absorbed by the film, but also on the radiation’s spectrum {{and to a lesser extent}} also on the incidence angle of the incoming radiation. Models trying to take all or most of these influential parameters into account inevitably lead to complex and proprietary film characterizations, and in particular require information generally not available in the film data sheets provided by the manufacturers. The recent EN 584 standard for the classification of film systems for industrial radiography proposes a pragmatic and in many cases sufficient classification in terms of the dose required to obtain optical density 2, and the gradient of an optical density vs. required dose at optical densities 2 and 4. In this paper, we discuss different ways to implement an EN 584 -compliant film model. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept for}} {{geological}} disposal of nuclear waste and {{spent nuclear fuel}} relies on a multi-barrier system with the copper/cast iron canister as the first barrier. The canister is designed to retain its integrity for at least 100000 years, which means that future glaciations need to be considered. A thick ice block together with hydrostatic pressure from groundwater would produce hydrostatic compressive stresses of maximum 44 MPa. A critical issue for {{the acceptance of the}} canister is to guarantee that it does not contain defects that may cause loss of integrity during design life time. <b>Radiographic</b> <b>inspections</b> of as-produced cast iron insert mock-ups of the canister were carried out to check the presence of manufacturing defects. Numerous indications were found {{both inside and outside the}} critical zone of tensile stresses. Mockups subjected to a hydrostatic compressive stress up to 130 MPa were inspected as well, and several cracks were detected in the deformed canister walls. The largest defects located in the zone of tensile stresses – slag inclusions and their agglomerates – were deemed to be critical for crack initiation. The inspection of the canisters by means of ultrasound is another useful test to assure the compliance with predefined acceptance criteria for critical defect sizes. Reliable ultrasoni...|$|R

40|$|Riveted lap joints made of two {{sheets of}} Glare ™ {{are known to}} develop cracks at the faying {{surfaces}} of aluminum sheets when subjected to cyclic axial constant amplitude loading (CAL).

Cracks have propagated from the rivet holes towards the lateral boundaries of the test specimen in the inner aluminum layers. High definition CR showed a similar quality and details of conventional X-ray radiography using (nondestructive technique) NDT film. However, when multiple cracks are detected, it is quite difficult to determine from which aluminum plate layer they have been propagated, because depth resolution is impossible with just one radiographic projection.

40|$|Abstract: The article {{describes}} the experimental procedures and results of <b>radiographic</b> and tomographic <b>inspections</b> in aircraft technology and geology. Turbine blade, made from TiAl alloys was investigated to reveal inhomogeneities that cannot be visualized by routine X-ray imaging. The alloy contains also about 1 % boron to increase ductility and crack resistance. This makes neutron imaging a highly suitable technique because boron has a high neutron absorption cross section. Neutron and X-ray imaging {{can be used as}} complementary methods in the nondestructive material inspection, because the attenuation properties of materials depend on the radiation and its energy. Another application focused on the 3 D visualization of internal structures of rock samples. The distribution of pore sizes and element distribution is demonstrated. Radiographic (thermal neutron and X-ray) and neutron tomographic investigations were carried out at the Atominstitut and Paul Scherrer Institute. Neutron inspections showed better contrast than X-ray due to the higher penetration ability for the inspections of thicker materials and their sensitivity to special isotopes.
