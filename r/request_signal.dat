40|$|This paper {{presents}} theoretical yet practical methodologies to model, assure and {{optimize the}} Reliability of Clockless Wave Pipeline. Clockless wave pipeline is a cutting-edge and innovative technology {{as an alternative}} to traditional pipeline, and a promising computing model towards ultra-high throughput and speed. The basic computational components of such clockless wave pipeline are data waves in association with <b>request</b> <b>signals</b> and switches. The key to the success of clockless wave pipeline is how to coordinate and ensure the processing of datawaves throughout the pipeline in association with the <b>request</b> <b>signals</b> without relying on any intermediate access points under clocked-control. Due to the complication of clockless operations, an efficient and effective method to model and analyze the confidence level (referred to as reliability or yield) of clockless operations of wave pipeline is exigently demanded, but has not yet been adequately addressed, in an integrated level such as datawaves in association with <b>request</b> <b>signals,</b> leaving this as a challenge. In this regard, out-of-orchestration between datawaves and <b>request</b> <b>signals,</b> referred to as datawave fault, is the major concern in assuring and optimizing the reliability of the system. This paper specifically addresses and resolves: extensive and practical clockless-induced datawavefault modeling; assurance and optimization; clockless-oriented fault tolerant design methods.

50|$|Asynchronous datapaths are {{typically}} encoded using several schemes. Robust schemes use two wires or 'rails' for each bit, called 'dual-rail encoding'. In this case, first rail is asserted to transmit a 0 value, or the second rail is asserted to transmit a 1 value. The asserted rail is then {{reset to zero}} before the next data value is transmitted, thereby indicating 'no data' or a 'spacer' state. A less robust, but widely used and practical scheme, is called 'single-rail bundled data'. Here, a single-rail (i.e. synchronous-style) function block can be used, with an accompanying worst-case matched delay. After valid data inputs arrive, a <b>request</b> <b>signal</b> is asserted as the input to the matched delay. When the matched delay produces a 'done' output, the block guaranteed to have completed computation. While this scheme has timing constraints, they are simple, localized (unlike in synchronous systems), and one-sided, hence are usually easy to validate.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fault tolerant design technique for the clockless wave pipeline. The specific architectural model investigated {{in this paper}} is the two-phase clockless asynchronous wave pipeline [10] which is ideally supposed to yield the theoretical maximum of performance. <b>Request</b> <b>signal</b> is the most critical component for the clockless-induced control of the wave pipelined processing of data. In practice, the <b>request</b> <b>signal</b> is very sensitive and vulnerable to electronic crosstalk noise, and this problem has become exteremely stringent for the ultra-high density integrated circuits today. Electronic noise may devastate the operational confidence level of the clockless wave pipeline. In this context, this paper characterizes the yield and reliability properties of the two-phase clockless asynchronous pipeline. Based on the yield characterization, a simple yet effective fault tolerance architecture and algorithm is proposed on the <b>request</b> <b>signal</b> lines as the most critical component for high confidence clockless asynchronous wave pipeline processing. A reliability model is developed to evaluate {{the effect of the}} <b>request</b> <b>signal</b> crosstalk noise, referred to as glitch.

30|$|Inspired by {{the concept}} of {{reservation}} busy tones which are used in [28 – 30] to effectively mitigate interference, we define the Coordination mechanism (CM) to control the CCI in the uncoordinated scenarios under study. Following our approach, the tagged femtocell user (FU) triggers the coordination of surrounding FBS by issuing an in-band <b>requesting</b> <b>signal</b> to advertise its presence. To achieve that, the victim user momentarily suspend its reception and transmit a <b>requesting</b> <b>signal</b> that surrounding interferers detect [5, 29]. Different from the original busy burst solution whereby detecting transmitters estimate their interference parcel from the received feedback; herein, surrounding femtocells only use the busy tone {{as an indication of}} the nearby victim receiver presence. To reduce the likelihood that multiple simultaneous requests trigger the coordination procedure, an interference margin can be introduced {{in order to reduce the}} sensitivity of potential interferers to the triggering criterion. The beacon power is maintained low so as to ideally restrict the group of detecting femtocells to the dominant set of interferers. It is also worth noting that any FBS that has already triggered the coordination procedure ignores further requests that may occur while transactions related to the first request are still ongoing.|$|R

30|$|To reduce {{unnecessary}} redundant packet transmission, a {{feedback channel}} is {{introduced to the}} uplink channel. If a user does not receive a frame successfully, a <b>request</b> <b>signal</b> {{will be sent to}} the base station for transmitting the redundant packet. However, this would incur enormous signaling overhead in the uplink when a dedicated feedback channel resource is allocated to an individual user. Instead, a common feedback channel can be employed for NACK feedback information from all users, as discussed in Section 2.1. In the common feedback channel, all users send an identical NACK signal through the common uplink channel resource without carrying the users’ identifications. In the implementation, the base station may reserve a radio resource unit as a common feedback channel. The base station will keep transmitting the redundant packets until no signal is detected over the common feedback channel. Immediately after transmitting Lmax redundant packets, the base station is allowed to transmit the subsequent video frame.|$|E
