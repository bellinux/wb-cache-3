50|$|There {{are also}} forms whose image {{consists}} {{of all but}} one of the positive integers. For example, {1,2,5,5} has 15 as the exception. Recently, the 15 and 290 theorems have completely characterized universal integral quadratic forms: if all coefficients are integers, then it <b>represents</b> <b>all</b> positive integers if and only if it <b>represents</b> <b>all</b> integers up through 290; if it has an integral matrix, it <b>represents</b> <b>all</b> positive integers if and only if it <b>represents</b> <b>all</b> integers up through 15.|$|R

40|$|In 1993, Conway {{formulated}} {{a remarkable}} conjecture regarding universal quadratic forms, i. e., integer-coefficient, positive-definite quadratic forms <b>representing</b> <b>all</b> positive integers.

5|$|In the Early Modern period, Aristotle came to <b>represent</b> <b>all</b> {{that was}} obsolete, scholastic, and wrong, not helped by his {{association}} with medieval theology.

5|$|LGBT, or GLBT, is an initialism {{that stands}} for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, {{the term is}} an {{adaptation}} of the initialism LGB, which was used to replace the term gay {{in reference to the}} LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s. Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately <b>represent</b> <b>all</b> those to whom it referred.|$|E

5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce {{spent the first}} few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to <b>represent</b> <b>all</b> factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E

5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly <b>represent</b> <b>all</b> his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, {{and the fact that}} there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E

5|$|As {{discussed}} above, in the PostgreSQL {{implementation of}} SQL, Null {{is used to}} <b>represent</b> <b>all</b> UNKNOWN results, including the UNKNOWN BOOLEAN. PostgreSQL does not implement the UNKNOWN literal (although it does implement the IS UNKNOWN operator, which is an orthogonal feature.) Most other major vendors {{do not support the}} Boolean type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL supports BOOLEAN however variables; these can also be assigned NULL and the value is considered the same as UNKNOWN.|$|E

50|$|The 290 theorem says a {{positive}} definite integral quadratic form is universal {{if it takes}} the numbers from 1 to 290 as values. A more precise version states that, if an integer valued integral quadratic form <b>represents</b> <b>all</b> the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 34, 35, 37, 42, 58, 93, 110, 145, 203, 290 , then it <b>represents</b> <b>all</b> positive integers, and {{for each of these}} 29 numbers, there is such a quadratic form <b>representing</b> <b>all</b> other 28 positive integers with the exception of this one number.|$|R

5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{full control}} over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition. The Social Democratic Party was banned and its assets seized. While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities, SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country. On 2 May 1933 all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested. Some were sent to concentration camps. The German Labour Front was formed as an umbrella organisation to <b>represent</b> <b>all</b> workers, administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of national socialism {{in the spirit of}} Hitler's Volksgemeinschaft ("people's community").|$|E
5|$|In December 1905 a mass {{meeting was}} held at the synagogue to protest massacres of Jews in Russia and mourn their deaths, and the {{congregation}} donated $500 to a fund for the sufferers. In March 1909 Orthodox groups held meetings there to organize opposition to the constitution and make-up of Judah Leon Magnes's Kehilla, an overarching organization intended to <b>represent</b> <b>all</b> of New York's Jews, which lasted until 1922. A mass meeting of local residents and businessmen to combat Lower East Side gangsters {{was held at}} the synagogue in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 20th century, a few Roman Catholics were appointed, but {{concerns}} about {{diversity of the}} Court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity, to <b>represent</b> <b>all</b> geographic regions of the country, as opposed to ethnic, religious, or gender diversity. The 20th century saw the first appointment of justices who were Jewish (Louis Brandeis, 1916), African-American (Thurgood Marshall, 1967), female (Sandra Day O'Connor, 1981), and Italian-American (Antonin Scalia, 1986). The 21st century saw the first appointment of a Hispanic justice (Sonia Sotomayor, 2009), if justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was a Sephardi Jew of Portuguese descent and appointed in 1932, is excluded.|$|E
