Methods: This was a retrospective observational study involving 208 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis enrolled in the Hospital Tuberculosis Control Program at the Institute for Thoracic Diseases, located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Between January of 2007 and October of 2010, the patients were treated with the rifampin-isoniazid-pyrazinamide (RHZ) regimen, whereas, between November of 2010 and June of 2013, the patients were treated with the rifampin-isoniazid-pyrazinamide-ethambutol FDC (RHZE/FDC) regimen. Data regarding tuberculosis recurrence and mortality in the patients studied were retrieved from the Brazilian Case Registry Database and the Brazilian Mortality Database, respectively. The follow-up period comprised two years after treatment completion. Results: The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure,</b> treatment abandonment, and death were 90. 4 %, 4. 8 %, and 4. 8 %, respectively. There were 7 cases of recurrence during the follow-up period. No significant differences in the recurrence rate were found between the RHZ and RHZE/FDC regimen groups (p = 0. 13).

50|$|By contrast, {{polyester}} resins {{are usually}} made {{available in a}} 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly.

The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst {{as well as by the}} temperature.|$|E

50|$|The {{chemical}} process of vulcanization {{is a type}} of cross-linking that changes rubber to the hard, durable material associated with car and bike tires. This process is often called sulfur curing; the term vulcanization comes from Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. This is, however, a slower process. A typical car tire is cured for 15 minutes at 150 °C. However, the time can be reduced by the addition of accelerators such as 2-benzothiazolethiol or tetramethylthiuram disulfide. Both of these contain a sulfur atom in the molecule that initiates the reaction of the sulfur chains with the rubber.

50|$|Radical perineal prostatectomy is a {{surgical}} procedure wherein the prostate gland is removed through an incision {{in the area}} between the anus and the scrotum (perineum). It is typically performed to remove early prostate cancer. Radical perineal prostatectomy is less commonly used than another surgery such as the open radical retropubic prostatectomy or the robot assisted laparoscopic radical retropubic prostatectomy. Lymph nodes can be sampled through the same incision, although this procedure is not common place in the U.S. at this time. When the cancer is small and confined to the prostate, radical perineal prostatectomy achieves the same <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> as the retropubic approach but less blood is lost and recovery is faster.

50|$|With the {{widespread}} use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the 'cancer poison' eventually spreads from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites ("metastasis"). This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan between 1871 and 1874. The use of surgery to treat cancer had poor results due to problems with hygiene. The renowned Scottish surgeon Alexander Monro saw only 2 breast tumor patients out of 60 surviving surgery for two years. In the 19th century, asepsis improved surgical hygiene and as the survival statistics went up, surgical removal of the tumor became the primary treatment for cancer. With the exception of William Coley who in the late 19th century felt that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> after surgery had been higher before asepsis (and who injected bacteria into tumors with mixed results), cancer treatment became dependent on the individual art of the surgeon at removing a tumor. The underlying cause of his results might be that infection stimulates the immune system to destroy left tumor cells. During the same period, the idea that the body was made up of various tissues, that in turn were made up of millions of cells, laid rest the humor-theories about chemical imbalances in the body.|$|E

50|$|Whilst some epoxy resin/ {{hardener}} combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, {{with temperatures}} up to 150 °C being common, {{and up to}} 200 °C for some specialist systems.

40|$|When {{malignant}} tumors {{were treated}} surgically, some cases which received palliative resections have been cured, while {{there have been}} those cases which, though opereted on at early periods, showed recurrence of the disease. In an effort to investigate on {{the difference in the}} results of treatment attributable to the period at which the operation was performed, the author performed a number of palliative resections on mice, to which malignant tumors (TAKTZAWA SARCOMA) had been experimentally transplanted, at different periods after transplantation. 1) Palliative resections performed on mice 2 weeks after transplantation of tumors attained excellent results, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> being by far the higher than the rate of the number of mice in which new growths could not be produced by transmission (the control) to the total number of mice to which transplantation was effected. 2) The result of palliative resections performed at different periods within 4 weeks after transplantation of tumors have revealed that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> of the mice that were operated on within 2 weeks after transplantation was low, and that the rate grew higher at each period {{toward the end of the}} 4 week-period. Generally speaking, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> of the mice whose tumors had shown comparatively slow growth was higher than that of the mice whose tumors had shown better growth: the former manifested higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> at comparatively early stages of development. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cure</b> of the mice whose weight had shown marked decrease or who had exhibited deterioration of general conditions was low, even though they were operated on at the later period. 3) The histopathological picture presented by the transplanted tumor showed the most vigorous growth and proliferation 10 days after transplantation. At the period more than 2 weeks after transplantation, regressive degeneration and necrosis of sarcomatous cells began to spread to the periphery of the tumor, while in the periphery, marked fibroplasia occurred and the tumor was covered with the connective tissue. On the other hand, the portion of a tumor that had not been removed by operation showed marked mesenchymal reaction at early periods, as compared with the transplanted tumor. 4) The results of the present investigations would indicate that the living animal tends to acquire immunity against a tumor in the course of its growth, and that the removal of a greater part of it by palliative resection enhances this power, so that the growth of the residual portion of the tumor is further deterred...|$|E

40|$|Propagation of {{the yeast}} prion [PSI+], a {{self-replicating}} aggregated form of Sup 35 p, requires Hsp 104. One model {{to explain this}} phenomenon proposes that, {{in the absence of}} Hsp 104, Sup 35 p aggregates enlarge but fail to replicate thus becoming diluted out as the yeast divide. To test this model, we used live imaging of Sup 35 p-GFP to follow the changes that occur in [PSI+] cells after the addition of guanidine to inactivate Hsp 104. After guanidine addition there was initially an increase in aggregation of Sup 35 p-GFP; but then, before the yeast divided, the aggregates began to dissolve, and after ≈ 6 h the Sup 35 -GFP looked identical to the Sup 35 -GFP in [psi+] cells. Although plating studies showed that the yeast were still [PSI+], this reduction in aggregation suggested that <b>curing</b> <b>of</b> [PSI+] by inactivation of Hsp 104 might be independent of cell division. This was tested by measuring the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> <b>of</b> [PSI+] cells in both dividing and nondividing cells. Cell division was inhibited by adding either alpha factor or farnesol. Remarkably, with both of these methods, we found that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> was not significantly affected by cell division. Thus, cell division is not a determining factor for curing [PSI+] by inactivating Hsp 104 with guanidine. Rather, curing apparently occurs because Sup 35 -GFP polymers slowly depolymerize in the absence of Hsp 104 activity. Hsp 104 then counteracts this curing possibly by catalyzing formation of new polymers...|$|R
