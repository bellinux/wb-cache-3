2500|$|The first {{significant}} gold <b>rush</b> <b>in</b> the United States was in Cabarrus County, North Carolina (east of Charlotte), in 1799 at today's Reed's Gold Mine. [...] Thirty years later, in 1829, the Georgia Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>in</b> the southern Appalachians occurred. It {{was followed by}} the California Gold <b>Rush</b> of 1848–55 <b>in</b> the Sierra Nevada, which captured the popular imagination. The California gold rush led directly to the settlement of California by Americans and the rapid entry of that state into the union in 1850. The gold <b>rush</b> <b>in</b> 1849 stimulated worldwide interest in prospecting for gold, and led to new <b>rushes</b> <b>in</b> Australia, South Africa, Wales and Scotland. Successive gold <b>rushes</b> occurred <b>in</b> western North America: Fraser Canyon, the Cariboo district and other parts of British Columbia, in Nevada, in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, eastern Oregon, and western New Mexico Territory and along the lower Colorado River.
