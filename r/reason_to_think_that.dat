5|$|Keith (Enrico Colantoni) is {{visited by}} Mindy O’Dell (Jamie Ray Newman), who {{tells him to}} {{investigate}} Dean O’Dell’s (Ed Begley, Jr.) death. Mac (Tina Majorino) is called in for tech support when an animal research lab is raided and a valuable monkey is stolen, and Mac asks Veronica for help. The researchers believe that a PETA-like organization, named PHAT, is responsible. At the PHAT meeting, Mac flirts with the group leader, Bronson, {{but there is no}} <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they’re guilty. Weevil invites Keith to investigate Dean O’Dell’s office, and he finds a 40-year-old bottle of scotch unopened. At the next PHAT meeting, Veronica is asked to take action for animal rights in any way she sees fit. Keith presents the bottle of scotch as evidence of a murder of Dean O’Dell. Back at the lab, Veronica notices a coworker being mean to the monkey researchers. After a slight hazing ritual, Veronica and Mac are accepted into the group. In order to impress the leader of the group, Veronica, Mac, and Parker (Julie Gonzalo) participate in a party.|$|E
25|$|While {{the murderer}} of Patrick's {{assistant}} {{was killed and}} immediately sent to heaven because he was forgiven by Patrick, future murderers were to be pardoned as Patrick would not be around to assure their forgiveness and ascent to heaven. There is, however, no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the events described actually occurred although they do provide insight into how the Brehons thought about their own law.|$|E
25|$|However, {{with the}} {{technological}} advances, {{the government has}} received the ability to invade privacy in more subtle ways; further, there is no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the rate of such technological advances will slow down. “Can {{it be that the}} Constitution affords no protection against such invasions of individual security?”, Brandeis asks. He answers that a clear negative answer is evident in Boyd v. United States.|$|E
40|$|For {{free will}} theorists, {{the problem of}} luck has been a {{constant}} source of consternation. Peter van Inwagen presents a version immune to even agent-causal conceptions of free will. However, van Inwagen’s version of the problem can be avoided if there are true propositions taking the form of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. There are good <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there are, and no comparably good <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there are not. This defense is also resistant to common attacks based on foreknowledge and the grounding of the truth of these counterfactuals...|$|R
5000|$|Thus, {{there are}} <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Cantor's {{infinite}} {{hierarchy of the}} infinites is superfluous.

25|$|Captain Turner gave {{evidence}} in Britain and now gave a more spirited defence of his actions. He argued that {{up until the}} time of the sinking he had no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> zig-zagging in a fast ship would help. Indeed, that he had since commanded another ship which was sunk while zig-zagging. His position was supported by evidence from other captains, who said that prior to the sinking of the Lusitania no merchant ships zig-zagged. Turner had argued that maintaining a steady course for 30minutes was necessary to take a four-point bearing and precisely confirm the ship's position, but on this point he received less support, with other captains arguing a two-point bearing could have been taken in five minutes and would have been sufficiently accurate.|$|E
25|$|In 1324, Odoric of Pordenone, a Franciscan missionary from Friuli, Italy, is {{believed}} {{by some to}} have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from Friuli, Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan, which is generally regarded as the first mass in the Philippines, by some 197 years. However, historian William Henry Scott concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil and, if he did, there is no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he celebrated mass.|$|E
25|$|August Weismann was {{responsible}} for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program because the old need to remove themselves from the theatre {{to make room for}} the next generation, sustaining the turnover that is necessary for evolution. This theory again has much intuitive appeal, but it suffers from having a teleological or goal-driven explanation. In other words, a purpose for ageing has been identified, but not a mechanism by which that purpose could be achieved. Ageing may have this advantage for the long-term health of the community; but that doesn't explain how individuals would acquire the genes that make them get old and die, or why individuals that had ageing genes would be more successful than other individuals lacking such genes. (In fact, there is every <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the opposite is true: ageing decreases individual fitness.) Weismann later abandoned his theory.|$|E
40|$|Are {{torture and}} torturers unforgivable? The article {{examines}} {{this question in}} the light of a Humean account of forgiveness. Initially, the Humean account appears to suggest that torturers are unforgivable.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} I explain Spinoza's concept of "infinite modes". After some brief {{background}} on Spinoza's thoughts on infinity, I provide <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Immediate Infinite Modes are {{identical to the}} attributes, and that Mediate Infinite Modes are merely totalities of finite modes. I conclude with some considerations against the alternative view that infinite modes are laws of nature...|$|R
25|$|The {{evidence}} available thus {{seems to}} indicate that the Indians of Robeson County who have been called Croatan and Cherokee are descended mainly from certain Siouan tribes of which the most prominent were the Cheraw and Keyauwee, but they probably included as well remnants of the Eno, and Shakori, and very likely some of the coastal groups such as the Waccamaw and Cape Fears. It is not improbable that a few families or small groups of Algonquian or Iroquoian may have cast their lot with this body of people, but contributions from such sources are relatively insignificant. Although there is some <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the Keyauwee tribe actually contributed more blood to the Robeson County Indians than any other, the name is not widely known, whereas that of the Cheraw has been familiar to historians, geographers and ethnologists {{in one form or another}} since the time of De Soto and has a firm position in the cartography of the region. The Cheraws, too, seem to have taken a leading part in opposing the colonists during and immediately after the Yamasee uprising. Therefore, if the name of any tribe is to be used in connection with this body of six or eight thousand people, that of the Cheraw would, in my opinion, be most appropriate.|$|E
500|$|The medieval {{churches of}} St Nicholas, Blakeney and St Margaret's, Cley, and the now ruined Blakeney friary, {{were not the}} first {{religious}} buildings in the area. An early church was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book at Esnuterle ("Snitterley" [...] was a former name for Blakeney, the current name first appearing in 1340), but the 11th-century church's location is unknown, {{and there is no}} <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it is {{on the site of the}} 'chapel'.|$|E
500|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known whether}} the medial pallium plays a similar role in even more {{primitive}} vertebrates, such as sharks and rays, or even lampreys and hagfish. [...] Some types of insects, and molluscs such as the octopus, also have strong spatial learning and navigation abilities, but these appear to work differently from the mammalian spatial system, so there is as yet no good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they have a common evolutionary origin; nor is there sufficient similarity in brain structure to enable anything resembling a [...] "hippocampus" [...] to be identified in these species. Some have proposed, however, that the insect's mushroom bodies may have a function {{similar to that of}} the hippocampus.|$|E

50|$|There {{are some}} <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Josephus' account overstates {{the role of}} the Pharisees. He reports {{elsewhere}} that the Pharisees did not grow to power until the reign of Queen Salome Alexandra (JW.1.110).

500|$|Televised {{presidential debates}} were reintroduced {{for the first}} time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first {{incumbent}} president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they [...] "gave the viewers <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Jimmy Carter had something to offer". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, [...] "There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration." [...] Ford also said that he did not [...] "believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union". In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner Max Frankel was visibly incredulous at the response. As a result of this blunder, and Carter's promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the Vietnam era during the presidential debates, Ford's surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls.|$|E

As I shall argue, recognising that artistic value is attributive goodness has important consequences for a number of debates in aesthetics...|$|R

40|$|In general, epistemic internalists {{hold that}} an individual’s {{justification}} for a belief is exhausted by her reflectively accessible reasons for {{thinking that the}} contents of her beliefs are true. Applying this to the epistemology of testimony, a hearer’s justification for beliefs acquired through testimony is exhausted by her reflectively accessible <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{the contents of the}} speaker’s testimony is true. A consequence of internalism is that subjects that are alike with respect to their reflectively accessible reasons are alike with respect to what they have justification to believe. Testimony should be thought no different: hearers that are alike with respect <b>to</b> reflectively accessible <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a speaker’s testimony is true are alike with respect to their justification for beliefs based upon that testimony. But it has been recently argued that this view faces powerful counterexamples. So the central question is this: assuming that a hearer can acquire justification to believe a proposition through the testimony of a speaker, can epistemic internalism provide the resources to explain how such justification is possible? My aim in this paper is to address these counterexamples, and in so doing, defend epistemic internalist accounts of testimony...|$|R
