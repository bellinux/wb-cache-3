50|$|After the war, Bourne {{began his}} {{political}} {{life as a}} member of the Rhode Island general assembly in 1789 and 1790. In 1799, Bourne was appointed to a committee to revise the state's militia laws. From 1783 to 1784, Bourne collected excise tax for Providence County. Then, between 1785 and 1789, he served as Justice of the Peace in Providence County. Bourne served on the federalist (pro-Constitution) committee which negotiated an end to William West's armed anti-federalist (Country Party) protest on July 4, 1788. In 1789, with the Reverend James Manning, Bourne petitioned Congress regarding <b>relief</b> <b>from</b> <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> imposed upon Rhode Island as a foreign nation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical analysis {{as to what}} extent countries {{have been able to}} recover revenue losses <b>from</b> <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> due to trade liberalization policies through indirect taxes. In contrast to the existing literature, we identify major trade liberalization policies and explore their revenue effects. Specifically, we investigate how revenues <b>from</b> <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> and consumption tax revenues change as a result over the course of GATT/WTO accession. Employing a robust difference-in-difference specification as well as non-parametric methods, our results reveal a substantial, statistically significant inverse relationship between GATT/WTO membership and <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> supporting concerns about revenue losses. At the same time, however, we find a significant increase in revenues from indirect taxes and VAT. Our findings indicate that countries joining GATT/WTO, including low income countries, have successfully substituted revenues <b>from</b> <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> with higher indirect taxes including VAT...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{panel of}} 97 mostly {{developing}} and transitional countries for the period 1990 - 2011, this paper explores fiscal implications of membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). Em-ploying robust difference-in-difference specifications as well as semi-parametric methods, we find that countries joining the WTO experience a decline in revenues <b>from</b> <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> between 0. 5 % and 1 % of GDP. Revenue losses <b>from</b> <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> are more than compensated for {{by an increase in}} consumption taxes. Although triggered by WTO accession, the shift towards consumption taxes, in particular to VAT, typically takes place before trade liberalization commitments result in declining tariff revenues...|$|R

40|$|The United States has {{a strong}} {{reputation}} for being {{at the forefront of}} space exploration. The commercial space industry in the United States is flourishing, yet the United States government is not effectively using its resources to help the industry. Currently, the United States government has some policies in place that promote the private space sector. Nonetheless, the government favors its own failing agency, NASA, by giving it extra benefits in the form of exemptions <b>from</b> <b>import</b> <b>duties.</b> Extending an exemption <b>from</b> <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> to the commercial space industry, however, would have several beneficial effects on the United States that the government should want to pursue: (1) production costs for producers would decrease, leading to lower costs for consumers and a more productive industry; (2) space “production” would increase and would help the United States keep its place {{at the forefront of the}} space community in the face of rapidly increasing competition; and (3) the United States would be better prepared for the innovative and sophisticated space endeavors that we are likely to see in the future. Following in the footsteps of other progressive nations by extending an <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> exemption, and shifting the focus from the public to the private sector, is a practical approach for the United States to bolster the commercial space industry and remain competitive with the rest of the world...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advancing}} general dismantiement of tariffs, it became progressively more obvious that, apart <b>from</b> <b>import</b> <b>duties,</b> {{there are a}} number of other obstacles for a free flow of international trade. There are numerous rules, regulations, and restrictive practices imposed and operated by government departments and semi-official bodies which exert a more or less strong influence on the volume, the directions, and the composition of foreign trade. Such measures designed to channel trade into desired directions are collectively known as non-tariff barriers (NTBs) ...|$|R
50|$|The raw {{materials}} and the auxiliary substances of industry were in many cases raised in price. The duties on salt and glass specially illustrated the bad results of the excise. New processes were hindered and routine made compulsory. The customs duties were still more restrictive of trade; as they practically excluded foreign manufactures, and were both costly and in many instances unproductive of revenue. As George Richardson Porter showed in Progress of the Nation (1851), the really profitable customs taxes were few in number. Less than a score of articles contributed more than 95% the revenue <b>from</b> <b>import</b> <b>duties.</b> The duties on transactions, levied chiefly by stamps, were ill-graded and lacking in comprehensiveness.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the decade}} {{leading up to}} 1786 the French had lost both their Canadian and Indian colonies, {{national}} debt had risen to excessively high levels, and many feared national bankruptcy was imminent.

Similarly, the British economy was highly inefficient. With a national debt of £250 million, an extreme black market (only 42% of the tea and 14% of the brandy imported paid the government-issued 119% duties imposed), and the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, William Pitt and the British government were eager to find common ground with their historic rivals in order to secure these [...] "greater opportunities." ...|$|R
