500|$|The Naval Technical Committee {{proposed}} to <b>reboiler</b> her in 1907 with new Belleville water-tube boilers, {{but this was}} forestalled by a plan to reuse those of the [...] Simultaneously a proposal to rearm her with four ten-inch guns in two turrets and several 6-inch guns in a new casemate {{was made by the}} Naval General Staff. This was estimated to cost 1,275,000 roubles and would only add [...] to her displacement, but both proposals were rejected by the Naval Technical Committee which believed it was a waste of money given her obsolete layout. The General Staff made another proposal in 1909 to rearm her as with smaller guns as a guardship intended to defend Sevastopol from attacks by enemy light forces. This was initially approved by the Navy Minister, Admiral Ivan Grigorovich in June 1909, but this was later reversed.|$|E
50|$|All five Class 10A {{locomotives}} {{were eventually}} <b>reboilered</b> with Watson Standard no. 1 boilers. Since the original {{difference between the}} Class 10A and Class 10B lay only {{in the fact that}} their respective boilers were constructed without or with superheaters, distinction between the two types became unnecessary after this <b>reboilering.</b> The <b>reboilered</b> Class 10A locomotives were therefore reclassified to Class 10BR along with similarly <b>reboilered</b> Class 10B locomotives.|$|R
50|$|All thirty Class 12B {{locomotives}} {{were eventually}} <b>reboilered</b> with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers. In the process, {{they were also}} equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, compared to the conventional vertical fronts of their original cabs. Upon <b>reboilering,</b> the unknown original reason for the separate classification was ignored and instead of becoming Class 12BR, the <b>reboilered</b> locomotives were reclassified to Class 12R along with the <b>reboilered</b> Class 12 locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Their {{original}} Belpaire boilers were {{fitted with}} Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with Pop safety valves. An obvious {{difference between an}} original and a Watson Standard <b>reboilered</b> locomotive is usually a rectangular regulator cover just {{to the rear of}} the chimney on the <b>reboilered</b> locomotive. In the case of <b>reboilered</b> Class 14A locomotives, two even more obvious differences are the Watson cab and the absence of the Belpaire firebox hump between the cab and boiler on the <b>reboilered</b> locomotives.|$|R
500|$|Although {{small size}} units, mostly made of glass, {{can be used}} in laboratories, {{industrial}} units are large, vertical, steel vessels [...] (see images 1 and 2) known as [...] "distillation towers" [...] or [...] "distillation columns". [...] To improve the separation, the tower is normally provided inside with horizontal plates or trays as shown in image 5, or the column is packed with a packing material. [...] To provide the heat required for the vaporization involved in distillation and also to compensate for heat loss, heat is most often added {{to the bottom of the}} column by a <b>reboiler,</b> and the purity of the top product can be improved by recycling some of the externally condensed top product liquid as reflux. [...] Depending on their purpose, distillation columns may have liquid outlets at intervals up the length of the column as shown in image 4.|$|E
500|$|Large-scale {{industrial}} fractionation towers use reflux {{to achieve}} more efficient separation of products. Reflux {{refers to the}} portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation tower that is returned to {{the upper part of the}} tower as shown in images 3 and 4. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and partial condensation of the upflowing vapors, thereby increasing the efficacy of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided, the better is the tower's separation of the lower boiling from the higher boiling components of the feed. [...] A balance of heating with a <b>reboiler</b> at the bottom of a column and cooling by condensed reflux at the top of the column maintains a temperature gradient (or gradual temperature difference) along the height of the column to provide good conditions for fractionating the feed mixture. Reflux flows at the middle of the tower are called pumparounds.|$|E
500|$|Distillation towers (such as {{in images}} 3 and 4) use various vapor and liquid {{contacting}} methods {{to provide the}} required number of equilibrium stages. Such devices {{are commonly known as}} [...] "plates" [...] or [...] "trays". [...] Each of these plates or trays is at a different temperature and pressure. [...] The stage at the tower bottom has the highest pressure and temperature. Progressing upwards in the tower, the pressure and temperature decreases for each succeeding stage. The vapor–liquid equilibrium for each feed component in the tower reacts in its unique way to the different pressure and temperature conditions at each of the stages. That means that each component establishes a different concentration in the vapor and liquid phases at each of the stages, and this results in the separation of the components. [...] Some example trays are depicted in image 5. [...] A more detailed, expanded image of two trays {{can be seen in the}} theoretical plate article. [...] The <b>reboiler</b> often acts as an additional equilibrium stage.|$|E

50|$|An obvious {{difference}} between an original and a Watson Standard <b>reboilered</b> locomotive is usually a rectangular regulator cover, just {{to the rear of}} the chimney on the <b>reboilered</b> locomotive. In the case of the Class 15B and Class 15BR, two even more obvious differences are the Watson cab and the absence of the Belpaire firebox hump between the cab and boiler on the <b>reboilered</b> locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s, many serving {{locomotives}} were <b>reboilered</b> with {{a standard}} boiler type, designed by Watson {{as part of his}} standardisation policy. Such Watson Standard <b>reboilered</b> locomotives were reclassified by adding an [...] "R" [...] suffix to their classification.|$|R
500|$|An {{alternative}} to continuous distillation is batch distillation, where {{the mixture is}} added to the unit {{at the start of the}} distillation, distillate fractions are taken out sequentially in time (one after another) during the distillation, and the remaining bottoms fraction is removed at the end. [...] Because each of the distillate fractions are taken out at different times, only one distillate exit point (location) is needed for a batch distillation and the distillate can just be switched to a different receiver, a fraction-collecting container. [...] Batch distillation is often used when smaller quantities are distilled. [...] In a continuous distillation, each of the fraction streams is taken simultaneously throughout operation; therefore, a separate exit point is needed for each fraction. [...] In practice when there are multiple distillate fractions, the distillate exit points are located at different heights on a fractionating column. The bottoms fraction can be taken from the bottom of the distillation column or unit, but is often taken from a <b>reboiler</b> connected to the bottom of the column.|$|E
2500|$|Laboratory scale distillations {{are almost}} {{exclusively}} run as batch distillations. The device used in distillation, {{sometimes referred to}} as a still, consists at a minimum of a <b>reboiler</b> or pot in which the source material is heated, a condenser in which the heated vapour is cooled back to the liquid state, and a receiver in which the concentrated or purified liquid, called the distillate, is collected. Several laboratory scale techniques for distillation exist (see also [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|This unique 0-6-0T {{locomotive}} {{dates from}} 1885 {{and is the}} only engine on the line to have been built by Dübs and Company, of Glasgow; purchased to tackle the steep gradients of the Foxdale Railway she was ideally suited to the job. [...] After the merger in 1905 she was numbered 15 in the Isle of Man Railway fleet (having previously been Manx Northern's No. 4) and only saw sporadic use, most notably on Ramsey Cattle Mart specials and for snow clearing trains. [...] She was <b>reboiler</b> in 1923, receiving the first boiler on the IMR to carry [...] "Ross" [...] pop safety valves. [...] When the Marquess of Ailsa took over operations in 1967 she was repainted into spring green livery and saw service once again until 1968. By 1975 she had been painted into Manx Northern colours and placed in the then new museum at Port Erin where she remained until 1993 when she was returned to Douglas by road for steam feasibility tests. [...] By 1995 she was the star of the show, operating on the 1 in 12 gradients of the Snaefell Mountain Railway as part of the centenary celebrations. [...] This had historical precedent as Caledonia had been leased for construction purposes in 1895. [...] She has since been part of the stable of serviceable locomotives, having been painted into a non-prototypical blue livery in 1999 but reverted to the intricate original paint scheme in 2007. [...] The locomotive {{was the subject of a}} major rebuild from 2009 and returned to service in January 2013. [...] She was last in service in 2014 and is currently stripped down undergoing boiler work, unlikely to see service until 2016. The boiler was sent to the Severn Valley Railway in January 2016 to be repaired.|$|E

50|$|Proper <b>reboiler</b> {{operation}} {{is vital to}} effective distillation. In a typical classical distillation column, all the vapor driving the separation comes from the <b>reboiler.</b> The <b>reboiler</b> receives a liquid stream from the column bottom and may partially or completely vaporize that stream. Steam usually provides the heat required for the vaporization.|$|E
50|$|Thermosyphon {{reboilers}} (Image 2) do {{not require}} pumping of the column bottoms liquid into the <b>reboiler.</b> Natural circulation is obtained by using the density difference between the <b>reboiler</b> inlet column bottoms liquid and the <b>reboiler</b> outlet liquid-vapor mixture to provide sufficient liquid head to deliver the tower bottoms into the <b>reboiler.</b> Thermosyphon reboilers (also known as calandrias) are more complex than kettle reboilers and require more attention from the plant operators. There are many types of thermosyphon reboilers including vertical, horizontal, once-through or recirculating.|$|E
