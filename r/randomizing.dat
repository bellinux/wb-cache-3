Bounds checking can prevent buffer overflows, but requires additional code and processing time. Modern operating systems use a variety of techniques to combat malicious buffer overflows, notably by <b>randomizing</b> the layout of memory, or deliberately leaving space between buffers and looking for actions that write into those areas ("canaries").|$|E
25|$|Herd {{immunity}} {{is often}} accounted for when conducting cost–benefit analyses of vaccination programs. It {{is regarded as}} a positive externality of high levels of immunity, producing an additional benefit of disease reduction that would not occur had no herd immunity been generated in the population. Therefore, herd immunity's inclusion in cost–benefit analyses results in more favorable cost-effectiveness or cost–benefit ratios and {{an increase in the number}} of disease cases averted by vaccination. Study designs done to estimate herd immunity's benefit include recording disease incidence in households in which a member was vaccinated, <b>randomizing</b> a population in a single geographic area to be vaccinated or not, and observing disease incidence before and after a vaccination program is introduced. From these, it can be observed that disease incidence may decrease to a level beyond what can be predicted from direct protection alone, indicating that herd immunity contributed to the reduction. When serotype replacement is accounted for, it lessens the predicted benefits of vaccination.|$|E

2500|$|The game's main {{theme is}} morality, {{and it is}} the game in the series with the largest focus on philosophy; Uchikoshi intends to have the player's [...] "way of thinking, values, [...] virtues" [...] shaken {{intensely}} while they play the game. The [...] "dilemma" [...] in the game's title reflects this, as the game asks the player whether choices they make are the right thing to do. Another main theme is identity, and how people try to figure out who they are. This came from Uchikoshi's personal struggles with identity issues: he said that he is [...] "always thinking about who [...] " [...] and that he thinks he might have a multifaceted personality; his characters, like him, deal with this issue. Among other major themes are [...] "multiple-probability histories", with the player being able to move between different equally probable histories depending on the choices they have made; and the big effects small coincidences can have, which was reflected in the use of <b>randomizing</b> events. The idea to include randomization came from how Uchikoshi wanted to [...] "spoiler-proof" [...] the game, and felt that FAQ websites that tell players how to beat the game make playthroughs uninteresting. He had always been fascinated by the concept of coincidences, and how actions done in the past lead up [...] "where we are today", so he did a lot of research and reading on the topic to prepare writing the story. The theme of no absolute good or evil came from Buddhist literature Uchikoshi had read, particularly the Zen Buddhist idea of [...] "shiki soku zeku", which he described as [...] "matter is void and form is emptiness". Because of this idea, Uchikoshi tried to give each character [...] "their own sense of personal justice that they believe to be true", resulting in characters with different philosophies who play off each other.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Randomized</b> {{clinical}} trials that enroll patients in critical or emergency care (acute care) setting are challenging because of narrow time windows for recruitment {{and the inability}} of many patients to provide informed consent. To assess the extent that recruitment challenges lead to <b>randomized</b> clinical trial discontinuation, we compared the discontinuation of acute care and nonacute care <b>randomized</b> {{clinical trials}}. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of 894 <b>randomized</b> clinical trials approved by six institutional review boards in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada between 2000 and 2003. SETTING: <b>Randomized</b> clinical trials involving patients in an acute or nonacute care setting. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We recorded trial characteristics, self-reported trial discontinuation, and self-reported reasons for discontinuation from protocols, corresponding publications, institutional review board files, and a survey of investigators. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 894 <b>randomized</b> clinical trials, 64 (7 %) were acute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials (29 critical care and 35 emergency care). Compared with the 830 nonacute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials, acute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials were more frequently discontinued (28 of 64, 44 % vs 221 of 830, 27 %; p = 0. 004). Slow recruitment was the most frequent reason for discontinuation, both in acute care (13 of 64, 20 %) and in nonacute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials (7 of 64, 11 %). Logistic regression analyses suggested the acute care setting as an independent risk factor for <b>randomized</b> clinical trial discontinuation specifically {{as a result of}} slow recruitment (odds ratio, 4. 00; 95 % CI, 1. 72 - 9. 31) after adjusting for other established risk factors, including nonindustry sponsorship and small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials are more vulnerable to premature discontinuation than nonacute care <b>randomized</b> clinical trials and have an approximately four-fold higher risk of discontinuation due to slow recruitment. These results highlight the need for strategies to reliably prevent and resolve slow patient recruitment in <b>randomized</b> clinical trials conducted in the critical and emergency care setting...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective: The use of <b>randomized</b> consent designs {{has been}} subject of methodologic and ethical controversy. In most Western countries, {{research}} ethics committees {{make the decision}} as to whether a <b>randomized</b> consent design can be applied. The purpose of the study is to assess to what extent a <b>randomized</b> consent design and a modification of this design is accepted by research ethics committees, in terms of ethics, health law, and methodology. Methods: A postal survey was conducted among members of research ethics committees in the United Kingdom, and in The Netherlands, with professional competence in ethics, (health) law, methodology, or clinical practice. Results: In both the UK and in The Netherlands, the modified <b>randomized</b> consent design appears to be statistically significantly more acceptable than the <b>randomized</b> consent design, with respect to ethical and judicial aspects. The overall rejection rate of the <b>randomized</b> consent design was 66 % in the UK and 59 % in The Netherlands. However, the modified <b>randomized</b> consent design was rejected by 47 and 41 % in the two countries, respectively. Conclusion: the modified <b>randomized</b> consent design appears to be more acceptable than the <b>randomized</b> consent design. To increase consistency in the way research ethics committees handle study protocols, a discussion about the use of <b>randomized</b> consent designs appears necessary. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Randomized</b> {{controlled}} trials {{provide the}} best method of determining which of two comparable treatments is preferable. Unfortunately, contemporary <b>randomized</b> trials have become increasingly expensive, complex and burdened by regulation, {{so much so that}} many trials are of doubtful feasibility. Discussion Here we present a proposal for a novel, streamlined approach to <b>randomized</b> trials: the "clinically-integrated <b>randomized</b> trial". The key aspect of our methodology is that the clinical experience of the patient and doctor is virtually indistinguishable whether or not the patient is <b>randomized,</b> primarily because outcome data are obtained from routine clinical data, or from short, web-based questionnaires. Integration of a <b>randomized</b> trial into routine clinical practice also implies that there should be an attempt to <b>randomize</b> every patient, a corollary of which is that eligibility criteria are minimized. The similar clinical experience of patients on- and off-study also entails that the marginal cost of putting an additional patient on trial is negligible. We propose examples of how the clinically-integrated <b>randomized</b> trial might be applied in four distinct areas of medicine: comparisons of surgical techniques, "me too" drugs, rare diseases and lifestyle interventions. Barriers to implementing clinically-integrated <b>randomized</b> trials are discussed. Conclusion The proposed clinically-integrated <b>randomized</b> trial may allow us to enlarge dramatically the number of clinical questions that can be addressed by randomization. </p...|$|R
