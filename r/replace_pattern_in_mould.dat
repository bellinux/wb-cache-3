40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} {{termination}} is decidable for rewrite systems that contain shallow and right-linear rules, collapsing rules, and rightground rules. This class of rewrite systems is expressive enough to include interesting rules. Our proof uses {{the fact that}} this class of rewrite systems is known to be regularity-preserving and hence the reachability and joinability problems are decidable. Decidability of termination is obtained by analyzing the nonterminating derivations. 1 Introduction Term rewriting systems are Turing-complete models of computation that specifyrules for <b>replacing</b> certain <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> terms by equivalent, in some cases simpler, other terms. Simpler models of computation result by imposing additionalconstraints on the form of terms in a rewrite system. For instance, if variables are not allowed, we get ground term rewrite system, which have been extensivelystudied, mainly via mapping them to tree automata [2]. More complex models of computation arise by allowing restricted variable occurrences in the term rewritesystem (or the tree automata transitions) ...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a halftone-based watermarking approach for designing image barcodes (i.e., data-embedded halftones). First, regular clustered-dot screening {{is applied to}} transform the input contone image into a clustered-dot halftone comprising individual halftone cells. The properties of dot profile patterns are exploited to select embeddable halftone cells. We propose a screen column-shift method for embedding data by <b>replacing</b> different halftone <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> each embeddable cell. Finally, to enhance the image quality, a modified direct binary search framework is integrated with the proposed method.

Intrinsic diamond cantilevers were fabricated using a bottom up approach which consists of a selective growth of diamond <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> micro-machined silicon <b>moulds.</b> They were then coated with {{a thin layer of}} boron doped diamond to allow electrochemical immobilization of DNA on their surface. DNA was attached onto the measuring cantilever using a four-step electrochemical process involving diazonium salt grafting on diamond surface. The DNA immobilization was validated by cyclic voltammetry and fluorescence imaging. DNA denaturation was detected by comparing the resonance frequency shift of the measuring diamond cantilever against that of a reference cantilever when adding the denaturing agent in the solution.

40|$|A {{microinjection}} {{moulding machine}} {{was used to}} obtain micromouldings of polyoxymethylene, in order to study morphology development during the process. The method of design of experiments was used to investigate statistically the effects of processing variables on the microstructural features of the mouldings. The morphological features were identified by microtoming the samples in both transverse and longitudinal (flow) directions and observing the microtomed sections under a polarised light microscope. Morphology evolution along the flow direction was followed by microtoming the specimens along the centre plane longitudinally and sequentially. A five-layer skin core structure was identified for micromoulded polyoxymethylene. The development of the structure was explained, based on mechanisms which {{were similar to those}} proposed for conventional injection moulding. Injection speed was found to be the most significant factor affecting morphological features of the final moulding. Moreover, the average plunger velocity, which {{is directly related to the}} cavity filling flow rate, was found to have good correlation with skin layer thickness. The distributions of crystalline polymorphs were observed and explained, in light of the distributions of the flow and thermal <b>patterns</b> <b>in</b> the <b>mould.</b> Morphology evolution along the flow direction reflected the distribution of pressure, temperature and velocity of the polymer melt during the microinjection moulding process.

40|$|In the {{continuous}} casting of steel, the Submerged Entry Nozzle (SEN), {{in particular the}} SEN geometry, has a primary influence on the flow pattern: the SEN controls the speed, direction and other characteristics of the jet entering the mould. The SEN is however relatively inexpensive to change (in comparison with other continuous casting equipment). Thus; there is a feasible incentive to exactly understand and predict the flow of molten steel through the SEN and into the <b>mould,</b> <b>in</b> order to maximise {{the quality of the}} steel by altering the design of the SEN. By changing the SEN geometry and SEN design, the flow <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> the <b>mould</b> will also change: it is thus possible to obtain an optimum SEN design if (or when) the desired flow patterns and/or certain predetermined temperature distributions are achieved. Expensive and risky plant trials were traditionally utilised to “perfect” continuous casting processes. As opposed to the plant trials, this dissertation is concerned with the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of the SEN and mould, which, when used in conjunction with the Mathematical Optimiser LS-OPT, will enable the optimisation of the SEN design to achieve desired results. The CFD models are experimentally verified and validated using 40 %-scaled (designed and built in-house) and full-scale water model tests. This dissertation proves that the CFD modelling of the SEN and mould can be quite useful for optimisation and parametric studies, especially when automated model generation (geometry, mesh and solution procedures) is utilised. The importance of obtaining reliable and physically correct CFD results is also emphasised; hence the need for CFD model verification using water modelling.

Considering the extreme A + T-richness of this genome (G + C = 22 %), {{there is a}} {{surprising}} degree of codon usage variation among genes. For example, G + C content at silent sites varies from less than 10 % to greater than 30 %. It was previously suggested [Warrick, H. M. and Spudich, J. A. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16 : 6617 - 6635] that highly expressed genes contain fewer 'optimal' codons than genes expressed at lower levels. However, {{it appears that the}} optimal codons were misidentified. Multivariate statistical analysis shows that the greatest variation among genes is in relative usage of a particular subset of codons (about one per amino acid), many of which are C-ending. We have identified these as optimal codons, since (i) their frequency is positively correlated with gene expression level, and (ii) there is a strong mutation bias in this genome towards A and T nucleotides. Thus, codon usage in D. discoideum can be explained by a balance between the forces of mutational bias and translational selection...|$|R

In the technique of evaporative patterns, the process of mould filling with molten metal (the said mould holding inside a polystyrene pattern) is interrelated with the process of thermal decomposition of this pattern. The transformation of an evaporative pattern (e. g. made from foamed polystyrene) from the solid into liquid and then gaseous state occurs {{as a result of the}} thermal effect that the liquid metal exerts onto this pattern. Consequently, at the liquid metal-pattern-mould phase boundary some physico-chemical phenomena take place, which until now have not been fully explained. When the pattern is evaporating, some solid and gaseous products are evolved, e. g. CO, CO 2, H 2, N 2, and hydrocarbons, e. g. styrene, toluene, ethane, methane, benzene [16, 23]. The process of polystyrene <b>pattern</b> evaporation <b>in</b> foundry <b>mould</b> under the effect of molten metal is of a very complex nature and depends on many different factors, still not fully investigated.

40|$|Continuous caster moulds are {{the last}} and most {{important}} stage in the steelmaking process, where inclusions can either be generated or removed. With increasing casting speed using conventional immersion nozzles critical problems, such as unstable bulk mould flow have been noticed. Mould flux entrapment due to vortex and shearing action from the oscillating surface waves have become of particular concern. It is therefore necessary to have a calm inlet flow {{at the entrance of}} the mould. Recently, it has been acknowledged that a swirl blade placed at the upstream of the immersion nozzle effectively resolves the problems arising from unstable bulk mould flow. Therefore, to increase the knowledge of effect of swirling flow on the flow <b>pattern</b> <b>in</b> the <b>mould,</b> fundamental mathematical models of a billet mould equipped with a swirl blade in the nozzle have been developed. The model was used to study the effect of divergent angle of the immersion nozzle and mould aspect ratio on the flow field and temperature distribution inside billets moulds. Data from water model experiments were used to verify the mathematical model predictions. A fairly good agreement was found between physical modeling data and predictions, which ensured that the numerical model is reliable. Thereafter, the differences between square and round billet moulds were studied. Next, the effect of changing aspect ratio of the rectangular mould on the fluid flow and heat transfer, while keeping mould surface area constant, was studied. Two types of immersion nozzles, bottomless and conventional, were also analyzed during the research. The model moulds were changed gradually from a square billet with an aspect ratio of 1 x 1 to a rectangular billet with an aspect ratio of 3 x 1. First, the temperature and velocity distributions were calculated. Later, unsteady calculations were done to determine velocity fluctuations on the meniscus level for two types of nozzles and several moulds geometries. QC 20101110 </p...|$|R
