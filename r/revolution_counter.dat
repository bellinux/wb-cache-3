50|$|Under-reading of 300rpm on the Jaeger <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> was a {{contributing}} factor in over-stressing the engines during the race.|$|E
50|$|Numbers are entered using slides (one slide per digit) on {{the side}} of the device. The <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> and result counter appear on the top. A single turn of the crank adds the input number to the result counter, at any position, and {{increments}} the <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> accordingly. Pulling the crank upwards slightly before turning performs a subtraction instead of an addition. Multiplication, division, and other functions require a series of crank and carriage-shifting operations.|$|E

50|$|The {{assault on}} the Typhoon Cannon is successful. The cannon is {{destroyed}} and Korvus is killed. Yet, the allies bicker. With the destruction and collapse of the Typhoon Cannon, {{there is now a}} giant breach in Widow's Wall. Alec Chase of the Liberation front wishes to advance further into the base, but Monhk Erdene of the Shadow <b>Revolution</b> <b>counters</b> that their coalition has captured the Siege Cortex and that further advance into the base {{is not part of the}} mission.|$|R

50|$|The larger Type II Curta, {{introduced}} in 1954, has eleven digits for data entry, an eight-digit <b>revolution</b> <b>counter,</b> and a fifteen-digit result counter. It weighs 13.15 oz, based on weighing serial number 550973, produced in early 1966.|$|E
50|$|A {{particularly}} large speedometer (a quick-reading five inch dial), matching engine <b>revolution</b> <b>counter,</b> and ten inch headlights were supplied {{as part of}} {{the complete}} kit for the coachbuilder. The large headlights were supported by braced mountings included in the kit.|$|E
5000|$|Marxist {{historian}} Albert Prago criticizes Graham Kelsey {{for using}} anarchist newspapers as his principal {{source of information}} on collectives when newspapers were all openly partisan at the time. Frank Mintz accuses Peirats of being [...] "bereft of critical capacity." [...] Burnett Bolloten, however, has been praised by both Frank Mintz and Noam Chomsky for objective scholarship in his book The Spanish Civil War: <b>Revolution</b> and <b>Counter</b> <b>Revolution.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} of the A7 h-tron quattro is also intentionally very similar to other A7 variants, except the system splash screens include the h-tron logo, and where the <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> would be on a normal A7, there is the efficiency counter, in a suitable green and orange color scheme.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Corbitt led efforts to {{accurately}} measure and certify long distance road race {{courses in the}} United States. The technique, {{based on the work}} of John Jewell of Great Britain, used a calibrated bicycle wheel in conjunction with a <b>revolution</b> <b>counter.</b> This method is still used today.|$|E

50|$|The {{cabin is}} made from steel and glass fibre and its top is detachable. All windows are made from safety glass and the side windows {{as well as the}} {{windscreen}} are openable. There are seats for driver and two passengers; the driver's seat is adjustable. The gauge panel is comprehensive, including a <b>revolution</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Instruments {{are usually}} a basic set given {{the size of}} the panel. It {{consists}} of variometer, altimeter, speed indicator in the top line and two smaller engine instruments below (<b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> and valve head temperature indicator). Custom upgrades can be of different kind usually providing communication radios, different GPS devices, integrated engine instruments, Hobbs meter, ELT or turn indicators.|$|E
50|$|The Curta {{was also}} favored by both {{commercial}} and general-aviation pilots, {{before the advent}} of electronic calculators, because of both its precision and the user's ability to confirm the accuracy of his or her manipulations via the <b>revolution</b> <b>counter.</b> Because calculations such as weight and balance are critical for safe flight, precise results free of pilot error are essential.|$|E

The front head cowl conceals a set of functional clocks that provide motorcycle speed, engine <b>revolution</b> <b>counter,</b> odometer and fuel gauge. The Wind 125 retails for P54,000.|$|E
50|$|The {{dashboard}} instrumentation includes speedometer with odometer, <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> and gauges showing oil pressure, fuel, {{cooling water}} temperature, air pressure of both circuits and ammeter. There are lamps for oil pressure, indicators, alternator charging, differential interlock engagement, air pressure system warning, parking brake engagement and engine overheating indicator, and switches for headlights, heater and ventilation, windscreen wipers, indicators, differential interlock, hand throttle and engine shutdown; the models with tandem axle are also equipped with tandem lifting and lowering switches.|$|E
50|$|A Speed Meteor Twenty {{version was}} {{announced}} 21 July 1932. The compression ratio was increased to 6.8 : 1, a downdraught carburettor fitted {{and an extra}} large exhaust pipe with special Pullswell silencer. Although a choice of bodywork was available this was a special sports 4-seater with air cushions (for the seats) stone guards for lamps, remote gear change control, extra large faces on the speedometer and <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> and Rudge-Whitworth special wire wheels. This Speed model was fitted with a single-plate clutch, 4-speed gearbox with quiet third gear and a central remote control.|$|E

50|$|The over {{engine mounted}} entire steel made cabin is hinged from its front end {{and can be}} tilted forward in 20 seconds by a {{hydraulic}} system operated by a hand pump. There are seats for driver and one passenger. The steering wheel can be adjusted in range of 7 cm forward and backward. The 220 cm wide cabin {{is equipped with a}} full length and 50 cm wide bed placed behind the seats and fastened to the chassis from three points. The instrumentation includes an electrically operated speedometer and a <b>revolution</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{ensure the}} Bug hit its target, a {{mechanical}} system was devised that would track the aircraft's distance flown. Before takeoff, technicians determined {{the distance to}} be traveled relative to the air, taking into account wind speed and direction along the flight path. This was {{used to calculate the}} total number of engine revolutions needed for the Bug to reach its destination. When a total <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> reached this value a cam dropped down which shut off the engine and retracted the bolts attaching the wings, which fell off. The Bug began a ballistic trajectory into the target; the impact detonated the payload of 180 lb of explosives.|$|E

Two cast blocks of three; twin overhead camshafts {{driven by a}} vertical shaft and gears {{from the front of}} the engine; four valve per cylinder (24 in total), 60 degrees included angle. Camshafts castings split horizontally. Pivoted cam followers carried by bronze mountings. Crankshaft in three pieces carried in four large ball bearings; plain big ends. Drilled aluminum pistons - a first for Sunbeam racing car. Dry sump lubrication with two oil pumps - one for the bearings and the other for the camshafts. Mounted on sub-frame articulated with the chassis. Single Bosch magneto ignition driven at ¾ engine speed. Twin CZS Claudel Hobson carburettors mounted on two water-jacketed induction manifolds. Compression ration 5.8:1, 152 bhp at 3,200 rpm. Two speed gearbox was tried but four speed gearbox with cone clutch generally used; Hotchkiss drive with bevel back axle. <b>Revolution</b> <b>counter</b> driven by the camshaft.|$|E

50|$|The two engines {{selected}} for this test were a 38 and a 22-h.p., having a bore and stroke, respectively, of 124 by 130 mm. and 96 by 130 mm. They were bolted {{down to the}} test bench close together {{in one of the}} large engine testing shops at the Daimler Works. The section of the shop in which they were placed was railed off and under the sole charge and observation of the R.A.C. officials {{from the start of the}} test to the finish. The observers kept watch day and night just as on board a ship, and periodically tested the <b>revolution</b> <b>counters</b> and spring balances to ensure that the engines were always running under full load. Every possible precaution was taken to keep constant and close observation upon the test, and there were never less than two observers on duty.|$|R
