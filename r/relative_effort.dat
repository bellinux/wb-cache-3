Twenty-two older adults were assigned to either a training group (TG; n= 12, 73. 4 +/- 3. 9 yr) or a non-training control group (CG; n= 10, 70. 9 +/- 9. 6 yr). TG participated in a 7 -week individualized walking interval training at intensities progressing from 50 to 100 % of ventilatory threshold (T (VE)). Aerobic fitness [maximal oxygen uptake (V O(2 max)) and T (VE) ], preferred walking speed (PWS), gross and net C(w) (GC(w) and NC(w), respectively) and <b>relative</b> <b>effort</b> (%V O(2 max)) at PWS measured before training (PWS(1)) were assessed prior and following the intervention. All outcomes were measured on a treadmill. Significant improvements in GC(w) (- 8 %; P= 0. 007), NC(w) (- 12 %; P= 0. 003), <b>relative</b> <b>effort</b> (%V O(2 max) : - 12 %; P 0. 71). V O(2 max) and T (VE) remained unchanged in both groups (P> 0. 57). Changes in GC(w) at PWS(1) (difference between GC(w) at PWS(1) measured pre and post intervention) were inversely correlated with changes in PWS (difference between pre and post PWS; r=- 0. 67; P= 0. 02). The decreased C(w) at PWS(1), with no concomitant improvement in aerobic fitness, represents the main contributing factor for the reduction of the <b>relative</b> <b>effort</b> at this speed. This also allows elderly people to increase their PWS post training. Therefore, the present walking training may be an effective way to improve walking performance and delay mobility impairment in older adults...|$|E

Specifically, we present a contest model of a college basketball game to identify the winners, losers, and social welfare consequences of point-shaving corruption in mens NCAA basketball as an example of participation in illicit activities. It is shown that, under reasonable conditions, such activities lower the level of social welfare derived from college basketball play by reducing aggregate efforts in a game and distorting <b>relative</b> <b>efforts</b> across teams. We then examine the economic incentives of a player to point-shave and discuss player-types that are at a relatively high risk of engaging in point-shaving corruption. Private and public mechanisms to minimize corruption are compared in terms of efficiency, and a differential honesty premium is derived and discussed as an efficient way for the NCAA to decrease the incidence of player corruption. ...|$|R

Examination of other considerations such as the possible roles of possum migration and heterogeneities in possum population density suggest that each control strategy may be superior under different field conditions.

40|$|We {{critically}} discuss John Roemer’s normative {{criterion of}} equal opportunity and advance opportunity dominance {{as an alternative}} criterion {{for the evaluation of}} policies. For Roemer, strict equality of opportunity obtains when people, irrespectively of circumstances beyond their control, have the same ability to achieve advantage through their free choices. To implement this idea, Roemer sorts people with similar circumstances into types and takes their free choices to be represented by their behaviour relative to other members of the same type or, as Roemer calls it, by their ‘relative effort’. He then proposes that society should maximize the average advantage of all those whose circumstances cause them to be least well–off relative to others who have expended the same degree of <b>relative</b> <b>effort.</b> We argue that typing and the <b>relative</b> <b>effort</b> metric conflate the factors for which we do and do not want to hold individuals responsible, whenever these factors are statistically correlated. Moreover, Roemer’s rule for policy selection burdens the concept of equal opportunity with foreign distributive principles. Pointing to an inconsistency in Roemer’s argument, we also note that his selection rule violates his own requirement of Pareto-optimality. In response to these difficulties, we advance the criterion of opportunity dominance which is Pareto optimal, maintains conceptual purity and does not conflate the factors for which individuals should and should not be held responsible. This criterion determines a set of candidate policies that are undominated in opportunity and from which a final policy must be selected by additional, conceptually distinct principles of distributive justice...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMost {{viviparous}} squamates are lecithotrophic, {{and maternal}} effort during pregnancy mainly involves behavioural and thermoregulatory shifts to optimize developmental conditions. Still, pregnancy also imposes specific metabolic {{demands on the}} female, known as the metabolic cost of pregnancy (MCP). Contrary to the thermoregulatory shift, these energy constraints should be directly fecundity dependent and their evaluation is important to assess the 'costs' of viviparity. We measured the metabolic rate of aspic vipers Vipera aspis at three stages (early pregnancy, late pregnancy and post parturition), and we examined the determinants of maternal metabolic changes over time. We found a 55 % metabolic increase {{over the course of}} pregnancy that was better explained by maternal <b>relative</b> reproductive <b>effort</b> (<b>relative</b> litter mass) when compared with absolute estimates (litter mass, litter size). After parturition, female metabolism dropped below values recorded at early pregnancy and this decrease was closely related to maternal <b>relative</b> reproductive <b>effort.</b> Our estimates for MCP ranged from 13. 9 to 14. 7 % of maternal metabolic rate, suggesting that specific energetic demands of pregnancy are significant. It appears crucial to consider both direct (MCP) and indirect (thermoregulatory shift) components to evaluate overall maternal metabolic demand during pregnancy. Because females are already emaciated at the onset of pregnancy, these combined constraints are likely costly by inducing structural protein mobilization and altered performances after parturition...|$|R

In a way, {{this seems to be}} comparable to ecotaxation: An incentive provides for the lack of altruistic behavior to do what is best for all.

Unfortunately, chances are low of fitting complex indicator systems with rather simple measures of current fiscal relations and their structural conditions. Specifically, we show that sustainable development indicators suffer four fundamental problems if applied to fiscal relations. All four are arising from the fact that highly diverse information must be condensed into one single form of information to give the incentive: money. " [author's abstract...|$|R
