2500|$|The Blab-off was a wired {{remote control}} created in 1952 that turned a TV's sound {{on or off}} so that viewers could avoid hearing commercials.

It was much too cumbersome for the average user to program, but it received rave reviews from those who could.

40|$|The <b>remote</b> welding <b>equipment</b> {{for nuclear}} fuel bundle {{fabrication}} in a hot-cell {{was designed and}} developed. To achieve this, a preliminary investigation of hands-on fuel fabrication outside a hot-cell was conducted with {{a consideration of the}} constraints caused by the welding in a hot-cell. Some basic experiments were also carried out to improve the end-plate welding process for nuclear fuel bundle fabrication. The resistance welding equipment using end-plate welding was also improved. It was found that the remote resistance welding was more suitable for joining an end-plate to end caps in a hot-cell. This paper presents an outline of the developed welding equipment for nuclear fuel bundle fabrication and reviews a conceptual design of <b>remote</b> welding <b>equipment</b> using a master-slave manipulator.

In 1971, while he was working with Boeing in Huntsville, Alabama, Paraskevakos demonstrated a transmitter and receiver that provided additional ways to communicate with <b>remote</b> <b>equipment,</b> however it did not yet have general purpose PDA applications in a wireless device typical of smartphones. They were installed at Peoples' Telephone Company in Leesburg, Alabama and were demonstrated to several telephone companies.

Some of these shows were merely showings of Spanish and Mexican musical films, which were major attendance draws at the time; other were live act shows which Gilbert first announced, and later became a promoter of. Gilbert would do partial live airings of the first show of any show run (first via telephone line, which was unheard of at the time, then using <b>remote</b> <b>equipment),</b> verbally describing the movie if a film was being shown. These partial airings would almost guarantee sell out crowds for the other performances. Gilbert {{would also be a}} pioneer of radio contests and giveaways in Puerto Rico.|$|E
