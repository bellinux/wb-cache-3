40|$|The <b>remote</b> welding <b>equipment</b> {{for nuclear}} fuel bundle {{fabrication}} in a hot-cell {{was designed and}} developed. To achieve this, a preliminary investigation of hands-on fuel fabrication outside a hot-cell was conducted with {{a consideration of the}} constraints caused by the welding in a hot-cell. Some basic experiments were also carried out to improve the end-plate welding process for nuclear fuel bundle fabrication. The resistance welding equipment using end-plate welding was also improved. It was found that the remote resistance welding was more suitable for joining an end-plate to end caps in a hot-cell. This paper presents an outline of the developed welding equipment for nuclear fuel bundle fabrication and reviews a conceptual design of <b>remote</b> welding <b>equipment</b> using a master-slave manipulator.

Some of these shows were merely showings of Spanish and Mexican musical films, which were major attendance draws at the time; other were live act shows which Gilbert first announced, and later became a promoter of. Gilbert would do partial live airings of the first show of any show run (first via telephone line, which was unheard of at the time, then using <b>remote</b> <b>equipment),</b> verbally describing the movie if a film was being shown. These partial airings would almost guarantee sell out crowds for the other performances. Gilbert {{would also be a}} pioneer of radio contests and giveaways in Puerto Rico.|$|E
