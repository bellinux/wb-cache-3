50|$|Opened in 1953 with a <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>call</b> {{between the}} Postmasters-General of New Zealand and Great Britain, it {{operated}} until 1993 {{when it was}} closed down and stripped.|$|E
50|$|December: During the Melbourne Olympic Games, {{a record}} amount of traffic was sent over Australia's {{international}} telecommunications channels. 9,408,254 words were sent over 22 leased channels which operated for some 5465 hours. 6730 <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>calls</b> were handled and 2296 phototelegrams were sent. 285 hours of radio broadcasts were sent over R/T channels.|$|R
50|$|On May 10, 2006, the FCC began Auction 65, {{which sold}} off the 4 MHz of {{spectrum}} over which <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>calls</b> were made, and required AirFone to revise its equipment {{within two years}} of the auction's conclusion on June 2, 2006. Instead of the narrowband approach, with dedicated uplink and downlink for each call, Verizon is required to move its operations to a 1 MHz slice which is expected to provide substantially higher call volume and quality.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the voice}} call [...] "Mayday", SOS was the Morse code {{equivalent}} of the Mayday call. In 1927, the International Radiotelegraph Convention of Washington adopted the voice call Mayday as the <b>radiotelephone</b> distress <b>call</b> {{in place of the}} SOS radiotelegraph (Morse code) call.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the situation in}} Europe, receiver licensing in Canada never {{had much to do with}} the funding of broadcasts. Before 1952, Canadian law required the licensing of all radio receivers, not just those for tuning in broadcasts. In 1952 the Radio Act was amended to exempt broadcast-only receivers from licensing, and the Department of Transport (DOT) was given authority to exempt other receiver types from licensing as it saw fit. DOT exempted all [...] "home-type" [...] receivers capable of receiving any radio communications other than [...] "public correspondence" [...] (a term defined as [...] "radio transmissions not intended to be received by just anyone but rather by a member of the public who has paid for the message" [...] - examples include ship-to-shore <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>calls</b> or car-phone transmissions). After 1952, licences were required in Canada only for general coverage shortwave receivers with single-sideband capability, and VHF/UHF scanners which could tune to the maritime or land mobile radiotelephone bands.|$|R
5000|$|A U.S. air-ground {{radiotelephone}} transmits a {{radio signal}} in the 849 to 851 megahertz range; this signal {{is sent to}} either a receiving ground station or a communications satellite depending {{on the design of}} the particular system. [...] "Commercial aviation air-ground radiotelephone service licensees operate in the 800 MHz band and can provide communication services to all aviation markets, including commercial, governmental, and private aircraft." [...] If it is a call from a commercial airline passenger <b>radiotelephone,</b> the <b>call</b> is then forwarded to a verification center to process credit card or calling card information. The verification center will then route the call to the public switched telephone network, which completes the call. For the return signal, ground stations and satellites use a radio signal in the 894 to 896 megahertz range.|$|R
