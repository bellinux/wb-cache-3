5|$|Peace did {{not last}} for long, as the {{political}} turmoil in Baghdad continued. In September 941, Ibn Ra'iq assumed once more the post of amir al-umara {{at the invitation of}} Caliph al-Muttaqi (r. 940–944), but he was not as powerful as before. Unable to stop the advance of another strongman, Abu'l-Husayn al-Baridi of Basra, both Ibn Ra'iq and the caliph were forced to abandon Baghdad and seek the help of the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul. The latter soon had Ibn Ra'iq assassinated (April 942) and succeeded him as amir al-umara with the laqab of Nasir al-Dawla. Al-Ikhshid used the opportunity to reoccupy Syria for himself, joining his forces in person in June 942, and venturing as far as Damascus, before returning to Egypt in January 943. The Hamdanids also staked claim on Syria at the same time, but the sources do not <b>record</b> <b>details</b> of their expeditions there. Nasir al-Dawla's position as amir al-umara also proved to be weak, and in June 943 he was ousted by the Turkish general Tuzun. In October, Caliph al-Muttaqi, fearing that Tuzun intended to replace him, fled the capital and sought refuge with the Hamdanids. Although Nasir al-Dawla and his brother Sayf al-Dawla sheltered the caliph, they also did not confront Tuzun's troops, and in May 944 they reached an agreement that gave Upper Mesopotamia and northern Syria to the Hamdanids in exchange for recognizing Tuzun's possession of Iraq. Nasir al-Dawla sent his cousin al-Husayn ibn Sa'id to take over the Syrian provinces allotted to him in this agreement. The Ikhshidid forces either defected or retreated, and al-Husayn swiftly took over the districts of Qinnasrin and Hims.|$|E

25|$|Early bridges were {{vulnerable}} to floods, and in 1309 many bridges were washed away or damaged by severe winter floods, including Hethbeth Bridge. In 1683 the same bridge was partially {{destroyed by a}} flood that also meant {{the loss of the}} bridge at Newark. Historical archives often <b>record</b> <b>details</b> of the bridge repairs that followed floods, as the cost of these repairs or pontage had to be raised by borrowing money and charging a local toll.|$|E
25|$|In the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP), {{participants}} are informed {{that they will}} receive tasks to complete while watching a video on a television screen. They are given a response sheet in order to <b>record</b> <b>details</b> of the tasks when the appropriate cues appear in the video. A distractor task is given {{at a certain point}} in order to test for prospective memory. Titov and Knight (2001) used a PRVP with a video consisting of a pedestrian walking through a shopping district and required participants to make decisions on whether to buy certain items {{as if they were the}} pedestrian. Shopping requires many prospective memory intentions such as remembering what items are needed and what items can be purchased another day.|$|E

500|$|Garnet's recent {{interrogation}} {{was only}} the first of many. [...] Generally, his answers were carefully considered and demonstrated a passive resistance to his questioners; {{the use of the}} rack was a distinct possibility, one which he answered with [...] "Minare ista pueris [...] ". [...] What information he did give up was of limited interest only. His jailer, a man named Carey, was employed by Waad to gain the priest's trust, offering to relay letters to his nephew in the Gatehouse Prison. [...] Carey then placed Garnet into a cell containing a hole through which he was able to converse with Oldcorne, who was in a neighbouring cell. [...] From [...] "a place which was made for this precise purpose", two government eavesdroppers were therefore able to <b>record</b> <b>details</b> of conversations between the two priests. Their communications were mostly innocent, although Garnet's admission that on one occasion he drank too much wine was later used against him, along with other incriminating evidence recorded during their stay. His communications with his nephew, and Anne Vaux, were also intercepted. Most of these letters found their intended recipient, but not before they had first been read by Waad, who also kept Salisbury informed. Although Garnet told Vaux that the Council's evidence constituted nothing but [...] "presumptions", insufficient for a state trial, early in March he confessed, possibly as a result of torture. Vaux too was arrested and interrogated twice, just as further questions were being asked of Garnet by the council and the king, the latter interested in his opinion on theological matters.|$|E
