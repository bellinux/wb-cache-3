Supra-annular prosthesis implantation can facilitate mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> with a larger prosthesis in children with a small annulus, but little is known about its effect on the outcomes of mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> {{in young children}}. MethodsOne hundred eighteen children underwent mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> at 5 years of age or younger from 1976 – 2006. Mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> was supra-annular in 37 (32 %) patients. ResultsSurvival was 74 % ± 4 % at 1 year and 56 % ± 5 % at 10 years but improved over time (10 -year survival of 83 % ± 7 % from 1994 – 2006). Factors associated with worse survival included earlier mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> date, age less than 1 year, complete atrioventricular canal, and additional procedures at mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement,</b> but not supra-annular mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement.</b> As survival improved during our more recent experience, the risks of supra-annular mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> became apparent; survival was worse among patients with a supra-annular prosthesis after 1991. A pacemaker was placed in 18 (15 %) patients within 1 month of mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> and was less likely in patients who had undergone supra-annular mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement.</b> Among early survivors, freedom from redo mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> was 72 % ± 5 % at 5 years and 45 % ± 7 % at 10 years.

Moreover, for patients under 35, the failure rate is nearly 100 % within 5 years of the valve replacement surgery. The significant numbers of patients suffering from AV dysfunction, shortcomings to currently available valve substitutes, and the market demands for <b>replacement</b> <b>valves</b> has prompted increasing interest in the study of AV biomechanics. A fundamental study of the AV structure-function biomechanics is presented in this thesis. The mechanical behaviour of the AV is characterised at the tissue level, and the associated microstructural mechanisms established. In addition to the experiments, in depth mathematical models are developed and presented, to explain the observed experimental data and elucidate the micromechanics of the AV constituents and their contribution to the tissue behaviour. Tissue-level results indicate that the AV shows ‘shear-thinning’ behaviour, as well as anisotropic time-dependent characteristics. The microstructural experimental data indicates that there is no direct translation of tissue level mechanical stimuli to the ECM, implying that strain transfer is non-affine. Modelling micro-structural mechanics has confirmed that collagen fibres do not need to become fully straight before they contribute to load bearing, while the elastin network has been shown to contribute to load bearing even at high strains, further exacerbating the non-linear stress-strain relationship of the valve. The structural mechanisms underlying time-dependent behaviour of the tissue can be explained at the fibre level, stemming from fibre sliding and the dissipative effects arising due to fibre-fibre and fibre-matrix frictional interactions, suggesting a unified structural mechanism for both the stress-relaxation and creep phenomena. These outcomes contribute to an improved understanding of the physiological biomechanics of the native AV, and may therefore assist in optimising the design processes for substitute valves and selecting appropriate materials to effectively mimic the native valve function. Understanding AV micromechanics also helps quantify the mechanical environment perceived by the residing cells, which can have significant implications for cell-mediated tissue engineering strategies.

40|$|ObjectiveCongenital {{heart valve}} disease {{is one of}} the most common {{abnormalities}} in children. There are limited technological solutions available for treating children with congenital heart valve diseases. The aim of this study is to provide the details of the consensus reached in terms of pediatric definitions, design approach, in vitro testing, and clinical trials, which may be used as guidance for developing prosthetic heart valves for the pediatric indication. MethodsIn stark contrast to the various designs of adult-sized <b>replacement</b> <b>valves</b> available in the market, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) –approved prosthetic heart valves available for use in the pediatric population. There is a pressing need for FDA-approved pediatric valve devices in the United States. The pediatric patient population has been typically excluded from replacement heart valve trials for several reasons. In January 2010, heart valve manufacturers and pediatric clinicians collaborated with academicians and FDA staff in a workshop to suggest ways to successfully evaluate pediatric prosthetic valves and conduct pediatric clinical trials to provide acceptable heart valve replacement options for this patient population. ResultsRecommendations, derived from ISO 5840 : 2005 and the 2010 FDA Draft Replacement Heart Valve Guidance, are provided for hydrodynamic, durability, and fatigue testing. ConclusionsThe article specifically addresses in vitro and premarket and postmarket approval clinical studies that should be considered by a heart valve manufacturer for obtaining regulatory approval of pediatric sizes of prosthetic heart valve designs that are already approved for adult clinical use...|$|E
40|$|One {{percent of}} infants {{are born with}} {{congenital}} heart disease (CHD), which commonly involves outflow tract (OFT) defects. These infants often require complex surgeries, which are associated with long term adverse remodeling effects, and receive <b>replacement</b> <b>valves</b> with limited strength, biocompatibility, and growth capability. To address these problematic issues, researchers have carried out investigations in valve development and valve mechanics. A longstanding hypothesis is that flow-induced forces regulate fibrous valve development, however, the specific mechanisms behind this mechanotransduction remain unclear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to implement an in vitro system of outflow tract development to test the response of embryonic OFT tissues to fluid flow. A dynamic, three-dimensional bioreactor system was used to culture embryonic OFT tissue under different levels of flow as well as the absence of flow. In the absence of flow, OFT tissues took on a more primitive phenotype that is characteristic of early OFT cushion development where widely dispersed mesenchymal cells are surrounded by a sparse, disorganized extracellular matrix (ECM). Whereas OFT tissues subjected to physiologically matched flow formed compact mounds of cells, initated,fibrous ECM development, while prolonged supraphysiological flow resulted in abnormal tissue remodeling. This study indicates that both the timing and magnitude of flow alter cellular processes that determine if OFT precursor tissue undergoes normal or pathological development. Specifically, these experiments showed that flow-generated forces regulate the deposition and localization of fibrous ECM proteins, indicating that mechanosensitive signaling pathways are capable of driving pathological OFT development if flows are not ideal...|$|E

We attempted to determine the survival in patients who had had aortic <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> after 2 previous CABG procedures. We describe 12 patients who had aortic <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> for aortic stenosis; rather than one previous CABG operation, all had had 2 previous CABG procedures.

40|$|ObjectivesThe Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 {{cardiac surgery}} risk {{models have been}} {{developed}} for heart valve surgery with and without coronary artery bypass grafting. The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 cardiac risk models in Chinese patients undergoing single valve surgery and the predicted mortality rates of those undergoing multiple valve surgery derived from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 risk models. MethodsA total of 12, 170 patients underwent heart valve surgery from January 2008 to December 2011. Combined congenital heart surgery and aortal surgery cases were excluded. A relatively small number of valve surgery combinations were excluded. The final research population included the following isolated heart valve surgery types: aortic <b>valve</b> <b>replacement,</b> mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement,</b> and mitral <b>valve</b> repair. The following combined valve surgery types were included: mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> plus tricuspid <b>valve</b> repair, mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> plus aortic <b>valve</b> <b>replacement,</b> and mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> plus aortic <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> and tricuspid <b>valve</b> repair. Evaluation was performed by using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and C-statistics. ResultsData from 9846 patients were analyzed. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 cardiac risk models showed reasonable discrimination and poor calibration (C-statistic, 0. 712; P = . 00006 in Hosmer–Lemeshow test). Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 models had better discrimination (C-statistic, 0. 734) and calibration (P = . 5805) in patients undergoing isolated valve surgery than in patients undergoing multiple valve surgery (C-statistic, 0. 694; P = . 00002 in Hosmer–Lemeshow test). Estimates derived from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 models exceeded the mortality rates of multiple valve surgery (observed/expected ratios of 1. 44  for multiple valve surgery and 1. 17 for single valve surgery). ConclusionsThe Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 cardiac surgery risk models performed well when predicting the mortality for Chinese patients undergoing valve surgery. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 models were suitable for single valve surgery in a Chinese population; estimates of mortality for multiple valve surgery derived from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2008 models were less accurate...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{reviewed}} {{our experience}} with the operative management of patients with isolated nonnative mitral valve infective endocarditis {{to better understand the}} outcome. MethodsWe reviewed the records of 39 patients operated on for isolated nonnative mitral valve infective endocarditis from January 1974 to June 2009. Median age of the group was 68 years. There were 23 (59 %) women. Prostheses were mechanical in 18 (46 %) patients, biological in 18 (46 %), and annuloplasty rings in 3 (8 %). Staphylococcus was present in 22 (56 %) patients. Operative indications included valve dysfunction in 26 (67 %) patients and heart failure in 22 (56 %). ResultsPerivalvular abscess was present in 12 (31 %) patients. <b>Replacement</b> <b>valves</b> were mechanical in 23 (59 %) patients and biological in 16 (41 %). Twenty (51 %) patients received additional operative procedures. Treatment-related mortality occurred in 8 (21 %) patients, with age being the only factor predictive of mortality (hazard ratio, 5. 37). Follow-up of the survivors was 5. 7 years. Six (18 %) patients underwent repeat mitral valve replacement including 3 who had an annulus abscess at the initial operation and 2 who had the prosthesis sutured to the left atrial wall. There was 1 (4 %) case of recurrent endocarditis in the group of 28 patients who survived more than 1 year after the incident operation. Survival at 5 years was 48 % (95 % confidence interval, 35 %- 67 %). ConclusionsSurgery for isolated nonnative mitral valve infective endocarditis carries increased operative risk. Aggressive debridement and reconstruction of the annulus are paramount to achieving a good outcome. Surviving patients obtain high rates of cure and freedom from recurrent infective endocarditis...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThis study assesses in a baboon {{model the}} {{hemodynamics}} and {{human leukocyte antigen}} immunogenicity of chronically implanted bioengineered (decellularized with collagen conditioning treatments) human and baboon heart valve scaffolds. MethodsFourteen baboons underwent pulmonary valve replacement, 8 with decellularized and conditioned (bioengineered) pulmonary valves derived from allogeneic (N =  3) or xenogeneic (human) (N =  5) hearts; for comparison, 6 baboons received clinically relevant reference cryopreserved or porcine valved conduits. Panel-reactive serum antibodies (human leukocyte antigen class I and II), complement fixing antibodies (C 1 q binding), and C-reactive protein titers were measured serially until elective sacrifice at 10 or 26 weeks. Serial transesophageal echocardiograms measured valve function and geometry. Differences were analyzed with Kruskal–Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. ResultsAll animals survived and thrived, exhibiting excellent immediate implanted valve function by transesophageal echocardiograms. Over time, reference valves developed a smaller effective orifice area index (median, 0. 84 cm 2 /m 2; range, 1. 22 cm 2 /m 2), whereas all bioengineered valves remained normal (effective orifice area index median, 2. 45 cm 2 /m 2; range, 1. 35 cm 2 /m 2; P = . 005). None of the bioengineered valves developed elevated peak transvalvular gradients: 5. 5 (6. 0) mm Hg versus 12. 5 (23. 0) mm Hg (P = . 003). Cryopreserved valves provoked the most intense antibody responses. Two of 5 human bioengineered and 2 of 3 baboon bioengineered valves did not provoke any class I antibodies. Bioengineered human (but not baboon) scaffolds provoked class II antibodies. C 1 q+ antibodies developed in 4 recipients. ConclusionsValve dysfunction correlated with markers for more intense inflammatory provocation. The tested bioengineering methods reduced antigenicity of both human and baboon valves. Bioengineered <b>replacement</b> <b>valves</b> from both species were hemodynamically equivalent to native valves...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} 40 years, {{replacement}} of diseased natural heart valves with prosthetic devices has dramatically extended {{the quality and}} length {{of the lives of}} millions of patients worldwide. However, as in many medical therapies today, <b>replacement</b> <b>valves</b> are never as good as natural, healthy valves. Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV) continue to fail due to structural failure, a result of both poor tissue durability and faulty design. Clearly, an in-depth understanding of the biomechanical behavior of the BHV at both the tissue- and functional prosthesis levels is essential to improving BHV design and the mechanisms of failure. The goal of this research effort was to develop and evaluate a complete process for biomechanical simulations of heart valve biomaterials, with an emphasis on numerical stability and experimental validation. This process started from the collection of appropriate experimental data, formulating and validating a constitutive model, obtaining and refining material parameters, finite element implementation and validation of a constitutive model, and finally finite element simulation of valve deformation. The results of this study indicated that explicit expression of shear behavior was required for proper computational implementation of the exponential Fung pseudo-elastic model and thus, biaxial testing with extension only did not provide sufficient information to constitute a strain energy function for computational implementation. This study also demonstrated that a set of model constraints imposed by the convexity of strain energy function and condition number of elasticity tensor were necessary for numerical stability. When applied to an intact valve, the finite element model demonstrated an overall discrepancy of only 0. 0187 strain when compared to experimental validation data, which was within the experimental error. This result underscored the need for rigorous experimentation and constitutive modeling to allow a close match between FE and experiment output. The present study is, to our knowledge, the most rigorously developed and validated model available to date for characterizing valve deformation. It is hoped that the developed approaches will be a valuable tool for evaluating various valve design parameters and will greatly facilitate optimal BHV design...|$|E
