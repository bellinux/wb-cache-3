5|$|The {{helicopter}} {{operations were}} {{taken over by}} Norsk Helikpoter (later renamed Bristow Norway) when they opened their base on 11 November 2004. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Hammerfest was the second airport to receive SCAT-I, a Global Positioning System-based landing system, when it was installed in 2007. SCAT-I allows aircraft with the system installed to make a safer and less fuel-consuming landings using a gliding instead of step-down approach. This was followed up with an upgrade to the runway safety area and <b>runway</b> <b>lights</b> in 2008 and 2009.|$|E
5|$|Værøy Airport {{was plagued}} by bad wind {{conditions}} and low regularity. The airport had {{the highest number of}} cancellations in the country, with 31 of 609 flights canceled in the first eleven months of operation. During some periods, regularity was as low as 50%. The navigational aids were moved in 1989 to increase safety, more <b>runway</b> <b>lights</b> were installed and an anemometer was installed on the mountain, costing NOK1 million. Widerøe introduced self-imposed restrictions on landing at Værøy from 31 October 1988. Aircraft were not allowed to land or take off if the wind came from 090°–240° (though south) if the wind speed exceeded , including gusts. Additional restriction were introduced following an incident on 18 January 1989. These were again modified on 1 November 1989.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, <b>runway</b> <b>lights</b> were {{installed}} at Penshurst. In 1926, a telephone was again {{made available to}} airmen at Penshurst. On 27 August 1927, Tunbridge Wells Air Pageant was held. The site originally chosen, a field about a mile outside Tunbridge Wells was deemed unsuitable as there were obstacles surrounding it. It was decided to continue the pageant at Penshurst. Five civil de Havilland Moths and three Armstrong Whitworth Siskins from No. 56 Squadron RAF, based at nearby RAF Biggin Hill attended. The pageant was to promote the proposed Tunbridge Wells Flying Club, whose President was to be Sir Robert Gower. It was reported that part of Penshurst Airfield had been rented by the club. Sir Robert entertained Sir Sefton Brancker at Penshurst on 5 December 1927 when Brancker called in {{on his way to}} Lympne Aerodrome where he was to visit the East Kent Flying Club.|$|E

5|$|Norving {{operated}} at {{the airport}} until 1990, when the route {{was taken over by}} Widerøe, who initially used the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. The Ministry of Transport and Communications announced in February 1993 that they were considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). Along with Båtsfjord Airport and Vardø Airport, Svartnes, Hasvik Airport was one of three regional airports in Finnmark with government-subsidized routes which did not receive state operating grants. In December Widerøe articulated that Hasvik Airport did not meet the demands for future operation as it lacked proper instruments and did not have an asphalt runway. Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash 8 they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. Additional navigation aids were installed in 1993 and the runway was asphalted in 1995, subsequently resulting in Dash 8 services being introduced. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997. The <b>runway</b> <b>lights</b> were upgraded in 2008 and 2009, followed by the installation of the Global Positioning System-based landing system SCAT-I.|$|E
25|$|The {{probable}} cause {{determined by the}} inquiry for the 14 June 1950 accident was {{a failure of the}} pilot-in-command to adapt the timed approach procedure to the prevailing conditions and having descended to , the pilot-in-command did not take the necessary steps to maintain this altitude until such time as the <b>runway</b> <b>lights</b> became visible.|$|E
25|$|Zhang Ning {{observed}} the plane after {{it left the}} airport. Lin's plane initially traveled southeast (in the direction of Guangzhou). The plane then returned twenty minutes later and circled the airport several times {{as if it were}} trying to land, but the <b>runway</b> <b>lights</b> had been turned off. Soviet officials and Mongolian witnesses reported that the plane then flew north, over Mongolia and almost to the Soviet border, but then turned around and began flying south before it crashed. A Mongolian who witnessed the plane crash reported that the plane's tail was on fire when it crashed.|$|E

25|$|The airline {{therefore}} {{contacted the}} municipality in December 1969 and proposed that an airfield be built within a year, {{which it could}} operate with its Britten-Norman Islander aircraft. When the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) started planning an airport for the area, it considered both Kjøllefjord, Mehamn and Gamvik as locations for the regional airport. In early 1971 mean time Norving and local interest started looking for a suitable site in Gamvik. A committee was created for the task, which initiated a cooperation with the municipality. It was possible {{to take advantage of}} the weather station and radio navigation equipment at Slettnes Lighthouse. A gravel runway was estimated to cost 76,000 Norwegian krone, in addition to simple <b>runway</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 19 March 2016, at 3:42 AM local time, Flydubai Flight 981, a Boeing 737-800 on a {{passenger}} flight from Dubai, while executing a go-around, crashed {{at a high}} angle and speed {{by the end of}} Runway 22. All 62 people aboard died in the crash. The crash damaged 350 sq.meters of the airport's only runway and destroyed ten <b>runway</b> <b>lights.</b> The airport was closed down for several days for the air crash investigation's field survey and the runway repairment. The circumstances and reasons of the crash are still to be determined by the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee, with the participation of the airline's specialists and foreign experts, who continue the investigative actions in the airport.|$|E
25|$|On 5 November 1997, after {{numerous}} attempts to shake free the jammed {{main landing gear}} of an Airbus A340-300 (G-VSKY) failed, the aircraft en route from Los Angeles to Heathrow, made an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport. The aircraft sustained major damage to the undersides of engines one, two and four, which made contact with the runway surface during landing. The runway surface was also damaged and several <b>runway</b> <b>lights</b> were broken as the right main landing gear wheels broke up during the deceleration. The aircraft was evacuated safely. Two crew members and five passengers sustained minor injuries during the evacuation. The damaged aircraft was repaired after the incident and was retired from the Virgin Atlantic fleet in 2003.|$|E

50|$|The airport has minimal services: {{there is}} no <b>runway</b> <b>lighting</b> system for landing at night, no {{instrument}} approach and no control tower.|$|R
500|$|Iloilo International Airport has one primary [...] runway [...] wide. The runway runs at a {{direction}} of 02°/20°, {{the same as}} Mandurriao Airport. Unlike the runway at Mandurriao, the longer runway at Iloilo International Airport can support widebodied aircraft such as the Airbus A330, Airbus A350, Boeing 777(with reduced payload for the -300 series or -200 series) and Boeing 787. <b>Runway</b> <b>lights</b> and an Instrument Landing System were installed, making the airport capable of supporting low-visibility and night landings under any weather condition.|$|E
500|$|While the Catalina was {{suitable}} for postal flights, {{it was not}} {{suitable for}} a permanent solution for transporting passengers and freight, mainly due to its small size. Store Norske contacted the domestic airline Braathens SAFE for a regular service. The first trial flight was made on 2 April 1959 with a Douglas DC-4 with 54 passengers from Bardufoss Airport. Store Norske cleared a [...] runway for the aircraft. The next flight was done in 1962, followed by one in 1963 and two in 1964. Due to lack of <b>runway</b> <b>lights,</b> flights could only be done during daylight, thus hindering flights during parts of December and January, when the sun never rises. By April, the runway could melt, and no flights could be done during summer. Navigation was conducted using radio signals from Bear Island and Isfjord.|$|E

2500|$|Landings {{are made}} using VOR/DME {{approach}} on runway 13/31. The airport {{has a single}} runway, 13/31, which is [...] and is constructed of asphalt concrete. The lighting systems on runway 13/31 are High Intensity <b>Runway</b> <b>Lights,</b> Runway End Identification Lights, and Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI).|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} the approach lights for the runway were not lit {{on the night of}} the crash. [...] The pilot could not have known that only one strobe light was lit because the air traffic controller failed to adequately inform of the status of the <b>runway</b> <b>lights.</b> [...] The landing would be illegal under current FAA regulations, but was not at the time.|$|E

50|$|On <b>runways,</b> green <b>lights</b> {{indicate}} {{the beginning of}} the runway for landing, while red lights {{indicate the}} end of the <b>runway.</b> <b>Runway</b> edge <b>lighting</b> consists of white lights spaced out {{on both sides of the}} runway, indicating the edge. Some airports have more complicated <b>lighting</b> on the <b>runways</b> including <b>lights</b> that run down the centerline of the <b>runway</b> and <b>lights</b> that help indicate the approach (an approach lighting system, or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use pilot controlled lighting to save electricity and staffing costs.|$|R

The German forces were, like their Allied counterparts, only interested in keeping Elvenes as a reserve for Bardufoss.|$|E
2500|$|The wooden runway was pillaged by locals to {{accumulate}} building materials for reconstruction. The Norwegian Armed Forces established itself in Vardø in the mid-1950s. The airport was renovated; a terminal was built {{consisting of two}} simple barracks, one used as a passenger terminal and the other as a tower, consisting of a glass addition on the roof. The [...] gravel runway received portable <b>runway</b> <b>lights.</b> The Royal Norwegian Air Force served the airport with de Havilland Canada Twin Otter and Shorts Skyvan aircraft to transport military personnel.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, a {{proposal}} was launched {{to extend the}} runway to [...] At the time, all aircraft used in Norway either could land on a [...] long runway, or would need , so a compromise of [...] would have no practical application. The medium length would be possible at Meatjørn, but at Sørstokken, the <b>runway</b> <b>lights</b> {{would have to be}} placed in the fjord, which was too deep to make it feasible. When the issue was considered in the municipal council on 17 June 1982, the politicians voted unanimously for Sørstokken. There was no politician support to build an airport close to the residential areas, and those who were opposed to an airport voted for the most expensive proposal.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigating}} board {{determined that}} the probable cause of the accident {{was a lack of}} approach and <b>runway</b> <b>lighting</b> and improper guidance by the air traffic controller.|$|R
50|$|The primary runway is 16/34, with a {{paved surface}} {{measuring}} 1819 x 30 m.
