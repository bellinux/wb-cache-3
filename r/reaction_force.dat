40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> {{transmitted}} to the upper extremities of high-level gymnasts during the round-off phase of the Yurchenko vault. A secondary {{purpose of this}} study was to compare <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> during the Yurchenko vault to <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> observed in a tumbling pass during the floor exercise. Ten high-level, female gymnasts volunteered to participate. Conditions of the independent variable were the Yurchenko vault and floor exercise; dependent variables were peak vertical and peak anterior-posterior <b>reaction</b> <b>forces.</b> Each participant performed three trials of both conditions with the trail hand contacting a force platform. Vertical and anterior-posterior <b>reaction</b> <b>forces,</b> normalized to body weight, were greater (p < 0. 05) during the round-off phase of the Yurchenko vault (2. 38) than during the floor exercise round-off (2. 15). Vertical <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> during the round-off phase of the Yurchenko vault and floor exercise round-off are similar to <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> transmitted to upper extremities during other gymnastic skills and ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> transmitted to lower extremities while running and walking at various speeds.

40|$|In {{the dynamic}} {{formulation}} of holonomic and nonholonomic systems based on D'Alembert-Lagrange equation, {{the forces of}} constraints are maintained in the dynamic equations by introducing auxiliary variables, called Lagrange multipliers.

5|$|An {{operations}} plan {{suited for}} {{an attack on a}} small enemy formation was drafted by Ziegler, who was an adviser to Dam and the command staff of the 7th Infantry Division. Ziegler's plan, codenamed Operation Duc Thang I, called for the South Vietnamese to assault Ap Tan Thoi from three different directions: three rifle companies from the 11th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, to move from the north; the Dinh Tuong Civil Guards Regiment to march north from the south in separate columns; and a company of 13 M113 armored personnel carriers with an infantry company on board from the southwest. The M113 carriers and the infantry company could act as both a mobile reserve and a <b>reaction</b> <b>force,</b> so it was positioned where it could be shifted to the contact area if the Viet Cong began to retreat. In addition, Dam would also deploy two rifle companies at Tan Hiep airfield, which could be brought to the battlefield by helicopters from the US Army 93rd Transportation Company.|$|E

40|$|Several {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) lower-limb musculo-skeletal {{models have}} been developed for gait analysis and different hip, knee and ankle joint {{models have been}} considered in the literature. Conversely to the influence of the musculotendon geometry, the influence of the joint models - i. e. number of degrees of freedom and passive joint moments - on the estimated musculo-tendon forces and 3 D joint <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> has not been extensively examined. In this paper musculo-tendon forces and 3 D joint <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> have been estimated for one subject and one gait cycle with nine variations of a musculoskeletal model and outputs have been compared to measured electromyographic signals and knee joint contact forces. The model outputs are generally in line with the measured signals. However, the 3 D joint <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> were higher than published values and the contact forces measured for the subject. The results of this study show that, with more degrees of freedom in the model, the musculo-tendon forces and the 3 D joint <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> tend to increase but with some redistribution between the muscles. In addition, when taking into account passive joint moments, the 3 D joint <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> tend to decrease during the stance phase and increase during the swing phase. Although further investigations are needed, a five-degree-of-freedom lower-limb musculo-skeletal model with some angle-dependent joint coupling and stiffness seems to provide satisfactory musculo-tendon forces and 3 D joint <b>reaction</b> <b>forces.</b> Musculo-skeletal models, musculo-tendon <b>forces,</b> three-dimensional joint <b>reaction</b> <b>forces,</b> joint models, kinematic constraints, passive joint moments, gai...|$|R

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 17 February 6 RAR deployed into the area north-west of Hoi My by American UH-1 Iroquois helicopters and M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) {{in an attempt to}} cut off the anticipated Viet Cong withdrawal, establishing blocking and assault forces. Following an airmobile assault into an unsecured landing zone at 13:45, A Company 6 RAR was subsequently surprised by a strong, well-sited and dug-in Viet Cong force, which, rather than withdrawing, had likely remained in location as part of an attempt to ambush any <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> sent to the area. The Australians were soon contacted by heavy small arms fire, with a third of the lead platoon falling wounded in the initial volleys. A Company subsequently broke contact and withdrew under heavy fire from {{what appeared to be a}} Viet Cong base area.

However, unknown to the Australians the Viet Cong had been reinforced and they now faced a battalion-sized force in well prepared positions.|$|E
5|$|The Laotian {{soldiers}} were evidently reluctant to advance on the enemy, and only inched forward when the Americans {{ordered them to}} do so. In their first attempt to break through North Vietnamese lines, Ashley and his men were beaten back. Undeterred, the American-led forces tried to penetrate North Vietnamese positions several times, and only stopped after Ashley {{was shot in the}} chest and later killed by an exploding artillery round. The Laotians, who feared the North Vietnamese, disengaged from the fight and fled. After Ashley's final attack had failed, Willoughby and his men made the decision to abandon their position. However, after Specialist Four James L. Moreland was mortally wounded, Captain Willoughby decided to leave him in the bunker, because the remaining Americans were in no physical condition to carry out the wounded man. Under the cover of U.S. air strikes, Willoughby and other American survivors ran towards the old Lang Vei Camp, which was evacuated by U.S. Marine CH-46 from HMM-262, which lifted in a 50-man <b>reaction</b> <b>force.</b> By 17:30 on 7 February, all known survivors had been evacuated to Khe Sanh.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Colin Townsend, the {{commanding}} officer of 6 RAR, was called to the task force command post for a briefing at 10:20. Townsend subsequently issued verbal orders to deploy the battalion at 11:30, and 6 RAR subsequently launched a quick <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> code named Operation Bribie. The plan envisioned C Company, {{under the command of}} Major Brian McFarlane, being inserted by M113 APCs from A Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment to secure a helicopter landing zone—known as LZ Amber— east of Hoi My, just north of the hamlet of Ap My An. A, B and D Companies would then be flown into LZ Amber by American UH-1 Iroquois helicopters. The battalion would then link up and establish a blocking position to prevent the Viet Cong withdrawing east, before patrolling westward to contact. In direct support were 105mm M2A2 howitzers from the 101st Field Battery at the airstrip at Dat Do, which would subsequently be secured by A Company 5 RAR, while also supporting the operation were Bell H-13 Sioux light observation helicopters from the 161st Reconnaissance Flight and elements of the US 1st Battalion, 83rd Artillery Regiment. A New Zealand forward observation party was attached to the battery and would accompany B Company, 6 RAR. Due to the need to secure the task force base, 6 RAR would be required to return to Nui Dat before dark and this restriction would later impact heavily on the operation.|$|E
50|$|Ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> (GRF) are {{exerted by}} {{the ground on}} the body in contact with it and reflect the body’s acceleration. During level running, ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> can be dichotomized into {{vertical}} ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> and horizontal ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces.</b> In the comparison of incline to level running, the terms normal and parallel ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> are substituted for vertical and horizontal because when running on an incline the latter terms become inaccurate in describing the direction of force application. Measurements are expressed {{as a percentage of}} body weight, where a value of one body weight is the force exerted to support the body when standing. A plot of normal GRF is characterized by its biphasic nature, with an initial impact peak corresponding to the braking portion of the stance phase (heal strike) followed by a larger peak representing the propulsion part of the stance phase (toe off). Typical parallel GRF application during running involves two peaks, one that is negative during breaking and one that is positive during propulsion. Important characteristics of a GRF plot are the magnitude of the peaks (impact and active), the rate of loading, average force, and the total area under the plot.|$|R

5|$|The {{reform plan}} adopted in 2005 envisaged the {{formation}} of eighteen integrated brigades through the brassage process as its first of three stages. The process consists firstly of regroupment, where fighters are disarmed. Then they are sent to orientation centres, run by CONADER, where fighters take the choice of either returning to civilian society or remaining in the armed forces. Combatants who choose demobilisation receive an initial cash payment of US $110. Those who choose {{to stay within the}} FARDC are then transferred to one of six integration centres for a 45-day training course, which aims to build integrated formations out of factional fighters previously heavily divided along ethnic, political and regional lines. The centres are spread out around the country at Kitona, Kamina, Kisangani, Rumangabo and Nyaleke (within the Virunga National Park) in Nord-Kivu, and Luberizi (on the border with Burundi) in South Kivu. The process has suffered severe difficulties due to construction delays, administration errors, and the amount of travel former combatants have to do, as the three stages' centres are widely separated. Following the first 18 integrated brigades, the second goal is {{the formation of}} a ready <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> of two to three brigades, and finally, by 2010 when MONUC is anticipated to have withdrawn, the creation of a Main Defence Force of three divisions.|$|E
5|$|By staying and {{fighting}} the Viet Cong had surprised the Australians, who {{expected them to}} withdraw rapidly to their jungle bases following their attack on Lang Phuoc Hai as they had on previous occasions. This assumption had led the Australians to commit forces in a piecemeal fashion when the situation required a deliberate battalion attack supported by blocking forces, a co-ordinated indirect fire plan, and APCs. Yet such an operation would have required considerable time to plan and execute, and Townsend had been ordered not to become too heavily engaged. Ad hoc and planned in haste, Operation Bribie went badly for the Australians from the start with delays in deploying the <b>reaction</b> <b>force.</b> Expecting only minor contact, Graham had finally sent the battalion out after midday and ordered it to return before nightfall. Yet this restriction {{had a significant impact}} on the operation, and limited the time available to commanders at all levels for planning and reconnaissance, thereby preventing a more deliberate approach. Once committed, the Australians realised that they had struck at least a company from D445 Battalion with elements of a heavy weapons company, possibly supported by North Vietnamese reinforcements and at least five machine-guns, one heavy machine-gun and two recoilless rifles. Graham had intended to land 6 RAR behind the Viet Cong in order to cut-off their withdrawal, yet instead they had almost landed directly on top of them. Further misjudgement and circumstance affected the Australian response once the battle began, with the initial reports that the Viet Cong position was a 'camp' proving incorrect, as had the belief that the dense scrub made the area unsuitable for cavalry. Meanwhile, A Company's initial assault had lacked adequate artillery support, while B Company's final assault had been hampered by the requirement for A Company's supporting fire to cut-off early. The resulting friction had then culminated in A Squadron's difficulty linking-up with B Company in the dense vegetation, further delaying their relief.|$|E
