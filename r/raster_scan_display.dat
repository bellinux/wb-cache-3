40|$|Polygon Streams is a {{distributed}} system with multiple processors and strictly local communication. A unique custom VLSI chip that constitutes an independent processing module forms {{a stage of}} the PS pipeline. The number of these modules in PS is a variable that {{is determined by the}} application. PS features a modular architecture, multi-ported on-chip memory, bit-serial arithmetic, and a pipeline whose computation can be dynamically configured. The PS design closely subscribes to the system characteristics favored by VLSI. The task of scan conversion is very intensive in computation and pixel information access for rendering computer graphics images on <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> <b>displays.</b> It is very coherent and suitable, however, for forward difference algorithms. The discrete and regular layout of the raster display in conjunction with the largely local effect of a pixel on an image, make rendering amenable to parallel architectures with localized memory and communication. These are precisely the attributes favored by VLSI and typical of PS. A modification of the Digital Differential Analyzer is implemented to Gouraud Shade and depth buffer convex polygons at high speeds. The scan conversion task is distributed over the processors to efficiently subdivide the image space and maximize concurrency of processor operation.

Once the beam of the monitor has reached the edge of the screen, the beam is switched off, and the deflection circuit voltages (or currents) are returned to the values they had for the other edge of the screen; this would have the effect of retracing the screen in the opposite direction, so the beam is turned off during this time. This part of the line display process is the Horizontal Blank.|$|R

40|$|From {{a series}} of initial studies {{in the area of}} {{computer}} cartography a dual data structure was evolved based on matrix representation of graphs and the use of boolean expressions. This data structure was used principally to represent zones in space though, by using boundaries of zones, it was possible to create line networks. The original idea was to use the boolean expressions as an input language for creating volume and area descriptions and to use the graph matrices for internal manipulation and creating graphic output. However, a way was found to interpret the boolean expression directly into the form of graphic output suitable for the <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> <b>displays</b> given by television monitors. The software implementation of this process was very slow but, with the current developments in integrated circuitry, it suggested a way of creating a new form of parallel display processor. This possibility was investigated initially as a general processor to carry out several related spatial operations and then, finally, merely to create displays. The applications depend on (t) the general nature of the data structure used and the possible graphic languages it makes possible and (2) the real time manipulation of displays. In the case of three-dimensional scenes, this includes an automatic hidden line and hidden area removal capability. The particular applications which have been considered include the fast access and display of maps and technical drawings from planning, archi¬ tectural and engineering data bases; the real time generation of displays for training simulation; the preparation of animated films for teaching and entertainment; the control of numerically-controlled machine tools; and solving the placement problem in computer-aided design work and overlap problems in type setting and map annotation...|$|R

40|$|A {{software}} system that integrates an ADAGE 3000 Programmable Display Generator into a C. A. D. software package {{known as the}} Solid Modeling Program is described. The Solid Modeling Program (SMP) is an interactive program {{that is used to}} model complex solid object through the composition of primitive geomeentities. In addition, SMP provides extensive facilities for model editing and display. The ADAGE 3000 Programmable Display Generator (PDG) is a color, <b>raster</b> <b>scan,</b> programmable <b>display</b> generator with a 32 -bit bit-slice, bipolar microprocessor (BPS). The modularity of the system architecture and the width and speed of the system bus allow for additional co-processors in the system. These co-processors combine to provide efficient operations on and rendering of graphics entities. The resulting {{software system}} takes advantage of the graphics capabilities of the PDG in the operation of SMP by distributing its processing modules between the host and the PDG. Initially, the target host computer was a PRIME 850, which was later substituted with a VAX- 11 / 785. Two versions of the software system were developed, a phase 1 and a phase 2. In phase 1, the ADAGE 3000 is used as a frame buffer. In phase II, SMP was functionally partitioned and some of its functions were implemented in the ADAGE 3000 by means of ADAGE's SOLID 3000 software package...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, most {{computer}} graphics {{systems have been}} oriented toward the display of line drawings, continually refreshing the screen from a display list of vectors. Developments such as plasma panel displays and rapidly declining memory prices have now made feasible raster graphics systems, which instead associate some memory with each point on the screen, and display points according to {{the contents of the}} memory. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of such systems. Raster systems permit operations which are not feasible on vector displays, such as reading directly from the screen as well as writing it, and manipulating two dimensional areas as well as vectors. Conceptual differences between programming for raster and vector systems are illustrated with a description of the author's TV Turtle, a graphics system for <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> video <b>display</b> terminals. This system is imbedded in Logo, a Lisp-like interactive programming language designed for use by kids, and is based on Logo's turtle geometry approach to graphics.
