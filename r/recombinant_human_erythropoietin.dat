This article charts a brief history of their use in clinical medicine, mainly dealing with chronic kidney disease, paying special attention to how these agents were introduced into clinical medicine and what has happened subsequently; in 2009, there were several developments that could be regarded as a “perfect storm ” in terms of the long-term use of these compounds in chronic kidney disease and oncology and, likely, elsewhere. We are now very much at a “crossroads, ” where mature reflection is required, because with the latest trials and meta-analyses, these therapies seem not only expensive but also very much a clinical tradeoff (increased risk of adverse effects versus a small gain in fatigue scores).

During {{the past few}} years, {{there have been some}} reports indicating that multiple <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> infusions starting at least 2 weeks before the operation induced erythropoiesis. We aimed {{to reduce the risk of}} adverse reactions of high doses of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> and reduce the period of hospitalization by using it only once, 4 days before the operation. Methods: Twenty-five patients received <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> 4 days before the operation, and 28 patients comprised the control group. All the hematologic parameters of the patients are measured on the day of admission, the day before the operation (fourth day), the first day after the operation, and 1 week later. Results: In the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> group the mean hemoglobin concentration increased on the morning of the operation (14. 5 ± 0. 52 g/dL in the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> group and 12. 4 ± 0. 65 in the control group, P <. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Erythropoietin {{has been}} shown to be {{protective}} against hypoxic-ischemic and inflammatory injuries in cell culture, animal models of brain injury, and clinical trials of adult humans. The rationale for our study was that early administration of high-dose <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> may reduce perinatal brain injury (intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia) in very preterm infants and improve neurodevelopmental outcome. We investigated whether administration of high-dose <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> to very preterm infants shortly after birth and subsequently during the first 2 days is safe in terms of short-term outcome. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-masked, single-center trial with a 2 : 1 allocation in favor of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin.</b> Preterm infants (gestational age: 24 to 31 weeks) were given <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> or NaCl 0. 9 % intravenously 3, 12 to 18, and 36 to 42 hours after birth. RESULTS: The percentage of infants who survived without brain injury or retinopathy was 53 % in the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> group and 60 % in the placebo group. There were no relevant differences regarding short-term outcomes such as intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. For 5 infants who were in the <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> group and had a gestational age of < 26 weeks, withdrawal of intensive care was decided (3 of 5 with severe bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage, 2 of 5 with pulmonary insufficiency); no infant of the control group died. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> treatment did not result in significant differences in blood pressure, cerebral oxygenation, hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet count.

However, multiple weekly injections are inconvenient for both the patient and the healthcare provider. With the introduction of the longer-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agent darbepoetin alfa, there has been growing interest in longer dosing intervals for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Data from several randomized studies have shown that darbepoetin alfa is effective in maintaining haemo-globin levels when administered (subcutaneously, intravenously or both) every 2 weeks in dialysis patients, and every 2 weeks or monthly in patients with chronic kidney disease not yet receiving dialysis.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Anemia {{is common in}} {{patients}} with chronic heart failure, and is related to increased morbidity and mortality. The etiology of anemia in heart failure is complex and still not fully resolved. The review will describe current advances {{in the understanding of}} the pathophysiology of anemia and the potential therapeutic effects of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin.</b> Recent findings Recent attempts to resolve the preponderant etiology of anemia in chronic heart failure have further defined its multifactorial nature. Impaired renal perfusion and function resulting in blunted erythropoietin production as well as impaired erythropoiesis in the bone marrow account for a vulnerable erythropoietic system. Moreover, fluid retention causes hemodilutional anemia. Correction of anemia with <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> seems feasible and is currently being evaluated in a phase 3 clinical trial. In addition, <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> improves cardiac function in chronic heart failure through the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells and exerts cytoprotective effects during acute myocardial infarction. Although <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> shows great promise, we should not neglect other treatable causes of anemia.

Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham group, cardiopulmonary bypass group, and 3 recombinant human erythropoietin–treated cardiopulmonary bypass groups (bolus doses of 500, 3000, and 5000 U/kg 24 hours before surgery). Blood and urine samples were collected just before surgery and at 2, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. In phase II, rats were divided into 3 groups: sham group, cardiopulmonary bypass group, and 5000 U/kg <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> group. Kidneys were harvested at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Ultra-organization of glomeruli was observed. Glomerular transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC 6) expression was studied by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Nuclei nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1 (NFATc 1) activity was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. ResultsPretreatment of 5000 U/kg <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> decreased the urine protein (72 hours: 7. 82  ±  1. 13 g/L vs 11. 28  ±  1. 73 g/L), serum creatinine (72 hours: 35. 0  ±  3. 5 μmol/L vs 60. 7  ±  7. 6 μmol/L), and cystatin-C (2 hours: 336. 5  ±  28. 2 μg/L vs 452. 6  ±  63. 8 μg/L) compared with the control group (P < . 01).

40|$|Anaemia effects up to 90 % {{of cancer}} patients, {{with more than}} 60 % {{requiring}} blood transfusion during or after treatment. With the advent of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietins</b> (rHuEPO), an alternative to red blood cell transfusion has become available. So far, three drugs have been approved {{for the treatment of}} anaemia in patients with malignancies (epoetin alfa, epoetin beta and darbepoetin alfa). New concepts for the use of erythropoietin in cancer patients include 3 - and 4 -weekly dosing, as well as loading-dose concepts. Important factors helping to judge the impact of erythropoietin in cancer treatment include pharmacoeconomics and better predictive factors. Lately, the influence of erythro-poietin therapy on survival in cancer patients has been discussed very intensively, because conflicting data have emerged. Studies aimed at correcting anaemia in cancer patients had indicated a possible survival advantage of those patients receiving erythropoietin. In contrast, two recent trials aimed at correction of haemoglobin levels beyond anaemia reported a poorer survival of patients receiving erythropoietin. This might grossly be attributed to a higher risk of thrombosis in these patients.

The erythropoietic response to graded doses of <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> (epoetin alfa) was assessed in 24 hemodialysis patients by quantitative ferrokinetic studies, and measurement of the reticulocyte count and plasma levels of transferrin receptor protein. These responses were compared to those of 22 normal subjects. Epoetin alfa was given intravenously at 15, 50 or 150 U/kg every other day for four injections. Three patients with chronic renal failure were restudied after renal function was restored following renal transplantation. The results of these three different measurements of erythroid function showed that the acute response to <b>recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> was similar in normal subjects and patients with renal failure. We conclude that chronic uremia does not alter the responsiveness to erythropoietin in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> (hrEpo) {{is crucial}} in anemia {{treatment}} options in chronic renal failure patients undergoing regular hemodialysis therapy. However, the clinical characteristics of erythropoietin treatment prior to hemodialysis have not been thoroughly studied. This study was aimed to analyze in retrospective manner the results of hrEpo therapy in chronic renal failure prior to hemodialysis. The study included 42 patients (26 males and 16 females, 42. 4 ± 3. 7 yrs old) with mean serum creatinine 305 ± 32 µmol/l, whose anemia and iron homeostasis parameters were carefully assessed. HrEpo improved both the general state of the patients and the life quality, it decreased cardiovascular complications and the mortality of patients prior to hemodialysis therapy. Iron supplementation during erythropoietin therapy was required, {{in the majority of}} patients oral iron was sufficient. The application of <b>human</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>erythropoietin</b> prior to hemodialysis is a safe option, it does not accelerate the progression of chronic renal failure, only in a small number of patients moderate increase of blood pressure was noted that could have been effectively managed with the modification of doses of hypotensive pharmacotherapy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Recombinant</b> <b>human</b> <b>erythropoietins</b> (rHuEPOs) {{are used}} to treat cancer-related anemia. Recent {{preclinical}} studies and clinical trials, however, have raised concerns about the potential tumor-promoting effects of these drugs. Because the clinical significance of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) signaling in human {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) also remains controversial, our aim was to study whether EPO treatment modifies tumor growth and if EPOR expression has an impact on the clinical behavior of this malignancy. A total of 43 patients with stage III-IV adenocarcinoma (ADC) and complete clinicopathological data were included. EPOR expression in human ADC samples and cell lines was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Effects of exogenous rHuEPO alpha were studied on human lung ADC cell lines in vitro. In vivo growth of human ADC xenografts treated with rHuEPO alpha with or without chemotherapy was also assessed. In vivo tumor and endothelial cell (EC) proliferation was determined by 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation and immunofluorescent labeling. Although EPOR mRNA was expressed in all of the three investigated ADC cell lines, rHuEPO alpha treatment (either alone or in combination with gemcitabine) did not alter ADC cell proliferation in vitro. However, rHuEPO alpha significantly decreased tumor cell proliferation and growth of human H 1975 lung ADC xenografts. At the same time, rHuEPO alpha treatment of H 1975 tumors resulted in accelerated tumor endothelial cell proliferation. Moreover, in patients with advanced stage lung ADC, high intratumoral EPOR mRNA levels were associated with significantly increased overall survival. This study reveals high EPOR level as a potential novel positive prognostic marker in human lung ADC...|$|R
