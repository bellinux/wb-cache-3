40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{effective}} dielectric permitivity for the metamaterials used so far to obtain left-handed materials, with <b>strip</b> <b>wires</b> 0. 003 cm thick, {{is dominated by the}} imaginary part at 10. 6 - 11. 5 GHz frequencies, where the band pass filter is, and therefore there is not propagation and the wave is inhomogeneous inside the medium. This is shown from finite-differences time-domain calculations using the real permitivity values for the Cu wires. For thicker wires the losses are reduced and the negative part of the permitivity dominates. As the thickness of the wires is critical for the realization of a good transparent left- handed material we propose that the <b>strip</b> <b>wires</b> should have thickness of 0. 07 - 0. 1 cm and the split ring resonators 0. 015 - 0. 03 c...|$|R
50|$|Jump wires (also called jumper wires) for {{solderless}} breadboarding can {{be obtained}} in ready-to-use jump wire sets or can be manually manufactured. The latter can become tedious work for larger circuits. Ready-to-use jump wires come in different qualities, some even with tiny plugs attached to the wire ends. Jump wire material for ready-made or homemade wires should usually be 22 AWG (0.33 mm2) solid copper, tin-plated wire - assuming no tiny plugs are to {{be attached to the}} wire ends. The wire ends should be stripped 3/16 to 5/16 in. Shorter <b>stripped</b> <b>wires</b> might result in bad contact with the board's spring clips (insulation being caught in the springs). Longer <b>stripped</b> <b>wires</b> increase the likelihood of short-circuits on the board. Needle-nose pliers and tweezers are helpful when inserting or removing wires, particularly on crowded boards.|$|R

5000|$|Crimp {{contacts}} are {{assembled by}} inserting a <b>stripped</b> <b>wire</b> end into a cavity {{in the rear}} of the contact, then crushing the cavity using a crimp tool, causing the cavity to grip the wire tightly at many points.

50|$|It {{consists}} of a single flat piece of springy metal, bent over itself to form a clip. Pushing down {{on the end of}} the metal tab opens a hole through which a bare or <b>stripped</b> <b>wire</b> can be inserted. Releasing pressure allows the tab to spring back, closing the hole and gripping the wire to form an electrically sound mechanical connection. Pushing the tab again releases the grip on the wire so it can be withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|Typically, the metals {{are joined}} {{together}} via a special connector. <b>Stripped</b> <b>wire</b> (often stranded) is inserted through the correctly sized {{opening of the}} connector, and a crimper is used to tightly squeeze the opening against the wire.

50|$|In antiquity, jewelry often contains, in {{the form}} of chains and applied decoration, large amounts of wire that is {{accurately}} made and which must have been produced by some efficient, if not technically advanced, means. In some cases, strips cut from metal sheet were made into wire by pulling them through perforations in stone beads. This causes the strips to fold round on themselves to form thin tubes. This strip drawing technique was in use in Egypt by the 2nd Dynasty. From the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE most of the gold wires in jewellery are characterised by seam lines that follow a spiral path along the <b>wire.</b> Such twisted <b>strips</b> can be converted into solid round wires by rolling them between flat surfaces or the <b>strip</b> <b>wire</b> drawing method. The <b>strip</b> twist <b>wire</b> manufacturing method was superseded by drawing in the ancient Old World sometime between about the 8th and 10th centuries AD. There is some evidence for the use of drawing further East prior to this period.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose a new method to enhance the gain of {{rectangular}} waveguide antenna arrays using the double negative medium (DNG) structure composed of <b>strip</b> <b>wires</b> (SW) and split ring resonators (SRR). The electromagnetic parameters of the DNG structure are retrieved and the rectangular waveguide antennas with and without the DNG structure are studied using numerical simulation method. The simulation results show that the DNG structure can congregate the radiation energy when the index of refraction approximates zero, since that the gain of the antenna arrays is enhanced and the radiation performance of the antenna arrays is effectively improved. Far-field radiation patterns are measured, which indicate that this method is effective to enhance the gain. 1...|$|R
50|$|The rifle's {{stock is}} made from fiberglass-reinforced {{polyamide}} 66. At the forward end is the pistol grip with an enlarged forward trigger guard completely enclosing the firing hand that allows the rifle to be operated with winter gloves. The trigger is hung permanently on the pistol grip, together with its two operating rods which run in guides past the magazine housing. Behind that is the locking catch for the stock group. Pressing this to the right will separate the receiver and stock. The magazine catch is behind the housing, {{on the underside of}} the stock. Above the housing are the two ejector openings, one of which is always covered by a <b>removable</b> <b>strip</b> of plastic. The rear of the stock forms the actual shoulder rest which contains the hammer unit and the end of the bolt path. The butt is closed by an endplate which is held in place by the rear sling swivel. This swivel is attached to a pin which pushes in across the butt and secures the plate. There is a cavity under the buttplate that holds a cleaning kit.|$|R

The main features of magnetic traps based on superconducting wires in the Meissner and mixed states are discussed.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of electrical {{power from the}} overhead line to the train is carried out through the sliding contact between the pantograph’s contact strip and the overhead line’s contact wire. The state of the contact {{is defined by the}} current collection quality, where electrical arcs play a predominant role. Indeed, electrical arcs are generated when, during current collection, contact losses occur due to the dynamics of pantograph-catenary interaction. The main effects of the electrical arcs are electromagnetic disturbances and high values of local temperature on the strip and on the wire, which in turn cause an increase of wear rate on contact <b>strip</b> and contact <b>wire.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze, by means of laboratory tests, the effect of electrical arc occurrence on the wear of <b>strip</b> and <b>wire.</b> Two different kinds of carbon based strip are considered: plain carbon strip and copper impregnated carbon <b>strip.</b> The contact <b>wire</b> considered in this work is a pure copper wire...|$|R
