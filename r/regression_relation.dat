Study of sedimentary layer thickness and behaviour under stress cycles is crucial for earthquake hazard analysis. Borehole logs for Bangalore are used to benchmark the relation between sedimentary thickness and resonant frequency of the soil layer for this region. Microtremor measurements are carried out at the locations where borehole drilling was done and the frequencies corresponding to spectral peaks of the H/V ratio are estimated, where H and V denote the horizontal and vertical spectral component of the microtremor displacement respectively. The thicknesses of the soil layer (D), obtained from borehole logs and the soil layer resonant frequencies (fr) determined from the H/V spectral peaks are used to obtain a <b>regression</b> <b>relation</b> between them.

40|$|We {{obtain a}} {{modified}} version of the Onsager <b>regression</b> <b>relation</b> for the expectation values of quantum-mechanical operators in pure quantum states of isolated many-body quantum systems. We use the insights gained from this relation to show that high-temperature time correlation functions in many-body quantum systems can be controllably computed without complete diagonalization of the Hamiltonians, using instead the direct integration of the Schroedinger equation for randomly sampled pure states. This method is also applicable to quantum quenches and other situations describable by time-dependent many-body Hamiltonians. The method implies exponential reduction of the computer memory requirement in comparison with the complete diagonalization. We illustrate the method by numerically computing infinite-temperature correlation functions for translationally invariant Heisenberg chains of up to 29 spins 1 / 2. Thereby, we also test the spin diffusion hypothesis and find it in a satisfactory agreement with the numerical results. Both the derivation of the modified <b>regression</b> <b>relation</b> and the justification of the computational method are based on the notion of quantum typicality.

40|$|A {{statistical}} regression method is presented for estimating hourly anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) using an anthropogenic pollutant emission inventory {{for use in}} mesoscale meteorological and air-quality modeling. Based on bottom-up AHF estimated from detailed energy consumption data and anthropogenic pollutant emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the US National Emission Inventory year 2005 (NEI- 2005), a robust <b>regression</b> <b>relation</b> between the AHF and the pollutant emissions is obtained for Houston. This relation {{is a combination of}} two power functions (Y = aXb) relating CO and NOx emissions to AHF, giving a determinant coefficient (R 2) of 0. 72. The AHF for Houston derived from the <b>regression</b> <b>relation</b> has high temporal (R = 0. 91) and spatial (R = 0. 83) correlations with the bottom-up AHF. Hourly AHF for the whole US in summer is estimated by applying the <b>regression</b> <b>relation</b> to the NEI- 2005 summer pollutant emissions with a high spatial resolution of 4 -km. The summer daily mean AHF range 10 – 40 W m- 2 on a 4 × 4 km 2 grid scale with maximum heat fluxes of 50 – 140 W m- 2 for major US cities. The AHFs derived from the regression relations between the bottom-up AHF and either CO or NOx emissions show a small difference of less than 5 % (4. 7 W m- 2) in city-scale daily mean AHF, and similar R 2 statistics, compared to results from their combination. Thus, emissions of either species can be used to estimate AHF in the US cities. An hourly AHF inventory at 4 × 4 km 2 resolution over the entire US based on the combined regression is derived and made publicly available for use in mesoscale numerical modeling...|$|E

Indeed, Geweke (2003, p. 162) has written, “The seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) model developed in Zellner (1962) is perhaps the most widely used econometric model after linear regressions.

One way of setting design variable targets in initial stages for desirable side impact safety performance is to use reliable regression-based relations developed with the aid of test data. In the present study, values of relevant response parameters from a detailed FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) 214 simulation of an aluminum-intensive space-frame vehicle with a front DOT-SID (Department Of Transportation-Side Impact Dummy) are used in an available regression-based relation for front TTI (Thoracic Trauma Index) prediction.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{body mass}} index (BMI) is the {{standard}} parameter for predicting body fat fraction and for classifying degrees of obesity. Currently available regression equations between BMI and fat are based on 2 or 3 parameter empirical fits and have not been validated for highly obese subjects. We attempt to develop <b>regression</b> <b>relations</b> {{that are based on}} realistic models of body composition changes in obesity. These models, if valid, can then be extrapolated to the high fat fraction of the morbidly obese. Methods The analysis was applied to 3 compartment (density and total body water) measurements of body fat. The data was collected at the New York Obesity Research Center, Body Composition Unit, as part of ongoing studies. A total of 1356 subjects were included, with a BMI range of 17 to 50 for males and 17 to 65 for females. The body composition model assumes that obese subjects can be represented by the sum of a standard lean reference subject plus an extra weight that has a constant adipose, bone and muscle fraction. Results There is marked age and sex dependence in the relationship between BMI and fat fraction. There was no significant difference among Caucasians, Blacks and Hispanics while Asians had significantly greater fat fraction for the same BMI. A linear relationship between BMI and fat fraction provides a good description for men but overestimates the fat fraction in morbidly obese women for whom a non-linear regression should be used. New <b>regression</b> <b>relations</b> for predicting body fat just from experimental measurements of body density are described that are more accurate then those currently used. From the fits to the experimental BMI and density data, a quantitative description of the bone, adipose and muscle body composition of lean and obese subjects is derived. Conclusion Physiologically realistic models of body composition provide both accurate <b>regression</b> <b>relations</b> and new insights about changes in body composition in obesity. </p...|$|R

40|$|Short-term {{weathering}} rates (chemical denudation) {{of primary}} weathering products {{were derived from}} an analysis of fluxes in precipitation and streamwater. Rainfall, streamflow (runoff), and related water quality have been monitored at the Panola Mountain Research Watershed (PMRW) since 1985. <b>Regression</b> <b>relations</b> of stream solute concentration of major ions including weathering products [sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and silica (H 4 SiO 4) ] were derived from weekly and storm-based sampling from October 1986 through September 1998; runoff, seasonality, and hydrologic state were the primary independent variables. The <b>regression</b> <b>relations</b> explained from 74 to 90 percent of the variations in solute concentration. Chloride (Cl) fluxes for the study period were used to estimate dry atmospheric deposition (DAD) by subtracting the precipitation flux from the stream flux; net Cl flux varied from years of net retention during dry years to> 3 times more exported during wet years. On average, DAD was 56 {{percent of the total}} atmospheric deposition (also assumed for the other solutes); average annual net cation and H 4 SiO 4 fluxes were 50. 6 and 85. 9 mmol m- 2, respectively. The annual cumulative density functions of solute flux as a function of runoff were evaluated and compared among solutes to evaluate relative changes in solute sources during stormflows. Stream flux of weathering solutes is primarily associated with groundwater discharge. During stormflow, Ca and Mg contributions increase relative to Na and H 4 SiO 4, particularly during wet years when the contribution is 10 percent of the annual flux. The higher Ca and Mg contributions to the stream during stormflow are consistent with increased contribution from shallow soil horizons where these solutes dominate...|$|R
