5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books {{said to have been}} given by God to Moses. The three prominent <b>religious</b> <b>parties</b> were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented {{only a small fraction of}} the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E
5|$|Nineteen {{bodies were}} burned beyond recognition, {{but none of}} them {{appeared}} to be women or children, according to Pakistani officials. An article in The Nation, cited a grave digger at the cemetery where the bodies were being buried, who claimed there was the possibility {{that there may have been}} more than one body in each coffin. The article also stated that the government was digging more graves than previously established. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a coalition of hard-line <b>religious</b> <b>parties,</b> claimed that between 400 and 1,000 students had been killed, along with women and children. Spanish-language news channels Univision, Antena 3, and Telecinco claimed that the total number of deaths in the siege was greater than 286 and could be as high as 300.|$|E

JI continued its opposition to the War on terrorism, particularly the presence of American troops and agencies in Pakistan. JI also called for restoration of judiciary.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1976 his {{coalition}} government with the <b>religious</b> <b>parties</b> suffered a crisis: A {{motion of no confidence}} had been brought by Agudat Yisrael over a breach of the Sabbath on an Israeli Air Force base when four F-15 jets were delivered from the US and the National Religious Party had abstained. Rabin dissolved his government and decided on new elections, which were to be held in May 1977.|$|E
25|$|To cement {{the peace}} {{between the two}} <b>religious</b> <b>parties,</b> Catherine planned to marry her {{daughter}} Margaret to the Protestant prince, Henry of Navarre (the future King Henry IV), son of the Huguenot leader Queen Jeanne d'Albret. The royal marriage was arranged for 18 August 1572. It was not accepted by traditionalist Catholics or by the Pope. Both the Pope and King Philip II of Spain strongly condemned Catherine's Huguenot policy as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} over One Unit (the division of Pakistan into only two provinces, east and west) {{and the appropriate}} electoral system for Pakistan, whether joint or separate, also revived as soon as Suhrawardy became Prime Minister. In West Pakistan, there was strong opposition to the joint electorate by the Muslim League and the <b>religious</b> <b>parties.</b> The Awami League however, strongly supported the joint electorate. These differences over One Unit and the appropriate electorate caused problems for the government.|$|E

25|$|Secularism is {{protected}} by the constitution of Bangladesh, and <b>religious</b> <b>parties</b> are barred from contesting elections; however, the government is accused of courting religious extremist groups. Islam's ambiguous position as the de facto state religion has been criticized by the United Nations. Despite relative harmony, religious minorities have faced occasional persecution. The Hindu and Buddhist communities have experienced religious violence from Islamic groups, notably the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing (Shibir). Islamic far-right candidates peaked at 12 {{percent of the vote}} in 2001, falling to four percent in 2008. Homosexuality is outlawed by section 377 of the criminal code, and is punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of rapid {{economic}} growth in the 1960s, large numbers Pashtuns from the NWFP migrated to Karachi with Afghan Pashtun refugees settling in Karachi during the 80's. By some estimates, Karachi is home to the world's largest urban Pashtun population, with more Pashtun citizens than the FATA. While generally considered to be one of Karachi's most conservative communities, Pashtuns in Karachi generally vote for the secular Awami National Party rather than <b>religious</b> <b>parties.</b> Pashtuns from Afghanistan are regarded as the most conservative community. Pashtuns from Pakistan's Swat Valley, in contrast, are generally seen as more liberal in social outlook. The Pashtun community forms the bulk of manual labourers and transporters.|$|E
25|$|After General Zia's {{death in}} August 1988, Zia's {{political}} party–Pakistan Muslim League (Pagara Group)–split into two factions. Sharif led the Zia loyalist Fida Group against the Junejo Group, led by prime minister Muhammad Khan Junejo. The Fida Group later {{took on the}} mantle of the PML while the Junejo Group {{became known as the}} JIP. The two parties along with seven other right-wing conservatives and <b>religious</b> <b>parties</b> united with encouragement and funding from the ISI to form the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI). The alliance was co-led by Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi and Sharif to oppose Benazir Bhutto's PPP in the elections. The IJI gained substantial majorities in the Punjab and Sharif was re-elected Chief Minister of Punjab.|$|E

25|$|Yasmin Khan {{argued that}} Gandhi's death and funeral helped {{consolidate}} {{the authority of}} the new Indian state under Nehru and Patel. The Congress tightly controlled the epic public displays of grief over a two-week period—the funeral, mortuary rituals and distribution of the martyr's ashes—as millions participated and hundreds of millions watched. The goal was to assert the power of the government, legitimise the Congress party's control and suppress all religious para-military groups. Nehru and Patel suppressed the RSS, the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests. Gandhi's death and funeral linked the distant state with the Indian people and made more understand the need to suppress <b>religious</b> <b>parties</b> during the transition to independence for the Indian people.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} El Al began to {{schedule}} flights from airports outside of Israel that departed on the Jewish sabbath {{and landed in}} Israel after it had finished. However, the <b>religious</b> <b>parties</b> in the government were in arms over this, being {{that this was a}} violation of Jewish law and contrary to the agreement signed {{in the early days of}} the state, in which El Al promised to refrain from flying on the sabbath. In 1982 the newly re-elected prime minister Menachem Begin, brought before the Knesset a vote to ban Sabbath flights once again (it passed by a vote of 58 to 54). Outraged, the secular community threatened to boycott the airline. In August 1982 El Al workers blocked Orthodox and Hassidic Jews from entering the airport.|$|E
25|$|Following Golda Meir's {{resignation}} in April 1974, Rabin {{was elected}} party leader, after he defeated Shimon Peres. The rivalry {{between these two}} Labour leaders remained fierce and they competed {{several times in the}} next two decades for the leadership role, and even for who deserved credit for government achievements. Rabin succeeded Golda Meir as Prime Minister of Israel on 3 June 1974. This was a coalition government, including Ratz, the Independent Liberals, Progress and Development and the Arab List for Bedouins and Villagers. This arrangement, with a bare parliamentary majority, held for a few months {{and was one of the}} few periods in Israel's history where the <b>religious</b> <b>parties</b> were not part of the coalition. The National Religious Party joined the coalition on 30 October 1974 and Ratz left on 6 November.|$|E

25|$|The right-wing and left-wing {{parties in}} West were {{opposing}} the One Unit, {{and the cause}} was {{taken up by the}} rightist Muslim League and <b>religious</b> <b>parties.</b> Prime Minister Suhrawardy supported the One Unit plan to establish the federalism but the vast opposition paralyzed Suhrawardy's progress to oversee the program properly. Politically, the One Unit failed to progress and suffered with many set backs in West; it did not produce any geopolitical results and achievements for Suhrawardy's government. On the other hand, the One Unit was quite a success in East Pakistan. Amid political disturbances, massive labour strikes, and civil disorder instigated at the behest of right-wing and left-wing parties, Suhrawardy was forced to halt the One Unit and finally abandoning the controversial sections of One Unit in 1956. The four provinces successfully retained their geographical status while the East-Pakistan was evolved into one single large province with overwhelming Bengali population.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{the living}} {{standard}} {{for people in}} Pakistan declined as inflation and unemployment grew at an exponential rate particularly as UN sanctions began to take effect. During her first and second term, the difference {{between rich and poor}} visibly increased and the middle class in particular were the ones who bore the brunt of the economic inequality. According to a calculation completed by the Federal Bureau of Statistics, the rich were statistically were improved and the poor declined in terms of living standards. Benazir attributed this economic inequality to be a result of ongoing and continuous illegal Bangladeshi immigration. Bhutto ordered a crackdown on and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. Her action strained and created tensions in Bangladesh–Pakistan relations, as Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia refused to accept the deportees and reportedly sent two planeloads back to Pakistan. <b>Religious</b> <b>parties</b> also criticised Bhutto and dubbed the crackdown as anti-Islamic.|$|E
25|$|During {{a massive}} {{political}} rally in 1951, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan {{was assassinated in}} Rawalpindi, and Nazimuddin became the second prime minister. Tensions in Eastern Pakistan reached to its climax in 1952, when the East-Pakistani police opened fire on students near the Dhaka Medical College protesting for Bengali language to receive equal status with Urdu. The situation was controlled by Nazimuddin who gave a waiver to Bengali language as equal status, a right codified in the 1956 constitution. In 1953 at the instigation of <b>religious</b> <b>parties,</b> anti-Ahmadiyya riots erupted, which led to many Ahmadi deaths. The riots were investigated by a two-member court of inquiry in 1954, which was criticised by the Jamaat-e-Islami, {{one of the parties}} accused of inciting the riots. This event led to the first instance of martial law in the country and began the inroad of military intervention into the politics and civilian affairs of the country.|$|E

25|$|In 1973 {{a serious}} {{nationalist}} rebellion also {{took place in}} Balochistan province and {{this led to the}} harsh suppression of Baloch rebels with the Shah of Iran purportedly assisting with air support in order to prevent the conflict from spilling over into Iranian Balochistan. The conflict ended later after an amnesty and subsequent stabilization by the provincial military administrator Rahimuddin Khan. Bhutto and his government carried out major reforms such as the establishment and development and re-designing of the country's infrastructure, the establishment of the Joint Chiefs Committee (as well Joint Strategic Forces Command), the reorganization of the military, special forces and chain of commands in the military. Steps were taken for democratization of civil bureaucracy, election commission and the political structure, expansion of country's economic and human infrastructure growth, starting first with the agriculture, land reforms, and government-control (nationalization) of major private industries, industrialization and the expansion of the higher education system throughout the country. In 1974, Bhutto succumbed to increasing pressure from <b>religious</b> <b>parties</b> and helped Parliament to declare the Ahmadiyya adherents as non-Muslims. Bhutto's efforts undermined and dismantled the private-sector and conservative approach for political power in country's political setup.|$|E

500|$|The 1980s saw {{not only}} Mormons, but many Christian groups vying for {{representation}} and {{space in the}} city. These groups constantly faced opposition from a strong political minority of Orthodox Jews living in the city. Neither major political party in Israel (the Likud and Labor Parties) could achieve a majority vote in the Knesset without support from the more <b>religious</b> <b>parties.</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>parties</b> used this situation to pass laws in favor of Jewish Orthodoxy {{in exchange for their}} support on other issues. At the time, the conservative Jews, who made up the [...] "religious right" [...] in Israel, or the Haredim, constituted 27% of the population of Jerusalem, and was decidedly against the building of the BYU Jerusalem Center or any other similar Christian structure. Larger parties faced loss of a majority if they stood opposite on this issue. Many Israeli officials, however, such as the Mayor of Jerusalem at the time, Teddy Kollek, along with others in attendance at the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden dedication, supported the center because of what the church had done for the city. Kollek specifically stated that [...] "the Mormon church's presence in Jerusalem can do a great deal of work in providing the bridge of understanding between the Arab and Jews...because its members look with sympathy and understanding at both sides." [...] The land on which the center was built was then still considered Arab land by many, and many officials saw that its lease would add an image of religious tolerance to their government and increase Israeli control of the land.|$|E
