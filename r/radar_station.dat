5|$|The {{arrival of}} the British force caught Tirpitz by surprise. While the {{aircraft}} had first been {{picked up by a}} German <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> shortly after they crossed the Norwegian coastline, the battleship was not immediately warned. At the time of the attack Tirpitz was preparing to sail for her high-speed trials, and her crew were busy unmooring the vessel. Her five protective destroyers had already departed for the trials area in Stjern Sound. The warning from the <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> arrived shortly before the British aircraft appeared over Kaafjord, and the battleship's crew were {{still in the process of}} moving to their battle stations when the attack commenced; at this time not all of the watertight doors were closed and some damage-control stations were not fully manned.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{model of}} {{the area around the}} <b>radar</b> <b>station,</b> used to brief troops taking part in the assault, is preserved in the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum, at the Imperial War Museum Duxford.|$|E

5|$|Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 {{ordered his}} dive bomber units to begin {{operations}} against the radar stations and airfields {{on the southern}} coast of Britain. The targets {{on the afternoon of}} 18 August were RAF Ford, RAF Thorney Island and Gosport, all belonging to the Fleet Air Arm or Coastal Command. Included in the target selection was the <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> at Poling, West Sussex, near Littlehampton.|$|E
5|$|Poling took severe {{punishment}} {{from very}} accurate bombing. Since Ventnor <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> had been knocked out already, this attack demonstrated that {{an attack on}} Fighter Command's command, communication and control system was possible. Emergency equipment had been installed on the site {{in case of a}} breakdown, but the information and reading of the radar was significantly less reliable. In fact, Poling was so badly damaged it was out of action for the rest of August. Fortunately, the CH chain had a mobile <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> at the Isle of Wight to fill in for it. Another was due to be set up near Poling anyway, so the chain remained unaffected. The damage done to Kenley and Poling were no more than inconveniences to Park and Dowding. Only one WAAF member, Avis Parsons, was studying the plots at Poling up until the attack. She was awarded the Military Medal for her actions on 5 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|The British {{followed}} the main raids and {{were aware of}} all the approaching aircraft, save for the low-altitude 9 Staffel. The <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> near Dover began reporting a build-up over the Pas-de-Calais area. This activity increased until 12:45 when six separate concentrations were reported. The plotters estimated {{the strength of the}} force as 350 aircraft, one-third more than the actual size.|$|E
50|$|The <b>radar</b> <b>stations</b> were redesignated with NORAD {{identification}} numbers Z-2, etc. on July 31, 1963. The SAGE centers were subsequently {{replaced with the}} full operational capability of 7 Joint Surveillance System centers on December 23, 1980, and remaining <b>radar</b> <b>stations</b> of the permanent network include the former 1951 P-37, P-38, and RP-39 which became FAA Ground Equipment Facility <b>radar</b> <b>stations</b> of the Joint Surveillance System.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: SAGE <b>radar</b> <b>stations</b> {{were grouped}} by Air Defense Sectors (Air Divisions after 1966). The SAGE System {{networked}} the <b>radar</b> <b>stations</b> in over 20 of the sectors using AN/FSQ-7 centrals in Direction Centers.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, {{the weather}} bureau is now {{constructing}} {{at least two}} more Doppler weather <b>radar</b> <b>stations</b> in Busuanga (Palawan) and Zamboanga City,. It aims to have thirteen operational <b>radar</b> <b>stations</b> nationwide by the end of 2013.|$|R
5|$|The Bruneval raid or Operation Biting in February 1942 {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{missions}} planned by Combined Operations Headquarters that used all three of the British Armed Forces. An attacking force from 'C' Company, 2nd Parachute Battalion would be parachuted into France by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and later evacuated by the Royal Navy. Their objective was a German Würzburg <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> on the coast of France, which British scientists wanted to examine.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} {{long-range}} <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> at Poling caused few problems. The Chain Home Low radar there was working and could see almost as far out to sea. Along the surrounding coastline, for 70 miles, another six radar stations gave interlocking stations which provided cover, {{so there was no}} hole in the system. Within a few days, mobile units were moved into wooded areas nearby to provide cover until Poling was repaired.|$|E
5|$|At these speeds, it was {{expected}} that the B-70 would be almost immune to interceptor aircraft, the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time. The bomber would spend only a few minutes over a particular <b>radar</b> <b>station,</b> flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception. High speed also made the aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude flight could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet fighter.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{operations}} room at RAF Uxbridge was disturbed by {{a visit from}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Most of the plotting tables were bare, save for a few plots indicating German reconnaissance machines. Most of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) were relaxing, in spite of Churchill’s presence (he had ordered that they not behave any differently). However, at 10:30 the first German aircraft triggered the alarm at Chain Home <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> at Dover. The filter room at Stanmore recognised the formation as hostile. The WAAF detailed group and sector commands throughout the south that 40-plus enemy aircraft were entering Kentish airspace.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{warships}} {{reached the}} flying-off position for Implacables air group at 5:30 am on 14 June. Ten minutes later, twelve Seafires and two Fireflies were launched. The Seafires strafed a <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> and an airfield on Moen island, and the Fireflies reconnoitred the atoll. A Seafire {{equipped with a}} reconnaissance camera also photographed Japanese installations; these photos were used to plan further air attacks and bombardments. One of the Seafires was shot down while attacking the airfield, resulting {{in the death of}} its pilot. This was the only British aircraft to be lost in combat during Operation Inmate.|$|E
5|$|At Green Beach to the west, {{part of the}} South Saskatchewan Regiment was {{landed on}} the wrong side of the Scie River, necessitating an assault over the machine gun swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of Pourville was {{captured}} but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and a <b>radar</b> <b>station.</b> The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders were landed with the objective of moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II over 350 soldiers of the Royal Artillery were stationed on the island. Flat Holm was re-armed with four 4.5-inch guns and associated searchlights for anti-aircraft and close defence, together with two 40mm Bofors guns. A GL (Gun Laying) Mk II <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> was also placed in {{the centre of the}} island. The structures formed part of the Fixed Defences, and protected the Atlantic shipping convoys between Cardiff, Barry, and Flat Holm. These works were abandoned after the war and the island has had no military use since. Flat Holm's helipad still remains, however, at the centre of the island.|$|E
5|$|I./StG 77 were {{to strike}} at Thorney Island with 28 Ju 87s; 28 II./StG 77 were {{assigned}} to Ford; and 31 III./StG 77 Ju 87s were to destroy Poling <b>radar</b> <b>station.</b> A fourth unit, Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 (StG 3 or Dive Bombing Wing 3), sent 22 Ju 87s to attack Gosport. The dive-bombers were supported by 157 Bf 109s; 70 from JG 27; 32 from JG 53 acting as close escort; and 55 from JG 2 which was to sweep the Portsmouth area {{in advance of the}} main raid independently. The Ju 87s were based around Caen, too far away for the attacks. So in the morning the Stukas were moved into closer airfields around Cherbourg, right on the Channel coast. There, fuel tanks were filled, bombs loaded, and crews given a final briefing.|$|E
5|$|The {{extremely}} {{short distance}} of the eyewall of Hurricane Danny from a Doppler <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> in Mobile, Alabama and its slow landfall {{over the course of}} a day led to further study by meteorologists. The proximity to land allowed for measurements at a level closer to the surface than it is possible for hurricane reconnaissance aircraft to achieve, with the slow landfall allowing for more extended observation. One conclusion of the study included the need to sample the boundaries of an eyewall more to establish a better estimate of surface-level winds and the overall intensity of a storm. Another conclusion was that while Danny's slow movement positioned it over a tidal estuary bordering the Gulf, maintaining of or increase in strength was possible since eyewall convection remained over waters with high sea surface temperatures and other environmental conditions remained favorable.|$|E

50|$|Shortly after, {{the pair}} {{were picked up}} by NATO <b>radar</b> <b>stations</b> near Warburg, in {{southern}} Westphalia, heading east, {{in the direction of}} Königs Wusterhausen, south of Berlin.

5|$|The {{site of the}} Normandy {{landings}} is {{a popular}} tourist destination. The battery at Longues-sur-Mer is well preserved, and its observation bunker houses a visitor centre. The gun emplacements at Le Hamel and La Rivière still exist, but many other batteries and defensive positions {{have been allowed to}} decay. Bayeux is home to the Musée Mémorial de la Bataille de Normandie and the Bayeux Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery. La Cambe German war cemetery is also near Bayeux. At Arromanches, many elements of the Mulberry Harbour are extant and a museum examines its construction and use. The <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> is the site of a visitor centre and theatre.|$|E
5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a <b>radar</b> <b>station</b> and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} phase of attacks, shipping, coastal airfields, radar and {{stations}} south of London were attacked during 8–18 August. The Luftwaffe gradually increased the frequency of attacks. German bombers also raided targets as far north as Liverpool during night hours. The first major raid inland and against RAF airfields came on 12 August. RAF Hawkinge, Lympne, Manston and radar stations at Pevensey, Rye and Dover were to be destroyed. Portsmouth docks were also targeted. The results of the raids were mixed. The <b>Radar</b> <b>station</b> at Ventnor was badly damaged and others targeted were also damaged, but not destroyed. All were in working order by the following morning. The attacks against the harbour and RAF stations had failed to destroy them. All were not in fully working order {{by the end of the}} day, but were back in action the following morning. Unknown to German intelligence, Lympne itself was not even an operational station. This sort of intelligence blunder contributed to the failure of Adlertag.|$|E
