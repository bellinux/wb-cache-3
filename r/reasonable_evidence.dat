500|$|The main {{building}} of the monastic compound is Surp Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) church. The exact date of the {{building of the}} church is unknown. It is generally regarded as an 11th-13th century complex, but the current church has been built on an earlier foundation. Kirakos Gandzaketsi mentions that Ivane Zakarian was buried in the church in 1227. Stepanos Orbelian refers to the church in 1216. Modern researchers date the murals within the church to 1205–1216. Princess Mariam, the daughter of Gurgen II (Kyurikeh II) made a record in 1188 {{on the back of a}} khachkar found in a place called Ayor adjacent to Akhtala which refers to the construction of the Holy Mother of God church at Akhtala. The inscription on the khackar states the following: [...] "I, the daughter if Kyurikeh, Mariam, erected Surp Astvatsatsin at Pghndzahank, those who honor us remember us in their prayers." [...] In 1185 Mariam had constructed the narthex of the main church in Haghpat. According to some local lore, the church was built in the 7th century by Byzantine emperor of Armenian extraction, Heraclius. Another legend assumes that the church was built in the 5th century by Georgian King Vakhtang I Gorgasali. There is no <b>reasonable</b> <b>evidence</b> to support either story. [...] The church used to contain the cross which according to folklore was used by John the Baptist to baptise Jesus Christ. Vasak, the father of Prince Prosh, is said to have given this relic to Ivane Zakarian who later sold it for a large sum to the monastery of Noravank in Syunik.|$|E

2500|$|This type of revisionism, which Talbot {{describes}} as [...] "social memories" [...] and which persist {{to the present}} day, reappeared in the 16th century with the Prataparudra Caritramu hagiography, which claimed {{him to be the}} founder of the padmanayaka class of Telugu warrior and provided the elite of the Vijayanagara empire with what Talbot has described as a [...] "charter of legitimacy". This work claimed, contrary to all <b>reasonable</b> <b>evidence,</b> that he did not die after being taken prisoner but instead met with the sultan, was recognised as being an avatar of Shiva, and allowed to return to Orugallu. Once back home, the Prataparudra Caritamu says, he released the padmanayakas from their allegiance to him and told them to become independent kings. The work also claims Vijayanagara to be an ally of Prataparudra, which is clearly anachronistic but served the purpose of elevating the role of the padmanayakas, whom it claimed to be ultimately subordinate to Vijayanagara during his time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{surgical}} treatment for velopalatal insufficiency may cause {{obstructive sleep apnea}} syndrome.

This p sound, a plosive, is normally produced with the nasal airway closes off - all air comes out of the pursed lips, none from the nose. If it is impossible to say the sound without fogging a nasal mirror, there is an air leak - <b>reasonable</b> <b>evidence</b> of poor palatal closure.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} long-run {{equilibrium}} relationships, temporal dynamic relationships and causal relationships between energy consumption structure, economic structure and energy intensity in China. Time series variables over the periods from 1980 to 2006 {{are employed in}} empirical tests. Cointegration tests suggest that these three variables tend to move together in the long-run. In addition, Granger causality tests indicate {{that there is a}} unidirectional causality running from energy intensity to economic structure but not vice versa. Impulse response analysis provides <b>reasonable</b> <b>evidences</b> that one shock of the three variables will cause the periods of destabilized that followed. However, the impact of the energy consumption structure shock on energy intensity and the impact of the economic structure shock on energy consumption structure seem to be rather marginal. The findings have significant implications {{from the point of view}} of energy conservation and economic development. In order to decrease energy intensity, Chinese government must continue to reduce the proportion of coal in energy consumption, increase the utilization efficiency of coal and promote the upgrade of economic structure. Furthermore, a full analysis of factors that may relate to energy intensity (e. g. energy consumption structure, economic structure) should be conducted before making energy policies.

6000|$|I {{should think}} that few {{men have been}} born with the {{material}} for self-sufficient contentment more completely within himself than Edward Gibbon. He had every gift which a great scholar should have, an insatiable thirst for learning in every form, immense industry, a retentive memory, and that broadly philosophic temperament which enables a man {{to rise above the}} partisan and to become the impartial critic of human affairs. It is true that {{at the time he was}} looked upon as bitterly prejudiced in the matter of religious thought, but his views are familiar to modern philosophy, and would shock no susceptibilities in these more liberal (and more virtuous) days. Turn him up in that Encyclopedia, and see what the latest word is upon his contentions. [...] "Upon the famous fifteenth and sixteenth chapters it is not necessary to dwell," [...] says the biographer, [...] "because at this time of day no Christian apologist dreams of denying the substantial truth of any of the more important allegations of Gibbon. Christians may complain of the suppression of some circumstances which might influence the general result, and they must remonstrate against the unfair construction of their case. But they no longer refuse to hear any <b>reasonable</b> <b>evidence</b> tending to show that persecution was less severe than had been once believed, and they have slowly learned that they can afford to concede the validity of all the secondary causes assigned by Gibbon and even of others still more discreditable. The fact is, as the historian has again and again admitted, that his account of the secondary causes which contributed to the progress and establishment of Christianity leaves the question as to the natural or supernatural origin of Christianity practically untouched." [...] This is all very well, but in that case how about the century of abuse which has been showered upon the historian? Some posthumous apology would seem to be called for.|$|E
