50|$|The Japanese {{versions}} offered electrically folding power mirrors, 8-way power {{drivers seat}} with power recline {{for the seat}} back, and infrared keyless <b>remote</b> <b>entry</b> integrated into the ignition key. The GT and VZ had a feature where the driver's door could be opened without using a key or remote, using a driver programmed security code that was entered by pulling the exterior door handle a specific number of times, in accordance with a 4-digit security code found in its memory. This feature was only installed on vehicles with the infrared keyless remote. Vehicles equipped with the infrared keyless remote feature can be identified by having a dark plastic receiver patch installed on the driver's door handle, located directly above the entry lock keyhole. The transmitter installed in the ignition key was aimed at this receiver patch on the door handle.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} a teleoperated mobile robot system being developed at JPL {{for use by}} the JPL Fire Department/HAZMAT Team. The project, which began in October 1990, is focused on prototyping a robotic vehicle which can be quickly deployed and easily operated by HAZMAT Team personnel allowing <b>remote</b> <b>entry</b> and exploration of a hazardous material incident site. The close involvement of JPL Fire Department personnel has been critical in establishing system requirements as well as evaluating the system. The current robot, called HAZBOT III, has been especially designed for operation in environments that may contain combustible gases. Testing of the system with the Fire Department has shown that teleoperated robots can successfully gain access to incident sites allowing hazardous material spills to be remotely located and identified.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{design and}} locomotion analysis {{efforts to develop}} a new reconfigurable and collapsible working machine, dubbed Houdini (see Figure 1), to remotely clean up hazardous-waste and petroleum storage tanks. The tethered robot system is designed to allow <b>remote</b> <b>entry</b> through man-way openings as small as 0. 61 m (24 ") in diameter, after which it expands its locomotors and opens up its collapsible backhoe/manipulator and plow to subsequently perform waste or material handling operations. The design is optimized to meet stringent site and safety requirements, and represents a viable alternative to (i) the long-reach manipulation systems proposed for hazardous storage tank cleanup, and (ii) confined-entry manual cleanup approaches. The system development has been funded to provide waste mobilization and removal solutions for the hazardous waste storage tanks in the Department of Energy (DoE) Fernald and Oak Ridge complexes.

40|$|A graphic {{monitor program}} is described. It was {{developed}} at Carnegie-Mellon University for the CDC G 21 computer, {{which is a}} general purpose, batch-processing system with <b>remote</b> <b>entry.</b> The existing G 21 system and the graphics hardware are described. The graphic monitor is a resident auxiliary monitor which provides comprehensive managerial capability over the graphical system in response to commands from the human user. It also will respond to commands from a user program through a similar interface, where routine calls {{take the place of}} manual actions. Thus the human and program can interact on a symmetrical and equal basis through the medium of the graphic monitor. The choices made in designing the graphic monitor, given the constraints of the existing hardware and computer system, are discussed. The structure of the monitor program and the human and program interfaces are described. There is also a transient swapping version with a small resident part, and provision for swapped used submonitors.
