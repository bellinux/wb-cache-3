25|$|Subtitle {{translation}} can {{be different}} from the translation of written text. Usually, during the process of creating subtitles for a film or television program, the picture and each sentence of the audio are analyzed by the subtitle translator; also, the subtitle translator {{may or may not have}} access to a written transcript of the dialog. Especially in the field of commercial subtitles, the subtitle translator often interprets what is meant, rather than translating the manner in which the dialog is stated; that is, the meaning is more important than the form—the audience does not always appreciate this, as it can be frustrating for people who are familiar with some of the spoken language; spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied meanings that cannot be conveyed in the written subtitles. Also, the subtitle translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable <b>reading</b> <b>speed,</b> whereby purpose is more important than form.|$|E

25|$|The Kindle Paperwhite (1st generation) was {{announced}} on September 6, 2012, and released on October 1. It has a 6in, 212PPI E Ink Pearl display (758×1024 resolution) with four built-in LEDs {{to illuminate the}} screen. It was available in Wi-Fi ($120 ad-supported, $140 no ads) and Wi-Fi + 3G ($180 ad-supported, $200 no ads) models, with the ad-supported options only intended to {{be available in the}} United States. The light {{is one of the main}} features of the Paperwhite and it has a manually adjusted light level. The 3G access restrictions are the same as the Kindle Touch, and usage of the 3G data is limited to 50 MB per month and only on Amazon and Wikipedia's websites; additional data may be purchased. Battery life is advertised as up to eight weeks of reading with half an hour per day with wireless off and constant light usage; this usage equals 28 hours. The official leather cover for the Paperwhite uses the hall effect sensor in the device that detects when the cover is closed/opened to turn the screen off/on respectively. This device was the first Kindle to track one's <b>reading</b> <b>speed</b> to estimate when one will finish a chapter or book; this feature was later included with updates to the other Kindles and Kindle Fire tablets. The Kindle Paperwhite lacks physical buttons for page turning and does not perform auto-hyphenation. Except for the lock screen/power button at its bottom, it relies solely on the touchscreen interface. In November 2012, Amazon released the 5.3.0 update that allowed users to turn off recommended content on the home screen in Grid View (allowing two rows of user content) and included general bug fixes. In March 2014, the Paperwhite 5.4.4 update was released that added Goodreads integration, Kindle FreeTime to restrict usage for children, Cloud Collections for organization and Page Flip for scanning content without losing your place, which closely matched the Paperwhite 2's software features.|$|E

THE APPLICATION OF SPEED READING AT INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (A Case Study of Qualitative Research in One of Senior High School at Majalengka) Reading is the {{important}} things in education, because people can get knowledge and information from reading. Without reading people cannot absorb many sciences. Here, the researcher use <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> technique as the tool of analyzing to know the learning and teaching process at intermediate level. Moreover, the aims of this research are (1). To know {{the teaching and learning}} process of <b>speed</b> <b>reading.</b> (2). To know students’ attitude towards teaching and learning <b>speed</b> <b>reading.</b> (3). To know overcome of the difficulties of <b>speed</b> <b>reading.</b> Theoretically, is regarding to the reading area, especially in the reading comprehension by using <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> technique. Practically, the researcher will analyze of <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> in one of Senior High School at Majalengka which has benefit for teacher to know students’ ability in school. The research finding and discussion told about the teaching and learning process of <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> at intermediate level. There are three activities of <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> techniques. (1) Preparation Activity: teacher begins with greetings, deliver material and prepare students by warming up to focuss in learning process. (2) Core Activity: teacher teaches all the materials of <b>speed</b> <b>reading.</b> (3) Follow-up Activity: teacher gives exercise as the activity to know students score of <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> test. The result of the analysis shows there are 5 students’ attitude towards teaching and learning <b>speed</b> <b>reading.</b> then, the finding shows that (1). Students’ feeling towards teaching and learning using <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> in general: students like <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> then also comfortable. (2). Students’ feeling towards the process of teaching and learning speed reading: they get comprehension of this technique. (3). Students’ difficulties in learning using speed reading: there are unfamiliar word on athe text. (4). Students’ feeling towards their comprehension in learning using speed reading: they get purpose in <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> learning. (5). Students’ motivation in learning using speed reading: they can read books in fast time. It was found the overcome of difficulties of <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> technique they are the process of the teaching <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> and response the students’ response towards it, difficulties, disadvantages and teaching using <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> technique and the result, usefulness, critics, and suggestions of teaching using <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> technique. From the research that has been done, it can be concluded that there is way to apply <b>speed</b> <b>reading</b> by using steps of <b>speed</b> <b>reading.</b> From this technique will increase students’ ability in reading process.
