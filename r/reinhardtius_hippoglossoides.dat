25|$|Belugas play an {{important}} role in the structure and function of marine resources in the Arctic Ocean, as they are the most abundant toothed whales in the region. They are opportunistic feeders; their feeding habits depend on their locations and the season. For example, when they are in the Beaufort Sea, they mainly eat Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and the stomachs of belugas caught near Greenland were found to contain rose fish (Sebastes marinus), Greenland halibut (<b>Reinhardtius</b> <b>hippoglossoides),</b> and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), while in Alaska their staple diet is Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In general, the diets of these cetaceans consist mainly of fish; apart from those previously mentioned, other fish they feed on include capelin (Mallotus villosus), smelt, sole, flounder, herring, sculpin, and other types of salmon. They also consume a great quantity of invertebrates, apart from shrimp, such as squid, crabs, clams, octopus, sea snails, bristle worms, and other deep-sea species. Animals in captivity eat 2.5% to 3.0% of their body weight per day, which equates to 18.2 to 27.2kg.|$|E

50|$|Narwhals have a {{very intense}} summer feeding society. One study {{published}} in the Canadian Journal of Zoology tested 73 narwhals of different age and gender to see what they ate. The individuals were from the Pond Inlet and had their stomach contents tested from June 1978 until September 1979. The study found in 1978 that the Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) made up about 51% of the diet of the narwhals, with the next most common animal being the Greenland halibut (<b>Reinhardtius</b> <b>hippoglossoides),</b> consisting of 37% of the weight of their diet. A year later, the percentages of both animals in the diet of narwhals had changed. Arctic cod represented 57%, and Greenland halibut 29% in 1979. The deep-water fish - halibut, redfish (Sebastes marinus), and polar cod (Arctogadus glacialis) - are found in the diet of the males, which means that the narwhals can dive deeper than 500 m below sea level. The study found that the dietary needs of the narwhal did not differ among genders or ages.|$|E

40|$|Data were {{obtained}} from 682 demersal trawls made between 126 and 738 m depths on Flemish Cap in summer during the European Union research surveys in the years 1989 – 94. Despite {{the fact that the}} depth range for all species was not completely covered, analysis of different deep distributions of the 25 most representative species showed that the fauna are zoned with depth. Three faunal assemblages with characteristic catch rates, diversity and dominant species were found on the shelf (126 – 300 m), upper continental slope (300 – 600 m) and middle continental slope (> 600 m). Catch rates were greatest on the shelf and upper continental slope, while diversity was greatest on the middle continental slope. Domi-nance of the commercial species Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the shelf, beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) and Labrador redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) on upper continental slope, and Greenland halibut (<b>Reinhardtius</b> <b>hippoglossoides)</b> on the middle continental slope. This showed an important aspect of the community structure. Diversity patterns may be under-stood in terms of the relationships with predation, competition, environmental heterogeneity and trophic level. Also the influence of the fisheries in the area can modify this structure.
