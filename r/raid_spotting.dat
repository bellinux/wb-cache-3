50|$|The {{squadron}} {{was originally}} formed on 3 April 1933 as a Spotter Reconnaissance squadron. During World War II, the squadron carried out various duties, such as convoy protection, bombing <b>raids,</b> <b>spotting</b> for gunnery bombardments and attacks on enemy destroyers. The squadron {{took part in}} the Battle of Taranto on 11 November 1940, where together with aircraft from 813, 815 and 819 squadrons flying from HMS Illustrious, it successfully attacked the Italian Battle Squadron. It was disbanded 10 times between 1934 and 1970, in that time it was equipped with the Fairey Seal, Fairey Swordfish, Fairey Barracuda, Fairey Firefly and finally the Fairey Gannet.|$|R

The Scot opened the shelter hatch and threw a grenade down it. Macpherson was shot by an Italian officer, who arrived late but whom he succeeded in stabbing after a struggle.|$|R
50|$|This unit {{formed a}} corps and was {{independent}} {{at the same}} title of an actual regiment, much as its equipment {{as well as its}} missions. The squadron was stationed at ksar El Hirane, near Laghouat and mounted police patrols in the desert as well launched <b>raids</b> on <b>spotted</b> positions of the enemy.|$|R
50|$|The <b>raid</b> {{was soon}} <b>spotted</b> by the Chinese and the Chinese {{intelligence}} {{reported that a}} number of Japanese bombers had taken-off from an airfield Taiwan, crossed the Formosa Strait and were heading north over Zhejiang in the direction of Hangzhou. At this time, Hangzhou was only defended by a handful of Curtiss Hawk IIIs flown by instructors from the Central Chinese Aviation Academy since reinforcements from Zhoujiakou hadn't been able to fly in due to bad weather. Colonel Gao had previously flown from Nanchang to Jianqiao to await the 4th PG's Hawk III's, which were flying in from Zhoujiakou in the Henan Province and which was under his command.|$|R
50|$|Three armed assailants {{attack a}} woman who {{turns out to be}} NYPD Detective Sergeant Deke DaSilva in drag. His partner, Detective Sergeant Matthew Fox, immobilizes two of the assailants; Deke chases the third upstairs to a subway-station platform, taunts him and incapacitates him with a scarf. That day in London, {{terrorist}} Heymar Reinhardt (alias Wulfgar) bombs a department store. In New York City, DaSilva and Fox serve a high-risk warrant in the Bronx. They <b>raid</b> a drug-distribution <b>spot,</b> where they discover corrupt police officers among the dealers. After the arrests DaSilva meets his estranged wife, Irene, and tells her he loves her; although she initially rebuffs his advances, they eventually reconcile.|$|R

50|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} is {{a predator}} of great tits, {{with the young}} from second broods being at higher risk {{partly because of the}} hawk's greater need for food for its own developing young. The nests of great tits are <b>raided</b> by great <b>spotted</b> woodpeckers, particularly when nesting in certain types of nest boxes. Other nest predators include introduced grey squirrels (in Britain) and least weasels, which are able to take nesting adults as well. A species of biting louse (Mallophaga) described as Rostrinirmus hudeci was isolated and described in 1981 from great tits in central Europe. The hen flea Ceratophyllus gallinae is exceedingly common in the nests of blue and great tits. It was originally a specialist tit flea, but the dry, crowded conditions of chicken runs enabled it to flourish with its new host. This flea is preferentially predated by the clown beetle Gnathoncus punctulatus, The rove beetle Microglotta pulla also feeds on fleas and their larvae. Although these beetles often remain in deserted nests, they can only breed in the elevated temperatures produced by brooding birds, tits being the preferred hosts.|$|R
50|$|Two coastal defence {{batteries}} at Hartlepool returned fire, launching 143 shells, {{and damaging}} three German ships: SMS Seydlitz, SMS Moltke and SMS Blücher. The Hartlepool engagement lasted roughly 50 minutes, and the coastal artillery defence {{was supported by}} the Royal Navy in the form of four destroyers, two light cruisers and a submarine, none of which had any significant impact on the German attackers.Private Theophilus Jones of the 18th Battalion Durham Light Infantry, who fell {{as a result of this}} bombardment, is sometimes described as the first military casualty on British soil by enemy fire. This event (the death of the first soldiers on British soil) is commemorated by the 1921 Redheugh Gardens War Memorial together with a plaque unveiled on the same day (seven years and one day after the East Coast <b>Raid)</b> at the <b>spot</b> on the Headland (the memorial by Philip Bennison illustrates four soldiers on one of four cartouches and the plaque, donated by a member of the public, refers to the 'first soldier' but gives no name). A living history group, the Hartlepool Military Heritage Memorial Society, portray men of that unit for educational and memorial purposes.|$|R
