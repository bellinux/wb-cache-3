5|$|M.C. Curthoys and H.S. Jones {{argue that}} the rise of {{organised}} sport {{was one of the}} most <b>remarkable</b> <b>and</b> distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton and Harrow.|$|E
5|$|Following Rhoda, Kavner had a guest {{appearance}} on Taxi and {{appeared in the}} 1985 comedy Bad Medicine {{as well as the}} 1987 film Surrender, both of which were box office failures. She appeared in the television movies Revenge of the Stepford Wives, No Other Love and A Fine Romance, and shot a television pilot. She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called It Had to be You at a dinner theater in Canada, Particular Friendships in New York City in 1981, and Two for the Seesaw, directed by Burt Reynolds. Woody Allen first saw Kavner one night while he was watching Rhoda in the 1970s. He thought that she was <b>remarkable</b> <b>and</b> later offered her a role in his 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters. Kavner agreed, and credits Allen and the film with rejuvenating her career.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} {{bacteria}} to degrade {{a variety of}} organic compounds is <b>remarkable</b> <b>and</b> {{has been used in}} waste processing and bioremediation. Bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills. Fertiliser was added to some of the beaches in Prince William Sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the bioremediation of industrial toxic wastes. In the chemical industry, bacteria are most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals.|$|E

5|$|Perry and Whitford {{returned}} to Aerosmith in 1984 {{and the band}} signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It {{was not until the}} band's collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described {{as one of the most}} <b>remarkable</b> <b>and</b> spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year, except 2008. After 47 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music, but is embarking on a farewell tour that will likely last several years.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} <b>remarkable</b> <b>and</b> {{accomplished}} poems {{in the manuscript}} are both long exercises in a late form of alliterative verse with a superimposed rhyme-scheme: Pater Noster and The Three Dead Kings.

Four of these, on Plato’s Timaeus, could by themselves form a monograph, and are probably the most distinguished and important work on Plato done within the last forty years.|$|E

25|$|Autari died in 590, {{probably}} due to poisoning in a palace plot and, according to the legend recorded by Paul the Deacon, the succession to the throne was decided in a novel fashion. It was the young widowed Queen Theodelinda, who chose {{the heir to the}} throne and her new husband: the Duke of Turin, Agilulf. The following year (591) Agilulf received the official investiture from the Assembly of the Lombards, held in Milan. The influence of the queen over Agilulf's policies was <b>remarkable</b> <b>and</b> major decisions are attributed to both.|$|E
25|$|Otago Peninsula's coasts are {{prominent}} habitats for marine mammals. Seal and sea lion colonies have regenerated during the 20th century after massive exploitation in the 19th century which almost wiped out both them and whales. A number of New Zealand fur seals and Hooker's sea lions currently breed around Taiaroa Head. Otago Peninsula {{is considered a}} <b>remarkable</b> <b>and</b> pioneering habitat, especially for sea lions, {{as it is the}} only continual breeding ground on a main inhabited island.

25|$|For {{at least}} 26 years, Rameau was a {{professional}} organist {{in the service of}} religious institutions, and yet the body of sacred music he composed is exceptionally small and his organ works nonexistent. Judging by the evidence, it was not his favourite field, but rather, simply a way of making reasonable money. Rameau's few religious compositions are nevertheless <b>remarkable</b> <b>and</b> compare favourably to the works of specialists in the area. Only four motets have been attributed to Rameau with any certainty: Deus noster refugium, In convertendo, Quam dilecta, and Laboravi.|$|E

25|$|Instead, Basildon is <b>remarkable</b> <b>and</b> {{notable for}} its {{survival}} {{against all odds}} in the 20th century. At {{a time when it}} was near ruin and its destruction seemed inevitable, it was saved. Since 1900, over 1,000 country houses, many of far greater architectural importance than Basildon, have been demolished. The destruction of many of these houses began as a trickle just prior to World War I, but became a tidal wave in 1955, when one house was demolished every five days. The destruction did not halt until 1975, by which time the Iliffe's restoration work at Basildon was almost completed.|$|E
25|$|Jacob Owen Absher: In the mid-1920s, a <b>remarkable</b> <b>and</b> {{persistent}} experimenter named Jacob Owen Absher {{incorporated the}} Bituminous Sand Extraction Company. In 1926, Absher received a Canadian patent for his in situ experiments, and he carried on numerous experiments {{over the following}} five years - efforts that drew the interest of oil sands pioneers Sidney Ells and Karl Clark. Absher not only used steam to melt the bitumen, but also tried igniting fires within his wells. In the end, however, {{he was unable to}} produce oil from the oil sands.
