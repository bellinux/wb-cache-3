5|$|The {{earthquake}} and its precursor tremor struck {{during the afternoon}} near an extremely populated area, with most buildings in the area already left in precarious conditions by previous earthquakes. It affected roughly 400,000 people directly, {{most of whom were}} estimated to have experienced at least strong (MM VI) shaking. Hospital officials confirmed at least 46 injuries after its occurrence; falling debris struck several people, while two others were left in critical condition. In the city centre, two workers had to be rescued from a collapsed church and were promptly hospitalised. The morning after, officials confirmed an elderly man had died after being knocked unconscious in a <b>rest</b> <b>home</b> when the earthquake struck. Mass casualties were avoided owing to a combination of building evacuations prompted by the weaker shock and an epicentre removed from populous areas.|$|E

5|$|Word about Barrymore's {{problems}} {{on and off}} the set spread around the industry, and he did not work on another film for over a year, when he had a supporting role in the musical film Maytime. His divorce from Costello was finalized in October 1936, and he married Barrie in November the same year. The couple had a heated argument in public shortly afterwards, and he again spent time in Kelley's <b>Rest</b> <b>Home</b> and hospital, which cost him an average of $800 daily, draining his finances. When he came out, he collapsed on the Maytime set. On January 15, 1937, he was served with divorce papers, and a month later he filed for bankruptcy protection, with debts of $160,000. The divorce was granted in April, but the couple reconciled before it was finalized.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's early {{childhood}} was stable and happy. While Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, {{she was able}} to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of Hawthorne soon after the birth. They raised their foster children according to the principles of evangelical Christianity. At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to move back to the city in early 1927. She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles. Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in Hollywood. They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie. Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After several months in a <b>rest</b> <b>home,</b> she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital. She spent {{the rest of her life}} in and out of hospitals, and was rarely in contact with Monroe.|$|E
5|$|The tall flint {{tower of}} StMichael's at Ocklynge {{is one of}} Eastbourne's landmarks. The church was consecrated in 1902 and built {{on the site of}} the mission hall where the {{nonsense}} writer Lewis Carroll (the clergyman CL Dodgson) is known to have preached during his holidays in the town. All Souls, in Italian style, is a finely proportioned building with an Evangelical church tradition. Holy Trinity also has a strong history of Evangelism, particularly during the early 20th century when Canon Stephen Warner was the vicar for 28 years. There is a Greek Orthodox Church converted from a 19th-century Calvinistic chapel. The Strict Baptist Chapel in Grove Road is an interesting building, despite its rather grim street frontage. The United Reformed Church in Upperton Road has tall rogue Gothic windows set in red brick walls. Several other denominations have similarly interesting church buildings, including some of 20th century design, such as the Baptist Church in Eldon Road. The copyrights of many well-known hymns used in the English-speaking world are handled by Kingway's Thankyou Music of Eastbourne. There is a tradition of Judaism in Eastbourne, and a Jewish <b>rest</b> <b>home.</b> The Islamic community uses a small mosque that was formerly the Seeboard social club.|$|E

25|$|Palach was {{initially}} interred in Olšany Cemetery. As his gravesite was growing {{into a national}} shrine, the Czechoslovak secret police (StB) set out to destroy any memory of Palach's deed and exhumed his remains {{on the night of}} 25 October 1973. His body was then cremated and sent to his mother in Palach's native town of Všetaty while an anonymous old woman from a <b>rest</b> <b>home</b> was laid in the grave.

25|$|The partial state {{government}} shutdown of July 2005 was an unprecedented fiasco which {{will live on}} {{in the minds of}} MAPE members and other state employees who were sent home for eight days that summer with no knowledge of when they would be allowed to return to work. The governor and legislature failed to pass a state budget by the constitutional deadline of midnight on June 30, 2005 and therefore had no authority to pay thousands of the state’s employees for work performed. The politicians further attempted to divide state employees by deeming some “essential,” and sending the <b>rest</b> <b>home.</b> The “make half” settlement allowed those workers sent home, through no fault of their own to receive half of the pay or vacation hours lost ten months after the fact.|$|E

25|$|As {{time went}} on, the Army of Flanders began to enjoy various {{distinctly}} modern institutions, often {{before they were}} adopted {{by the rest of}} Europe. Alba set up a military hospital at Mechelen near Brabant in 1567; it was closed the following year, but after many complaints by mutineers it reopened in 1585, ultimately having 49 staff and 330 beds, paid for partially by the troops. The 'Garrison of our Lady of Hal' was created as a more permanent <b>rest</b> <b>home</b> for crippled veterans. A public trustee was also appointed in 1596 to administer the wills of soldiers who had fallen in service. After 1609, a number of small barracks (baraques, called after the French version of the Catalan barraca) were created away from the main urban centres to house the Army – a move that was eventually copied by other nations.|$|E
25|$|The {{river was}} an {{abundant}} source for fish, edible plants, and water, and the Albany Post Road (present-day US Route 9) {{is one of}} the Hudson Valley's oldest north-south routes. In 1697 the land along the kill was part of Water Lot 3 of Dutchess County's Nine Partner Patent. The earliest use of the site by colonists is estimated to have been around the 1750s. The saw mill, according to the study, was present in 1774. The grist mill was owned by Jeremiah Rogers, a militia officer serving on Long Island during the Revolution. The family burial ground, across the kill, has the graves of Rogers, his son and daughter, and his grandson. The property changed ownership multiple times in the 1800s. James Roosevelt owned the land as part of his estate in the 1820s, and by the 1860s a farmhouse and stone terraces were constructed along the stream by Moses Beach. In the 1890s the Webendorfer family of Long Island refurbished the farmhouse and built barns, a tenant house, and other structures. From 1919 until its destruction around 1940, St. Andrew-on-Hudson used the Webendorfer house as a <b>rest</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Army {{detailed}} Lahm to {{the fledgling}} Aeronautical Division, a {{section in the}} Office of the Chief Signal Officer (OCSO), on September 17, 1907, {{while he was still}} in Europe. His departure from France was delayed after a relapse of the typhoid he contracted in the spring of 1907 and he took convalescent leave at a <b>rest</b> <b>home</b> in St. Germain. It was in the home's garden on August 1, 1907, the very day that the Aeronautical Division came into being, that Lahm's father introduced him to Wilbur and Orville Wright. The elder Lahm had personally investigated the claims of the brothers and had been quietly promoting them among his colleagues in France since 1905. The meeting {{was the beginning of a}} friendship that lasted until the two brothers died. Lahm learned that the Army, through the reluctance and disinterest of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification, had obstructed the attempts of the Wright Brothers to provide the Army with an airplane, and immediately wrote his new superior, Chief Signal Officer (CSO) Brig. Gen. James Allen (who sat on the board), urging that favorable consideration be given their most recent proposal.|$|E

40|$|The environment, {{where we}} live, {{that means the}} {{dwelling}} environment, influences {{the quality of our}} lives very important. This space is more important for the seniors, because their abilities, which help them to move easy in our world, go down. The injuries represent a grave and special element in morbidity of the seniors. They happen more frequently, more weak is the health and functional disposition of the seniors. Compared to a younger age, their treatment is more complicated, longer and brings worse attainments and higher costs. Grave injuries are yoke together with higher mortality, than similar hurts in younger age. In this diploma work the author has tried to assess the prevention of the injuries of the seniors in the <b>rest</b> <b>homes</b> and to chart the factors, which most influence this adaptation. In {{the first part of the}} work, she alludes to attitude to the old people during the history and she mentions the actual situation in view at the old age. Other chapters treat of dividing of the periods of human life, bio-psycho-social changes in old age, most frequent health problems and their prevention, rehabilitation. In the second part of the work, the author is engaged in the survey in the <b>rest</b> <b>homes.</b> She locates in chosen institutions, if the living and life of the seniors is primary assured so, that the injury risk is minimal. For obtaining of the necessary data, the author has used a method of questioning and observation. Three of the <b>rest</b> <b>homes</b> were randomly chosen in the south-bohemian region.
