2500|$|A {{particular}} {{attention has been}} paid to concert hall acoustic. The main hall has an amphitheater slope. Over the stage, acoustic reflectors are placed on the back wall, and the whole interior is paneled in order to obtain balanced <b>reverberation</b> <b>time</b> through the entire frequency spectrum. Acoustic effects of this arena amazes even professionals. In a letter to the then Minister of Foreign Affairs Adam Rapacki, Andrzej Szwalbe stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was known}} that the ancient Greeks had {{developed}} the technique of using vases built into their auditoria which added resonance to strengthen tone or improve its quality, though the effect was very weak. The Building Research Station developed an electronic method of lengthening the <b>reverberation</b> <b>time</b> by a system called ‘assisted resonance’ in which some of the acoustical energy lost to the surfaces of the hall was replaced by acoustical energy supplied by a loudspeaker. Each microphone and its associated loudspeaker {{was limited to the}} one frequency by placing the microphone inside a Helmholtz resonator fitted into the ceiling in a range of sizes which resonated over a wide range of the low frequencies which critics and musicians thought did not adequately reverberate in the hall. 172 channels were used to cover a frequency range of 58Hz to 700Hz, increasing <b>reverberation</b> <b>time</b> from 1.4 to 2.5 s in the 125Hz octave band. [...] However, the system never fully solved the problem, and as it aged it became unreliable, occasionally emitting odd sounds during performances. It was switched off in 1998, which returned the acoustics to their poor state, so bad that they make performers who play in it [...] "lose the will to live", according to Sir Simon Rattle.|$|E
5000|$|By {{studying}} various rooms judged acoustically optimal {{for their}} intended uses, Sabine determined that acoustically appropriate concert halls had <b>reverberation</b> <b>times</b> of 2-2.25 seconds (with shorter <b>reverberation</b> <b>times,</b> a music hall seems too [...] "dry" [...] to the listener), while optimal lecture hall acoustics featured <b>reverberation</b> <b>times</b> of slightly under 1 second. Regarding the Fogg Museum lecture room, Sabine {{noted that a}} spoken word remained audible for about 5.5 seconds, or about an additional 12-15 words if the speaker continued talking. Listeners thus contended with a very high degree of resonance and echo.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays architects {{commonly}} use the ‘coupled space concept’. Examples are mezzanines, half-open office {{spaces and}} exhibition rooms.

The transmission of sound from one space to another depends on design decisions like position, shape and dimensions of each of the interconnected spaces and of the “gap ” between the spaces.

50|$|Sabine {{concluded}} that the <b>reverberation</b> <b>time</b> depends upon the reflectivity of sound from various surfaces available inside the hall. If the reflection is coherent, the <b>reverberation</b> <b>time</b> of the hall will be longer; the sound will take more time to die out.|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, six {{different}} single-channel dereverberation algorithms are evaluated subjectively {{in terms of}} speech intelligibility and speech quality. In order to study {{the influence of the}} dereverberation algorithms on speech intelligibility, speech reception thresholds in noise were measured for different <b>reverberation</b> <b>times.</b> The quality ratings were obtained following the ITU-T P. 835 recommendations (with slight changes for adaptation to the problem of dereverberation) and included assessment of the attributes: reverberant, colored, distorted, and overall quality. Most of the algorithms improved speech intelligibility for short as well as long <b>reverberation</b> <b>times</b> compared to the reverberant condition. The best performance in terms of speech intelligibility and quality was observed for the regularized spectral inverse approach with pre-echo removal. The overall quality of the processed signals was highly correlated with the attribute reverberant or/and distorted.

40|$|Reverberant {{responses}} {{are widely used}} to characterize acoustic properties of rooms, such as the early decay time (EDT) and the <b>reverberation</b> <b>times</b> T 20 and T 30. However, in real conditions a sound decay is often deformed by background noise, thus a precise evaluation of decay times from noisy room responses is the main problem. In this paper this issue is examined by means of numerical method where the decay times are estimated from the decay function that has been determined by nonlinear polynomial regression from a pressure envelope obtained via the discrete Hilbert transform. In numerical experiment the room responses were obtained from simulations of a sound decay for two-room coupled system. Calculation results have shown that background noise slightly affects the evaluation of <b>reverberation</b> <b>times</b> T 20 and T 30 {{as long as the}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is not smaller than about 25 and 35 dB, respectively.
