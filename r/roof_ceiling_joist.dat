5000|$|Manufactured trusses - trusses {{are used}} in home {{construction}} as a pre-fabricated replacement for <b>roof</b> rafters and <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> (stick-framing). It {{is seen as an}} easier installation and a better solution for supporting roofs than the use of dimensional lumber's struts and purlins as bracing. In the southern U.S. and elsewhere, stick-framing with dimensional lumber roof support is still predominant. The main drawbacks of trusses are reduced attic space, time required for engineering and ordering, and a cost higher than the dimensional lumber needed if the same project were conventionally framed. The advantages are significantly reduced labor costs (installation is faster than conventional framing), consistency, and overall schedule savings.|$|R

50|$|The {{floor joist}} framing layout looks {{similar to the}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist</b> layout. However, where the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> may consist of 2x6s, 2x8s, 2x10s and 2x12s, the floor joist layout will {{typically}} show 2x12 joists only. In some cases, where loads and spans dictate, and deeper floor joist system may be required. Deeper floor systems include wood I-joists and open web trusses.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist</b> layout shows {{all of the}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> {{over the}} rooms (typically over {{the second floor of}} a 2-story house, or over the first floor of a 1-story house). The size of the joists will vary {{depending}} on the spacing of the joists, as well as the span. Whether or not the joists are designed for attic storage loads will also affect the size of the members.|$|R

50|$|The guitar is {{made from}} 64 pieces of bone, metal, wood, stone and fabric, {{representing}} every province and territory.The guitar's neck has wood from {{the deck of the}} Bluenose II, a bagel shibba from Montreal, and oak from a <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist</b> from the St. Boniface Museum in Winnipeg, a former convent of the Grey Nuns and the building where Louis Riel attended school. The wood used from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist</b> was estimated to be 400 to 500 years old when it was procured for the construction of the St. Boniface Museum the 1840s.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{building}} codes require unoccupied attics to be ventilated {{to reduce the}} accumulation of heat and moisture that contribute to mold growth and decay of wood rafters and <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nailing {{support for}} {{the edges of the}} ceiling is {{required}} at the junction of the wall and ceiling where partitions run parallel to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b> This material is commonly referred to as 'dead wood' or backing.|$|R
50|$|Humphreys Boat Shed {{has been}} well {{maintained}} and still demonstrates the principal characteristics of a marine workshop: concrete slipway; timber rafters pitched steep from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> of the original building {{in order to create}} a larger, open space; and its location along the Spit.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, a {{concrete}} tiled roof would normally have rafters at 600mm centers, roof battens at 300mm centers and <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> at 400mm centers. The United States still uses imperial {{units of measurement}} and framing members are typically spaced sixteen or twenty-four inches apart.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls in}} the dining room are lined with wide {{vertical}} boards that are painted white. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> are exposed and have a dark appearance that contrasts with the white boards behind. The internal walls of the two bedrooms are similarly framed and finished.|$|R
5000|$|In light-frame construction, a trimmer is a timber {{or metal}} beam (joist) {{used to create}} an opening around a stairwell, skylight, chimney, and the like. Trimmers are {{installed}} parallel to the primary floor or <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> and support headers, which run perpendicular to the primary joists.|$|R
50|$|Both the {{rectangular}} sections and the slipway {{are protected by}} a low-pitched gable roof. In the slipway space, the timber rafters have been pitched steep from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> of the original building, creating the larger, open space. Some of the timber framed windows have been replaced with aluminium.|$|R
50|$|The arched window {{openings}} which {{line the}} north and south walls of the church are housed in arched recesses, in the spandrels of which sit the corbelled supports of the timber <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b> The windows are glazed with diamond mullioned glass in varying shades of blue and green forming geometric patterns.|$|R
50|$|It is in {{the center}} of the Cross Keys Battlefield in Rockingham County, Virginia. It has six-over-six windows with double-hung wooden sash, exposed floor and <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists,</b> a large center hall, original, {{interior}} chambered moldings and hand-planed partition walls. It originally included two limestone chimneys, but they were damaged during the Battle of Cross Keys, during the American Civil War and subsequently removed.|$|R
50|$|Framing - The {{vertical}} posts on {{the north}} and south side for room 2 and the foyer, built on an irregular beam base, were extended in length above the interior room ceiling to the top attic rail. The length was designed to match the height of the original room 1 roof. The vertical posts were long enough to extend about four feet above the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b>|$|R
50|$|The wall or ceiling {{finishing}} process begins with wood laths. These are narrow strips of wood, or split boards, nailed horizontally across the wall studs or <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b> Each wall frame {{is covered in}} lath, tacked at the studs. The lath is typically about one inch (2.5 cm) wide by four feet (1.22 meters) long by 1/4 in thick. Each horizontal course of lath is spaced about 3/8 in away from its neighboring courses.|$|R
50|$|Hanging pot racks are {{the most}} common type of pot racks. Hanging pot racks need to be {{installed}} into <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b> They usually come with chains or extension hooks, or hanging links and ceiling screws. Hanging pot racks are normally sold with hooks that can be positioned on the rim or on the grid. Pots and pans can be hung directly from the grid or from the rim using these hooks. Grids can be many shapes, but the most common are rectangular, round, or oval.|$|R
50|$|After {{the sheets}} are secured {{to the wall}} studs or <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists,</b> the {{installer}} conceals the seams between drywall sheets with 'joint tape' and several layers of 'joint compound' (sometimes called 'mud'). This compound is also applied to any screw holes or defects. The compound is allowed to air dry then typically sanded smooth before painting. Alternatively, for a better finish, the entire wall may be given a 'skim coat', a thin layer (about 1 mm or 1/16 inch) of finishing compound, to minimize the visual differences between the paper and mudded areas after painting.|$|R
50|$|The Fachwerk Farmhouse {{contains}} three {{rooms on}} the ground level, a central living room and two side rooms accessed from the central room. The floors are timber, covered with carpet and interior walls are rendered and painted. The timber frame is visible {{in the north and}} south walls and the internal dividing walls but the east and west walls have been re-plastered, concealing the timber framing. The original ceiling has been removed and a new timber attic floor now forms the ceiling over the ground level rooms, exposing the original timber <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1987, Rob Norden {{purchased}} the restaurant, {{which is now}} {{owned and operated by}} his son, also Rob. The Nordens undertook a significant research and restoration project to restore the older appearance and deal with structural problems. The foundation was strengthened with concrete. The floor and <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists,</b> weakened by sagging of the foundation, were replaced by others from a barn in Ontario as old as the tavern, and the floorboards were replaced with similar boards from a schoolhouse in Pennsylvania. The '76 House is a contributing property to the Tappan Historic District.|$|R
50|$|Ceiling Height - The room 1 {{ceiling was}} lowered from its {{original}} height to its current height. Notched top rails in the attic, approximately four feet above the ceiling floor, indicate both {{the height of the}} original <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> and the slope of the flat roof. West Chimney - A brick fireplace and chimney was installed on the west end of room 2. The fireplace chimney in room 1 was extended in height to accommodate the gable roof height with brick similar to that used in the fireplace in the room 2.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a stream}} of high {{pressure}} water impinges on a surface, water hammer can quickly erode and destroy it. In the 2009 Sayano-Shushenskaya hydroelectric power station accident, the lid to a 640 MW turbine was ejected upwards, hitting the ceiling above. During the accident, the rotor was seen flying through the air, still spinning, about 3 meters above the floor. Unrestrained, [...] per second of water began to spray all over the generator hall. The geyser caused the structural failure of steel <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists,</b> precipitating a <b>roof</b> collapse around the failed turbine.|$|R
50|$|The {{theme for}} the station focuses on the simplicity, neatness, and order of a modern city. Glass, aluminum, and enamel {{are used in the}} <b>roofs,</b> <b>ceilings,</b> pillars, and walls.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{components}} {{go into the}} overall planning of a distribution center {{in order to maximize}} its efficiency. If the distribution center relies on a conveyor system suspended from the ceiling, consideration needs to be given to the weight-bearing capacity of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b> If the conveyor system runs along the floor, then consideration needs to be given in the design stage to the placement of columns, particularly as they relate to the flue space between pallet rack frames. Other planning considerations include attention to such areas as slotting, product replenishment, storage media, and power requirements.|$|R
50|$|Coconut timber {{has many}} {{applications}} {{as both a}} structural and interior design material. The harder, high-density timber is suitable for general structural purposes such as pillars, trusses, rafting, furniture, window and door frames, floors, decking and floor joists. Medium density coconut timber {{can be used for}} walls, <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> and horizontal studs. Low density coconut timber is used in non-load bearing applications like wood panelling, internal trim and ceilings, as well as homewares.Coconut timber supplied by Pacific Green is to be used in exterior applications throughout Abu Dhabi's Masdar City development, including the entrance gates, screens and doors.|$|R
50|$|The {{outstanding}} {{quality of}} the clear finished timber joinery and fittings on the interior of Vida Lahey's house is particularly noteworthy. The internal walls are lined with vertically-jointed boards of first grade timber. Timber boards lining the ceiling are raked to meet {{the underside of the}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> on the east and west walls of the house. An outstanding feature of the interior is the joists of hoop pine running the full width of the house. Each joist was made from one piece of timber completely free from knots over its long expanse, a rarity today.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{consists of}} one large room that was partitioned {{on the south}} end in the 1950s to create two Sunday school rooms. The roof support system is unique to southwest Alabama, and consists of a single truss with vertical tie rods running {{the length of the}} building, which is notched to be attached to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> and diagonal trusses. This has caused the bottom chord to crack, and wood columns were added underneath the cracked portion. The original lath and plaster walls have been replaced with drywall, but the original heart pine flooring is intact.|$|R
40|$|The master {{thesis is}} about a design of {{supporting}} structure of prefabricated skeleton hall. The major part of a design are an internal trasverse and longitudinal frames, which contents roof reinforce concrete truss, columns, beam and <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b> All the load acting to the bearing structure is transferred to the prefabricate footing made of reinforce concrete. Other parts of the bulding are not solved in this thesis. The content of the thesis consists of an assembly drawing of parts of the skeleton and the static calculation according to the actual international standards. The output of each static calculation is drawing of a shape of part and its reinforcement...|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} arrangement {{has not been}} substantially altered. The first floor features a living room and dining room connected by a hallway, which itself features nooks furnished with bookshelf-partitions on its north and south sides, featuring decorative fir tree designs. Columns and beams are dressed and trimmed, with rough-hewn <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists</b> supporting diagonal <b>ceiling</b> sheathing. Downstairs interior spaces are finished in plaster with dark wood wainscoting. The building's original furnishings remain in the living and dining rooms. Upstairs a central hall runs {{to the ends of}} the wings, flanked by individual and dormitory rooms. The building's kitchen and bathrooms have been updated, and the partial basement contains mechanical equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Niemczowka {{tenement}} house {{built in the}} Renaissance style, in the terrace building development, with the spacious transit entrance hall. It belonged to Walenty and Anna Niemiec Wrzesień. It was built in 1570. In the past it was an inn. On the ground floor in the big room there is a three-piece window with Renaissance columns, and also the <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist,</b> on which there is the date 1634 and the surname of the contemporary chęciński mayor Walenty Soboniewski. Originally the building was one-storey, at present {{it also has the}} mezzanine built into the roof and adapted to council flats. There are also cloister vaulted basements.|$|R
50|$|The Savoy Hotel {{continued}} operations between World Wars I and II, {{and in the}} 1930s part of {{the bottom}} of the hotel was given to retail. In April 1930 a fire broke out at the Savoy Hotel, severely damaging the <b>roof,</b> <b>ceiling</b> and fittings of the kitchen.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{tropical}} {{green building}} also seeks to reduce power consumption through intelligent architecture, such as by allowing {{in lots of}} natural light so that electric lights aren't needed during the daytime, and at night, using white-painted <b>roofs,</b> <b>ceilings</b> and low-energy light bulbs such as compact fluorescents or LED lamps.|$|R
50|$|A {{top rail}} {{across the front}} (north side) of room 2 and the foyer and another across the rear (south side) of room 2 and the foyer tied the {{vertical}} beams all together. Each vertical post had a hand-made mortise at interior ceiling height to receive each <b>ceiling</b> <b>joist,</b> which had a tenon at each end. A wood peg secured each joint. The peg holes were chisel-cut with a square hole by hand, as opposed to round holes made with a drill, indicating construction in early 1800’s. The pegs were hand-formed with an ax from small cut blocks of wood and sized to each hole. Additionally, vertical water saw marks marking are on the vertical posts. Neither the room 2 nor the foyer framing used nails.|$|R
50|$|Pithouse {{construction}} was usually based on four corner posts positioned upright in the pit. These posts were carefully chosen and trimmed {{to create a}} branch or fork at the top as a structural support. They were joined by horizontal beams and crossed with <b>ceiling</b> <b>joists.</b> The interior sides of the pit were plastered with clay or lined with stone — either large slabs wedged upright in the soil or courses of smaller stones. The exterior of the pithouse was formed of branches, packed tree bark, or brush and grass. A thick layer of mud {{on the outside of}} the roof and walls protected the shelter from the weather. Often the initial mud layer was carefully plastered with a lighter colored clay.|$|R
