25|$|Nair is {{an example}} of a {{chemical}} hair <b>removal</b> <b>product</b> which also functions as a chemical exfoliant. It is done more frequently than waxing (once a week rather than once a month) since it only destroys hair partially below the skin, rather than destroying the entire root as with waxing. Using it weekly can substitute for a weekly exfoliant regime. It is a very aggressive chemical and cannot be used on the face so other exfoliants would need to be used on the face.|$|E
25|$|Steel blades are {{commonly}} shaped by forging or stock removal. Forged blades {{are made by}} heating {{a single piece of}} steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. Stock removal blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and stock removal processes. Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from stock <b>removal</b> <b>product</b> lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.|$|E

40|$|In {{approach}} to alleviating the problems causing ‘sick building syndrome’, {{many types of}} indoor air pollution <b>removal</b> <b>products</b> have been developed. In the various performance evaluation methods for these <b>removal</b> <b>products,</b> the pollutant constant-emission test is the most ideal. In order to generate pollutant-gas constantly, a surface evaporation type constant-emission device was developed. However, this device generates gas regularly by heating a diffusion tube containing the reagents under investigation and mixtures {{could not be used}} if the boiling point differed for the component ingredients. This device also had the demerit of being unable to build high concentrations of gas pollution. A constant-emission device was developed which has a heating furnace to instantly vaporize pollutants. These are then carried away by purified air. In the present study, the aim was to determine the basic performance and characteristics of this newly developed constant-emission device, using a large stainless-steel chamber under controlled environmental conditions. Steady states of formaldehyde concentration were successfully achieved in the chamber. Concentration prediction was conducted using the emission rates obtained from two calculation methods.

50|$|A common {{method for}} stump removal {{is to use}} one of the many {{chemical}} stump <b>removal</b> <b>products,</b> so long as immediate results are not needed. These stump removers are mostly made of potassium nitrate (KNO3) and act by rapidly increasing the decay of the stump. After an average of 4-6 weeks, the stump will be rotten through and easily fragmented in manageable pieces. If time is a limiting factor, setting fire to the stump is effective because once the potassium nitrate has been absorbed it acts as an effective oxidizer.|$|R
