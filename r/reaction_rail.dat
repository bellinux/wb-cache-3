5000|$|By {{carefully}} timing the energizing of the windings, {{the fields}} in the windings and [...] "reaction rail" [...] will be slightly offset due to the hysteresis. That offset results in a net thrust along the <b>reaction</b> <b>rail,</b> allowing the LIM to pull itself along the rail without any physical contact. The LIM concept sparked considerable interest in the transportation world, as it offered {{a way to make}} an electric motor with no moving parts and no physical contact, which could greatly reduce maintenance needs.|$|E
50|$|The motor was {{a one-sided}} LIM design, with an {{aluminum}} <b>reaction</b> <b>rail</b> positioned {{on the track}} between the two suspension rails. Power pickup was provided by two slipping brushes, like those on a conventional subway system. A subway can use the running rails as the ground, but the Transrapid had no contact with its rail, so it needed a second conductor. Brushes were positioned {{on both sides of}} the vehicle, to allow it to pick up from either side. It was powered by 600 VDC power, typical for mass transit systems, and drew 50 kW at 50 mph.|$|E
5000|$|The {{group at}} Hovercraft Development applied the LIM concept to their {{hovertrain}} {{almost immediately after}} the LIM became well known around 1961. By the time the prototype was running in 1963, they had been promoting {{the idea of using}} a LIM with their suspension as the basis for a full-sized development. A small model of their proposal shows a train that looks like the fuselage of a narrow-body airliner running on a monorail track shaped like an upside-down [...] "T".

Although Grumman's efforts got {{the majority of the}} funding in the TACV project, ensuring the construction of 22 mi of track, the <b>reaction</b> <b>rails</b> for the LIM propulsion were never installed. With jet engine propulsion only, no more than 90 mph was achieved.|$|R

A sample of N= 396 respondents from the Lower Hutt and Eastbourne areas of Wellington, New Zealand were divided into three groups; Waterloo, a high public transport access area for the collection attitude data; The two remaining areas Petone/Eastbourne, and Woburn were manipulation cites, where rail access was either removed or introduced in a hypothetical scenario. Results showed more positive, and universal attitudes towards rail, while attitudes to bus were influenced {{by a number of}} demographic measures. Revealed preferences showed a disinclination to use the bus when rail is available. Respondent showed greater trust in the stability of rail over bus infrastructure. <b>Reactions</b> towards the <b>rail</b> removal scenario were negative; house prices were expected to decrease. <b>Reactions</b> to the <b>rail</b> inclusion scenario were ambivalent, when they were expected to be positive. Loss aversion is cited as a possible explanation for this pattern of results. Recommendations are made for a reduced priority on bus development within rail serviced areas, and further research to confirm results...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} inertia is not {{explicitly}} supported in Maxwellian electrodynamics, {{as there is}} no reaction to the Lorentz force in the Lorentz relation. Recent experimental work suggests that the apparent lack of <b>reaction</b> to <b>rail</b> gun firing indicates a violation of the Newtonian laws of motion, but Einsteinian and Newtonian electrodynamics do support the principle of inertia and its consequence, the law of conservation of momentum. In this paper, drawing from first principles in electrical engineering and Euclidean geometry we construct the integrals that describe the forces upon the line elements of a simple asymmetric circuit caused by its current and that same current&# 039;s local magnetic self-induction caused by the other line elements. The complete solutions of these double integrals produce complex mathematical expressions, indicating imbalance of forces. The possibility of an entirely new class of electric motors for energy generation and motion arises with the constant change in linear momentum for the body with flow of high current within a geometrically asymmetric embedded circuit...|$|R
50|$|The {{test track}} for the LIMRV at the HSGTC near Pueblo wasn't yet {{complete}} when Garrett delivered the vehicle: the <b>reaction</b> <b>rail</b> {{in the middle}} of the tracks was still being installed. Once the track was ready, linear induction motor, vehicle power systems, and rail dynamics testing progressed and by October 1972, a speed of 187.9 mph was achieved. Speed was limited due to the length of track (6.4 mi) and vehicle acceleration rates. Two Pratt & Whitney J52 jet engines were added to the vehicle to propel the vehicle up to higher speeds, after acceleration the engines were then throttled back so that the thrust equaled their drag. On 14 August 1974, the LIMRV achieved a world record speed of 255.7 mph for vehicles on conventional rail.|$|E

The most consistent difference is a higher experimental than theoretical magnetic field near the entrance of the motor and a lower experimental than theoretical magnetic field near the exit. The observed differences between the theoretical and experimental magnetic fields and currents do not account for the differences of as much as 26 percent between the theoretical and experimental thrusts...|$|E

30|$|Theory and {{practice}} of management in terms of wheel and rail contact during the past 20  years are to increase the life of wheel and track and improve their adaptability {{and the use of}} greater axial loads. Wheels combined with high-strength steel-polished rail profiles lower wear and improve lubrication. Various effects such as difficulty of body contact, coefficient of friction, changes in lateral and longitudinal creep and wear volume are effective. Due to the lack of accurate predictions of actions and <b>reactions</b> created between <b>rail</b> and wheel (adhesion between the rail and the wheels, the alignment of rails and wheels together, rail level pollution, ambient temperature, humidity, hard surfaces, railways, the quality of the natural and physical infrastructure and other factors), determination of the level of each factor on the force between the rail and wheel wear rate is difficult [5].|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} secondary {{analysis on}} data collected among rail users, days {{before and after}} a national rail strike in the Netherlands. Our aim was to compare anticipated and actual behavioural <b>reactions</b> to the <b>rail</b> strike, investigate associations with traveller and trip characteristics, and perceived behavioural control and satisfaction with the chosen alternative. Forty-four {{percent of the people}} who had anticipated to travel by train on the day of the strike abandoned their trip, 24 % switched to car as driver, 14 % switched to another mode (as passenger), 18 % stayed with the train and rescheduled the planned activity to another day. Almost half of people who had anticipated travelling by car expected to change behaviour as well. Multinomial logistic regression showed low preference for car among rail users. Considerable marginal effects were found for several variables, e. g. : young people and females were less likely to switch to car; short and middle distance trips were less likely abandoned or switched to another day; commute and business trips were more likely done by car, and business trips less likely cancelled. Despite high levels of perceived behavioural control and satisfaction with the chosen alternative, permanent modal shift as result of this strike is not expected. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{optimizing}} {{the parameters of}} the high-speed single-sided linear induction motor (SLIM) is approached using nonlinear programing. Five principal design parameters are chosen as the indipendent variables, and the materials of the secondary <b>reaction</b> <b>rail</b> is expressed as their objective function. The power factor-efficiency product, the maximum flux density in teeth and the primary length are selected as constraint function. Optimization problem is mathmatically formed by use of the design formulas of SLIM approximately taking into account the end effect, skin effect and airgap leakage. The sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT) and the simplex method are used to solve the problem. The method is applied to the SLIM for the propulsion of the 300 km/h magnetic levitated vehicle of about 20 m length and 27 tons weight...|$|E
40|$|The SERAPBIM (SEgmented RAil PHased Induction Motor) {{concept is}} a linear {{induction}} motor concept which uses rapidly-pulsed magnetic fields and a segmented <b>reaction</b> <b>rail,</b> as opposed to low-frequency fields and continuous reaction rails found in conventional {{linear induction motor}}s. These improvements give a high-traction, compact, and efficient linear motor that has potential for advanced high speed rail propulsion. In the SERAPBIM concept, coils on the vehicle push against a segmented aluminum rail, which is mounted on the road bed. Current is pulsed as the coils cross an edge of the segmented rail, inducing surface currents which repel the coil. The coils must be pulsed in synchronization with the movement by <b>reaction</b> <b>rail</b> segments. This is provided by a sense-and-fire circuit that controls the pulsing of the power modulators. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the pulsed induction motor and to collect data {{that could be used}} for scaling calculations. A 14. 4 kg aluminum plate was accelerated down a 4 m track to speeds of over 15 m/sec with peak thrust up to 18 kN per coilset. For a trainset capable of 200 mph speed, the SERAPHIM concept design is based on coils which are each capable of producing up to 3. 5 kN thrust, and 30 coil pairs are mounted on each power car. Two power cars, one at each end of the train, provide 6 MW from two gas turbine prime power units. The thrust is about 210. 000 N and is essentially constant up to 200 km/hr since wheel slippage does not limit thrust as with conventional wheeled propulsion. A key component of the SERAPHIM concept is the use of passive wheel-on-rah support for the high speed vehicle. Standard steel wheels are capable of handling over 200 mph. The SERAPHIM cost is comparable to that for steel-wheel high-speed rail, and about 10 % to 25 % of the projected costs for a comparable Maglev system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Attracting {{ferromagnetic}} forces between magnet and <b>reaction</b> <b>rail</b> {{provide the}} supporting force in Electromagnetic Suspension. Miniature maglev using permanent magnets and electromagnets {{is based on}} the idea to generate the nominal magnetic force by permanent magnets and superimpose the variable magnetic field required for stabilization by currents flowing through control windings in electromagnets. Permanent magnets with a high energy density have lower power losses with regard to supporting force and magnet weight. So the advantage of the maglev using electromagnets and permanent magnets is partially reduced by the power required to feed the remaining onboard supply system so that the overall onboard power is diminished as compared to that of the electromagnet. In this paper we proposed the how to design and control the miniature maglev and confirmed the feasibility of the levitation system using electromagnets and permanent magnets through the manufacturing the miniature magle...|$|E
40|$|The rail freight-traffic {{has lost}} a {{significant}} amount of market shares to its main competitor - the road traffic - in the last decades. Reasons are the dramatic changed demands of transport and the insufficient <b>reaction</b> of the <b>rail</b> freight-traffic. Therefore, the principle of Train-Coupling and -Sharing has been discussed by the Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG) and research instituts. The operation of modules (demand-oriented trains) enables better offers concerning the transport time and the flexibility of transport. The composition of module-unions (coupled modules) reduces the number of needed train pathes. The concentration to point-to-point-traffic minimises shunting and reduces the needed infrastructure and the transport time. In the beginning the report describes the principle of TCS and the aspects of the construction of module-unions. The main issue of the dissertation is the developement and implementation of the program DisCoPlan for the planning and disposition of modules and module-unions. The software is based on the program INVOZUG, which was also developed by the author. DisCoPlan is a first step in the implementation of software for a comprehensive TCS-disposition, which will be included an ad-hoc-disposition of modules. The modules of a TCS-system can be related to each other in very complex ways. A heuristic algorithm (based on Simulated Annealing) was chosen to find an almost optimal constellation of module-unions. The boundary conditions are represented by cost, needed transport time and the needed infrastructure. The features and the possibilities of DisCoPlan are discribed and demonstrated by examples. They are based on scenarios with 300 and 2000 modules considering the whole route network of DB AG. The results demonstrate the positive effects of TCS. They also point out the dependence between the possibility to build module-unions and the length of the module-relations, the distribution of the departure time and the number of modules. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. Considerable {{longitudinal}} rail {{forces and}} displacements may develop in {{continuous welded rail}} (CWR) track on long-span bridges due to temperature variations. The track stability may be disturbed due to excessive relative displacements between the sleepers and ballast bed and the accompanied reduction in frictional resistance. For high-speed tracks, however, solving these problems by installing rail expansion devices in the track is not an attractive solution as these devices may cause a local disturbance of the vertical track stiffness and track geometry which will require intensive maintenance. With reference to temperature, two actions are considered by the bridge loading standards, the uniform variation in the rail and deck temperature and the temperature gradient in deck. Generally, the effect of temperature gradient has been disregarded in the interaction analysis. This paper mainly deals with the effect of temperature gradient on the track-bridge interaction {{with respect to the}} support <b>reaction,</b> <b>rail</b> stresses and stability. The study presented in this paper was not mentioned in the related codes so far...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} methodologies {{for current}} control, experimental modeling and velocity tracking of a laboratory-based single-sided, short-stator linear induction motor. A constant frequency, three-phase pulse-width-modulation (PWM) current controller is constructed {{to improve the}} current quality and power factor for the motor. Several current control experiments with step set-point changes are performed to obtain the current loop transfer function with uncertainty parameters. To overcome the performance degradation caused by parameter variations in the motor due to increased temperature in the <b>reaction</b> <b>rail,</b> a two-degree-of-freedom controller, consisting of a pre-filter and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback controller, is designed to produce good velocity tracking performance, robustness and disturbance rejection. The experimental setup consists of a laboratory-based linear induction motor, a ramp comparison PWM current inverter, a precise Laser displacement instrument, a host computer IBM PC 486 and a digital signal processor (DSP) TMS 320 C 31 with three l 6 -bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). Both current control and velocity tracking algorithms are implemented using the DSP processor and standard C programming techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed velocity tracking method is capable of providing a good result on the motor. 本文的研究目的是在發展實驗級單側式短定子線型交流感應馬達之實驗塑模、速 度追蹤方法及其製作技術。本文首先發展一定頻率之三相脈波寬度調變（PWM）的電流控 制器，用以改善該馬達之電流品質與功率因素，並反覆地進行多次開迴路步階設定點變動 實驗，用以實際地估算該馬達驅動之典型線性化模型參數與其變化範圍。為克服感應軌道 的溫昇、速度與氣隙長度所導致的模型參數變化，一含前饋與PID之雙自由度控制器被提 出，用以改善性能劣化現象，並完成優異的速度伺服與干擾抑制之功能。本文所採用的控 制驅動實驗硬體包含雷射位置量測儀，電流控制PWM換流器模組，三組l 6 位元類比數位轉 換器與數位類比轉換器，以及 486 個人電腦與─TI 320 C 315 的之數位訊號處理器（DSP）。所 有的即時控制軟體均採用C語言撰寫，並由數位訊號處理器執行。實驗數據顯示本文所提 的雙自由度控制器比傳統PID控制器更具優越的性能...|$|E
40|$|The Segmented Rail Phased Induction Motor (SERAPHIM) is a compact, pulsed linear {{induction}} motor (LIM) offering a unique capability for very high speed train propulsion. It uses technology developed for the Sandia coilgun, an electromagnetic launcher designed to accelerate projectiles to several kilometers per second. Both aluminum cylinders and plates were accelerated to a kilometer per second (Mach 3) by passing through a sequence of coils which were energized at the appropriate time. Although this technology was developed for ultra-high velocity, it can be readily adapted to train propulsion for which, at sea level, the power required to overcome air resistance limits the operational speed to a more modest 300 mph. Here, the geometry is reversed. The coils are on the vehicle and the ``projectiles`` are fixed along the roadbed. SERAPHIM operates not by embedding flux in a conductor, but by excluding it. In this propulsion scheme, pairs of closely spaced coils on the vehicle straddle a segmented aluminum <b>reaction</b> <b>rail.</b> A high frequency current is switched on as a coil pair crosses an edge and remains off as they overtake the next segment. This induces surface currents which repel the coil. In essence, the pulsed coils push off segment edges because at the high frequency of operation, the flux has insufficient time to penetrate. In contrast to conventional LIMs, the performance actually improves with velocity, even for a minimal motor consisting of a single coil pair reacting with a single plate. This paper will present results of proof-of-principle tests, electromagnetic computer simulations, and systems analysis. It is concluded that this new linear {{induction motor}} can be implemented using existing technology and is a promising alternative propulsion method for very high speed rail transportation...|$|E
