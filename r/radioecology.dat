50|$|The {{necessity}} of founding such an educational institution {{appeared as a}} result of the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, when there were practically no specialists professionally trained for minimization of the consequences of radiation accidents. Following the initiatives of the International Congress of memory of Andrei Sakharov “Peace, progress, human rights” and the program “Chernobyl” controlled by the United Nations Organization, Sakharov college was inaugurated in Minsk. The next stage of the development was 1994, when after the resolution of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Belarus the college became independent International Institute of <b>Radioecology.</b> In 1999 after the state accreditation the Institute acquired the status of University. In May 2015 prorector Sergey S. Poznyak was appointed acting rector of the university. He is Doktor nauk in agricultural sciences.|$|E
5000|$|In later years, the AEC began {{providing}} increased research {{opportunities to}} scientists by approving funding for ecological studies at various nuclear testing sites, most notably at Eniwetok, which {{was part of}} the Marshall Islands. Through their support of nuclear testing, the AEC gave ecologists a unique opportunity to study the effects of radiation on whole populations and entire ecological systems in the field. [...] Prior to 1954, no one had investigated a complete ecosystem with the intent to measure its overall metabolism, but the AEC provided the means as well as the funding to do so. Ecological development was further spurred by environmental concerns about radioactive waste from nuclear energy and postwar atomic weapons production. In the 1950s, such concerns led the AEC to build a large ecology research group at their Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which was instrumental in the development of <b>radioecology.</b> A wide variety of research efforts in biology and medicine took place under the umbrella of the AEC at national laboratories and at some universities with agency sponsorship and funding. As a result of increased funding as well as the increased opportunities given to scientists and the field of ecology in general, a plethora of new techniques were developed which led to rapid growth and expansion of the field as a whole. One of these techniques afforded to ecologists involved the use of radiation, namely in ecological dating and to study the effects of stresses on the environment.|$|E

40|$|With {{intentions}} of integrating {{a portion of}} their respective research efforts into a trans-national programme that will enhance <b>radioecology,</b> eight European organisations recently formed the European <b>Radioecology</b> ALLIANCE (www. er-alliance. org). The ALLIANCE is an Association open to other organisations throughout the world with similar interests in promoting <b>radioecology.</b> The ALLIANCE members recognised that their shared radioecological research could be enhanced by efficiently pooling resources among its partner organizations and prioritising group efforts along common themes of mutual interest. A major step in this prioritisation process was to develop a Strategic Research Agenda (SRA). An EC-funded Network of Excellence in <b>Radioecology,</b> called STAR (Strategy for Allied <b>Radioecology),</b> was formed, in part, to develop the SRA. This document is the first published draft of the SRA. The SRA outlines a suggested prioritisation of research topics in <b>radioecology,</b> with the goal of improving research efficiency and more rapidly advancing the science. It responds to the question: “What topics, if critically addressed over the next 20 years, would significantly advance radioecology?” The three Scientific Challenges presented within the SRA, with their 15 associated research lines, are a strategic vision of what <b>radioecology</b> can achieve in the future. Meeting these challenges will require a directed effort and collaboration with many organisations the world over. Addressing these challenges is important to the advancement of <b>radioecology</b> and in providing scientific knowledge to decision makers. Although the development of the draft SRA has largely been a European effort, the hope is that it will initiate an open dialogue within the international <b>radioecology</b> community and its stakeholders. This is an abbreviated document with the intention of introducing the SRA and inviting contributions from interested stakeholders. Critique and input for improving the SRA are welcomed via a link on the STAR website (www. star-radioecology. org) ...|$|E

COMET built upon the foundations laid by the FP 7 project STAR (Strategic Network for Integrating <b>Radioecology)</b> Network of Excellence in <b>radioecology.</b> In close association with the ALLIANCE, {{and based on the}} Strategic Research Agenda (SRA), COMET developed innovative mechanisms for joint programming and implementation of radioecological research. To facilitate and foster future integration under a common federating structure, research activities developed within COMET were targeted at radioecological research needs identified in the SRA. Furthermore, COMET maintained and developed strong mechanisms for knowledge exchange, dissemination and training to enhance and maintain European capacity, competence and skills in <b>radioecology.</b> In the short term the work to promote <b>radioecology</b> will continue under the H 2020 project EJP-CONCERT (European Joint Programme for the Integration of Radiation Protection Research). The EJP-CONCERT project (2015 – 2020) aims to develop a sustainable structure for promoting and administering joint programming and open research calls in the field of radiation protection research for Europe.

' <b>Radioecology</b> is a multidisciplinary science and E&T is needed by both students and professionals within research, industry and radiation protection. In order to address these needs, the EU COMET project has developed an E&T web platform and arranged a number of field courses, training courses, PhD and MSc courses, refresher courses and workshops, drawing on the COMET consortium to assemble relevant experts. In addition, COMET has been engaged in discussions with stakeholders for more long-term solutions to maintain the sustainability of <b>radioecology</b> E&T {{after the end of}} the project. Despite much progress in some areas, many of the challenges outlined in the 2014 SRA remain, mainly due to the lack of sustainable dedicated funding.
