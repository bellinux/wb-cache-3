40|$|The Workshop to Improve the Usefulness of Operational Radiosonde Data {{was held}} at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, North Carolina, from 11 through 13 March 2003. It brought {{together}} users of global radiosonde data in numerical weather prediction, climate, and satellite data applications, along with a number of experts concerned with radiosonde instrument development, validation, and operational programs. This report provides a set of findings and recommendations produced by the group. The recommendations address issues in the areas of accuracy, calibration, and corrections of radiosonde measurements, sampling strategies, and the exchange of and <b>response</b> to <b>information</b> on <b>data</b> integrity, metadata, and data processing strategies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a study piloted on highway assets Category 2 defects. Imminent hazards on high-way road networks are significantly accelerated by structural deterioration of highway infrastructures. The {{inspection and maintenance}} strategy for highway infrastructure requires continuous improvements to reduce high occurrence of defective highway assets. Combined risk-based inspection (RBI) and stochastic (STOC) techniques is considered in this investigation to give an in-depth understanding of highway asset maintenance <b>response.</b> Appropriate <b>data</b> <b>information</b> is extracted from Network Maintenance Management System and complementary information elicited from maintenance experts as well as recommended standards. Safety inspections piloted within the period of 5 years is evaluated using the projected RBI-STOC approach. The RBI incorporates the consequences and likelihood of the defects and the combined STOC techniques utilised defines the actual maintenance interval operated. The RBI-STOC approach proposes reclassification of highway asset defect repair intervals, appropriate maintenance task response and efficient maintenance prioritisation of highway assets in equivalence with contribution to system average {{mean time to repair}} and downtime...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} blind data hiding {{approach}} which has improved imperceptibility of the embedded <b>information</b> <b>data</b> {{as well as}} high capacity. The proposed method {{is a relatively new}} approach for two reasons. First, the Fresnelet transform is employed for scrambling the <b>information</b> image <b>data</b> with different distance parameters as keys, while maintaining the overall energy of the <b>information</b> <b>data</b> in the form of dummy complex data to be embedded in the cover image <b>data.</b> Second, the <b>information</b> <b>data</b> is extracted blindly in the extraction phase without the need of the original cover image data. Furthermore, our proposed method is useful for maintaining reasonable perceptual transparency of an information embedded image with large capacity of <b>information</b> <b>data.</b>|$|R

In this paper, since the <b>information</b> <b>data</b> is time series of single variables, the improved C-C method is proposed to reconstruct phase space and the extended small data sets method is proposed to calculate the largest Lyapunov exponent for the <b>information</b> <b>data.</b> Through typical chaos system, the methods are proved effectual.

In communication system <b>information</b> <b>data</b> is transferred from source to destination through channel. In between, source and destination, data may be corrupted due to any type of noise. To find original information we use Hamming code error detection and correction technique. In hamming code error detection and correction technique, to get error free data at destination, we encrypt <b>information</b> <b>data</b> according to even and odd parity method before transmission of information at source end. In this project 14 bit <b>Information</b> <b>data</b> {{is divided into two}} groups of 7 bit data. After this division each group is encrypted using four Redundancy bit. In this way 14 bit <b>information</b> <b>data</b> at sender end is now converted into two groups of 11 bit data (with redundant bits). Both groups are joined to make total 22 bit <b>Information</b> <b>data.</b> At Receiver end 22 bit <b>information</b> <b>data</b> in divided into two groups of 11 bit data and each group is detected and corrected using even and odd parity check method. After correction both group are joined together to Receive 22 bit original <b>information</b> <b>data.</b> Here, Xilinx ISE 10. 1 Simulator has been used for simulating VHDL Code.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} a comparative study of two separate techniques for obtaining important frequency and time domain characteristics of a system consisting of a process in series with a PI/PID controller in closed loop. The first technique {{involves the use of}} a Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) to obtain the closed loop frequency response of the system. This closed loop frequency information may then be manipulated to obtain both open loop frequency <b>response</b> <b>information</b> and process model parameters. A further mathematical simulation using Matlab may then be performed independent of the actual process in order to obtain important time domain characteristics of the system such as rise time, settling time and overshoot. The second technique is a relay-based method described in [1], which may be used to obtain the open loop frequency response of the system. In this case, it is the open loop frequency <b>response</b> <b>information</b> that is manipulated in order to obtain closed loop frequency <b>response</b> <b>information</b> and process model parameters...|$|R

3000|$|With the {{numerical}} simulation, we empirically analyze {{the choice of}} the scaling factor α. Since the scaling factor is weighting value for the <b>information</b> <b>data,</b> the different values of α in the range of 0 – 1 are affecting the quality of the information embedded image and the CC value of the extracted <b>information</b> <b>data.</b> In our simulation, we use the values α = 0.03, [...] 0.04, [...] 0.05, [...] 0.06, [...] 0.07 [...] that give a consistent result of PSNR and CC values as shown in Fig.  7. In this case, we employ four benchmark cover image data: Cameraman, Peppers, Elaine, Lena with size 512  ×  512 and two benchmark information image data: USAF, DDNT <b>information</b> <b>data</b> with 256  ×  256. Note that as increasing the scaling factor, the PSNRs of the information embedded images are decreasing and the CC values of the extracted <b>information</b> <b>data</b> are increasing and shown in Fig.  7. We focus on the value α = 0.05 [...] which provides the optimal result for the trade-off between the imperceptibility of information embedded images and the CC values of the extracted <b>information</b> <b>data</b> for all four graphs in Fig.  7.|$|R

And we can transmit very minimum number of configuration of data string. To increase the speed of communication system and increase the numbers of configuration data string author design some communication system by different methodologies of Hamming code. About all these communication systems all methodologies are discuss here. First, author design communication system to make communication by even parity check method for 25 bit <b>information</b> <b>data</b> string. In second paper, author design communication system to make communication by odd parity check method for 25 bit <b>information</b> <b>data.</b> In third paper, author again design communication system for 25 bit <b>information</b> <b>data</b> string by even parity and odd parity check method by using VHDL by single system.
