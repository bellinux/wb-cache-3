50|$|The fourth {{generation}} of LAURON was finished in 2004. The mechanical robustness was improved, {{for example the}} <b>round</b> <b>cord</b> belt connecting the joints with the motors were replaced by gear belts. Beside, a new head with 2 degrees of freedom was added. The central body was now made of light-weight carbon fiber. LAURON IV weights 27 kg including its accumulators and can reach a maximum walking speed of up to 0.22 m/s. Furthermore, the used NiMH accumulators can supply LAURON with energy for up to 60 minutes. The current version of the fourth LAURON generation is LAURON IVc. The LAURON IV won the Faulhaber University Project Award in 2011.|$|E

50|$|The {{collateral}} ligaments of metatarsophalangeal joints are strong, <b>rounded</b> <b>cords,</b> placed one {{on either}} side of each joint, and attached, by one end, to the posterior tubercle {{on the side of the}} head of the metatarsal bone, and, by the other, to the contiguous extremity of the phalanx.|$|R
50|$|The alar ligaments are two strong, <b>rounded</b> <b>cords</b> {{of about}} 0.5 cm in {{diameter}} that {{run from the}} sides of the foramen magnum of the skull to the dens of the axis, the second cervical vertebra.

40|$|Background: Text-books in Anatomy {{describe}} {{the presence of}} ‘small and unimportant cartilage triticea (like a wheat grain) ’. The lateral portion of thyrohyoid ligament is <b>round</b> <b>cord</b> like and very elastic and in its upper part contains a small nodule. The cartilage triticea probably reinforce the thyrohyoid ligament. It presumably adds {{to the strength of}} ligament. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of triticeous cartilage and to study its shape, dimensions and weight. Material and method: The study was carried out on 50 Laryngeal preparations from cadavers of both sexes. Presence/Absence of cartilage triticea was observed. The cartilages were cleaned and preserved in 5 % formalin. Dimensions (length and diameter) of triticeous cartilages were measured with the help of digital Vernier caliper. The measurements were taken to the nearest 0. 01 mm. The cartilages were weighed on Single pan electronic balance (sensitive to 0. 01 gm). Result: In the present study prevalence of triticeous cartilages was 58 % (40 % bilaterally and 18 % unilaterally). The shapes varied from oval (44 %) to spindle shaped (8 %). Its length varied from 3. 37 to 13. 94 mm. Its diameter 2. 4 to 4. 79 mm. In one case unilaterally two cartilage triticea were found. Very interesting variation in lateral thyrohyoid ligament were observed varying from its complex absence due to the union of superior cornu o...|$|E
50|$|The calcaneofibular {{ligament}} is a narrow, <b>rounded</b> <b>cord,</b> {{running from}} the tip of the lateral malleolus of the fibula downward and slightly backward to a tubercle on the lateral surface of the calcaneus. It is part of the lateral collateral ligament, which opposes the hyperinversion of the subtalar joint, as in a common type of ankle sprain.|$|R
50|$|The ulnar {{collateral}} ligament (internal lateral ligament, ulnar carpal collateral ligament or ulnar collateral ligament of {{the wrist}} joint) is a <b>rounded</b> <b>cord,</b> attached above {{to the end of}} the styloid process of the ulna, and dividing below into two , one of which is attached to the medial side of the triquetral bone, the other to the pisiform and flexor retinaculum.|$|R

5000|$|The {{shape and}} {{form of the}} {{ligament}} {{have been found in}} humans cadavers to vary from a <b>rounded</b> <b>cord</b> to a flat membrane. Further, it is not found in all humans being variably found to be absent in half of arms, and a third [...] or 15% of people. It is found in most primates though not in the family of New World monkeys that includes spider and woolly monkeys called atelines.|$|R

6000|$|Three {{principal}} sets of muscles, called [...] "flexors," [...] {{bend the}} fingers and thumb, as in clenching the fist, and three sets--the extensors--extend them, as in straightening the fingers. These muscles are all [...] "long muscles"; {{that is to}} say, the fleshy part of each, lying in and being fixed to {{the bones of the}} arm, is, at the other end, continued into tendons, or <b>rounded</b> <b>cords,</b> which pass into the hand, and are ultimately fixed to the bones which are to be moved. Thus, when the fingers are bent, the fleshy parts of the flexors of the fingers, placed in the arm, contract, in virtue of their peculiar endowment as muscles; and pulling the tendinous cords, connected with their ends, cause them to pull down the bones of the fingers towards the palm.|$|R

50|$|The lateral thyrohyoid {{ligament}} (lateral hyothyroid ligament) is a <b>round</b> elastic <b>cord,</b> {{which forms}} the posterior {{border of the}} thyrohyoid membrane and passes between {{the tip of the}} superior cornu of the thyroid cartilage and the extremity of the greater cornu of the hyoid bone. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve typical lies lateral to this ligament.|$|R

[...] "The large, oval, quite convex shell is {{sculptured}} all over with equal <b>rounded</b> <b>cords</b> or lirae. Its coloration is reddish-brown. Generally five holes are open. The form is oval. The back of the shell is quite convex. It is solid, but thinner than Haliotis rufescens. The outer surface has a uniform dull reddish-brown color. It is sculptured with rounded spiral lirae, nearly equal in size. These number 30 to 40 on the upper surface. At the row of the holes there is an angle. The surface below it slopes almost perpendicularly to the columellar edge, and has about midway an obtuse keel. The spire does not project above the general curve of the back. The inner surface is dark, mostly blue and green with dark coppery stains, pinkish within the spire. The muscle impression is painted in a peculiar and brilliant pattern, like a peacock's tail. The columellar plate is wide, flat, and slopes inward. The cavity of the spire is small, almost concealed. The about five perforations are rather small, elevated and circular." ...|$|R
