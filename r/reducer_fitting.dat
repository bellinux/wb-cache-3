40|$|Eccentric {{reducers}} {{are traditionally}} recommended for the pump suction <b>reducer</b> <b>fitting</b> {{to allow for}} transportation of air through the fitting to the pump. The ability of a concentric reducer to provide an improved approach flow to the pump while still allowing air to be transported through the fitting is investigated. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were utilised to analyse six concentric and six eccentric reducer geometries at four different inlet velocities to determine the flow velocity distribution at the inlet to the pump. It was found that eccentric reducers with angles greater or equal to 15 ° and concentric reducers with an angle greater or equal to 20 ° did not pass the assessment criteria related to the inlet conditions. Air could be hydraulically transported {{through all of the}} concentric reducers modelled except for the 20 ° concentric reducer. A correctly designed concentric reducer will not only provide a more uniform velocity distribution in comparison to an eccentric reducer, but will allow for the hydraulic transportation of air through the reducer.

40|$|For {{studies of}} root growth and morphology, an ideal {{containerized}} plant culture system should provide: 1) adequate nutrients, water and oxygen; 2) appropriate mechanical impedance to root elongation; 3) adequate depth to prevent root binding; and 4) easy separation of roots from the root-zone substrate. Columnar containers are preferable to pots {{because they can}} support deep root growth while taking up less bench space. Many columns can be arranged within a small area, such as a gas-exchange chamber, thereby maximizing the number of treatments and replications in a given space. Standard potting substrates typically contain sphagnum peat mixed with perlite or vermiculite. These well-drained, organic-rich mixtures support an appropriate balance of water and oxygen while also providing exchange surfaces for plant nutrients. Separation of plant roots from the potting substrate, however, is impossible. We have developed a columnar plant culture system that supports healthy plant growth while also enabling complete separation of the roots from the growth substrate. Our substrate of choice is Turface®, a porous ceramic produced by baking clay at high temperatures (Figure 1). Turface® drains well, resists compaction, and retains nutrients well with a cation exchange capacity (CEC) of 33 meq/ 100 g. Our columns are constructed of 2 ” diameter PVC pipe. A bell-shaped <b>reducer</b> <b>fitting</b> secured {{to the bottom of}} the pipe stabilizes the column, and also holds in place a mesh screen. The mesh supports the Turface® substrate while also allowing water to drain by gravity. An automated watering system delivers a dilute nutrient solution to each column. The watering system is programmed to add small amounts of nutrient solution at the substrate surface 20 times per day. This high frequency keeps the tops of the columns moist and ensures delivery of nutrients throughout the column...|$|E
40|$|The {{approach}} flow to a pump must be undisturbed {{and free}} from unequal velocity distributions, unequal pressure distributions, entrained air or gas bubbles, vortices and excessive pre-swirl. A <b>reducer</b> <b>fitting</b> is typically used in pump station pipe {{work to reduce}} the size of the suction pipe to match the size of the pump suction end flange. Two types of reducer fittings are commonly manufactured, namely: Eccentric Reducers and Concentric Reducers. Inlet pipework design guidelines traditionally prescribe the use of eccentric reducers, with the flat side on top. This prescription is to allow the transport of air through the fitting. The flow through an eccentric reducer accelerates along the sloped side as the flow path narrows from below, thereby causing higher velocities towards this sloped side. These flow conditions are contradictory to the recommended pump inlet approach flow conditions and pump station failures have been recorded resulting from the incorrect application of eccentric reducers. Relationships exist to assess the hydraulic transportation of air through a pipe and these relationships can be applied to calculate the ability to transport air through a concentric reducer. It is therefore hypothesised that a correctly designed concentric reducer will not only provide a more uniform pressure/velocity distribution in comparison to an eccentric reducer, but will allow any free air to be hydraulically transported through the reducer to the pump. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was utilised to assess the resulting velocity distributions through various concentric and eccentric reducer geometries at various flow rates. Six concentric reducers and six eccentric reducers were simulated with four inlet velocities. The resulting velocity distributions were recorded with scalar scenes and velocity probes at four positions spaced at a distance of 1 x the downstream diameter starting at the downstream end of the reducer. These velocity distributions were then compared to the pump inlet requirements typically used in the industry. These requirements require the velocity variation along a line drawn through the centre of the pipe to be less than 10 % of the average velocity along that line and the velocity variation along a circle within the pipe is less than 5 % of the average velocity along the circle. It was found that the eccentric reducers with angles of 15 °, 20 ° and 30 ° and the concentric reducer with an angle of 20 ° do not pass the requirements used in the assessment at all four velocities. From these results it was highlighted that some of the standard eccentric reducer geometries (including those specified by AWWA C 208) do not pass the inlet requirements. It was then assessed if air can be hydraulically transported through the concentric reducers utilising available hydraulic air transport theory. Air can be hydraulically transported through all of the concentric reducers except for the 20 ° reducer (the same size that failed the velocity distribution assessment) at 1 m/s for the assessed diameters. It was therefore shown that a correctly designed concentric reducer (angle less or equal to 15 °) will not only provide a more uniform pressure/velocity distribution in comparison to an eccentric reducer, but will allow air to be hydraulically transported through the reducer to the pump.

50|$|An {{eccentric}} <b>reducer</b> is a <b>fitting</b> used in piping systems {{between two}} pipes of different diameters. They are used where {{the diameter of}} the pipe on the upstream side of the fitting (i.e. where flow is coming from) is larger than the downstream side. Unlike a concentric reducer, which resembles a cone, eccentric reducers have an edge that is parallel to the connecting pipe. This parallel edge results in the two pipes having offset center lines. The same fitting can be used in reverse as an eccentric increaser/expander.|$|R
