50|$|Y-ME {{was founded}} in 1978 by breast cancer {{patients}} Ann Marcou (1932 - 2004) and Mimi Kaplan (d. 1983), and began as a hotline operated out of Marcou's Chicago-area home and a support group that met at a local YWCA. The organization was originally named YWCA and Me after its association with the local YWCA and the name was later shortened to Y-ME. Y-ME became a national organization that helped breast cancer patients receive support, access information and make informed decisions about their healthcare. Its hotline was notable for being the only multilingual, <b>round-the-clock</b> <b>support</b> service available in the US and received approximately 40 000 calls per year.|$|E
50|$|During a {{visit to}} CERN {{on the border of}} France and Switzerland in mid-1985, Hawking {{contracted}} pneumonia, which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. She refused, but the consequence was a tracheotomy, which would require round-the-clock nursing care and remove what remained of his speech. The National Health Service was ready to pay for a nursing home, but Jane was determined that he would live at home. The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation. Nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the <b>round-the-clock</b> <b>support</b> he required. One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.|$|E
50|$|Within {{minutes of}} the first {{aircraft}} crashes, the 171st wing was airborne with its only flyable KC-135E. Its mission was to provide aerial refueling to the fuel-thirsty jet fighter aircraft that were providing Combat Air Patrols (CAPs) over the skies of the eastern United States as part of Operation Noble Eagle (ONE). On the ground back in Pittsburgh, the maintainers and aircrews made more aircraft airworthy. The unit went into a wartime footing. Within 24 hours after the first attacks, the 171st wing was flying <b>round-the-clock</b> CAPs <b>support</b> sorties with eight Fully Mission Capable KC-135s. Before the continuous CAP missions were ended in early 2002, more than 13,000 combat missions were flown over U.S. soil.|$|R

50|$|Counselors also resided {{with the}} {{students}} in bedrooms adjacent to their respective dormitories to give <b>round-the-clock</b> <b>support.</b> The counselors, like the students, also attended regular individual and group therapy sessions {{to allow them to}} analyze their own methods and thought to improve. This is a practice which continues to this day.Bettelheim also believed that the Orthogenic School should feel like a home to the students. Furniture in the dormitories was usually antique and very expensive. Students in the dining rooms dined on imported china with metal silverware and glass cups, which was unusual for a treatment center. During the three renovations to the building which Bettelheim supervised, a number of art pieces were commissioned for the school by Bettelheim, including a mural by Jordi Bonet.|$|E
40|$|Demands for {{uninterrupted}} {{availability of}} systems that were hitherto not viewed as {{critical to the}} success of the enterprise has placed a burden upon support infrastructures for those systems. The small-to-medium help desk for a system that comprises part of an enterprise information system is under increasing pressure to provide <b>round-the-clock</b> <b>support,</b> while staffing budgets may not have caught up with the fiscal realities of covering second- or thirdshift on-site personnel. While the volume of calls outside normal hours may be small, a guaranteed turnaround and response to emergencies is essential for many IT operations to gain the trust of their customers. This paper describes a system for automated answering of the help desk telephone during non-peak hours, and for notifying on-call staff of emergencies within minutes. The system uses two voice-capable modems on a well-maintained computer for presenting to the caller a typical phone menu hierarchical menu which may include an option to record a message about some type of emergency. In this event, the system will notify the staff who are on call at that time for that type of emergency, contacting them by means they have specified in advance, such as voice telephone, numeric or alphanumeric pager, or other means. The system is currently undergoing testing in the Enterprise Information System File Service at JPL...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the history of}} a United States Air Force fighter squadron created during the Vietnam War. It focuses on the circumstances prior to the squadron's creation, the selection of what was considered to be an obsolete propeller driven aircraft, the teamwork established between the men who flew the aircraft into war, and those who provided <b>round-the-clock</b> maintenance <b>support</b> seven days a week. ¬†¬†	The demands of fighting a counter-insurgency war placed unforeseen pressure and unexpected calls for close air support for friendly ground forces engaged with a determined enemy. The study of the 6 th Air Commando Squadron during the Vietnam War is an excellent example of how the American military adapted to a tasking for which it had not planned for. It brings insight into the success of the American individual and the concept of teamwork. By understanding the 6 th Air Commando Squadron and its accomplishments during the Vietnam War, an understanding can be gained on how important teamwork is to success. ¬†¬†M. A...|$|R
40|$|Use of IT in {{providing}} homecare services to elderly people {{is expected to}} reduce the workload of care-providers. It is also expected that this will increase the quality of services by providing services <b>round-the-clock</b> and will <b>support</b> independent living of the elderly. However, ITbased care systems can also introduce new types of risks such as those related to availability and accountability. This can possibly lead to a decline of using such expensive IT-based homecare systems in practice. In order to prevent this, we propose a method to identify potential risks of using such a system, and to specify additional requirements of the system to mitigate or prevent these risks. We validate the usability and potential utility of our approach by three experiments using a case from the homecare domain. We discuss whether the proposed approach can be generalized {{for use in the}} wider class of adaptive critical systems...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To examine qualitatively the {{experiences}} of parents participating In Parent to Parent programs. Method: Twenty-four {{parents of children with}} special needs, a subset of subjects in a larger quantitative study, participated in a semi-structured telephone interview to explore the Impact and meaning of being matched with a trained supporting parent. Results: Qualitative analysis reveals a successful match is contingent upon creation of a "reliable ally " in the supporting parent, comprised of four main components: (1) perceived sameness, (2) situational compari-sons that enable learning and growth, (3) <b>round-the-clock</b> availability of <b>support,</b> and (4) mutuality of support. Conclusions: Parent to Parent support creates a community of similar others trained to listen and be sup-portive and provides an opportunity for matched parents to experience equality and mutuality in their rela-tionship. Findings also identify the need for quality control In Parent to Parent programs and the importance of such programs as an adjunct to traditional professional services.

40|$|Abstract‚ÄîThe {{need for}} {{multilingual}} communication in Japan has increased {{due to an}} increase in the number of foreigners in the country. When people communicate in their nonnative language, the differences in language prevent mutual understanding among the communicating individuals. In the medical field, communication between the hospital staff and patients is a serious problem. Currently, medical translators accompany patients to medical care facilities, and the demand for medical translators is increasing. However, medical translators cannot necessarily provide support, especially in cases in which <b>round-the-clock</b> <b>support</b> is required or in case of emergencies. The medical field has high expectations from information technology. Hence, a system that supports accurate multilingual communication is required. Despite recent advances in machine translation technology, it is very difficult to obtain highly accurate translations. We have developed a support system called M 3 for multilingual medical reception. M 3 provides support functions that aid foreign patients in the following respects: conversation, questionnaires, reception pro-cedures, and hospital navigation; it also has a Q&A function. Users can operate M 3 using a touch screen and receive text-based support. In addition, M 3 uses accurate translation tools called parallel texts to facilitate reliable communication through conversations between the hospital staff and the patients. However, if there is no parallel text that expresses what users want to communicate, the users cannot communicate. In this study, we have developed a circulating support environment for multilingual medical communication using parallel texts. The proposed environment can circulate necessary parallel texts through the following procedure: (1) a user provides feedback about the necessary parallel texts, following which (2) these parallel texts are created and evaluated. Keywords‚Äîmultilingual medical communication, parallel texts. I...|$|E
40|$|Mobile apps and tablets {{have assumed}} a {{prominent}} {{position in the}} landscape of technology use in education and training, Numerous successes have already been recorded. However, the rise of social, <b>round-the-clock</b> Internet activity <b>supporting</b> voluntary, loosely organized, informal learning is posing significant challenges for traditional classroom-based education as well as distance teaching. In the era of Web 2. 0, an individual‚Äôs blog post or shared video can generate debate and commentary akin to a successful classroom discussion. At {{the other end of}} the scale, astonishing numbers of people registering for massive open online courses (MOOCs) testify to the growing popularity of free, semi-formal learning environments that afford good learning materials, a degree of social interaction, and tolerance of intermittent participation due to varying interests and constraints. Use of mobile technologies bolsters this phenomenon. It is widely known that mobile learning expands access, but less well understood is that it also provides additional channels for communication and collaboration, facilities for context-inspired content creation, location-specific learning, and augmentation of a person‚Äôs surroundings through extra layers of visual and audio information automatically triggered or delivered on demand. Mobile devices will soon be capable of supporting learners intelligently across study locations and contexts of use, breaking down barriers between formal and informal learning. This article alerts readers to the impacts that these developments are having on traditional models of teaching, since they call into question the role of schools and universities as fixed locations imparting largely static knowledge...|$|R
