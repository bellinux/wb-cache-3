40|$|Drowning {{is a major}} global injury {{problem and}} is the second leading cause of unintentional injury death after road traffic injuries. As a result, many inventions to prevent {{drowning}} and to rescue drowning victims have been made over the years. Because information about many of these inventions that exists in patent databases is {{not found in the}} injury literature, many academic injury researchers and practitioners may be unaware of them. Therefore, a US patent database search was conducted to identify inventions aimed at preventing drowning, for the purpose of disseminating this information among injury prevention researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. The survey identified inventions that could be broadly classified into: (1) pool fences, gates, and latches, (2) detection and signalling devices, (3) floatation <b>devices,</b> (4) water <b>rescue</b> <b>devices,</b> (5) devices for emergencies involving watercraft, (6) devices for preventing drowning in pools, spas, bathtubs, and toilet bowls, (7) devices for preventing scuba diving related drowning, and (8) other miscellaneous inventions. These inventions range from simple devices such as pool fences and rescue nets to complex electronic systems that monitor swimmers in a pool and automatically recognize a swimmer in distress and sound an alarm. There are many inventions that deserve systematic evaluation of their effectiveness in preventing drowning. Especially, relatively low cost devices, affordable for deployment in low- and middle-income countries, should receive particular attention, as these countries endure almost 97 % of global drowning deaths...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{primordial}} {{task of the}} fire-fighting {{and rescue}} services {{in the event of}} a large crisis is the search for human survivors on the incident site. This task, being complex and dangerous, often leads to loss of lives. Unmanned search and <b>rescue</b> <b>devices</b> can provide a valuable tool for saving human lives and speeding up the search and rescue operations. Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) community agrees with the fact that the operator skill is the main factor for successfully using unmanned robotic platforms. The key training concept is “train as you fight ” mentality. Intervention troops focalize on “real training”, as a crisis is difficult to simulate. For this reason, in this paper a methodology of training and support for USAR with unmanned vehicles is proposed. The methodology integrates the Qualitative Spatio-Temporal Representation and Reasoning (QSTRR) framework with USAR tools to decrease the cognitive load on human operators working with sophisticated robotic platforms. Tools for simplifying and improving virtual training environment generation from life data are shown...|$|R

50|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that {{insertion}} and use of the standard tracheal tube is easy, providing a clear airway in the majority of cases. Comparative studies indicate that the standard laryngeal tube is generally as effective as the laryngeal mask airway, while some studies indicate that the Pro-seal laryngeal mask may be more effective than the standard laryngeal tube under controlled ventilation conditions in general anaesthesia.The indications and contraindications for use of the laryngeal tube {{are similar to those of}} the laryngeal mask airway and include the use in general anaesthesia for minor surgical operations. Several studies describe the usefulness of the device in securing a difficult airway, even in cases where insertion of the laryngeal mask had failed. The double-lumen laryngeal tube-Suction II, with the possibility of placing a gastric tube, has been found to have distinct advantages over the standard laryngeal tube and has been recommended as a first-line device to secure the airway in emergency situations when direct laryngoscopy fails in neonates and infants. The laryngeal tube is also recommended for medical personnel not experienced in tracheal intubation, and as a <b>rescue</b> <b>device</b> when intubation has failed in adults.

40|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} (TI) is {{a routine}} procedure {{in the intensive}} care unit (ICU), and is often life saving. However, life-threatening complications occur in a significant proportion of procedures, making TI perhaps one the most common but underappreciated airway emergencies in the ICU. In contrast to the controlled conditions in the operating room (OR), the unstable physiologic state of critically ill patients along with underevaluation of the airways and suboptimal response to pre-oxygenation are the major factors for the high incidence of life-threatening complications like severe hypoxaemia and cardiovascular collapse in the ICU. Studies have shown that strategies planned for TI in the OR can be adapted and extrapolated for use in the ICU. Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation for pre-oxygenation provides adequate oxygen stores during TI for patients with precarious respiratory pathology. The intubation procedure should include not only airway management but also haemodynamic, gas exchange and neurologic care, which are often crucial in critically ill patients. Hence, there is a necessity for the implementation of an Intubation Bundle during routine airway management in the ICU. Adherence to a plan for difficult airway management incorporating the use of intubation aids and airway <b>rescue</b> <b>devices</b> and strategies is useful...|$|R
