5|$|Mitchell and Galle were {{terminated}} from WCMH in June 2009. A {{few days}} later, both nurses were arrested. They {{were charged with}} misuse of official information, a felony that carries the possibility of ten years imprisonment and fines up to $5,000. <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta {{rather than as a}} good faith reporting of facts. He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports did not include the names of patients and federal law exempts medical board reports from patient privacy laws.|$|E
5|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Yamaha could not develop a dirt track motorcycle capable of competing with the dominant Harley-Davidson dirt track team, the American Yamaha importer, Yamaha USA, offered to send Roberts to Europe in 1978 to compete in the World Championship Grand Prix road racing series, along with Kel Carruthers to act as his mentor and crew chief. Roberts also secured the financial backing of the Goodyear tire company. The team planned to compete in the 250cc world championship as well as the Formula 750 series in order to have more practice time to learn the tracks, but their main focus would be on the 500cc class, considered the premier class at the time. His main competition in the 500cc world championship would come from Suzuki rider Barry Sheene, winner of the two previous titles. <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> that he was initially indifferent about competing in Europe, but when he read that Sheene had labeled him as"no threat", he made up his mind to compete. Few observers gave Roberts any chance of winning the championship, citing the reasoning that it would take him at least one season to learn the European circuits.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Area Handbook for the Republic of Turkey, {{written by}} Thomas <b>Roberts,</b> <b>said</b> in late 1968 {{that the army}} had 425,000 men (p.385), three field armies (First: Istanbul, Second: Konya, Third: Erzurum), {{thirteen}} infantry divisions, one armoured division (with M-47s and M-48s), four armoured brigades (M47 Patton tanks), two armoured cavalry regiment, two mechanised infantry brigades, and two parachute battalions. There was a trained reserve of 450,000.|$|E
25|$|The Court's ruling {{concluded}} with a lengthy discussion {{of the nature of}} the Board's order. The employer had claimed that the Board's order was arbitrary and capricious. Justice Roberts reviewed at length the Board's evidentiary hearings, the language of the order, and the nature of the charges against Mackay Radio. Mackay Radio's claim, <b>Roberts</b> <b>said,</b> largely turned on whether the Board had failed to define a current labor dispute. But having already dismissed that argument earlier, Roberts concluded that the Board's order was appropriate.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter Jonathan <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> that, in a musical, {{songs are}} used to convey a character's {{emotions}} and [...] "I wants." [...] Composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice wrote the song [...] "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" [...] {{in order to give}} Simba a medium through which he can express his desire to become King of the Pride Lands. <b>Roberts</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's a way for storytellers to move the story and deliver the direction of the character." ...|$|E

500|$|Basarab sent envoys {{who asked}} for the {{hostilities}} to cease, and in return offered to pay 7,000 marks in silver, submit the fortress of Severin to Robert, and send his own son as hostage. According to the Viennese Illuminated Chronicle, a contemporary account, <b>Robert</b> <b>said</b> about Basarab: [...] "He is the shepherd of my sheep, and I will take {{him out of his}} mountains, dragging him by his beard." [...] Another account writes that <b>Robert</b> <b>said</b> that: [...] "...he will drag the Voivode from his cottage, as would any driver his oxen or shepherd his sheep." ...|$|R
500|$|Julia Roberts was the [...] "one and only" [...] {{choice for}} the role of Anna Scott, {{although}} Roger Michell and Duncan Kenworthy did not expect her to accept. Her agent told her it was [...] "the best romantic comedy she had ever read". <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> that after reading the script she decided she was [...] "going to have to do this".|$|E
500|$|The President of the New Jersey Senate, former Governor Richard Codey, had stated {{his support}} for Corzine's budget {{including}} the tax increase. The stalemate in the negotiations {{had been with the}} New Jersey General Assembly, whose Speaker, Joseph J. Roberts, strongly rejected the Governor's plan. At the time <b>Roberts</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Our caucus feels overwhelmingly that there are much more appealing alternatives to balance the budget than a sales tax increase." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{accommodate}} the game's visual fidelity, the team compromised on frame rate. <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> {{that the decision}} was made early in development, since they initially expected that the PlayStation Vita could run PlayStation 3 assets at 30 Hz. The team used existing code from Wipeout HD as a [...] "starting point" [...] to make the development process more efficient; the art and technical teams of Studio Liverpool worked in parallel. Lovegrove agreed that 30 frames per second was always the goal for the game, since the team wanted to prioritise visual quality. In a Eurogamer interview, <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> that Studio Liverpool were one of the first developers to use a dynamic framebuffer on the PlayStation 3: an algorithm which reduces resolution when the game engine is stressed, maintaining performance and optimising frame rate. The technique, known as resolution throttling, was carried over from Wipeout HD to Wipeout 2048: [...] "If you are dead set on locking frame-rate and resolution your whole game is (graphically) restricted by the worst-case scenario".|$|E
6000|$|... "What are you {{worrying}} {{this poor}} fellow for?" [...] <b>Robert</b> <b>said</b> angrily to the boys. [...] "If {{you do not}} be off, and that quickly, I will lay my cudgel about your shoulders." ...|$|R

500|$|Although Wipeout 2048 and Wipeout HD have {{a shared}} shader program {{and did not}} require {{retooling}} for the Vita's architecture, <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> that a [...] "great deal" [...] of time and attention was spent fine-tuning the game's shader effects for the Vita's GPU. Lovegrove thought that the method of working on a PlayStation 3 and its handheld counterpart was identical (a sentiment generally shared by the team), and <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> that the systems' similarities helped the team [...] "get moving quickly". Roberts added that the game's lighting system was identical to that of Wipeout HD; both games' ships shared image-based lighting, with blended diffuse and specular highlights effects and the vertex-based lighting system used for weaponry. According to Roberts, {{the main difference between}} the games was PlayStation Vita's utilisation of the effects via the GPU; PlayStation 3 relied on SPUs. The team decided to use anti-aliased colour buffers for real-time shadow rendering, instead of depth buffers. This gave the game greater transparency effects, since the memory cost of anti-aliasing was 8 bits per pixel; therefore, 4x MSAA (multisample anti-aliasing) buffers contained the same amount of memory as a 32-bit depth buffer. Another feature which Roberts considered an improvement was tone mapping (partly due to Vita's superior support of buffer formats), which gave Wipeout 2048 better exposure control and bloom effects.|$|E
500|$|On September 5, Arkansas State coach Steve <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> he {{was told}} by the Big 12 Conference's {{supervisor}} of football officials that game officials wrongly overturned ASU's recovery of the onside kick. [...] He said the Big 12 Conference Supervisor of Officials told Arkansas State there had been no illegal formation, that no penalty should have been called, and that Arkansas State should have been awarded possession of the football. [...] A Big 12 Conference spokesman said he could not confirm or deny that such a conversation took place and that any such conversation would be confidential.|$|E
500|$|Elements of the comic's story {{carry over}} into the episode, such as his {{confusion}} between a sonic screwdriver and a toothbrush, and the Doctor's aptitude at football. However, <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> that the episode was [...] "a completely different situation" [...] from the comic strip, as the Doctor did not know Craig as he did Mickey, {{and there was the}} added enemy of the upstairs apartment. When Roberts began writing for the episode, he knew the series' overarching plot but was not aware who was to be cast as the Eleventh Doctor. Roberts based the Doctor's lines on those written in Moffat's completed scripts and further characterization was added by Matt Smith's reading of the lines.|$|E

500|$|Two years later, {{the project}} was officially {{announced}} as Freelancer at GameStock, an annual showcase to the mass media of Microsoft's games. [...] The media covered the event, focusing on the features promised for this game. [...] There were concerns {{about the state of}} the graphics and uncertainties over the promise of a dynamic economy, but gaming site GameSpot gave Roberts and his company, Digital Anvil, the benefit of their doubts. [...] Initially in 1999, Roberts announced the game would be available on the market by fall 2000. [...] However, the project suffered delays and by Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2000, <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> the earliest release for the game was at the end of 2001.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book in World Literature Today, Sheila <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> that Gordimer's mixture of first- and third-person {{narrative}} is [...] "an interesting device" [...] which is [...] "superbly handled" [...] by the author. She commented that it allows the reader to get inside Rosa, and then step back and observe her from a distance. Roberts described Gordimer's handling of Rosa's predicament, continuing the role her father had given her versus abandoning the struggle and finding herself, as [...] "extremely moving and memorable". In The Sewanee Review Bruce King wrote that Burger's Daughter is a [...] "large, richly complex, densely textured novel". He said that it [...] "fill with unresolvable ironies and complications" [...] as Gordimer explores the dilemmas faced by her characters in the South African political landscape.|$|E
500|$|Reception for the {{character}} has been positive. The BBC's official Neighbours website stated that Charlene most memorable moments were [...] "her wedding to Scott and punching Scott in the face during their first meeting." [...] The Independent said Minogue's [...] "elfin prettiness" [...] won Charlene a huge following in Australia and Britain. During a TV Week feature on Minogue, a columnist said she [...] "brought to life {{one of the most}} loved and memorable characters of Australian TV." [...] Colleen Last from MSN TV branded Charlene [...] "iconic" [...] and [...] "beloved". During a column on the [...] "Top five ex-Neighbours stars", The Daily Telegraph's Robin Wilks placed Minogue at number one, commenting that [...] "Kylie was once best-known as the sharp-tongued, permanently overalled tomboy Charlene". The Age's Jo <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> that the [...] "slightly goofy" [...] Charlene was a [...] "tousle-headed teenager with an oil rag and hoop earrings".|$|E

500|$|Alex Roberts of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter {{attended}} the event. He criticized the ladder matches as [...] "dangerous spectacles" [...] where many wrestlers [...] "took plenty of painful-looking bumps" [...] but often failed to score [...] "a corresponding crowd reaction". He {{also stated that}} the apparent injuries suffered by Sin Cara and the Miz in those matches had unnerved the audience. In contrast, Roberts felt that the two world title matches, which focused on [...] "in-ring psychology and storytelling", were much more [...] "memorable" [...] or even [...] "legendary". Regarding the main event, <b>Roberts</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "even a match-ending run-in bypassed the expected convoluted machinations and played perfectly to the narrative at hand". At the end of 2011, Nathan Kyght of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter ranked Money in the Bank the best of 34 pay-per-views in 2011, including those from WWE, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, Ring of Honor, and Dragon Gate USA.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} recorded by Roberts and Tikovoi. However, the pair struggled to finish its production, with Roberts describing {{the process as}} something that [...] "just wouldn't work". The incompletion of the song led to stress and illness for Roberts, and she decided to contact producer Diplo {{to work on the}} record. Discussing her choice in an interview for The Guardian, <b>Roberts</b> <b>said</b> that she only had one chance to get him to work with her and asked for his assistance. After Diplo reassured the singer that he would help, Roberts revealed that the situation was no longer in her hands and that she would wait for him to contact her with some progress. Despite her worries, she felt that [...] "he just got it straight away". Communications were limited between the pair, but when Roberts received Diplo's finished production, she was too nervous to listen to it immediately. Instead, she burnt the track to a CD, and drove to a deserted field with her younger brother and sister, where she played the song loudly. After positive responses from her siblings, Roberts declared Diplo a [...] "genius".|$|E
