2500|$|In {{generally}} warmer {{areas of}} the Eurasian continent, the diverse pheasant family replaces the grouse as the significant group of birds in the golden eagle's diet. Across the range, pheasants make up 5.7% of the diet of this species. Unlike grouse, pheasants are not known to comprise {{more than half of}} the nest remains in any study, but they can be important nonetheless. This is especially true in Spain, where most studies show that the pheasants at 22.8-28.7% of the diet, mainly the <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris rufa), are the second most prominent prey species after the European rabbit, with the <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridge</b> and the rabbit collectively making up to more than 90% of the prey remains in several nests there. The red-legged species, along with the rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) and grey partridge (Perdix perdix), are the leading prey group in the French Pyrenees at 15.8% of a sampling of 114 from 10 nests. In Hungary, the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) appears to be the favored prey species, making up 26.6% of the prey of a sampling of 49 from 4 nests there. In Japan, the copper pheasant (Syrmaticus soemmerringii) is the second most common single prey species, making up 17.8% of the remains (sample size of 967 from 5 nests). In the Caspian Sea area of Kazakhstan, the most common bird species (and third most common overall prey species) is the chukar (Alectoris chukar), representing 19.5% of a sampling of 468 from 36 nests. Chukar and Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius) are reportedly the primary avian prey species in Armenia. In the Himalayan region, two very large pheasants, the Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus) and the Himalayan snowcock (Tetraogallus himalayensis), are reportedly among the most significant prey for eagles. Moorland francolin (Scleroptila psilolaemus) were reportedly the most common bird prey species in Ethiopia's Bale Mountains, comprising 10% among a sample size of 49 at 4 nests. North America has fewer native pheasants species but introduced species such as grey partridge, ring-necked pheasant and, especially, chukar are readily hunted (native quail seem to be largely or entirely ignored as prey by golden eagle, perhaps because of their small size or dense thicket-dwelling habits). The chukar is the most significant bird species in the diet in Nevada (at 5.4%) and the second most significant bird species in Washington state (at 11.8%). One native North American “pheasant” known to be occasionally hunted is the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), the largest species of galliform. The golden eagle is the only major avian predator of adult turkeys. The hunting techniques used on pheasants are probably similar to those used for grouse. Pheasants hunted by golden eagles are also similar in size in grouse. Alectoris sp. weigh around [...] and medium-sized species weighing around [...] Snowcock will often weigh , whereas the female and male adult turkey weigh around [...] and , respectively. On a wildlife monitoring camera in Tennessee, a golden eagle was filmed assaulting an adult turkey, appearing to use a “contour flight with short glide attack” but the quarry in this case appears to successfully avoid the strikes by running and then ultimately flying away. Breeding pairs of eagles have been known to hunt turkeys cooperatively.|$|E
2500|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl may hunt {{at least}} 300 species of bird. In Europe, {{the most common}} avian prey species are the {{normally}} feral or domestic [...] rock pigeons (Columba livia), although the [...] common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) can be locally even more significant. In the Netherlands, the common wood pigeon {{is the most important}} prey species, making up 37.3% by number and 38.3% by biomass. Yet another, smaller study of the Netherlands found the rock pigeon to be the primary prey species. In a dietary study from Luxembourg, the common wood pigeon was the most frequent prey species, making 19% of the remains by number. A study from Romania listed the rock pigeon was the second most frequently recorded prey behind only the Romanian hamster and the largest contributed of biomass. Unusually, in the Netherlands, birds were the primary food in both number (77.6%) and biomass (72%). Also, in Luxembourg, eagle-owls hunted birds in general were more regularly than mammals, as nearly 70% of prey remains there were avian. At least six other species of pigeon and dove have also been recorded as prey. However, perhaps the most significant contributor of prey at the family level is the corvids. The [...] carrion crow (Corvus corone) is the second most widely recorded avian prey species in Europe and, locally, good numbers are also taken of [...] hooded crow (Corvus cornix), [...] western jackdaws (Corvus monedula), [...] Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius), [...] common ravens (Corvus corax), [...] rooks (Corvus corone), two species each of magpie and chough and the [...] spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes), in rough descending order of reportage in the eagle-owl’s diet. In Baden-Württemberg, Germany, the carrion crow was the most frequently recorded bird among an exceptionally diverse recorded prey base including than 65 bird species there (although birds only comprised 27% of the prey numbers overall). Unlike smaller passerines, corvids roost in numbers in relatively open spots, which make them fairly vulnerable to a predator as stealthy and powerful as the eagle-owl. [...] More than 17 species of gamebirds have been recorded in the Eurasian eagle-owl’s diet but they are normally taken in small numbers. There are, however, exceptions. In one study conducted in lower Austria, the most frequently identified prey species was the [...] grey partridge (Perdix perdix), which is the most widely reported gamebird prey for eagle-owls in Europe. One study of a “primeval” forested region of Finland found various grouse species to be the most significant contributor of biomass, namely in descending order the [...] western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), the [...] black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the [...] hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). In inland areas of Norway, the large forest grouse were also significant biomass contributors. The same forest grouse species were also found to be significant to diet along the Pechora River in Russia. Other gamebirds can be important secondary prey species in different parts of Europe: the [...] <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris rufa) in western Europe, the [...] rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) and the [...] rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) in alpine highlands, the [...] ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) in eastern Europe and the [...] willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) in the sub-Arctic zone. In Turkey, the most significant prey by number was the [...] chukar (Alectoris chukar), comprising 20.5% of remains. A Korean study in two habitat types (forest and field) found that ring-necked pheasants were the main prey species, making up an average of 19.33% by number and 34.81% by biomass. Other birds of prey are perhaps second only to pigeons and corvids amongst avian contributors to the diet (their ecological relationships with eagle-owls are explored in more detail below).|$|E

60|$|Birds also {{frequently}} have small portions of earth on their feet; and Mr. Darwin has shown by actual experiment {{that almost all}} such earth contains seeds. Thus in {259} nine grains of earth on the leg of a woodcock a seed of the toad-rush was found which germinated; while a wounded <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridge</b> had a ball of earth weighing {{six and a half}} ounces adhering to its leg, and from this earth Mr. Darwin raised no less than eighty-two separate plants of about five distinct species. Still more remarkable was the experiment with six and three-quarter ounces of mud from the edge of a little pond, which, carefully treated under glass, produced 537 distinct plants! This is equal to a seed for every six grains of mud, and when we consider how many birds frequent the edges of ponds in search of food, or come there to drink, it is evident that great numbers of seeds may be dispersed by this means.|$|E

60|$|It {{is not at}} all {{probable}} that the <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridge</b> will ever drive out our own bird, a contingency which some have feared. That would be a misfortune, for we do not wish to change one bird for another, or to lose any species we now possess, but to have a greater variety. We are better off with two partridges than we were with one, even if the invader does not afford such good sport nor such delicate eating. They exist side by side, and compete with each other; but such competition is not necessarily destructive to either. On the contrary, it acts and re-acts healthily and to the improvement of both. It is a fact that in small islands, very far removed from the mainland, where the animals have been exempt from all foreign competition--that is, from the competition of casual colonists--when it does come it proves, in many cases, fatal to them. Fortunately, this country's large size and nearness to the mainland has prevented any such fatal crystallization of its organisms as we see in islands like St. Helena. That any English species would be exterminated by foreign competition is extremely unlikely; whether we introduce exotic birds or not, the only losses we shall have to deplore in the future will, like those of the past, be directly due to our own insensate action in slaying every rare and beautiful thing with powder and shot. From the introduction of exotic species nothing is to be feared, but much to be hoped.|$|E
60|$|Even {{since the}} {{insulation}} of Britain {{a great many}} new plants and animals {{have been added to}} our population, both by human design and in several other casual fashions. The fallow deer {{is said to have been}} introduced by the Romans, and domesticated ever since in the successive parks of Celt and Saxon, Dane and Norman. The edible snail, still scattered thinly over our southern downs, and abundant at Box Hill and a few other spots in Surrey or Sussex, was brought over, they tell us, by the same luxurious Italian epicures, and is even now confined, imaginative naturalists declare, to the immediate neighbourhood of Roman stations. The mediæval monks, in like manner, introduced the carp for their Friday dinners. One of our commonest river mussels at the present day did not exist in England at all a century ago, but was ferried hither from the Volga, clinging to the bottoms of vessels from the Black Sea, and has now spread itself through all our brooks and streams to the very heart and centre of England. Thus, from day to day, as in society at large, new introductions constantly take place, and old friends die out for ever. The brown rat replaces the old English black rat; strange weeds kill off the weeds of ancient days; fresh flies and grubs and beetles crop up, and disturb the primitive entomological balance. The bustard is gone from Salisbury Plain; the fenland butterflies have disappeared with the drainage of the fens. In their place the <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridge</b> invades Norfolk; the American black bass is making himself quite at home, with Yankee assurance, in our sluggish rivers; and the spoonbill is nesting of its own accord among the warmer corners of the Sussex downs.|$|E
60|$|Although the beaks {{and feet}} of birds are {{generally}} clean, earth sometimes adheres to them: {{in one case}} I removed sixty-one grains, and in another case twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from {{the foot of a}} partridge, and in the earth there was a pebble as large as the seed of a vetch. Here is a better case: the leg of a woodcock was sent to me by a friend, with a little cake of dry earth attached to the shank, weighing only nine grains; and this contained a seed of the toad-rush (Juncus bufonius) which germinated and flowered. Mr. Swaysland, of Brighton, who during the last forty years has paid close attention to our migratory birds, informs me that he has often shot wagtails (Motacillae), wheatears, and whinchats (Saxicolae), on their first arrival on our shores, before they had alighted; and he has several times noticed little cakes of earth attached to their feet. Many facts could be given showing how generally soil is charged with seeds. For instance, Professor Newton sent me the leg of a <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridge</b> (Caccabis rufa) which had been wounded and could not fly, with a ball of hard earth adhering to it, and weighing six and a half ounces. The earth had been kept for three years, but when broken, watered and placed under a bell glass, no less than eighty-two plants sprung from it: these consisted of twelve monocotyledons, including the common oat, and at least one kind of grass, and of seventy dicotyledons, which consisted, judging from the young leaves, of at least three distinct species. With such facts before us, can we doubt that the many birds which are annually blown by gales across great spaces of ocean, and which annually migrate--for instance, the millions of quails across the Mediterranean--must occasionally transport a few seeds embedded in dirt adhering to their feet or beaks? But I shall have to recur to this subject.|$|E

60|$|That {{these large}} kinds thrive so well {{with us is}} an {{encouraging}} fact; but the question that concerns us at present is the feasibility of importing birds of the grove, chiefly of the passerine order, and sending them forth to give a greater variety and richness to our bird life. To go with such an object to tropical countries would only be to court failure. Nature's highest types, surpassing all others in exquisite beauty of form, brilliant colouring, and perfect melody, can never be known to our woods and groves. These rarest avian gems may not be removed from their setting, and to those who desire to know them in their unimaginable lustre, {{it will always be}} necessary to cross oceans and penetrate into remote wildernesses. We must go rather to regions where the conditions of life are hard, where winters are long and often severe, where Nature is not generous in the matter of food, and the mouths are many, and the competition great. Nor even from such regions could we take any strictly migratory species with any prospect of success. Still, limiting ourselves to the resident, and consequently to the hardiest kinds, and to those possessing only a partial migration, it is surprising to find how many there are to choose from, how many are charming melodists, and how many have the bright tints in which our native species are so sadly lacking. The field from which the supply can be drawn is very extensive, and includes the continent of Europe, the countries of North Asia, a large portion of North America and Antarctic America, or South Chili and Patagonia. It would not be going too far to say that for every English species, inhabiting the garden, wood, field, stream, or waste, {{at least half a dozen}} resident species, with similar habits, might be obtained from the countries mentioned which would be superior to our own in melody (the nightingale and lark excepted), bright plumage, grace of form, or some other attractive quality. The question then arises; What reason is there for believing that these exotics, imported necessarily in small numbers, would succeed in winning a footing in our country, and become a permanent addition to its avifauna? For it has been admitted that our species are not few, in spite of the losses that have been suffered, and that the bird population does not diminish, however much its character may have altered and deteriorated from the aesthetic point of view, and probably also from the utilitarian. There are no vacant places. Thus, the streams are fished by herons, grebes, and kingfishers, while the rushy margins are worked by coots and gallinules, and, above the surface, reed and sedge-warblers, with other kinds, inhabit the reed-beds. The decaying forest tree is the province of the woodpecker, of which there are three kinds; and the trunks and branches of all trees, healthy or decaying, are quartered by the small creeper, that leaves no crevice unexplored in its search for minute insects and their eggs. He is assisted by the nuthatch; and in summer the wryneck comes (if he still lives), and deftly picks up the little active ants that are always wildly careering over the boles. The foliage is gleaned by warblers and others; and not even the highest terminal twigs are left unexamined by tits and their fellow-seekers after little things. Thrushes seek for worms in moist grounds about the woods; starlings and rooks go to the pasture lands; the lark and his relations keep to the cultivated fields; and there also dwells the larger partridge. Waste and stony grounds are occupied by the chats, and even on the barren mountain summits the ptarmigan gets his living. Wagtails run on the clean margins of streams; and littoral birds of many kinds are in possession of the entire sea-coast. Thus, the whole ground appears to be already sufficiently occupied, the habitats of distinct species overlapping each other like the scales on a fish. And when we have enumerated all these, we find that scores of others have been left out. The important fly-catcher; the wren, Nature's diligent little housekeeper, that leaves no dusty corner uncleaned; and the pigeons, that have a purely vegetable diet. The woods and thickets are also ranged by jays, cuckoos, owls, hawks, magpies, butcher-birds-- Nature's gamekeepers, with a licence to kill, which, after the manner of game-keepers, they exercise somewhat indiscriminately. Above the earth, the air is peopled by swifts and swallows in the daytime, and by goatsuckers at night. And, as if all these were not enough, the finches are found scattered everywhere, from the most secluded spot in nature to the noisy public thoroughfare, and are eaters of most things, from flinty seed to softest caterpillar. This being the state of things, one might imagine that experience and observation are scarcely needed to prove to us that the exotic, strange to the conditions, and where its finest instincts would perhaps be at fault, would have no chance of surviving. Nevertheless, odd as it may seem, the small stock of facts bearing on the subject which we possess point to a contrary conclusion. It might have been assumed, for instance, that the <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridge</b> would never have established itself with us, where the ground was already fully occupied by a native species, which possessed the additional advantage of a more perfect protective colouring. Yet, in spite of being thus handicapped, the stranger has conquered a place, and has spread throughout the greater part of England. Even more remarkable is the case of the pheasant, with its rich plumage, a native of a hot region; yet our cold, wet climate and its unmodified bright colours have not been fatal to it, and practically it is one of our wild birds. The large capercailzie has also been successfully introduced from Norway. Small birds would probably become naturalized much more readily than large ones; they are volatile, and can more quickly find suitable feeding-ground, and safe roosting and nesting places; their food is also more abundant and easily found; their small size, which renders them inconspicuous, gives them safety; and, finally, they are very much more adaptive than large birds.|$|E

Using immunohistochemistry and histology we studied ocular lesions and antigen distribution in <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridges</b> experimentally infected with WNV and in <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridges</b> and common pheasants naturally infected with BagV. [Material and methods]: Cross sections of eyes from euthanized or dead birds were examined microscopically. A polyclonal antibody against the envelope protein of WNV was used for antigen detection. [Results]: In both infections, inflammatory infiltrates were present {{in different parts of}} the eye, although pectenitis was only present in birds infected with BagV. In WNV infected partridges, viral antigen was detected in endothelial cells throughout the eye and in the rods and cones layer of the retina. BagV antigen was present in the endothelial cells of the pecten (only in partridges) and in different cells of the retina. [Discussion & Conclusion]: This is the first time that ocular lesions caused by WNV are described in gallinaceous birds. Detection of BagV antigen in the retina may be responsible for the apparent blindness observed. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Case presentation Three juvenile farm-reared <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridges</b> in a batch of 100 {{of the same species}} were sent for clinical and pathological investigations. The owner referred of a sudden isolation of the sick animals, with apathy, diarrhea, ruffled plumage and respiratory rattles. Post mortem total body lateral projection radiograph showed an increased perihilar interstitial pattern and air bronchogram signs due to lung edema. At necropsy, carcasses showed cachexia; the pericloacal region was soiled by diarrheic fecal material. From the mouth to the intestine, a mucous yellowish fluid was present on a slightly reddish mucosa. Histopathology showed slight edema and congestion with different free fungal elements, referable to blastospores, hyphae and pseudohyphae. Biomolecular exam identified the most similar sequences as belonging to Leucosporidium scottii. Conclusion To our knowledge, this case report describes {{for the first time this}} fungal species as a causative agent of candidiasis in birds. </p...|$|R

40|$|Carotenoids are organic {{pigments}} {{involved in}} several important physiological functions and {{may serve as}} indicators of individual quality in animals. These pigments are only obtained by animals from the diet, {{but they can be}} later transformed into other carotenoids by specific enzymatic reactions. The diet of farm-reared and probably wild <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridges</b> (Alectoris rufa) is mainly based on cereals that contain high levels of lutein and zeaxanthin. These two carotenoids are also predominant in internal tissues and blood of <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridges.</b> However, in their integuments, astaxanthin and papilioerythrinone (the last one identified in this work) are mainly present in their free form and esterified with fatty acids. According to available literature about carotenoid metabolism in animals, we propose that astaxanthin (λ max= 478 nm) and papilioerythrinone (λ max= 452 - 478 nm) are the result of a chromatic convergence of the transformation of dietary zeaxanthin and lutein, respectively. Moreover, the results obtained in this work provide the first identification by liquid chromatography coupled to accurate mass quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer system of papilioerythrinone (m/z 581. 3989 [M+H] +) in the skin (i. e., not feathers) of a vertebrate. Astaxanthin and papilioerythrinone are very close in terms of chemical structure and coloration, and the combination of these two keto-carotenoids is responsible for the red color of the ornaments in <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridges.</b> Esther García-de Blas was supported by a predoctoral grant (JAE-PRE) from the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) cofinanced by Fondo Social Europeo.

40|$|The repopulations {{carried out}} with captive raised <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridges</b> don’t seem to conduct to {{satisfactory}} results. Currently, the partridges present to the free state in different Tuscany areas (obtained from captivity raised animals) are not yet able to reconstitute self sustaining wild populations. The presence of hybrids with non indigenous partridges (E. G. A. chukar) and the genetic/behavioural alterations, {{due to the traditional}} breeding, are presumably the principal causes of the insufficient quality of the reintroduced animals. For these reason we wanted to test the reproduction ability of the genetically pure <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridges</b> in controlled aviaries with the aim to produce partridges more fitted for wildlife release. 14 couples of red partridges, certified genetically not hybridized with A. chukar by theNational Institute for Wild Fauna, were used for the test. Only 6 couples brooded the laid eggs and only 3 couples of them completed the brooding, with the birth of 17 partridges in total. The study therefore has underlined the necessity to use the direct brooding for the selection of the reproducers of the game farms, with the aim to improve the natural reproductive ability of the captive raised animals...|$|R
25|$|This aviary was {{formerly}} home to Andean Condors {{but is now}} the home {{to a variety of}} European birds after Europe on the Edge was demolished in late 2017. The species include here consist of European black vultures and griffon vultures, and the rarer of the two European storks, the black stork. There are spoonbills, ibises and egrets as well as a selection of waterfowl. Smaller birds include rock doves, northern lapwings, <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridges</b> and the native but rare red-billed chough.|$|R

50|$|The {{natural range}} of the <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridge</b> is France, Spain and Portugal. However, it was {{introduced}} from France to Great Britain in the 18th century, and has since become an important gamebird there. As it is a mediterranean species, it thrives in hot, dry areas with sandy soil. The ability to breed two clutches simultaneously has led to it being extensively reared in captivity, and released for shooting. The breeding of chukars (Alectoris chukar) and red-legged/chukar hybrids is prohibited, due to its impact on wild populations of red-legs. The <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridge</b> {{is believed to be}} in decline across its range.|$|E
50|$|The chukar readily interbreeds {{with the}} <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridge</b> (Alectoris rufa), and the {{practice}} of breeding and releasing captive-bred hybrids has been banned in various countries including the United Kingdom, as it is a threat to wild populations.|$|E

40|$|Restocking from captive-reared <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridges</b> (Alectoris rufa) is a {{frequent}} practice in some Spanish regions, due to the strong decrease of wild populations size in the last years. Chukar partridges (A. chukar), which never lived as wild game birds in Spain, are more prolific and efficient meat producers, being legally bred in many Spanish farms to be directly sent to slaughterhouses. Releasing foreign partridges species or hybrids is strictly forbidden by hunting and environment preservation laws. However, eventual hybridization with chukar partridges in breeding farms is a worrying possibility as, in many cases, farms produce birds for both meat and restocking purposes. DNA analyses might be useful to elucidate the genetic purity of wild or farmed partridges. Single Strand Conformation Polymorphisms (SSCP´s) were studied on individual DNA samples from Spanish supposed red-legged and captive chukar partridges. Two mitochondrial (Cytochrome B and D-loop) and one nuclear (Ribosomal DNA-intervening transcribed spacer, ITS) regions were considered for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) design and further polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results suggest that these techniques might identify interspecific A. rufa x A. chukar hybrids among wild and captive supposed <b>red-legged</b> <b>partridges</b> by detecting chukar partridge ancestors in their genealogies. On the other hand, these markers showed intra population genetic variability...|$|R
