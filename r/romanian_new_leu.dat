40|$|Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) {{represents}} a fundamental concept in exchange rate modeling. The main idea {{is given by}} equality between prices in two different countries when expressing in the same currency. This paper aims to analyze the behavior of real exchange rate between EURO and <b>Romanian</b> <b>new</b> <b>leu</b> (RON) under PPP paradigm. We use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron stationarity tests in order to check real exchange deviations from PPP. Also, we investigate {{the existence of a}} connection between long-term between nominal exchange rate and industrial producer price indices from Romania and euro area. The main conclusions of this research highlight that PPP doesn’t holds; real exchange rate stationarity tests doest not confirm the stationarity, thus between the aforementioned three variables it doesn’t exists any equilibrium relation...|$|E
