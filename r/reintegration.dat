With the support association Scugnizzi, which operates in the juvenile prison of Nisida, Naples supports various projects aimed at the social <b>reintegration</b> of young offenders once granted their punishment.|$|E
5|$|The <b>reintegration</b> of French prisoners into {{civilian}} life was facilitated by {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to regain their pre-war jobs because of the shortage of labour. The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be more sympathetic to the Vichy regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups.|$|E
5|$|Though {{his career}} spanned the {{desegregation}} and <b>reintegration</b> of the NFL, as an owner, {{he never had}} an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd. Bell's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph. Although {{he did not have}} the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games, he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers, and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.|$|E
5|$|After the Erdut Agreement {{was signed}} in 1995, the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) was {{established}} to enable the return of Croatian refugees and to prepare the region for <b>reintegration</b> into Croatia. This UN peacekeeping force provided security during the transition period between 1996 and 1998. It was only in 1999 that Croats began returning to Vukovar in significant numbers, {{and many of the}} pre-war inhabitants never returned. By March 2001, the municipality was recorded as having 31,670 inhabitants– less than half the pre-war total– of whom 18,199 (57.46%) were Croats and 10,412 (32.88%) were Serbs. The community did not recover its mixed character: Croats and Serbs now lived separate social lives. Public facilities such as shops, cafés, restaurants, sports clubs, schools, non-governmental organisations and radio stations were re-established on segregated lines, with separate facilities for each community.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Review, Admiral Graf Spee returned to Spain for a fourth non-intervention patrol. Following fleet manoeuvres and a brief visit to Sweden, the ship conducted a fifth and final patrol in February 1938. In 1938, KzS Hans Langsdorff took command of the vessel; she conducted a series of goodwill visits to various foreign ports throughout the year. These included cruises into the Atlantic, where she stopped in Tangier and Vigo. She also participated in extensive fleet manoeuvres in German waters. She was part of the celebrations for the <b>reintegration</b> of the port of Memel into Germany, and a fleet review in honour of Admiral Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. Between 18 April and 17 May 1939, she conducted another cruise into the Atlantic, stopping in the ports of Ceuta and Lisbon. On 21 August 1939, Admiral Graf Spee departed Wilhelmshaven, bound for the South Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|As a brigadier in 2003, Barrons {{served his}} second tour in Northern Ireland, {{this time as}} a brigade commander. In 2005, he was {{appointed}} to Assistant Chief of Staff, Commitments, a senior staff position. He was promoted to major general in 2008 and deployed to Iraq for the second time, this time to Baghdad, with responsibility for joint operations. He then served briefly with the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps before being sent to Afghanistan for the second time, when he headed an ISAF <b>reintegration</b> unit to provide incentives for Taliban soldiers to surrender. He later became Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Operations).|$|E
5|$|On 1 October, Galbraith {{informed}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman of {{the plan}} without providing any details. Similarly, Ahrens and Eide informed RSK president Milan Martić. Although early Z-4 Plan negotiations were planned without actually disclosing the plan to Croatia and the RSK, elements {{of the plan}} were leaked to Belgrade and Zagreb newspapers in mid-October. According to Florence Hartmann, in October representatives of Tuđman and those of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević met in Graz, Austria to discuss the proposed <b>reintegration</b> of the RSK into Croatia and {{their opposition to the}} Z-4 Plan. Tuđman disliked the plan because it envisaged a Serb state in Croatia, while Milošević saw it as a dangerous precedent that could be applied to majority non-Serb or ethnically-mixed regions of rump Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo, Vojvodina and the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} {{had decided that}} the RUF could not be trusted, {{and would have to}} be confronted and forced to enter the UN's Disarmament, Demobilisation, and <b>Reintegration</b> (DDR) process. They assessed that there were three options available to achieve this—to deploy British forces against the RUF, for UNAMSIL to expand its operations and confront the RUF, or for the Sierra Leonean government to use loyal forces (the SLA, former SLA personnel, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, and several other militia groups) to take on the RUF. Richards estimated that a British deployment against the RUF would require at least a brigade-sized force (in excess of 5,000 troops). Nevertheless, British forces' involvement in Sierra Leone was politically unpopular in Westminster and the MoD could not assemble such a force while maintaining its commitments elsewhere, so the use of British forces to directly confront the RUF was ruled out. Also ruled out was a UNAMSIL-led confrontation. Although UNAMSIL's mandate would have allowed it to enter into combat with the RUF, the national contingents were reluctant to leave their bases and its focus remained on peacekeeping rather than the peace enforcement that the British and others believed was necessary.|$|E
5|$|The overall British {{operation}} was mostly completed by September 2000. The RUF began to disarm after political pressure, and later economic sanctions, were exerted on Liberia—which had supported the RUF {{in exchange for}} conflict diamonds smuggled out of Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leonean government eventually signed a ceasefire with the RUF that obliged the latter to enter the Disarmament, Demobilisation, and <b>Reintegration</b> (DDR) process. By September 2001, when the British training teams were replaced by an international force, the DDR process was almost complete. British forces continued {{to be involved in}} Sierra Leone by providing the largest contribution of personnel to the international training team and advising on a restructuring of Sierra Leone's armed forces. A small force was deployed to the area in 2003 to ensure stability while several indictments and arrests were made by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The success of British operations in Sierra Leone vindicated several concepts, including the retention of high-readiness forces. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was keen to see Western interventions in other conflicts, and—along with France—supported the creation of several European Union Battlegroups for the purpose. As it happened, political opposition and later British commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq prevented further British operations in Africa.|$|E

25|$|South Ossetian {{authorities}} had stated that 20 {{were killed and}} 150 wounded in Tskhinvali after overnight shelling. That day, Georgian <b>Reintegration</b> Minister Temur Iakobashvili said that the city of Zugdidi in western Georgia was being bombed.|$|E
25|$|During Reconstruction, the Rangers were {{replaced}} by a Union-controlled version of the Rangers aka the Texas State Police. Charged with enforcing unpopular new laws that came with <b>reintegration,</b> that organization fell into disrepute. The TSP only existed from July 22, 1870 to April 22, 1873.|$|E
25|$|The main {{arguments}} are, {{the abandonment}} of the region by their state governments, cultural and racial integration which was divided by {{the region in the}} colonial and republican period. The <b>reintegration</b> of the Huasteca is considered a historic debt that it has with the indigenous peoples of the region.|$|E
25|$|Under the Department of Labor, the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) {{offers a}} variety of {{programs}} targeted at ending homelessness among veterans. The Homeless Veterans' <b>Reintegration</b> Program (HVRP) is the only national program that is exclusively focused on assisting veterans as they reenter the workforce. In addition, the VETS program also has an Incarcerated Veterans' Transition Program as well as services that are unique to female Veterans. Mainstream programs initiated by the Department of Labor have included the Workforce Investment Act, One-Stop Career Centers, and a Community Voice Mail system that helps to connect homeless individuals around the United States with local resources. In addition, targeted labor programs have included the Homeless Veterans' <b>Reintegration</b> Project, the Disability Program Navigator Initiative, efforts to end chronic homelessness through providing employment and housing projects, Job Corps, and the Veterans Workforce Investment Program (VWIP).|$|E
25|$|During {{the year}} more than 4,800 former combatants in Ituri District voluntarily {{disarmed}} and joined the UN demobilization process.

25|$|Although it {{does not}} operate victim shelters {{dedicated}} to trafficking, the government funds one NGO to operate a victim's shelter.

25|$|More {{problems}} {{appeared on}} 28 February 2008: The rebels demand a retraction of the ICC indictments, but the Ugandan government only {{wants to ask}} the UN to do that after the rebels have demobilised.

25|$|In Ituri, an {{area with}} interethnic {{violence}} that caused 50.000 deaths (and 500,000 displaced) since 1999, a group of 4000 militia members of the Forces armées du peuple congolais (FAPC) decided to depose arms and {{to adhere to the}} national disarmament, demobilization and <b>reintegration</b> program. The militia members who disarm have the choice between being integrated in the regular army or to join the civil life.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} that inmates who maintain contact {{with family and}} friends in the outside world {{are less likely to be}} convicted of further crimes and usually have an easier <b>reintegration</b> period back into society. Many institutions encourage friends and families to send letters, especially when they are unable to visit regularly. However, guidelines exist as to what constitutes acceptable mail, and these policies are strictly enforced.|$|E
25|$|Disarming {{can have}} {{enormous}} symbolism, {{as with the}} Independent International Commission on Decommissioning in Northern Ireland. There may well be situations where an insurgency will not hand over its arms to the government, but will accept face-saving measures such as having a third party verify that the weapons {{are no longer a}} threat. <b>Reintegration</b> may mean that people perceived as having been involved in violence still can reenter the political process.|$|E
25|$|Stalin {{suggested}} a territorial exchange with Germany, {{giving them the}} ethnic Polish-dominated areas of Lublin Province and part of Warsaw Province, and in return receiving Lithuania; Stalin had desired the <b>reintegration</b> of the three Baltic states into the Soviet Union. This was agreed in 28 September. A German–Soviet Frontier Treaty was signed shortly after, in Stalin's presence. The two nations continued trading, undermining the British blockade of Germany.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} All India Muhammadan Educational Conference {{as a part}} of the Aligarh Movement, the All-India Muslim League, was {{established}} with the support provided by Syed Ahmad Khan in 1906. It was founded in Dhaka in a response to <b>reintegration</b> of Bengal after a mass Hindu protest took place in the subcontinent. Earlier in 1905, viceroy Lord Curzon partitioned the Bengal which was favoured by the Muslims, since it gave them a Muslim majority in the eastern half.|$|E
25|$|Barnett et al. divides postconflict peacebuilding {{into three}} dimensions: {{stabilizing}} the post-conflict zone, restoring state institutions {{and dealing with}} social and economic issues. Activities within the first dimension reinforce state stability post-conflict and discourage former combatants from returning to war (disarmament, demobilization and <b>reintegration,</b> or DDR). Second dimension activities build state capacity to provide basic public goods and increase state legitimacy. Programs in the third dimension build a post-conflict society's ability to manage conflicts peacefully and promote socioeconomic development.|$|E
25|$|On 5 August, Russia, Georgia and South Ossetia {{agreed to}} hold {{negotiations}} on 7 August, with Georgian minister Temur Iakobashvili attending talks in Tskhinvali. However, Georgia still {{opposed to the}} format of the Joint Control Commission. The Georgian state minister for <b>reintegration</b> Temur Iakobashvili said that a meeting between him and Boris Chochiev was decided and chief Russian negotiator over South Ossetia, Yuri Popov, would be attending. However, later the South Ossetians denied any agreement for such meeting.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, Abkhazia {{reported}} that around 10 am of that day, it had shot down another spy plane over {{the village of}} Gagida in Gali district. Georgian television station Mze TV {{reported that}} this had been confirmed by Georgian State Minister for <b>Reintegration</b> Temur Iakobashvili, while Georgian agency InterPressNews reported that an eyewitness had seen how an unmanned aeroplane flew over the coastline {{near the village of}} Primorskoe, followed by a jet, which then shot down the unmanned plane. Still, that day the Georgian Ministry of Defence initially denied that its spy plane had been shot down, stating that it was not conducting any flights over Abkhazia, and that Abkhazian reports were misinformation. In an interview to Mze TV, State Minister for <b>Reintegration</b> Iakobashvili stated that Abkhazia did not possess the technical capability for shooting down unmanned aircraft. According to Iakobashvili there was information that an incident involving an explosion had taken place in the Gali district, and he confirmed that eyewitnesses had seen aircraft, but since Georgia could not send people to the site, it was impossible to determine what had happened. He denounced what had taken place as further attempts to stage a military provocation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} 1948-1989, {{the foreign policy}} of Czechoslovakia had {{followed}} that of the Soviet Union. Since the revolution and the subsequent mutually-agreed peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the Czechs have made <b>reintegration</b> with Western institutions their chief foreign policy objective. This goal was rapidly met with great success, as the nation joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004, and held the Presidency of the European Union {{during the first half}} of 2009.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the above, the negotiating parties also announced an agreement on security guarantees, aimed at ensuring the safety of social movements, communities, human rights groups, political parties and movements (especially the political movement to be created by the FARC in their <b>reintegration</b> to civilian life). Symbolically, this agreement includes a 'national political pact' with political parties, unions and civil society to guarantee that never again will weapons be used in pursuit of politics goals, or violent organizations promoted.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, Georgia {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} regarding the <b>reintegration</b> of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

The document says Georgia views peaceful methods as the only way for conflict solution and that there won’t be a war with these regions. It envisions engagement of people of these two regions through education as well as social, economic and business projects, instead of isolation.|$|E
25|$|The rise {{of postmodern}} architecture, with its {{interest}} {{in history and}} place, has seen the occasional <b>reintegration</b> of Gothic Revival styles. One example is Massey College at the University of Toronto. Its materials and the elements of its design are fully modern; however, the form and arrangement of those materials directly quotes from the Gothic Revival structures on campus. Another is the Windsor Arms Hotel, also in Toronto. It is a modern Gothic styled skyscraper built {{on the base of}} an older Gothic Revival structure {{from the start of the}} 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In August 2015, {{the head}} of the Darfur Regional Authority (DRA) and former head of the Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM), were {{publicly}} accused of corruption. Abu Garda said Sese had complete authority over appointing government positions at every level. In other words, Sese had stripped all authority from the DRA, as a result of which the Council of Ministers had a total of four meetings in four years. Abu Garda said that the people of Darfur should impeach Sese as president of the DRA for failure to implement a recovery and enabling corruption in the Disarmament, demobilization and <b>reintegration</b> program.|$|E
25|$|He thenceforth {{spent some}} time in {{ballistic}} studies, which led him to the invention of the modern artillery shell. In 1795 he requested of the Committee of Public Safety <b>reintegration</b> in the army, a request which the Committee ignored. His attempts to obtain a diplomatic position and to found a bank also proved unsuccessful. Eventually, Laclos met the young general and recently appointed (November 1799) First Consul, Napoleon Bonaparte, and joined his party. On 16 January 1800 he was reinstated in the Army as Brigadier General in the Army of the Rhine; he took part in the Battle of Biberach (9 May 1800).|$|E
