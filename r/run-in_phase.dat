50|$|BCG vaccine: The common, live, {{attenuated}} vaccine against tuberculosis, has substantially reduced recurrence of symptoms in multiple sclerosis patients. The frequency of new enhancing lesions as detected by Gd-enhanced MRI was reduced {{by more than}} half in 12 patients, comparing the six-month <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> to the six-month post BCG phase of the experiment. Persistence at subsequent MR scan was reduced from 18 to 1 lesion, and evolution to black holes was reduced from 28 to 6 lesions. The conventional explanation of such protection is that parasites (including bacteria) modulate the sensitivity of the immune system. BCG appears safe as a treatment for multiple sclerosis.|$|E
50|$|Participants ate one of {{the three}} {{aforementioned}} dietary patterns in 3 separate phases of the trial, including (1) Screening, (2), Run-in and (3) Intervention. In the screening phase, participants were screened for eligibility based on the combined results of blood pressure readings. In the 3 week <b>run-in</b> <b>phase,</b> each subject was given the control diet for 3 weeks, had their blood pressure measurements taken on each of five separate days, gave one 24-hour urine sample and completed a questionnaire on symptoms. At this point, subjects who were compliant with the feeding program during the screening phase were each randomly assigned to {{one of the}} three diets outlined above, to begin at the start of the 4th week. The intervention phase followed next; this was an 8-week period in which the subjects were provided the diet to which they had been randomly assigned. Blood pressures and urine samples were collected again during this time together with symptom & physical activity recall questionnaires. The first group of study subjects began the <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> of the trial in September 1994 while the fifth and final group began in January 1996. Each of the three diets contained the same 3 grams (3,000 mg) of sodium, selected because that was the approximate average intake in the nation at the time. Participants were also given two packets of salt, each containing 200 mg of sodium, for discretionary use. Alcohol was limited to no more than two beverages per day, and caffeine intake was limited to no more than three caffeinated beverages.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Studies of {{desmopressin}} {{in children}} with primary nocturnal enuresis show a greater than 90 % decrease in wet nights in 20 % to 30 %, a 50 % to less than 90 % decrease in 20 % to 40 % and less than a 50 % decrease in up to 60 %. Insufficient response to desmopressin is attributable to various factors, including differences in the primary nocturnal enuresis definition, underlying bladder dysfunction and/or desmopressin pharmacokinetic characteristics. However, {{little attention has been}} given to poor compliance with therapy as a possible explanatory factor. For a drug with an effect duration limited to the night after administration a high degree of compliance is essential to ensure consistent therapeutic effects. Materials and Methods: This was a substudy of an international investigation of treatment for 6 months or less with desmopressin tablets {{in children with}} primary nocturnal enuresis. Medication was dispensed at each visit as required and collected at each subsequent visit. Compliance was determined by pill counts by study staff. Results: Compliance data were available on 723 patients. Of the patients 81 % to 91 % ingested all medication as instructed during the initial <b>run-in</b> <b>phases.</b> However, this decreased to 77 % and 71 % during the first and second 3 -month treatment periods, respectively. Conclusions: Patient motivation and compliance are generally stronger in clinical trials than in clinical practice. However, this study shows that some patients were poorly compliant with medication even at study initiation and only 71 % were fully compliant with long-term treatment. Decreased compliance was associated with a lower response rate. Patients should be encouraged to comply fully with treatment to achieve an optimal outcome...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In a {{previous}} trial involving patients with early autosomal dominant {{polycystic kidney disease}} (ADPKD; estimated creatinine clearance, >= 60 ml per minute), the vasopressin V- 2 -receptor antagonist tolvaptan slowed the growth in total kidney volume and {{the decline in the}} estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) but also caused more elevations in aminotransferase and bilirubin levels. The efficacy and safety of tolvaptan in patients with later-stage ADPKD are unknown. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, randomized withdrawal, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. After an 8 -week prerandomization period that included sequential placebo and tolvaptan <b>run-in</b> <b>phases,</b> during which each patient's ability to take tolvaptan without dose-limiting side effects was assessed, 1370 patients with ADPKD who were either 18 to 55 years of age with an estimated GFR of 25 to 65 ml per minute per 1. 73 m(2) of body-surface area or 56 to 65 years of age with an estimated GFR of 25 to 44 ml per minute per 1. 73 m(2) were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive tolvaptan or placebo for 12 months. The primary end point was the change in the estimated GFR from baseline to follow-up, with adjustment for the exact duration that each patient participated (interpolated to 1 year). Safety assessments were conducted monthly. RESULTS: The change from baseline in the estimated GFR was - 2. 34 ml per minute per 1. 73 m(2) (95 % confidence interval [CI], - 2. 81 to - 1. 87) in the tolvaptan group, as compared with - 3. 61 ml per minute per 1. 73 m(2) (95 % CI, - 4. 08 to - 3. 14) in the placebo group (difference, 1. 27 ml per minute per 1. 73 m(2); 95 % CI, 0. 86 to 1. 68; P 3 times the upper limit of the normal range) occurred in 38 of 681 patients (5. 6 %) in the tolvaptan group and in 8 of 685 (1. 2 %) in the placebo group. Elevations in the aminotransferase level were reversible after stopping tolvaptan. No elevations in the bilirubin level of more than twice the upper limit of the normal range were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Tolvaptan resulted in a slower decline than placebo in the estimated GFR over a 1 -year period in patients with later-stage ADPKD...|$|R
40|$|Assessing current fatigue {{of athletes}} to {{fine-tune}} training prescriptions {{is a critical}} task in competitive sports. Blood-borne surrogate markers are widely used despite the scarcity of validation trials with representative subjects and interventions. Moreover, differences between training modes and disciplines (e. g. {{due to differences in}} eccentric force production or calorie turnover) have rarely been studied within a consistent design. Therefore, we investigated blood-borne fatigue markers during and after discipline-specific simulated training camps. A comprehensive panel of blood-born indicators was measured in 73 competitive athletes (28 cyclists, 22 team sports, 23 strength) at 3 time-points: after a <b>run-in</b> resting <b>phase</b> (d 1), after a 6 -day induction of fatigue (d 8) and following a subsequent 2 -day recovery period (d 11). Venous blood samples were collected between 8 and 10 a. m. Courses of blood-borne indicators are considered as fatigue dependent if a significant deviation from baseline is present at day 8 (Delta fatigue) which significantly regresses towards baseline until day 11 (Delta recovery). With cycling, a fatigue dependent course was observed for creatine kinase (CK;Delta fatigue 54 +/- 84 U/l;Delta recovery - 60 +/- 83 U/l), urea (Delta fatigue 11 +/- 9 mg/dl;. recovery - 10 +/- 10 mg/dl), free testosterone (Delta fatigue - 1. 3 +/- 2. 1 pg/ml;Delta recovery 0. 8 +/- 1. 5 pg/ml) and insulin linke growth factor 1 (IGF- 1;Delta fatigue - 56 +/- 28 ng/ml;Delta recovery 53 +/- 29 ng/ml). For urea and IGF- 1 95 % confidence intervals for days 1 and 11 did not overlap with day 8. With strength and high-intensity interval training, respectively, fatigue-dependent courses and separated 95 % confidence intervals were present for CK (strength:Delta fatigue 582 +/- 649 U/l;Delta recovery - 618 +/- 419 U/l; HIIT:Delta fatigue 863 +/- 952 U/l;Delta recovery - 741 +/- 842 U/l) only. These results indicate that, within a comprehensive panel of blood-borne markers, changes in fatigue are most accurately reflected by urea and IGF- 1 for cycling and by CK for strength training and team sport players...|$|R
50|$|Of the two {{preliminary}} Phase III studies {{investigating the}} treatment of people with MS, one showed a reduction of spasticity of 1.2 points on the 0-10 points rating scale (versus 0.6 points under placebo), the other showed a reduction of 1.0 versus 0.8 points. Only the first study reached statistical significance. The Phase III approval study consisted of a <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> where the response of individuals to the drug was determined.

50|$|The DASH-Sodium {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{following the end of}} the original DASH study to determine whether the DASH diet could produce even better results if it were low in salt and also {{to examine the effects of}} different levels of sodium in people eating the DASH diet. The researchers were interested in determining the effects of sodium reduction when combined with the DASH diet as well as the effects of the DASH diet when at three levels of sodium intake. The DASH-Sodium trial was conducted from September 1997 through November 1999. Like the previous study, it was based on a large sample (412 participants) and was a multi-center, randomized, outpatient feeding study where the subjects were given all their food. The participants were adults with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension (average systolic of 120 to 159 mm Hg & average diastolic of 80 to 95 mm Hg) and were randomly assigned to one of two diet groups. The two randomized diet groups were the DASH diet and a control diet that mirrored a “typical American diet”, and which was somewhat low in key nutrients such as potassium, magnesium and calcium. The DASH diet was the same as in the previous DASH study. After being assigned to one of these two diets, the participants were given diets that differed by 3 distinct levels of sodium content, corresponding to 3,000 mg, 2,400 mg or 1,500 mg/day (higher, intermediate or lower), in random order, for 30 consecutive days each. During the two-week <b>run-in</b> <b>phase,</b> all participants ate the high sodium control diet. The 30-day intervention phase followed, in which subjects ate their assigned diets at each of the aforementioned sodium levels (high, intermediate and low) in random order, in a crossover design. During the 30-day dietary intervention phase, each participant therefore consumed his or her assigned diet (either DASH or control) at all three sodium levels.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of improved diabetes self-management following {{participation in a}} clinical trial, with subsequent improvement of glycaemic control, has been acknowledged in literature but has received little attention. Also, the potential implications of such a 'study effect' for clinical research are poorly explored. We review the literature and describe the effects on glycaemic and psychological outcomes in long-term poorly controlled type 1 diabetes patients participating in a qualification phase of a Good Clinical Practice (GCP) trial. Improved glycaemic control following participation in a clinical trial is best understood {{as the result of}} improved patients' instrumental coping behaviours, including increased self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Such improvement in self-care with ensuing improved glycaemic control has important consequences for trial design. Firstly, benefits seen in uncontrolled trials should be interpreted with extreme caution. Secondly, unspecific study effects and the effect of a given intervention may not simply be additive. Therefore, it is wise to include a <b>run-in</b> or qualification <b>phase</b> of adequate length before randomization in a clinical trial. A stable baseline HbA(1 c) can thus be reached, upon which the specific effect of an intervention can be properly judged. Also, in a multi-centre trial, a qualification phase of sufficient length will help diminish differences in terms of intensity of care provided in participating centres.

40|$|The Euro-Balance Trial: The {{effect of}} a new {{biocompatible}} peritoneal dialysis fluid (balance) on the peritoneal membrane. Background Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a widely accepted form of renal replacement therapy (RRT), concerns remain regarding the bioincompatible nature of standard PD fluid. In order to evaluate whether a newly formulated fluid of neutral pH, and containing low levels of glucose degradation products (GDP), resulted in improved in vivo biocompatibility, it was compared in a clinical study to a standard PD fluid. Methods In a multicenter, open, randomized, prospective study with a crossover design and parallel arms, a conventional, acidic, lactate-buffered fluid (SPDF) was compared with a pH neutral, lactate-buffered, low GDP fluid (balance). Overnight effluent was collected and assayed for cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), hyaluronic acid (HA), procollagen peptide (PICP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). Serum samples were assayed for circulating advanced glycosylation end products (AGE), Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), and imidazolone. Clinical end points were residual renal function (RRF), adequacy of dialysis, ultrafiltration, and peritoneal membrane function. Eighty-six patients were randomized to either group I starting with SPDF for 12 weeks (Phase I), then switching to "balance" for 12 weeks (Phase II), or group II, which was treated vice versa. Seventy-one patients completed the study with data suitable for entry into the per protocol analysis. Effluent and serum samples, together with peritoneal function tests and adequacy measurements, were undertaken at study centers on three occasions during the study: after the four-week <b>run-in</b> period, after <b>Phase</b> I, and again after Phase II. Results In patients treated with balance there were significantly higher effluent levels of CA 125 and PICP in both arms of the study. Conversely, levels of HA were lower in patients exposed to balance, while there was {{no change in the}} levels of either VEGF or TNFalpha. Serum CML and imidazolone levels fell significantly in balance-treated patients. Renal urea and creatinine clearances were higher in both treatment arms after patients were exposed to balance. Urine volume was higher in patients exposed to balance. In contrast, peritoneal ultrafiltration was higher in patients on SPDF. When anuric patients were analyzed as a subgroup, {{there was no significant difference}} in peritoneal transport characteristics or in ultrafiltration on either fluid. There were no changes in peritonitis incidence on either solution. Conclusion This study indicates that the use of balance, a neutral pH, low GDP fluid, is accompanied by a significant improvement in effluent markers of peritoneal membrane integrity and significantly decreased circulating AGE levels. Clinical parameters suggest an improvement in residual renal function on balance, with an accompanying decrease in peritoneal ultrafiltration. It would appear that balance solution results in an improvement in local peritoneal homeostasis, as well as having a positive impact on systemic parameters, including circulating AGE and residual renal function...|$|R
40|$|Individuals with {{abdominal}} obesity are {{at higher}} risk for developing type 2 diabetes, predisposing cardiovascular events and insulin resistance. Low glycemic index (GI) diets may be beneficial {{in the management of}} insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is associated with increased intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content as measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS). The primary objective of this thesis was to determine whether a low GI diet can improve insulin sensitivity by reducing IMCL of skeletal muscle. One hundred and twenty-one male and female participants aged 30 to 70 years (mean+SD, 53 + 10)) with abdominal obesity, entered a 4 to 6 week weight-maintaining, low-fat dietary advice <b>run-in</b> <b>phase.</b> Of the 121 eligible participants, 95 completed the <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> and were randomly assigned to either a low-GI (LGID, n= 48) or high-GI diet (HGID, n= 47) for 24 weeks.

40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the pharmacodynamic effects of switching patients from ticagrelor to prasugrel. BackgroundClinicians may need to switch between more potent P 2 Y 12 inhibitors because of adverse effects or switch to the use of a once-daily dosing regimen due to compliance issues. MethodsAfter a 3 - to 5 -day <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> with a ticagrelor 180 -mg loading dose (LD) followed by a ticagrelor 90 -mg twice-daily maintenance dose (MD), aspirin-treated patients (N = 110) with stable coronary artery disease were randomized to continue ticagrelor or switch to prasugrel 10 -mg once-daily MD, with or without a 60 -mg LD. Pharmacodynamic assessments were defined according to P 2 Y 12 reaction unit (PRU) (P 2 Y 12 assay) and platelet reactivity index (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay) at baseline (before and after the <b>run-in</b> <b>phase)</b> and 2,  4, 24, and 48 h and 7 days after randomization. ResultsPlatelet reactivity was significantly greater at 24 and 48 h after switching to prasugrel versus continued therapy with ticagrelor, although to a lesser extent in those receiving an LD. Mean PRU remained significantly higher in the combined prasugrel groups versus the ticagrelor group (least-squares mean difference: 46 [95 % confidence interval 25 to 67]) and did not meet the primary noninferiority endpoint (upper limit of the confidence interval ≤ 45), although PRU in the prasugrel cohort was lower at 7 days than at 24 or 48 h. Accordingly, rates of high on-treatment platelet reactivity were higher at 24 and 48 h in both prasugrel groups. At 7 days, there was no difference in high on-treatment platelet reactivity rate between the combined prasugrel and ticagrelor groups. ConclusionsCompared with continued ticagrelor therapy, switching from ticagrelor to prasugrel therapy was associated with an increase in platelet reactivity that was partially mitigated by the administration of an LD...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To explore the possible beneficial effects and tolerability of 120 mg two times a day of Ginkgo Biloba special extract EGb 761 in patients suffering from Raynaud disease (RD) (primary Raynaud phenomenon). METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study, 41 patients with RD were randomized to either the active treatment group (EGb 761, n = 21) or placebo group for 10 weeks, after an initial 2 -week <b>run-in</b> <b>phase.</b> The primary efficacy variables were self-reported changes of the frequency, duration, and severity of vasospastic attacks between the placebo-controlled <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> {{and the end of}} the study. RESULTS: Most of the patients were female, and both groups were perfectly matched with respect to demographic characteristics. The frequency of daily attacks reduced from 3. 6 +/- 2. 3 to 2. 4 +/- 2. 6 (- 33 %) in the EGb 761 group and from 2. 9 +/- 2. 0 to 2. 0 +/- 1. 8 (- 31 %) in the placebo group with no significant difference according to the ordinary least squares test (P = 0. 3564).

We investigated {{the effects of}} moderate alcohol intake on inflammatory and haemostatic parameters in 17 healthy women (age 53 ± 5 years) with ≥ 2 vascular risk factors for CVD. Study protocol: 3 -week <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> with isoenergetic non antiinflammatory ethanol free diet (T 0 -T 21); 3 -week isoenergetic diet and white wine (20 g alcohol equivalent/die) (T 21 -T 42); 3 -weeks on the same diet {{with the addition of}} 3 portions/week of fish and nuts, low glycemic index carbohydrates, and soluble fibres (“anti-inflammatory” diet) (T 42 - T 63); 3 -weeks on the <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> diet (T 63 -T 84). At baseline {{and at the end of}} each period anthropometric index, fat mass, lipid profile, CRP, IL- 6, TNF-alpha, fibrinogen, vonWillebrand factor (vWf:Ag), tissue factor (TF:Ag), factor VII (FVII:Ag and c), factor VIII (FVIII:Ag) and thrombin generation parameters in plasma were measured. Results: Over the study period BMI, fat mass, triglycerides, LDL and HDL-cholesterol did not significantly change compared to baseline levels, whereas a reduction in total cholesterol levels was observed (p< 0. 05). Among inflammatory parameters, only IL- 6 levels showed a reduction (p= 0. 09), non statistically significant. Alcohol intake, on the other hand, was associated with TF:Ag (p< 0. 05) and FVII:Ag (p< 0. 05) reduction. These results were paralleled by an increase of thrombin generation Lag Time (p< 0. 002) and ttPeak (p< 0. 02).

Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have improved anemia management and two agents are available in Canada, epoetin alfa (Eprex®) and darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®). Darbepoetin requires less frequent administration due to a longer half-life. Epoetin and darbepoetin {{are considered to be}} equally effective in achieving target hemoglobin in dialysis patients {{but it is not clear}} if there is a cost difference. There have been few head-to-head comparisons of the two ESAs; most published data is from observational switch studies. [...] An open label randomized controlled trial of intravenous darbepoetin alfa versus epoetin alfa was conducted in hemodialysis patients. Fifty patients were enrolled in the study. A dose stabilization <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> was followed by a 12 month active phase. ESAs and iron were dosed using a study algorithm to maintain hemoglobin within 100 - 120 g/L. The primary outcome was the cost per patient of ESA over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included deviation from target ranges in anemia indices, iron dose and cost, time and number of dose changes required for dose stabilization, number of dose changes in the active phase and the dose conversion ratio. [...] The median cost for epoetin over 12 months was $ 4179 (IQR $ 2416 - 5955) and for darbepoetin was $ 2303 (IQR $ 1178 - 4219) with a difference of $ 1876 (p= 0. 017). There was no significant difference in the dose or cost of iron. The median weekly iron dose was 40. 4 mg for epoetin and 41. 7 mg for darbepoetin (p= 0. 992). There were no significant differences in the anemia care targets including hemoglobin: 108. 0 g/L epoetin and 109. 8 g/L darbepoetin (p= 0. 336); serum ferritin: 848 μg/L epoetin and 726 μg/L darbepoetin (p= 0. 202); TSAT: 26. 7 % epoetin and 28. 6 % darbepoetin (p= 0. 472). [...] The number of dose changes and the time required to attain hemoglobin stability in the <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> and the number of dose changes in the active phase were similar for both groups.

METHOD: The baseline placebo <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> (BL) was part of a RCT investigating sibutramine hydrochloride for BED; it included 451 participants, ages 19 - 63, diagnosed with BED. Follow-up (FU) included 33 PRs. RESULTS: : In this study, 32. 6 % of participants responded to placebo (PRs = 147; NRs = 304). PRs exhibited significantly less symptom severity. At FU (n = 33), many PRs reported continued symptoms. CONCLUSION: PRs exhibited significantly less severe pathology than NRs. Placebo {{response in}} BED may transitory or incomplete. The {{results of this study suggest}} variable stability in the BED diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patients {{with heart}} failure and reduced {{ejection}} fraction have impaired health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQL) with variable responses to therapies that target mortality and heart failure hospitalizations. In PARADIGM-HF trial (Prospective Comparison of ARNI [Angiotensin Receptor–Neprilysin Inhibitor] With ACEI [Angiotensin-Converting–Enzyme Inhibitor] to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure), sacubitril/valsartan reduced morbidity and mortality compared with enalapril. Another major treatment goal is to improve HRQL. Given improvements in mortality with sacubitril/valsartan, this analysis provides comprehensive assessment of impact of therapy on HRQL in survivors only. Methods and Results: Patients (after <b>run-in</b> <b>phase)</b> completed disease-specific HRQL using Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) at randomization, 4 month, 8 month, and annual visits. Changes in KCCQ scores were calculated using repeated measures analysis of covariance model that adjusted for treatment and baseline values (principal efficacy prespecified at 8 months).

40|$|A novel {{recombinant}} interferon-alpha B/D hybrid {{was applied}} to assess tolerability, antiviral effect, and biological activity in chronic hepatitis B. The study was designed as an open nonrandomized trial. Treatment comprised a two-week <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> with 16 MU {{three times a week}} followed by 14 weeks with 64 MU three times a week (or 48 MU if toxicity occurred with 64 MU). Total follow-up was 36 weeks. Nineteen patients were included; three discontinued treatment during the run-in with 16 MU. Fourteen of 16 patients had 14 weeks of treatment with {{greater than or equal to}} 32 MU three times a week. Fourteen dose reductions were necessary in nine patients. The adverse experience profile was similar to other interferon-alpha s. HBV-DNA decreased using all doses studied. HBV-DNA became undetectable in five patients, two of whom had HBeAg seroconversion. No HBsAg seroconversion was observed. It is concluded that interferon-alpha BID is well tolerated in high doses. The anti-viral effect starts at at least 16 MU three times a week...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{conducted}} a single-centre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II clinical study to test {{safety and efficacy}} of a 12 -week therapy with low-dose (700 mg/daily) or high-dose (2800 mg/daily) of NAC. Methods: Twenty-one patients (∆F 508 homo/hetero-zygous, FEV 1 > 40 % pred.) {{were included in the}} study. After a 3 -weeks placebo <b>run-in</b> <b>phase,</b> 11 pa-tients received low-dose NAC, and 10 patients re-ceived high-dose NAC. Outcomes included safety and clinical parameters, inflammatory (total leukocyte numbers, cell differentials, TNF-α, IL- 8) measures in induced sputum, and concentrations of extracellular glutathione in induced sputum and blood. Results: High-dose NAC was a well-tolerated and safe medication. High-dose NAC did not alter clinical or inflammatory parameters. However, extracellular glu-tathione in induced sputum tended to increase on high-dose NAC. Conclusions: High-dose NAC is a well-tolerated and safe medication for a prolonged therapy of patients with CF with a potential to increase extracellular glu-tathione in CF airways...|$|E
40|$|Overnight {{hypoglycemia}} occurs {{frequently in}} individuals with {{type 1 diabetes}} and can result in loss of consciousness, seizure, or even death. We conducted an in-home randomized trial to determine whether nocturnal hypoglycemia could be safely re-duced by temporarily suspending pump insulin delivery when hypoglycemia was predicted by an algorithm based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) glucose levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Following an initial <b>run-in</b> <b>phase,</b> a 42 -night trial was conducted in 45 individuals aged 15 – 45 years with type 1 diabetes in which each night was assigned randomly to either having the predictive low-glucose suspend system active (intervention night) or inactive (control night).

40|$|Background: Informed consent is the {{foundation}} of the ethical conduct of health research. Obtaining informed consent may unwittingly interfere with the data collected in research studies, particularly if they concern sensitive behaviours that participants are requested to report on. To address gaps in evidence on such research participation effects, we conducted a methodological experiment evaluating the impact of the informed consent procedure on participants’ reporting behaviour, specifically on their self-report of drinking behaviour as measured by Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). Methods: A two arm double blinded randomised controlled trial was used. University students present in London student unions at the time of recruitment were contacted in two phases (an initial <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> followed by the main phase). Those providing positive responses to verbal questions: 1) “are you a student?”; 2) “do you drink alcohol?”; 3) “would you like {{to take part in a}} brief health survey, which will take around 5 minutes?” were recruited. Participants received one of the two envelopes by chance, with the sequence generated by an online random sequence generator. One contained the participant information sheet, informed consent form and the AUDIT questionnaire (the intervention group), while the other contained only the AUDIT questionnaire (the comparator group). The primary outcome was the mean AUDIT score, which ranges from 0 to 40. The secondary outcome was the proportion of participants in each group scoring 8 or more on the AUDIT, the threshold score for hazardous and harmful drinking warranting intervention. Results: A total of 380 participants were successfully recruited, resulting in 190 participants in each group, of which 378 were included in the final analysis. There is no evidence of any statistically significant difference between groups in the primary outcome. A statistically significant difference in the secondary outcome was found in the <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> only, and not in the main phase, or overall. Moreover, between-group outcome differences between the two phases suggest an important influence of setting on reporting behaviour. Conclusions: There is no strong evidence that completion of informed consent itself alters self-reporting behaviour with regards to alcohol, though the effect of settings needs to be further studied...|$|E
40|$|Background: The mySentry system (Medtronic Inc.) is {{the first}} to amplify and relay {{continuous}} glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pump data to a remote site within the house. Its usability and acceptability were evaluated in families having a child with type 1 diabetes. Methods: Each enrolled family included a child (age 7 – 17 years) who used a Paradigm REAL-Time Revel sensor-augmented insulin pump (Medtronic). After a 1 -week <b>run-in</b> <b>phase,</b> families set up and used the mySentry system for a 3 -week study phase. Opinion surveys were completed by parents, and pump and CGM data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. No formal hypothesis testing was performed, and the study was not powered to detect changes in nocturnal glycemia. Results: Thirty-five families completed the study. Enrolled children (61. 1 % female) had a mean (± standard deviation) age of 11. 9 ± 2. 70 years and a mean age at initiation of pump therapy of 7. 1 ± 3. 19 years.

MethodsThis was a randomized, placebo-controlled PERT withdrawal study evaluating the efficacy and safety of PANCREAZE® (pancrelipase) in CF patients with EPI. Participants (n= 49) entered an open-label, ≤ 14 day <b>run-in</b> <b>phase,</b> maintained a high-fat diet (100 ± 15 g/day), and received PANCREAZE® (10. 5 or 21). Participants with a coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) ≥ 80 % (n= 40) were then randomized (1 : 1) to receive either PANCREAZE® or placebo during a double-blind, ≤ 7 day withdrawal phase. ResultsPANCREAZE® improved fat absorption as shown by significantly lower mean±SD change in CFA between open-label and double-blind phases for PANCREAZE® (− 1. 5 ± 5. 88 %; p< 0. 001) compared to placebo (− 34. 1 ± 23. 03 %). Protein absorption was similarly improved. No unexpected adverse events were reported.

40|$|According to {{anti-inflammatory}} and anti-nociceptive {{effects of}} Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort), {{the aim of}} this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Hypericum perforatum extract on the management of Recurrent Aphthous Ulcers (RAU). Thirty patients with RAU participated in a randomly, placebo controlled double blind trial during three episodes of RAU to evaluate the efficacy of the topical hypericum containing mouthwash (0. 5 %). After a no-treatment <b>run-in</b> <b>phase,</b> patients were asked to use placebo mouthwash or hypericum mouthwash randomly. The diameters of ulcer and inflammatory halo (with 0. 1 mm precision) and ulcer duration (day) were recorded and associated pain (Visual Analog Scale) were recorded by patients during each episode. Hypericum mouthwash resulted in a significant reduction of pain of RAU (p< 0. 05). Healing time was reduced in hypericum mouthwash group in comparison to other episodes (p = 0. 052). Other indices did not show any significant differences. Hypericum perforatum extract in form of mouthwash (0. 5 %), may be of benefit in reduction of pain of RAU and has relative effect on reduction of healing time...|$|E
40|$|Background: Treatment of end stage {{renal disease}} {{patients}} with short daily hemodialysis {{has been associated}} with an improvement in blood pressure. It is unclear from these studies if anti-hypertensive management had been optimized prior to starting short daily hemodialysis. Also, the potential mechanism(s) of blood pressure improvement remain to be fully elucidated. Study Design, Setting and Participants: We undertook a randomized cross-over trial in adult hypertensive patients with ESRD treated with conventional hemodialysis to determine: 1) if short-daily hemodialysis is associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure after a 3 -month blood pressure optimization period and; 2) the potential mechanism(s) of blood pressure reduction. Blood pressure was measured using Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines. Extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) was assessed with bioimpedance. Serum catecholamines were used to assess the sympathetic nervous system. Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (T-BARS) were used as markers of inflammation and oxidative stress respectively. Results: After a 3 -month <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> in which systolic blood pressure improved, {{there was no significant difference}} in pre-dialysis systolic pressure between short-daily and conventional hemodialysis (p = 0. 39).

40|$|Cisapride is a {{substituted}} benzamide with gastrointestinal prokinetic effects {{presumed to}} be due to the enhancement of the physiological release of acetylcholine at the myenteric plexus. In a multicentre study, 189 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD) received single-blind placebo treatment for two weeks. A total of 123 patients with no or minimal response to placebo and epigastric pain of at least moderate severity and frequency were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three parallel double-blind treatments for six weeks: cisapride 10 mg tid, cisapride 20 mg tid or placebo. The severity and frequency of individual symptoms (epigastric pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, postprandial discomfort, regurgitation, lower abdominal pain, bloating and constipation) were assessed on a four- and five-point categorical scale, respectively, by the investigator at three on-treatment visits and by patients in a daily diary. Analysis of investigator and patient assessments for differences in symptom severity x frequency composite scores among the three treatment groups showed no statistically significant differences for individual symptoms or symptom clusters. As assessed by the investigator, and compared with baseline, cisapride 20 mg tid significantly (P< 0. 05) improved epigastric pain, bloating and early satiety as well as improved the total symptom cluster. Investigator evaluation of the five most severe and frequent symptoms for each patient showed statistically significant improvement in each treatment group. For patient diary assessments, statistically significant within-treatment improvement of the total symptom cluster, the five most severe symptoms cluster, bloating and early satiety was observed for both cisapride 20 mg and placebo, whereas epigastric pain significantly (P< 0. 05) improved in all three treatment groups. Investigator evaluation of global response (good + excellent) rate at the end of the six-week treatment period was 38 % for cisapride 20 mg, 47 % for cisapride 10 mg and 33 % for placebo. No statistically significant difference in this parameter among treatments was noted. Cisapride was well tolerated at both doses with a side effect profile comparable with that of placebo. It is concluded that, in this double-blind multicentre study with a single-blind two-week placebo <b>run-in</b> <b>phase,</b> cisapride 10 mg tid and 20 mg tid were not effective compared with placebo in improving symptoms in NUD patients. This study re-emphasizes the good prognosis of patients with NUD, with 14 % of patients improving in the two-week placebo <b>run-in</b> <b>phase</b> and a further 33 % improving in the next six weeks while on placebo. Within-treatment analysis of investigator assessments showed improvement for cisapride 20 mg tid suggesting a trend for efficacy at this dose...|$|E
30|$|Of note is {{the marked}} {{inequality}} {{between the groups}} of TD buprenorphine and placebo in a completely enriched study (Sorge and Sittl 2004). For instance, patients {{in the placebo group}} had a better starting condition and <b>run-in</b> <b>phase.</b> Also, more patients in the placebo group had received radiotherapy shortly before the onset of the study, contributing to their better pain status. Buprenorphine, when delivered via the TD route passively diffused into the systemic circulation (Bohme and Likar 2003; Sorge and Sittl 2004), providing a slower increase in serum concentration and no peak-and-trough effects as seen with the SL route (Yaksh and Wallace 2011; Al-Tawil et al. 2013). This is the reason why in many cases SL buprenorphine is used as rescue analgesic. As a matter of fact, TD buprenorphine is non-invasive and a suitable choice for cancer pain relief even in the presence of renal disease. It also has a beneficial ceiling effect for respiratory depression. A recent pharmacokinetic study has reported that the systemic exposure to TD buprenorphine was sufficiently similar between elderly (> 75  years) and younger (50 – 60  years) participants (Fudala et al. 2003). However, due to the heterogeneity of the published data and small sample sizes, the current meta-analysis has thus some limitations to provide sufficient evidence.|$|E
