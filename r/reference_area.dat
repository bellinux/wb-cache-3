40|$|White-tailed deer were extirpated from Indiana in {{the late}} 1800 s, but populations across the state rebounded {{in the late}} 20 th century {{following}} successful reintroduction in the 1930 s and 1940 s. Populations in state parks grew large and were not reduced by hunting as occurred on other properties throughout Indiana beginning in the 1950 s. Excessive deer browse was severely affecting herbaceous plant cover and woody stem density by the early 1990 s. Controlled hunts were initiated in the state parks in the 1990 s to reduce the impact that deer were having on vegetation communities. In 1996 / 1997 a {{study was conducted to}} quantify the impact of deer browsing on the plant communities of state parks. I resampled these plots in 2010 to determine the degree of recovery since 1996 / 1997. Fifteen state parks and five <b>reference</b> <b>areas</b> that have always been hunted were sampled in this study. Percent cover and species composition were measured in the herbaceous layer (3 ̆c 50 cm tall) and woody stem density and composition were measured for three height classes of woody vegetation (3 ̆c 50 cm, 50 - 200 cm, and 3 ̆e 200 cm). Herbaceous percent cover, S, and H’ significantly increased over time in the state parks and exceeded the changes observed in the <b>reference</b> <b>areas.</b> NMS ordinations revealed that state park herbaceous layer composition was generally becoming increasingly similar to <b>reference</b> <b>areas</b> and that current composition was related to either long-term or short-term deer reductions. There was {{a significant increase in the}} woody stem densities of the 50 - 200 cm height class in state parks and <b>reference</b> <b>areas,</b> but the increase in state parks was much greater. Woody vegetation S, E, and H’ increased significantly in state parks, but not the <b>reference</b> <b>areas.</b> Also, the densities of more palatable species significantly increased in state parks in the lower height classes. Increases in state park herbaceous percent cover, woody stem density in the 50 - 200 cm height class, and S, E, and H’ in both relative to <b>reference</b> <b>areas</b> suggest that deer reductions are responsible for these changes and should therefore be continued in order to maintain these conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{project was}} {{initiated}} in 1998 {{to investigate the}} effect of varying topsoil depths on soil parameters, plant cover, production and diversity on a coal mine in northeastern Wyoming. Soil and vegetation information was collected for three consecutive growing seasons (2000 through 2002) on reclaimed areas with three topsoil treatment depths (15, 30 and 56 cm) and from two native <b>reference</b> <b>areas</b> (Upland Grass and Breaks Grass) at the mine. For the vegetation analysis, total vegetation cover, total cover, average number of species and total number of species were the primary parameters. Vegetation production was measured in 2002 only. Analyzed soil parameters included pH, electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratio at 15 cm intervals throughout the treatment depth and the immediate underlying spoil material. Although three years of data has been collected for this project, the primary emphasis of this paper will be 2002. No significant differences in vegetation and soils were noted by treatment in the 2000 through 2002 data. Location effects, however, were numerous, which emphasizes the difficulty in utilizing native <b>reference</b> <b>areas</b> as standards for reclamation success on reclaimed areas. All vegetative parameters were generally higher in <b>reference</b> <b>areas</b> {{with the exception of}} production. Diversity indices on the reclaimed and <b>reference</b> <b>areas</b> were also evaluated. The Shannon-Wiener indices were significantly different by location throughout 2000 to 2002 and by treatment in 2001, i. e., the 30 cm treatment was significantly higher in diversity than the 56 cm treatment. Previous research has indicated diversity differences in topsoil depth treatment levels increase over time. For this project, differences in topsoil depth treatments will likely increase over time and/or with more typical precipitation patterns...|$|R

In addition to a standard boxcorer for common macrofauna, a Triple-D dredge was used to collect longer-lived, more sparsely distributed infauna and epifauna. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any difference between the assemblages in and outside OWEZ with respect to abundance, biomass, and production after a 5 -year closure. The Shannon–Wiener diversity index pointed to a significantly higher diversity in OWEZ compared with some of the <b>reference</b> <b>areas.</b> A minority of the bivalve species assumed to be sensitive to trawling showed higher abundances (Spisula solida) or larger sizes (Tellina fabula, Ensis directus) in OWEZ than in some of the <b>reference</b> <b>areas.</b> In general, samples collected with the Triple-D showed more differences between areas than boxcore samples. No evidence was also found that the species composition in OWEZ relative to the <b>reference</b> <b>areas</b> had changed in the period between 1 (2007) and 5 (2011) years after closure. The change observed in all areas between 2007 and 2011 was mainly due to relatively small variations in species abundances. In conclusion, 5 years after the closure of OWEZ to fisheries, only subtle changes were measured in the local benthic community, i. e. a higher species diversity and an increased abundance and lengths of some bivalves. Depleted adult stocks, faunal patchiness, and a limited time for recovery (5 years) might explain that a significant recovery could not be found. The current study shows that designation of large-scale marine protected areas as planned for the North Sea will not automatically imply that restoration of benthic assemblages can be expected within {{a relatively short period of}} years...|$|R
