50|$|The oranges then {{go through}} <b>roller</b> <b>conveyors,</b> which expose {{all sides of}} the fruit. The <b>roller</b> <b>conveyors</b> are {{efficiently}} built as they are well lighted, installed at a convenient height, and width to ensure all inspectors can reach the fruit to determine inadequacies. Some reasons why fruit may be rejected include indication of mold, rot, and ruptured peels. Afterwards, the oranges are separated based on size through machines prior to juice extraction. There are a number of different ways orange juice industry leaders extract their oranges. Some common methods include halving the fruit and pressing/ reaming the orange to extract juice from the orange. One instrument inserts a tube through the orange peel and forces the juice out through the tube by squeezing the entire orange. Despite the variety of machines used to extract juices, all machines have commonalities in that they are rugged, fast, easy to clean, and have the ability to reduce peel extractives into the juice. The extracted juice product does not contain the orange peel, but it may contain pulp and seeds, which are removed by finishers.|$|E
5000|$|Tunnels are {{available}} {{with or without a}} conveyor system. Some are built into a production line or are integral with machinery that also applies the shrink film. Others are movable by hand or by castors. A shrink tunnel, referred to as an oven, may be equipped with an integrated conveyor of two different kinds: the roller conveyor or the belt conveyor. <b>Roller</b> <b>conveyors</b> can be used with polyolefin, PVC, and shrink polyethylene films. The space in between the rollers is filled with hot air {{from the bottom of the}} tunnel to shrink the film layer around the object, creating a sealed package. When used with polyolefin and PVC based films the rollers are called [...] "live" [...] or spinning. When used with polyethylene films the rollers are called [...] "dead" [...] or not spinning. The tunnels with Teflon mesh belts and polymer mesh belts are used for smaller packages, or when the package may have an instability and need a stable platform.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- <b>Roller</b> <b>conveyors</b> are {{conventionally}} used to convey/transport cartons, FMCG goods. The conventional {{roller conveyor}} was either toothed belt driven or PU cord driven. The roller and the conventional belt conveyors have a speed limiting value of 45 metres/minute. In {{the current day}} industrial scenario, looking at the increasing demands of the end customer, the speed limit of 45 metres/minute had to be overcome and increased to a higher level. For this purpose a narrow belt driven live roller conveyor {{has been designed to}} deliver goods at a speed of 90 - 110 metres per minute. In this drive mechanism, a narrow belt is running continuously below the rollers, tangentially driving them. A special 3 layered belt with acrylonitrile- butadienerubber as the rough surface {{on both sides of the}} belt and polyester (PET) fabric as the traction layer material is used. Special crowned nylon material plastic pulleys have been injection moulded for self-tracking and to guide the belt throughout the 5 metre long conveyor. Several experiments like: load test, slippage test, pull test, current overloading test, temperature test, lower speeds test have been performed to study the behaviour of the belt under various conditions. On the basis of the experimental results, further modifications have been done in the conveyor design. The final results show that this conveyor can convey 35 kgs of unit load per metre at a speed of 90 - 110 metres per minute within a permissible slippage range of 1 - 1. 5 %. The higher the load, the higher the slippage is and lesser is the belt life. The system was also kept under simulation run for continuous 6 month...|$|E

50|$|Vayeron is an Australian based {{company that}} has {{developed}} a hardware sensor device {{which is designed to}} be embedded within the <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> itself. The Smart-Idler™ is an automated <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> condition monitoring & prognostics technology that is embedded within <b>conveyor</b> <b>rollers</b> when they are manufactured. The device monitors bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell-wear to predict <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> failure. This ultimately makes <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> condition monitoring more efficient and reduces operational downtime. The Smart-Idler™ sensor operates without batteries, taking its power directly from the rotation of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller,</b> using a dynamo style energy harvesting method as it turns whilst in operation within the conveyor. Companies that make <b>conveyor</b> <b>rollers</b> can integrate the Smart-Idler™ within their <b>conveyor</b> <b>roller</b> products to create an enhanced roller offering for their clients - the owners and operators of conveyor systems. The embedded sensors have a multi-modal monitoring capability. Parameters such as bearing temperature, vibration, acoustics and roller shell wear are monitored and analysed to determine roller condition deterioration and flag impending failure.|$|R
