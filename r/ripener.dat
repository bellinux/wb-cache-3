O ensaio foi instalado em março de 2004 e conduzido na APTA Regional Centro-Oeste, Jaú (SP). O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o de blocos casualizados, em parcelas sub-divididas, com quatro repetições, constituído pela combinação dos genótipos IAC 87 - 3396, IAC 87 - 3410, IAC 89 - 3124, IAC 91 - 2195, IAC 91 - 5155, PO 88 - 62 e SP 80 - 1842, e de três manejos de condução da maturação sulfometuron metil, 20 g p. c. ha- 1; etefon, 2, 0 l p. c. ha- 1 e testemunha. A qualidade tecnológica foi determinada através dos atributos Brix no caldo, pol no caldo, pureza do caldo, fibra da cana, pol na cana, açúcares redutores no caldo, açúcares redutores na cana e açúcar total recuperável (ATR) aos 0, 21, 42, 63, 84, 105 e 126 dias após a aplicação (DAA), além dos atributos florescimento, isoporização, produtividade de colmos e de açúcar aos 126 DAA. Observou-se que, para a maioria dos genótipos, o emprego dos maturadores antecipou a colheita em 21 dias em relação à testemunha, sendo o etefon indicado para colheita entre 42 e 84 DAA, e o sulfometuron metil para o período entre 105 e 126 DAA. O IAC 91 - 5155 não respondeu aos maturadores, o PO 88 - 62 apresentou melhor resposta ao sulfometuron metil, e os demais genótipos ao uso de etefon, quanto à qualidade tecnológica. Os dois produtos, etefon e sulfometuron metil, controlaram o florescimento. Os genótipos IAC 91 - 5155 e PO 88 - 62, apesar de não florescidos, apresentaram isoporização. Para a maioria dos genótipos a aplicação dos maturadores não afetou a produtividade de colmos, exceto para o sulfometuron metil que reduziu a do genótipo SP 80 - 1842, e para etefon que aumentou a do IAC 91 - 2195. O sulfometuron metil e o etefon aumentaram a produtividade de açúcar do genótipo IAC 89 - 3124. O IAC 91 - 2195 apresentou produtividade de açúcar maior com a aplicação de etefon. A produtividade de açúcar foi menor no SP 80 - 1842 com o emprego de sulfometuron metil. Use {{of plant}} growth regulators as sugarcane <b>ripeners</b> {{has been a}} practice well used, {{because of the need}} of early harvest and the agricultural planning optimization of the crop. However, with the frequent release of genotypes by breeding programs, little information is available about of the interactions among new genotypes and products over the technological quality. This study aimed to determine the response of seven sugarcane genotypes to the application of two <b>ripeners</b> in the raw material quality. The experiment was installed in march 2004 and carried out in the APTA Regional Center West, Jaú (SP). The experimental design was the randomized complete blocks, in split-plot, with four repetitions, constituted by the genotypes IAC 87 - 3396, IAC 87 - 3410, IAC 89 - 3124, IAC 91 - 2195, IAC 91 - 5155, PO 88 - 62 and SP 80 - 1842, and by three ripening manegement sulfometuron methyl, 20 g p. c. ha- 1; ethephon, 2, 0 l p. c. ha- 1 and control. The technological attributes evaluated were Brix in the juice, pol in the juice, purity of the juice, fiber of the cane, juice reducing sugars, stalks reducing sugars and recoverable total sugars (ATR) to 0, 21, 42, 63, 84, 105 and 126 days after the application (DAA) besides flowering, pith, productivity of stalks and sugar attributes to 126 DAA. It was observed that for the most of the genotypes the use of <b>ripeners</b> antecipated the harvest in 21 days in relation to control, being ethephon recomendable for harvest between 42 and 84 DAA, and sulfometuron methyl for the period between 105 and 126 DAA. The genotype IAC 91 - 5155 didn't answer to the <b>ripeners,</b> PO 88 - 62 presented better answer to sulfometuron methyl and the others genotypes to ethephon to technological quality. Both products, ethephon and sulfomethuron methyl, controlled the flowering. The genotypes IAC 91 - 5155 and PO 88 - 62, in spite of no flowering, presented pith. For most of the genotypes the application of the <b>ripeners</b> didn't affect the productivity of stalks, except to sulfomethuron methyl that reduced it in SP 80 - 1842, and to ethephon that increased it in IAC 91 - 2195. Sulfomethuron methyl and ethephon increased the productivity of sugar of the genotype IAC 89 - 3124. IAC 91 - 2195 presented bigger sugar productivity with ethephon application. The productivity of sugar was smaller in SP 80 - 1842 with sulfomethuron methyl use...|$|R
60|$|By the twenty-fifth of September, the Red Maples {{generally}} {{are beginning to}} be ripe. Some large ones have been conspicuously changing for a week, and some single trees are now very brilliant. I notice a small one, half a mile off across a meadow, against the green wood-side there, a far brighter red than the blossoms of any tree in summer, and more conspicuous. I have observed this tree for several autumns invariably changing earlier than its fellows, just as one tree ripens its fruit earlier than another. It might serve to mark the season, perhaps. I should be sorry, if it were cut down. I know {{of two or three}} such trees in different parts of our town, which might, perhaps, be propagated from, as early <b>ripeners</b> or September trees, and their seed be advertised in the market, {{as well as that of}} radishes, if we cared as much about them.|$|R
40|$|Na aplicação aérea de maturadores de cana-de-açúcar, a pulverização deve atingir o seu alvo sem que ocorra deriva, evitando a contaminação de culturas circunvizinhas. Objetivou-se com a pesquisa avaliar o efeito de subdoses de maturadores de cana-de-açúcar na cultura do milho quando aplicadas em estádios de desenvolvimento V 4 e V 8. Foram instalados três ensaios na Fazenda da Universidade Federal de Goiás, UFG, Regional Jataí. Cada parcela continha 10 linhas do híbrido de milho SYN 7 G 17. Cada ensaio foi constituído de oito tratamentos estabelecidos em delineamento com blocos casualizados em esquema fatorial 2 x 4 mais um tratamento controle (sem aplicação de maturador), com quatro repetições. O primeiro fator corresponde a aplicação nos estádios V 4 e V 8 da cultura do milho e o segundo fator às subdoses de 3; 6; 9 e 12 % de 475, 2 g i. a. ha- 1 de {{ethephon}} (Ensaio I), 216, 0 g e. a. ha- 1 de glyphosate (Ensaio II) e 15, 0 g i. a. ha- 1 de sulfometuron methyl (Ensaio III). Aos 20 e aos 36 dias após a semeadura, quando as plantas de milho se encontravam em V 4 e V 8, respectivamente, foram realizadas as aplicações dos maturadores. Os efeitos de fitotoxicidade foram perceptíveis em ambos os estádios aos 7, 14, 21, 28 e 42 dias após a aplicação apenas para o Ensaio III. Para glyphosate, o comprimento e diâmetro de espigas foram afetados para ambos os estádios. A cultura do milho é sensível a subdoses a partir de 0, 45 g i. a. ha- 1 de sulfometuron methyl em estádios de desenvolvimento V 4 e V 8. A produtividade de grãos foi menor apenas para as plantas submetidas às subdoses de sulfometuron methyl, com menos efeito quando a deriva ocorre no estádio de desenvolvimento V 8 em comparação ao estádio V 4. In {{the field}} aerial application of sugarcane <b>ripeners,</b> spraying should reach its target without drifting occurs, avoiding contamination of surrounding crops. The {{aim of this}} research was to evaluate the effects of sugarcane <b>ripeners</b> simulated drift using sublethal rates in maize when applied to V 4 and V 8 stages of development. For this purpose were installed two trials on the Federal University of Goiás, Regional Jataí. Each plot contained 10 rows of SYN 7 G 17 maize hybrid. Each trial consisted of eight treatments established in design with randomized blocks where the treatments were arranged at factorial design of 2 x 4, plus one control treatment, with four replications. First factor corresponds to spraying at the V 4 and V 8 stages of maize and the second factor to sublethal rates of 3; 6; 9 to 12 % of 475. 2 g a. i. ha- 1 ethephon (Trial I), 216. 0 g a. e. ha- 1 glyphosate (Trial II) and 15. 0 g a. i. ha- 1 sulfometuron methyl (Trial III). At 20 and 36 days after sowing, when the maize were in V 4 and V 8, respectively, applications of <b>ripeners</b> were performed. The phytotoxicity effects were noticeable in both stages at 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days after spraying only for Trial III. For glyphosate, the length and diameter of ear were reduced in size to both stages. Maize is sensitive to sublethal rates starting from 0. 45 g a. i. ha- 1 sulfometuron methyl in V 4 and V 8 stages of development. The lower grain yield was only to plants subjected to sublethal doses of sulfometuron methyl, being lower yield when drift occurs in the V 8 stage of development compared to the V 4 stage...|$|R
