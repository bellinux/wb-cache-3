40|$|AbstractRecent {{analyses}} {{on energy}} scenarios for countries with high contribution of intermittent <b>renewables</b> <b>point</b> out that electricity generation from {{solar and wind}} energy may exceed the overall electricity demand during {{a large number of}} hours per year (that include peak periods). Thus, large-scale electrical –energy storage systems are required for grid balancing. Hydrogen production through solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) stands for promising power storage systems due to its high capacity and wide variety of applications. SOEC operates with steam in the range of 600 - 1000 °C, which, in this work, is supplied by a concentrating solar system. Based on its simplicity and low cost of the components, a linear Fresnel reflector coupled with castable ceramic thermal energy storage system was selected. Thermal oil was retained as heat transfer fluid avoiding phase change through the solar receiver. The heat is stored during the day for later use by the SOECs. The proposed hybrid plant, located in Seville, Spain, is analyzed under two scenarios. In the first one, the Solid-Oxide unit is only used as steam electrolyser producing hydrogen that is directly sell to a hydrogen bus refueling station. In the second case, the device operates either as electrolyser or fuel cell, generating hydrogen that is stored and later used to produce electricity during peak periods. The capacity of the plant operating under both scenarios has been evaluated {{as a function of the}} storage capacity...|$|R

40|$|As {{recently}} as the year 2010, renewable energy contributed less than 1 % of all the energy sources in South Africa. Possible reasons include the lack of private sector investment in Renewable Energy technologies. By way of a structured interview methodology, this paper explores the reasons why private investors are reluctant to invest in <b>renewables.</b> The responses <b>point</b> to political, economic, social and technological barriers limiting private investment in renewable energy. Other barriers that were identified include poverty, low levels of education, limited technological readiness {{and access to the}} electricity grid. Some of these barriers are specific to the South African context.

40|$|Abstract—Being one of {{the most}} {{important}} elements of social evolution, energy has a vital role for a sustainable economy and development. Energy has great importance to level up the welfare. While energy needs are increasing, sources to respond these needs are very limited. So countries seek for alternative resources to meet their energy needs. In this <b>point</b> <b>renewable</b> energy sources have firstly taken into consideration. Being clean and belonging to countries own sources, renewable energy resources have been widely applied during the last decades. But can renewable energy meet all the expectations of energy needs? This is {{one of the}} biggest question to be answered on the energy field. In this article energy resources, SWOT analysis of renewable sources and the future of renewable energy has been mainly discussed in order to describe future of energy...|$|R
3000|$|Another {{point of}} {{interest}} is the dynamics of option values. The downward slope of the curves indicates that option values decrease with prices of coal. The point where option value curve meets the straight line {{is the point of}} indifference. This point indicates the price of coal where an investor is indifferent between a decision to opt for coal or <b>renewables.</b> After such <b>point,</b> an investor has no better option but to switch technologies to renewables to avoid welfare loses. The vertical distance between the option curve at the terminal period (broken curve) and initial period (bold curve) represents the benefit of the option to wait which is equal to (V_T([...] P_C,t) - V_ 0 ([...] P_C,t). It can be observed that as coal price increases from zero, the value of option to wait increases, then decreases, and finally equals zero. This only confirms that the option value and value of option to wait are not necessarily proportional with changes in coal price under the conditions set in the real options model.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWind {{energy is}} {{commonly}} thought {{as part of}} <b>renewable</b> energies. “Renewable” <b>points</b> {{to the idea that}} wind, being a flow-energy, is not exhaustible. In economic terms, it is thought as non-rival: harnessing the energy of the wind does not deprive others from the possibility of doing so. A corollary to this view is the pregnant and reifying idea that wind speed defines the potential for wind power development and production. In this view, the physical geography of wind is the only geography that matters in characterising wind power potential. Our chapter builds on previous contributions pointing at the socially-constructed nature of wind power potential, in order to introduce the reader to a human geography of wind power. Drawing from a set of case studies of wind power development in France and a (theoretical) discussion of the socio-technical dimension of wind power technology and of various types of commons involved, assembled and re-composed in its development, we challenge the idea that “renewability” is an essential property of wind energy. Rather, we defend the idea that wind power can be made ‘renewable’ if the sociospatial context in which it is developed is thoroughly understood and properly taken into account...|$|R

Energy-related CO 2 emissions have in creased significantly. At the same time, important investments in combined cycle gas turbines have taken place. This paper analyses whether, from a cost minimization view <b>point,</b> <b>renewable</b> supporth as been the best policy for reducing emissions, when compared to the promotion of energy efficiency in sectors such as transportation or buildings. We use a model of the Spanish energy sector to examine its evolution in the time period considered under different policies. It is a bottom-up, static, partial equilibrium, linear programming model of the complete Spanish energy system. We conclude that demand side management (DSM) clearly dominates renewable energy (RE) support if the reduction of emissions at minimum cost is the only concern. We also quantify the savings that could have been achieved: a total of 5 billion per year, mainly in RE subsidies and in smaller costs of meeting the reduced demand (net of DSM implementation cost). info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{some aspects}} concerning {{the utilization of}} biomass as a bioenergy resource worldwide and in Romania, since biomass is considered a sustainable, potentially environmentally sound and a replenishable resource. The biomass categories for bioenergy are analyzed, considering the factors which influence its availability. Biomass energy potential and current use in different regions {{as well as in}} Europe is accounted. Also, biomass power as an important alternative for providing energy in rural sector is described and some technologies for biomass conversion are evaluated briefly. Biomass and renewable energy from biomass are considered end products, which involve new and advanced technologies to improve power production efficiency. It is evidenced that biomass provides a clean, renewable energy source, which could improve economic, energetic and environmental sectors. Also, many factors converge in making bioenergy a key issue toward the achievement of the Millenium Development Goals. Contributions of bioenergy to sustainable development of humanity are also discussed, based on some sustainability considerations and indicators. The investments in biomass and bioenergy in Romania are also considered as important, since the production of renewable energy for Romania is an important topic. The future projection on the use of <b>renewable</b> energy resources <b>points</b> toward actions for economic development where renewable energy from biomass will play more and more a growing role, without affecting the community food security...|$|R
40|$|Development of new {{renewable}} technologies {{is an important}} driver in the scientific community. As atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increase and the dependence on a finite amount of fossil fuel remains, the need for sustainable forms of energy is ever growing. Research {{in the field of}} <b>renewable</b> biofuels has <b>pointed</b> researchers toward the naturally occurring, robust, lipid- producing microorganism; microalgae. Its ability to sequester carbon and yield high lipid production has made it very attractive to renewable research. It has the potential to produce up to 10 times the oil, per acre, than competing biofuel feedstocks. However, an energy efficient method of harvesting algal biomass has yet to be utilized. The methods currently used employ large energy inputs, reducing overall efficiency of the harvest. The use of cavitation as destructive phenomenon has been largely studied in the past as something to avoid. Problems encountered on boat propellers, pump impellers, and turbines are designed to stay within certain operating parameters as to avoid cavitation, which would lead to failure of the equipment. It has more recently gained attention as a useable force, however a more thorough investigation of cavitational parameters is required in order to aid engineers and designers to understand the extent of its usefulness. The work implements a hydrodynamic cavitation system testing different operating parameters for evaluation of efficiency. Orifice plates were tested at varying cavitation numbers, power inputs, and geometric parameters in a controlled system. The Weissler reaction was employed to verify the intensity of the cavitating flow and the influence of tested parameters. Wet algal biomass samples were then run through the reactor to verify the effect of cavitation on cell wall disruption. ...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} role of the public trust {{doctrine}} in current efforts to site large-scale wind and solar projects on public and private lands. Notably, both proponents and opponents of such renewable energy projects have looked to the public trust doctrine to advance their goals. Proponents of large-scale <b>renewable</b> energy projects <b>point</b> to the environmental and climate change benefits associated with renewable energy development and argue that the use of public lands and large tracts of private lands to facilitate such projects are both in the public interest and consistent with the public trust doctrine. At the same time, parties opposed to particular renewable energy projects have argued that the land-intensive nature of these projects as well as their potential adverse impacts on endangered species, open space, aesthetic values, and pristine landscapes will result in a violation of the public trust doctrine. Which side is right? How do we balance the benefits and harms of large-scale renewable energy projects and what role should the public trust doctrine play in setting that balance? In addressing these questions, this Article discusses {{the extent to which the}} public trust doctrine applies to on-shore and off-shore renewable energy projects on private, state, and federal lands and waters. It then discusses the potential role state and federal legislation can play in codifying or expanding the application of the public trust doctrine with regard to state and federal lands and waters.

40|$|The primary {{motivation}} {{behind this}} research {{is the need to}} accelerate the supply of renewable energy because of the important role that it plays in mitigating climate change and in fostering sustainable development. Understanding past drivers for low-carbon investment can help us identify those for the future, and what could accelerate such investment. Investment in renewable energy can be modelled as a problem of technical asset allocation or optimisation at the firm or sectoral level, but is not entirely explained by this approach – the context in which actors are involved, their motivations and the wider systems in which they operate must also be taken into account. The interactions between actors may sometimes accelerate investment and sometimes prevent it; however, understanding the dynamics of these processes is crucial if we are to shape them. This study, which focuses on the wind and solar power sectors in India and China, aims to find and compare drivers for investment in <b>renewable</b> energy. Our <b>point</b> of entry for this piece of the study is that India is already seeing significant investment activity in renewable energy. During 2010 / 11, investment in renewables grew by 62 per cent to US$ 13 bn (although it slowed drastically in 2011 / 12 to US$ 6. 5 bn). In 2010 the Indian government announced a National Solar Mission that aimed to add 20 gigawatts (GW) of solar power generation capacity by 2020; wind power capacity has grown steadily at a compound annual growth rate of 17. 9 per cent since 2007 and now contributes more than 20 GW, or just over 70 per cent, of total renewable energy capacity. Almost all of this is private investment. However, these levels will need to increase sharply in the coming years and decades if India is to reach China’s levels (who, in 2013, became the world leader with US$ 67 bn invested in renewables) and make a greater contribution to the US$ 1 tn needed.

40|$|The {{problems}} {{of renewable energy}} sources development in Russia are complex and require long-term structural solutions in national socio-economy system. Currently, the Russian economy stays about two and half times less energy efficient and more carbon intensive than other comparable modern countries. General population on its own has not yet embraced energy efficiency as a social value. Among the main barriers to deployment of <b>renewable</b> energy technologies <b>pointed</b> out by experts are the lack of political, legislative and regulatory support, energy prices that {{do not reflect the}} costs of production, low electric power and heat tariffs, lack of information for decision makers, and preference for centralized energy supplies barriers all contribute to an inadequate investment climate for renewable energy technologies. But in some southern regions of Russia with favorable natural conditions and a comparatively low degree of economic centralization the situation is different. Good environmental conditions are very important for socio-economic development of two of those southern regions, the Krasnodar Region and the Republic of Adygea, which are currently promoted as tourist areas. Because of rapid infrastructure and economic development, the Krasnodar region has the biggest shortage of electricity in the country. The advantage of Krasnodar Region is the relatively low level of centralization of population and economic activity in the major cities. It makes off-grid technologies a growing focus of interest. In this paper the natural conditions for development renewable energy in Krasnodar region are studied, the potential environmental and ecological effects of renewables of different types are evaluated. For the Russian economy at present time the problem of lack of investment and unemployment is not as important as the problem of structural imbalances. Deindustrialization characterized structural change in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics during the transition to a market economy, and has transformed in early 2000 into reallocation of labor and capital to the oil&gas industry. Therefore, instead of the traditional input-output tool that estimates the number of jobs, salaries, and overall economic activity that will likely result from the renewable power project (JEDI model), we use a simplified approach, which allows us to identify the potential beneficiaries from growing demand for renewables among Russian manufacturers of power equipment. It is demonstrated that the expected environmental effect from the biogas and heat pumps technologies implementation in the Krasnodar region is the most significant in comparison with other types of renewable energy sources...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energy has}} become mainstream. The weird and wacky {{appliances}} of the seventies now mean {{big business and}} big opportunities for small farmers and small processors. Whatever next? At {{the mouth of the}} port of Dakar in Senegal, a kilometre or two off the coast, stands one of Africa s new landmarks: a navigation light. Standing nobly above the waves, on a firm concrete mast, it guides ships around a rocky bank on their port side, and on past the island of Gorée, an old African landmark of the former slave trade, on their starboard. Both landmarks have etched their place in history, one chillingly and shamefully, the light for being powered by batteries fed by the sloping solar panels {{at the top of the}} mast. Even the marks left by seagulls in transit, themselves a form of biomass, cannot long hinder the sun s rays from being caught by the panels. Similar new landmarks are in place in more than half of Africa s 400, 000 villages, and in most of those of the Pacific and the Caribbean. They are now at the forefront of what, two decades ago, was just another dream in the complex area of rural electrification. Then, they lay like discarded toys in a pile of broken dreams that came to be known as a technology graveyard, solar panels alongside ill-sited windmills. Now, times have changed, and while the sun and the wind were patiently waiting, the engineers have climbed their learning curve and simplified maintenance, and costs have fallen. Solar panels and well-sited wind pumps stand as a symbol of appropriate <b>renewable</b> energies, <b>pointing,</b> like those coastal navigation lights, a relatively sure way towards affordable energy supply in rural areas. Energy is the key Energy. It is in energy that we can find the key to development, according to many of those who search for the way to heave a society onto a virtuous spiral of progress. Others will say it is in education and the book. Or in health and nutrition, to tend and feed the body and mind. Or transport and trade, to get closer to markets and better income. Or digital technology, to get the right information. None of these options, and they each have their impassioned proponents, can work without energy. Energy is the light for extended learning and training time; the healthier heat for cooking; the cooling for perishable crops, food and medicine; the pumping for irrigation. It is in the processing and storage of products that reliable energy supply can add the most value to agricultural production. Of course, this is not to belittle the need for energy in the field. In water pumping, more use can be made of wind and solar energy. In mechanised cultivation, the need is for dependable access to fuel and, if possible, to shift away from fossil fuels. Yet in most ACP countries the localised production of alternatives to petrol and diesel, such as ethanol distilled from sugar cane, is still even farther away from the drawing board than the planner is from the field. Applications of renewable energy in agricultural processing come in two forms: direct, and through generated electricity. The use of solar dryers for processing fruit and vegetables is now standard practice in most villages; the ubiquitous towers of trays of produce are ventilated by the convection of warm air, which can be boosted by small solar-powered fans. Similarly, panels of water-filled collectors absorb solar radiation, even on cloudy days, to warm up water for cooking and cleaning, reducing the need for wood or charcoal use in stoves. And, of course, there are the infamous improved small stoves, known as jikos in eastern Africa, or ban uk suf in Senegal, which have noticeably reduced both wood consumption and unhealthy smoke for millions of households and small food processors. Grappling with the grid There is, though, no real alternative to the use of electricity, and here there are many mountains to climb, perhaps literally, before rural supply is a common feature in most villages. In Uganda, for example, less than 1 % of the rural population is connected to the national grid, reflecting the fact that extensive rural grid connection is hindered by high, uneconomical cost. This barrier, says a recent government report, has led to increased self-electrification in rural areas, with people using diesel-powered generators and, increasingly, solar photovoltaic collectors. Such scenarios are known in most ACP countries more than 40 use traditional fuels (mainly wood) for more than three-quarters of their fuel consumption, according to extensive data provided by UNDP s Human Development Report 2002. In recent years, many technical advances have been made in the extension of national electricity grids, in particular on overcoming the tremendous losses of power over transmission lines several hundred kilometres long. Grids are also being linked, one to another, so that they can share electricity. A massive project is currently underway to share power from the Manantali hydro-electricity dam in Mali with Senegal and Mauritania. Using national grids is not, frankly, an option in most rural electrification programmes. They need to be based mainly on the generation of electricity at the local level, in stand-alone systems or isolated grid mini-systems serving a locality. In these, power can be generated from such sources as sugar mills; bagasse is heavily used in, for example, Jamaica, Mauritius and South Africa. Other agricultural wastes, such as rice husks or coffee shells, can also be used. In Uganda, isolated systems will serve relatively concentrated areas with a potential for use by rural enterprises, providing a model for better serving market towns. Their source of power will be mainly from micro-hydro plants, a growing sector in the field of renewables. Creating demand In those dispersed areas where isolated grid systems are not viable, many countries are starting to opt for individual and institutional solar photovoltaic systems. Clinics, schools, guesthouses and small workshops, as well as better-endowed individuals, are shifting towards solar-powered buildings and homes. To really achieve a critical mass of demand, these steps require several support mechanisms: credit to help purchasers, and loans or grants to subsidise the initial cost for local manufacturers. These are exactly the same mechanisms as were used 20 years in Europe to get solar energy off the ground, as it were. And exactly the same as were used to ensure the widespread dissemination of improved wood-burning stoves. Third time lucky, they must be thinking in the ACP solar sector. And, yes, these steps are now being taken in a positive way. The recent launch of the African Rural Energy Enterprise Development (see Links,) is an example of how public-private partnerships are being developed to yank up the production of equipment for affordable energy generation or efficient consumption. It is this business-like approach which will ultimately determine whether the slogan power to the people also works for rural communities. If the new Global Environment Facility of the UN system, due to emerge in early September 2002 from the World Summit on Sustainable Development, is looking for a priority area to work in, alongside changes in consumption in the industrial world, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars, cows, rice paddies and factories, then it is in rural electrification. Maybe the future that only visionaries can see, 30 years from now, is full of new forms of electricity generation, such as covering massive desert areas in ACP countries and elsewhere with vast arrays of solar collectors. In the meantime, if the world cannot bring power to the rural people, then at least help them make it themselves. Sustainably.
