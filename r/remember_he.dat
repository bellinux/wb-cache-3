He {{cared for}} the success of the British aims, especially insofar as they could be achieved by the Admiralty, and for nothing else. His passion for this aim was pure, self-devoted, and all-devouring. He failed to <b>remember</b> <b>he</b> was a politician.|$|E

When a young mutant named Layla Miller gives several heroes (including Hawkeye) the ability to <b>remember,</b> <b>he</b> is horrified at the Scarlet Witch's actions. Hawkeye shoots Wanda {{in the back with}} an arrow. In retaliation, one of her recreated children wipes Hawkeye from existence, killing him once more. When the Scarlet Witch's reality is eventually undone, Hawkeye is still presumed dead. However, the recently formed New Avengers find his bow and arrows {{on the site of the}} old Avengers Mansion, pinning up an article about his death.|$|E

He portrayed a happily committed fireman in Sad Movie, and rekindled a romance with an old friend in A Good Rain Knows. His big-budget martial arts films The Restless and Reign of Assassins would also have romantic elements.|$|E

He said {{he went to a}} party and got drunk and when he {{woke up in the morning}} he found Northrup was in bed with him. He was having a lot of problems with her. I <b>remember</b> <b>he</b> said to me I was the only person he knew who would set up a white silk tent for him. I was rather surprised when we were driving back to LA on Sunday evening, he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife." [...] In November 1950, Northrup attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid and told her to forget about him and the Foundation, but resumed the affair with her again within a month.|$|E
500|$|Poe {{wrote the}} poem as a narrative, without {{intentionally}} creating an allegory or falling into didacticism. The main {{theme of the}} poem is one of undying devotion. The narrator experiences a perverse conflict between desire to forget and desire to <b>remember.</b> <b>He</b> seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss. The narrator assumes that the word [...] "Nevermore" [...] is the raven's [...] "only stock and store", and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, knowing what the answer will be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss. Poe leaves it unclear if the raven actually {{knows what it is}} saying or if it really intends to cause a reaction in the poem's narrator. The narrator begins as [...] "weak and weary," [...] becomes regretful and grief-stricken, before passing into a frenzy and, finally, madness. Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of elegiac paraclausithyron, an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded, locked-out lover at the sealed door of his beloved.|$|E
500|$|Talk of {{a reunion}} {{commenced}} {{weeks after the}} trio began speaking again. After a two-hour phone conversation between DeLonge and Hoppus, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. DeLonge {{was the first to}} approach the subject of reuniting. The trio had, in Hoppus's words, [...] "two gnarly heart-to-hearts," [...] during which the three opened up. [...] "Tom had just kind of come out to Los Angeles for the day," [...] recalled Hoppus, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>he</b> said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think we should continue with what we've been doing for the past 17 years. I think we should get back on the road and back in the studio and do what we love doing.'" [...] Eventually, the band appeared {{for the first time on}} stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the 51st Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009. The band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up where we left off and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy." ...|$|E

500|$|Arthur Adams {{was born}} on April 5, 1963 in Holyoke, Massachusetts. His father was a {{loadmaster}} in the United States Air Force, and as a result, Adams frequently moved with his parents and four younger brothers to places that included West Virginia. When Adams was five years old, the family settled in Vacaville, California, near Travis Air Force Base. Adams' first exposure to superhero and monster comics came through the ones his mother would buy for him once a month at a thrift store. His enthusiasm for superhero stories by particular creators began when his father returned from an overseas trip with the first Marvel Treasury Grab-Bag, which included stories by Ross Andru, Wally Wood, and Gene Colan. He particularly liked Marvel Comics for their stories with monster-like characters like the Thing, the Hulk, and the Man-Thing. He became interested in dinosaurs and monsters like King Kong after watching Creature Features on TV every Saturday, and Universal Monster movies such as Frankenstein and Creature from the Black Lagoon. He also enjoyed superhero and science fiction programming, such as Super Friends, the 1967 Spider-Man cartoon and Star Trek. Adams enjoyed drawing frequently in his youth, {{as far back as}} he could <b>remember.</b> <b>He</b> discovered the work of Frank Frazetta when he was 13 or 14, which was a [...] "huge" [...] early influence on him, and attempted to mimic his style using watercolor. Adams did not consider illustration as a profession, however, as he aspired to be a paleontologist. His interest in professional paleontology waned, however, when he realized that the extreme climates of the environments in which he would be required to work were not appealing to him.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra became {{increasingly}} {{frustrated with the}} status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group, but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard as the lead singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra signed a contract with Dorsey for $125 a week at Palmer House in Chicago, and James agreed amicably to release Sinatra from his contract. On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, Illinois, opening the show with [...] "Stardust". Dorsey recalled: [...] "You could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. <b>Remember,</b> <b>he</b> was no matinée idol. He was just a skinny kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos". Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940. Sinatra later said that [...] "The only two people I've ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey". Though Kelley claims that Sinatra and drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals, other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious illness.|$|E

When speaking about Cuomo, Barron said, [...] "He’s done nothing to deserve our support; he’s hurt the black community. <b>Remember</b> <b>he</b> was with his father, when his father built more prisons than any other governor in the history of New York State.

2500|$|October – Boyd K. Packer {{delivered}} his [...] "Cleansing the Inner Vessel" [...] October conference address. He states that [...] "qualifies {{according to the}} definition as a revelation". Immediately after referencing [...] "Satan's many substitutes or counterfeits for marriage", he states [...] "some suppose that they were pre-set and cannot overcome what they feel are inborn tendencies toward the impure and unnatural. Not so! Why would our Heavenly Father do that to anyone? <b>Remember,</b> <b>he</b> is our father." [...] His characterization of same-sex physical attractions as [...] "impure and unnatural" [...] tendencies that can be [...] "overcome" [...] sparked a protest of thousands of individuals on October 7 which surrounded Temple Square. Packer later altered his words in the print version of his speech to say [...] "Some suppose that they were preset and cannot overcome what they feel are inborn temptations toward the impure and unnatural.

DelToro also added (before writing began) that if they could not find a coherent story for the second film, they would just film The Hobbit, stating [...] "The Hobbit is better contained in a single film and kept brisk and fluid with no artificial 'break point'." [...] By November 2008, he acknowledged that the book was more detailed and eventful than people may <b>remember.</b> <b>He</b> decided to abandon the [...] "bridge film" [...] concept, feeling that it would be better for the two parts to contain only material from The Hobbit: ...|$|E
2500|$|Bunin {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in international myths and folklore, {{as well as}} the Russian folkloric tradition. But, (according to Georgy Adamovich) [...] "he was absolutely intolerant towards those of his colleagues who employed stylizations, the [...] "style Russe" [...] manufacturers. His cruel– and rightly so– review of Sergey Gorodetsky's poetry was one example. Even Blok's Kulikovo Field (for me, an outstanding piece) irritated him as too lavishly adorned... "That's Vasnetsov," [...] he commented, meaning 'masquerade and opera'. But he treated things that he felt were not masqueradery differently. Of the Slovo o Polku Igoreve... he said something to the effect that all the poets of the whole world lumped together couldn't have created such wonder, in fact something close to Pushkin's words. Yet translations of the legend... outraged him, particularly that of Balmont. He despised Shmelyov for his pseudo-Russian pretenses, though admitting his literary gift. Bunin had an extraordinarily sharp ear for falseness: he instantly recognized this jarring note and was infuriated. That was why he loved Tolstoy so much. Once, I <b>remember,</b> <b>he</b> spoke of Tolstoy as the one 'who's never said a single word that would be an exaggeration'." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 27, 2014, in an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Murphy discussed returning to the edgier type character of Axel Foley after years of making family friendly films. [...] "I haven't done a street guy, working class, blue-collar character in ages so maybe it's like, 'Oh, wow, I didn't <b>remember</b> <b>he</b> was able to do that,'" [...] Murphy said. According to studio reports on the film's plot, Foley will return to Detroit after leaving his job in Beverly Hills and he will be faced with the coldest winter on record to navigate the new rules and old enemies of one of America's most tenacious cities. The state of Michigan approved $13.5 million in film incentives, based on an estimated $56.6 million of filmmaker spending in the state. The film will be shot in and around Detroit and is estimated to provide jobs for 352 workers. The film was originally scheduled for a March 25, 2016 release, but on May 6, 2015, Paramount Pictures pulled Beverly Hills Cop IV from its release schedule, due to script concerns. On June 14, 2016, Deadline.com reported that Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, directors of the Belgian drama Black, would direct the film.|$|E
