5|$|During the 19th century, Massachusetts {{became a}} {{national}} leader in the American Industrial Revolution, with factories around cities such as Lowell and Boston producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing tools, paper, and textiles. The economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of water-power and later the steam engine to power factories. Canals and railroads were used for transporting <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> finished goods. At first, the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms, and later relied upon immigrant labor from Europe and Canada.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{occupation}} {{came under}} two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US Dollars) {{by the end}} of the war, this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial products, military equipment, <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> other goods. Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went on.|$|E

30|$|The pH was {{slightly}} acidic in the vermicompost, {{followed by the}} <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> the cow manure, i.e., 6.50, 6.50 and 6.20, respectively. The soluble salt concentrations (measured as electric conductivity) in the resulting vermicompost, <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> cow manure were 3.71  mS/cm, 3.00  mS/cm and 5.72  mS/cm, respectively, indicating a slight decrease in salinity in the vermicompost compared to the cow manure. The total organic carbon was 18.53 %, 42.96 % and 21.02 % in the vermicompost, <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> cow manure, respectively. The total nitrogen was 1.36 % in the vermicompost and 1.88 % in the <b>raw</b> <b>material.</b> The C/N ratio in the vermicompost, and cow manure was the same (13 : 1) but quite high (23 : 1) in the <b>raw</b> <b>material.</b> Total phosphorus was 0.58 %, 0.26 % and 0.78 % in the vermicompost, <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> cow manure, respectively. The total potassium was 0.56 % in the vermicompost, 1.23 % in <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> 0.86 % in cow manure, indicating {{a decrease in the}} vermicompost, compared to the cow manure <b>and</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material.</b> The total zinc, manganese, copper and iron concentrations are higher in the vermicompost than in the <b>raw</b> <b>material,</b> indicating an accumulation of these micro-elements in the vermicompost, but lower than in cow manure.

5|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} capital, foreign investment—in particular from Great Britain—was courted, but it was not sizable enough to initiate an economic recovery. Finally the new nations entered the world economy {{after the end of the}} French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, when the economies of Europe and the United States were recovering and aggressively seeking new markets to sell their products after more than two decades of disruption. Ultimately Spanish America could only connect to the world markets as an exporter of <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> a consumer of finished products.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E
5|$|Another {{institution}} key to unifying the German states, the Zollverein, {{helped to}} create a larger sense of economic unification. Initially conceived by the Prussian Finance Minister Hans, Count von Bülow, as a Prussian customs union in 1818, the Zollverein linked the many Prussian and Hohenzollern territories. Over the ensuing thirty years (and more) other German states joined. The Union helped to reduce protectionist barriers among the German states, especially improving the transport of <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> finished goods, making it both easier to move goods across territorial borders and less costly to buy, transport, and sell raw materials. This was particularly important for the emerging industrial centers, {{most of which were}} located in the Rhineland, the Saar, and the Ruhr valleys.|$|E

5|$|Based on archaeological {{findings}} in the Middle East, in particular physical artifacts, textual references, inscriptions and wall paintings, it appears that Mycenaean Greeks achieved strong commercial and cultural interaction {{with most of the}} Bronze Age people living in this region: Canaanites, Kassites, Mitanni, Assyrians, and Egyptians. The 14th century Uluburun shipwreck, off the coast of southern Anatolia, displays the established trade routes that supplied the Mycenaeans with all the <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> items that the economy of Mycenaean Greece needed, such as copper and tin for the production of bronze products. A chief export of the Mycenaeans was olive oil, which was a multi-purpose product.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{increase}} in the domestic manufacturing industry {{there was still a}} significant shortfall in many items. In part this was due to the priority that military consumption and production necessarily had over civilian, however, there was also a considerable scarcity of <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> other components required for manufacturing. This was due both to the lack of shipping available from the United Kingdom, as well as the limitations placed upon the flow of such goods from Britain due to their own increased requirements. The result of this was inflationary. Domestic prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased considerably.|$|E
5|$|Fiscal chaos, {{coupled with}} {{problems}} {{of transportation and}} the requisition of metal led to a general economic collapse as factories ran out of <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> laid off workers. The crisis especially afflicted Belgium's large manufacturing industries. As raw material usually imported from abroad dried up, more firms laid off workers. Unemployment became a major problem and increased reliance on charity distributed by civil institutions and organisations. As many as 650,000 people were unemployed between 1915 and 1918. The German authorities used the crisis to loot industrial machinery from Belgian factories, which was either sent to Germany intact or melted down. The policy escalated {{after the end of}} the German policy of deportation in 1917 which later created major problems for Belgian economic recovery {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E

The possibility here is that enterprises with limited fund and credit, and without or with inconsistent water and electric power in work places will not meet their target in the market. In addition, they could not purchase quality <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> that can lead them to better production and strong resistant to market fluctuation.|$|R

5|$|The {{availability}} {{of water to}} transport products and <b>raw</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>and</b> as a resource used {{in the manufacture of}} paper, was essential to the historical development of paper mills in the area. Bradbourne stream, which meanders through the parish in a south-east to north-west direction, rises in East Malling, crosses under the A20 road and M20 motorway, and joins the river Medway near the Aylesford Newsprint site. Historically the {{availability of}} running water was essential to the early settlements that grew up in Kent, and to the establishment of industries in the area; such as providing power to drive the mills which ground grain.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the manufacture of iron goods to Birmingham's economy was recognised as early as 1538, and grew rapidly as the century progressed. Equally significant was the town's emerging role as a centre for the iron merchants who organised finance, supplied <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> traded and marketed the industry's products. By the 1600s Birmingham formed the commercial hub {{of a network of}} forges and furnaces stretching from South Wales to Cheshire and its merchants were selling finished manufactured goods as far afield as the West Indies. These trading links gave Birmingham's metalworkers access to much wider markets, allowing them to diversify away from lower-skilled trades producing basic goods for local sale, towards a broader range of specialist, higher-skilled and more lucrative activities.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{major power}} of the cotton {{industry}} {{in the first quarter}} of the 19th century, the Strutts' company began to lose out to competition from Lancashire mill towns. The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley; Lancashire was better situated than Derbyshire in relation to the <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> new markets. The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation; although they were at the forefront of fireproofing technology at the start of the 19th century, as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful, the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been more adept at using the machinery. The company declined and in the second half of the 19th century some of its mills were leased or sold off to other companies. Although the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley declined, many of the structures associated with the industrial processes associated with producing cotton and workers' housing has survived and there are 848 listed buildings in the World Heritage Site.|$|E

5|$|By 1985, {{international}} {{isolation and}} economic hardships had forced Vietnam to rely {{more and more}} on the Soviet Union for help. During the Chinese invasion in February 1979, the Soviet Union provided $1.4 billion worth of military aid to Vietnam, a figure that peaked at $1.7 billion in the period between 1981 and 1985. Then, to help Vietnam implement its third Five Year Plan (1981–1985), the Soviet Union provided a sum of $5.4 billion to the Vietnamese Government for its expenditures; economic aid ultimately reached $1.8 billion annually. The Soviet Union also provided 90 percent of Vietnam’s demand for <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> 70 percent of its grain imports. Even though the figures suggest the Soviet Union was a reliable ally, privately Soviet leaders were dissatisfied with Hanoi's handling of the stalemate in Kampuchea and resented the burden of their aid program to Vietnam as their own country was undergoing economic reforms. In 1986, the Soviet Government announced that it would reduce aid to friendly nations; for Vietnam, those reductions meant the loss of 20 percent of its economic aid and one-third of its military aid.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 18th century, with {{the lines between}} {{commercial}} and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts. The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to {{a portion of the}} Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s. India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with <b>raw</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>and</b> many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period. By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and effectively having been made an arm of British administration, the company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.|$|E
5|$|With {{access to}} wood from the Quantock Hills, {{records show that}} paper making was {{established}} by 1652. In the 15th century, a flour mill was established by the Fulford and Hadley families {{near the mouth of}} the Washford River. By 1587 the Wyndham estate had established a fulling and grist mill to the south west. By 1652, the mill had started to produce paper. In 1846 business partners James Date, William Peach and John Wansbrough bought the business and introduced mechanised-production using a water wheel-powered pulley system. In the 1860s, the factory was converted to steam power and the local harbour was used to import <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> export finished goods. Most of the mill was destroyed by fire in 1889 but it was rebuilt and less than ten years later five paper making machines were operating. The mill became the largest manufacturer of paper bags in the UK. In 1896, the business became the Wansbrough Paper Company, a limited liability company and is now known as the Wansbrough Paper Mill. With an annual capacity of 180,000 tonnes of product and employing 100 people, it is the UK's largest manufacturer of coreboard, and also produces containerboard, recycled envelope, bag and kraft papers. In December 2015 the paper mill ceased production and closed.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Cornish mining {{industry}} went into decline, public opposition to the use of female and child labour in mines was rising. The Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act 1872 brought the mines of Cornwall under the provisions of the Mines Act 1842, which had previously applied only to coal mines, limiting the use of child labour in the mines and thus increasing costs. The Act prohibited women from working underground, which the bal maidens did not do, but it also forbade any child under ten from working in any mine, even on the surface. The passing of the Factory and Workshop Act 1878 drastically limited the use of female and child labour. The employment of children under 10 was banned outright, the maximum working hours for children aged 10–14 were drastically restricted, and women were banned from working over 56 hours per week. The sudden loss of cheap child labourers made the already weakened mining industries of Cornwall and West Devon even less profitable, and more than half the mines in the area went out of business in the following decade. Some bal maidens continued to work in surviving mines and in tin-streaming, but instability in the metal markets made what remained of the mining industries increasingly unviable. In the 1880s William Ewart Gladstone's Liberal government tried to ban female labour from mines altogether; although the Bill was defeated, the number of bal maidens continued to fall. At the 1891 census the number of working bal maidens had fallen to around half its 1850s–60s peak. By 1895 only 23 mines remained operational compared to 307 in 1873, and in 1901 Devon Great Consols, the last significant copper mine in Devon and Cornwall, closed. Electrification and the introduction of Frue Vanners at the surviving mines replaced most of the jobs still done by women, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few bal maidens remained in employment. With wartime shortages of <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> many younger men in the armed forces, some bal maidens were temporarily rehired to dress potash ore at a re-opened mine at St Austell, and to re-dress the existing spoil heaps of defunct mines for wolfram and arsenic.|$|E
