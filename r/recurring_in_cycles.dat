40|$|Luteinized unruptured {{follicle}} (LUF) {{syndrome is}} one of the intractable ovulation disorders that are commonly observed during cycles of treatment with ovulation inducers, for which no effective therapy other than assisted reproductive technology is available. Here, we investigated whether granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) could prevent the onset of LUF syndrome. We analyzed the effects of G-CSF in 68 infertile women with LUF syndrome who received ovulation induction (clomiphene + human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] therapy or follicle-stimulating hormone + hCG therapy). G-CSF (lenograstim, 100  μg) was administered subcutaneously. Onsets of LUF syndrome were compared between the cycle during which G-CSF was given in combination with the ovulation inducer (ie, the G-CSF treatment cycle) and the subsequent cycle during which only the ovulation inducer was given (ie, the G-CSF nontreatment control cycle). The results showed that LUF syndrome <b>recurred</b> <b>in</b> only 3 <b>cycles</b> during the G-CSF treatment cycle (4. 4 % [3 / 68 cycles]), whereas LUF syndrome <b>recurred</b> <b>in</b> 13 <b>cycles</b> during the subsequent G-CSF nontreatment control cycle (19. 1 % [13 / 68 cycles]). The additional use of G-CSF significantly prevented the onset of LUF syndrome during ovulation induction (P =  0. 013, McNemar test). No serious adverse reactions because of the administration of G-CSF were observed. In conclusion, our findings indicate that G-CSF may become a useful therapy for LUF syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Oxaliplatin is a {{cytotoxic}} {{platinum compound}} {{that is in}} widespread use {{in the treatment of}} gastrointestinal cancers. It has been occasionally associated with acute motor neuropathy, but the precise mechanism is uncertain. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of a patient demonstrating post-tetanic facilitation in the setting of transient bilateral abducens neuropathy and hypokalemia, after being infused with oxaliplatin. Case presentation A 47 -year-old Indian woman with metastatic gastric cancer was receiving an oxaliplatin infusion at the initiation of her third cycle of palliative chemotherapy. She developed acute bilateral abducens neuropathy with post-tetanic facilitation alongside acute laryngopharyngodysesthesia and hypokalemia. Following supportive management, including potassium infusion and warming, her neurological signs and symptoms were spontaneously resolved. This syndrome did not <b>recur</b> <b>in</b> subsequent <b>cycles</b> following prolongation of infusion duration and the addition of supportive calcium and magnesium infusions. Conclusion The novel clinical observation of post-tetanic facilitation highlights a possible involvement of voltage-gated channels at the presynaptic terminals in the mechanism of acute oxaliplatin neurotoxicity. </p...|$|R

Secondly, we apply the method of Christiano (2002) to solve the model with heterogenous information sets. This is justified if we argue that the information set of domestic economic agents in a currency union is home-biased (i. e. foreign shocks enter only with a lag).

40|$|The {{ghosts of}} the 2000 presidential {{election}} will return in 2012. Photo-finish and error-laden elections <b>recur</b> <b>in</b> each <b>cycle.</b> When {{the margin of error}} exceeds the margin of victory, officials and courts must decide which, if any, errors to discount or excuse, knowing that the answer will likely determine the election’s winner. Yet despite widespread agreement on the likelihood of another national meltdown, neither courts nor scholars have developed consistent principles for resolving the errors that cause the chaos. This Article advances such a principle, reflecting the underlying values of the electoral process. It argues that the resolution of an election error should turn on its materiality: whether the error is material to the eligibility of a voter or the determination of her ballot preference. In developing this argument, this Article offers the first transsubstantive review of materiality as a governing principle. It then introduces the insight that, unlike the evaluation of materiality in other contexts, the materiality of a voting error may be reassessed over time. This dynamic assessment of materiality best accommodates the purposes of a decision rule for election error. Indeed, the insight is most powerful when the stakes are highest: when an election hangs in the balance. Finally, this Article discusses the pragmatic application of the materiality principle, including the invigoration of an underappreciated federal statute poised to change the way that disputed elections are resolved, in 2012 and beyond...|$|R
40|$|This paper generalizes the {{standard}} methods of solving rational expectations models {{to the case}} of time-varying nonstochastic parameters, <b>recurring</b> <b>in</b> a finite <b>cycle.</b> Such a specification occurs in a simple stylized New Keynesian model of the euro area when we combine the rotation in the ECB Governing Council (as constituted by the Treaty of Nice) and home bias in the interest rate decisions taken by its members. In small and mid-size economies, this combination slightly increases output and inflation volatility, as compared to a monetary policy setup without rotation. The method of Christiano (2002) has also been applied to solve the model when we assume a lagged perception of foreign macroeconomic shocks by domestic agents. When the cross-country synchronization of shocks is low or moderate and when these shocks are relatively persistent, the exclusion of contemporaneous foreign shocks from domestic agents' information sets may raise the volatility of output. There is also some tentative evidence that this effect could particularly affect mid-size economies.

In fact Wagner himself never publicly named any of his leitmotifs, [...] preferring to emphasise their flexibility of association, role in the musical form, and emotional effect.

Thus we have gallop rhythm, canter rhythm, and trot rhythm; presystolic gallop, systolic gallop, protodiastolic gallop, and mesodiastolic gallop; complete summation gallop and incomplete summation gallop; auricular gallop, ventricular gallop, and auriculo-ventricular gallop; true gallop; left-sided gallop and right-sided gallop; rapid-filling gallop; diastolic echo; mitral opening snap; reduplication of first sound and reduplication of second sound; Potain's murmur; third heart sound and fourth heart sound.

The Babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses <b>recurred</b> <b>in</b> a repeating <b>cycle</b> known as a saros.Following the Babylonians, significant advances in astronomy were made in ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the Moon and Sun, and was the first to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe. Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy. The Antikythera mechanism (c. 150-80 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.|$|R
