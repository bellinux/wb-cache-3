2500|$|Furthermore, {{others may}} have made {{observations}} on interferons before the 1957 publication of Isaacs and Lindenmann. For example, during research to produce a more efficient vaccine for smallpox, Yasu-ichi Nagano and Yasuhiko Kojima—two Japanese virologists working at the Institute for Infectious Diseases at the University of Tokyo—noticed inhibition of viral growth {{in an area of}} <b>rabbit-skin</b> or testis previously inoculated with UV-inactivated virus. [...] They hypothesised that some [...] "viral inhibitory factor" [...] was present in the tissues infected with virus and attempted to isolate and characterize this factor from tissue homogenates. Independently, Monto Ho, in John Enders's lab, observed in 1957 that attenuated poliovirus conferred a species specific anti-viral effect in human amniotic cell cultures. They described these observations in a 1959 publication, naming the responsible factor viral inhibitory factor (VIF). It took another fifteen to twenty years, using somatic cell genetics, to show that the interferon action gene and interferon gene reside in different human chromosomes. The purification of human beta interferon did not occur until 1977. Chris Y.H. Tan and his co-workers purified and produced biologically active, radio-labeled human beta interferon by superinducing the interferon gene in fibroblast cells, and they showed its active site contains tyrosine residues. Tan's laboratory isolated sufficient amounts of human beta interferon to perform the first amino acid, sugar composition and N-terminal analyses. They showed that human beta interferon was an unusually hydrophobic glycoprotein. This explained the large loss of interferon activity when preparations were transferred from test tube to test tube or from vessel to vessel during purification. The analyses showed the reality of interferon activity by chemical verification. The purification of human alpha interferon was not reported until 1978. A series of publications from the laboratories of Sidney Pestka and Alan Waldman between 1978 and 1981, describe the purification of the type I interferons IFN-α and IFN-β. By the early 1980s, genes for these interferons had been cloned, adding further definitive proof that interferons were responsible for interfering with viral replication. [...] Gene cloning also confirmed that IFN-α was encoded by a family of many related genes. [...] The type II IFN (IFN-γ) gene was also isolated around this time.|$|E

60|$|The drum reverberated, the panpipes squealed. I {{signed to}} him to hide himself in the recess among my {{discarded}} clothes, {{out of sight of}} peeping eyes, and arranged my person on the satin and <b>rabbit-skins.</b>|$|R
60|$|Old Uleeta {{turned out}} to be a more intelligent, it not more kindly, nurse. After she had eaten her supper and succeeded in bolting the last bite that had refused to go down when she could eat no more, she came forward with a bladder full of water, and some <b>rabbit-skins,</b> for the purpose of {{dressing}} the wounds.|$|R

60|$|Her {{voice had}} grown louder. She entered the cave as she spoke--a big-boned {{woman in a}} suit of skins leading by the hand a pathetic little mite in a <b>rabbit-skin,</b> with blue eyes and a slobbered face.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she began}} to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room {{as well as the}} kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front-door and put them straight; the hearth-rug was a <b>rabbit-skin.</b> She dusted the clock and the {{ornaments}} on the mantelpiece, and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 10: Still more {{remarkable}} is {{the increase of}} rabbits both in New Zealand and Australia. No less than seven millions of <b>rabbit-skins</b> have been exported from the former country in a single year, their value being £67,000. In both countries, sheep-runs have been greatly deteriorated in value by the abundance of rabbits, which destroy the herbage; {{and in some cases}} they have had to be abandoned altogether.] ...|$|R
6000|$|Very soon Snorro's little head reposed upon {{a pillow}} of <b>rabbit-skins,</b> {{and not long}} after that Olaf went to rest beside him on a deer-skin couch, where, lying on his back, he could see the sky {{through the hole in the}} top of the tent whence the smoke of the fire escaped. As he lay there the burden of his {{thoughts}} was ever the same--"Oh why did I do it? Why did I disobey?" [...] Thus the poor boy lay, self-condemned, and gazed upwards and pondered, until sweet sleep came and carried heart and brain to the blessed refuge of oblivion.|$|R
60|$|The tent, {{which was}} made of sheets of birch bark sewed together, was pitched beneath the {{branches}} of a gigantic pine, upon the lower limbs of which hung a pair of worn-out snow-shoes, a very dirty blanket, and a short bow, with a quiver of arrows near it. At the foot of it, upon the ground, were scattered a few tin pots, several pairs of old moccasins, and a gun; while against it leaned an Indian cradle, in which a small, very brown baby, with jet-black eyes and hair, stood bolt upright, basking in the sun's rays, and bearing a comical resemblance to an Egyptian mummy. At the door of the tent a child of riper years amused itself by rolling about among the chips of wood, useless bits of deer-skin, and filth always strewn around a wigwam. On the right hand lay a pile of firewood, with an axe beside it, near which crouched a half-starved, wretched-looking nondescript dog, who commenced barking vociferously the moment he cast eyes upon me. Such was the outside. The interior, filled with smoke from the fire and Indians' pipes, was, if possible, even dirtier. Amid a large pile of <b>rabbit-skins</b> reclined an old woman, busily plucking the feathers from a fine duck, which she carefully preserved (the feathers, not the duck) in a bag, for the purpose of trading them with the Company at a future period. Her dress was a coat of <b>rabbit-skins,</b> so strangely shaped that no one could possibly tell how she ever got it off or on. This, however, was doubtless a matter of little consequence to her, as Indians seldom take the trouble of changing their clothes, or even of undressing at all. The coat was fearfully dirty, and hung upon her in a way that led me to suppose she had worn it for six months, and that it would fall off her in a few days. A pair of faded blue cloth leggins completed her costume--her dirty shoulders, arms, and feet being quite destitute of covering; while her long black hair fell in tangled masses upon her neck, and it was evidently a long time since a comb had passed through it. On the other side sat a younger woman similarly attired, employed in mending a hand-net; and on a very much worn buffalo robe sat a young man (probably the brother of the one we had seen fishing), wrapped in a blanket, smoking his pipe in silence. A few dirty little half-naked boys lay sprawling among several packages of furs tied up in birch bark, and disputed with two or three ill-looking dogs the most commodious place whereon to lie. The fire {{in the middle of the}} tent sent up a cloud of smoke, which escaped through an aperture at the top; and from a cross-bar depended a few slices of deer-meat, undergoing the process of smoking.|$|R
60|$|The tree, {{deeper in}} the water, was {{travelling}} faster, and the painter tautened as the boat took the tow. Then, with a last giddy look around, wherein he saw the banks tilting and swaying and the sun swinging in pendulum-sweep across the sky, Daylight wrapped himself in his <b>rabbit-skin</b> robe, lay down in the bottom, and fell asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo! wot have we here?" [...] cried Big Waller, who was poking inquisitively about {{among the}} tents, to the consternation {{of the poor}} Indian {{children}} who lay huddled up in their <b>rabbit-skin</b> blankets, trembling from head to foot, and expecting to be scalped forthwith--such of them, at least, as were old enough to expect anything. [...] "Here's your blunderbusses, I guess, mister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a feller in a <b>rabbit-skin</b> cap {{some time}} ago. 'E was loiterin' about until I asked 'im what 'is {{business}} was, for I didn't {{care about the}} looks of 'im, or the way that 'e was peepin' in at the windows.

6000|$|... "'Yes, ma'am,' I'll say, 'Burning Daylight was {{a pretty}} good cuss, but it's better that he's gone. He quit rolling up in his <b>rabbit-skins</b> and {{sleeping}} in the snow, and went to living in a chicken-coop. He lifted up his legs and quit walking and working, and took to existing on Martini cocktails and Scotch whiskey. He thought he loved you, ma'am, and he did his best, but he loved his cocktails more, and he loved his money more, and himself more, and 'most everything else more than he did you.' And then I'll say, 'Ma'am, you just run your eyes over me and see how different I am. I ain't got a cocktail thirst, and all the money I got is a dollar and forty cents and I've got to buy a new ax, the last one being plumb wore out, and I can love you just about eleven times as much as your first husband did. You see, ma'am, he went all to fat. And there ain't ary ounce of fat on me.' And I'll roll up my sleeve and show you, and say, 'Mrs. Harnish, after having experience with being married to that old fat money-bags, do you-all mind marrying a slim young fellow like me?' And you'll just wipe a tear away for poor old Daylight, and kind of lean toward me with a willing expression in your eye, and then I'll blush maybe some, being a young fellow, and put my arm around you, like that, and then--why, then I'll up and marry my brother's widow, and go out and do the chores while she's cooking a bite to eat." ...|$|R
6000|$|The other {{passengers}} have emerged: a large, pale, fat, [...] "handsome" [...] Palermitan {{who is going}} to be professor at Cagliari: his large, fat, but high-coloured wife: and three children, a boy of fourteen like a thin, frail, fatherly girl, a little boy in a <b>rabbit-skin</b> overcoat, coming rather unfluffed, and a girl-child on the mother's knee. The one-year-old girl-child being, of course, the only man in the party.|$|E
60|$|Mr Clark stood rapt in amazement: observing {{under his}} breath, I never saw such a start on this wharf before. Walter {{picked up the}} shoe, {{and put it on}} the little foot as the Prince in the story might have fitted Cinderella's slipper on. He hung the <b>rabbit-skin</b> over his left arm; gave the right to Florence; and felt, not to say like Richard Whittington--that is a tame comparison--but like Saint George of England, with the dragon lying dead before him.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{attitude}} of Madame Recamier in the picture, I reclined on a lustrous spread of crimson satin and <b>rabbit-skin</b> draped over a small lump of wood for bolster to give support to my elbow. And out of my paint and powder, from amid this oasis--and with repeated warnings [...] "not to touch" [...] screamed by my gipsy--I met as pleasantly and steadily as I could {{the eyes of the}} grinning, smirking, awestruck faces--townsfolk and village folk, all agape and all sound Kentish stock.|$|E
6000|$|Our new {{acquaintance}} very deliberately coiled up {{the tube}} of his hookah, and produced {{from behind a}} curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs. This he buttoned tightly up, {{in spite of the}} extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire by putting on a <b>rabbit-skin</b> cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face. [...] "My health is somewhat fragile," [...] he remarked, as he led the way down the passage. [...] "I am compelled to be a valetudinarian." ...|$|E
60|$|Florence {{remained}} there, {{looking at}} the bustle in the street, {{and more and more}} bewildered by it; and in the meanwhile the clocks appeared to have made up their minds never to strike three any more. At last the steeples rang out three o'clock; there was one close by, so she couldn't be mistaken; and--after often looking over her shoulder, and often going a little way, and as often coming back again, lest the all-powerful spies of Mrs Brown should take offence--she hurried off, as fast as she could in her slipshod shoes, holding the <b>rabbit-skin</b> tight in her hand.|$|E
60|$|He had {{followed}} the trail of his fleeing people for eleven days, and his pursuit had been in itself a flight; for behind him he knew full well were the dreaded Russians, toiling through the swampy lowlands and over the steep divides, bent on {{no less than the}} extermination of all his people. He was travelling light. A <b>rabbit-skin</b> sleeping-robe, a muzzle- loading rifle, and a few pounds of sun-dried salmon constituted his outfit. He would have marvelled that a whole people--women and children and aged--could travel so swiftly, had he not known the terror that drove them on.|$|E
60|$|Either the {{firewood}} {{had originally}} been placed {{too far away from}} the old woman's hand, or she had shifted her position, for she could not reach it. Once and again she made the effort--she stretched out her withered arm and succeeded in just touching the end of one of the pieces of wood, but could not grasp it. She pawed it once or twice, and then gave up the attempt with a little sigh. Drawing herself slowly together, she gathered up the <b>rabbit-skin</b> blanket which rested on her shoulders and attempted feebly to fold it across her chest. Then she slowly drooped her white head, with an expression of calm resignation on her old wrinkled visage.|$|E
6000|$|From Curzon Street the tiger-skin rug {{travelled}} {{down to the}} Manor House, and was duly inspected {{and admired}} by the county, and it seemed a fitting and appropriate thing when Mrs. Packletide went to the County Costume Ball {{in the character of}} Diana. She refused to fall in, however, with Clovis's tempting suggestion of a primeval dance party, at which every one should wear the skins of beasts they had recently slain. [...] "I should be in rather a Baby Bunting condition," [...] confessed Clovis, [...] "with a miserable <b>rabbit-skin</b> or two to wrap up in, but then," [...] he added, with a rather malicious glance at Diana's proportions, [...] "my figure is quite as good as that Russian dancing boy's." ...|$|E
60|$|October is the time--1900; Hope Canyon is the place, a silver-mining camp {{away down}} in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to discovery; thought by its {{occupants}} to be rich in metal--a year or two's prospecting will decide that matter {{one way or the}} other. For inhabitants, the camp has about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in <b>rabbit-skin</b> robes, battered plug hats, and tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; there is no church, no newspaper. The camp has existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and place.|$|E
60|$|Tess Durbeyfield {{had been}} one of the last to suspend her labours. She sat down at the end of the shock, her face turned {{somewhat}} away from her companions. When she had deposited herself a man in a <b>rabbit-skin</b> cap, and with a red handkerchief tucked into his belt, held the cup of ale over the top of the shock for her to drink. But she did not accept his offer. As soon as her lunch was spread she called up the big girl, her sister, and took the baby of her, who, glad to be relieved of the burden, went away to the next shock and joined the other children playing there. Tess, with a curiously stealthy yet courageous movement, and with a still rising colour, unfastened her frock and began suckling the child.|$|E
60|$|Especially {{he loved}} his camp {{at the end of}} the day, and in it he saw a picture which he ever yearned to paint and which he knew he would never forget--a beaten place in the snow, where burned his fire; his bed, a couple of <b>rabbit-skin</b> robes spread on fresh-chopped spruce-boughs; his shelter, a {{stretched}} strip of canvas that caught and threw back the heat of the fire; the blackened coffee-pot and pail resting on a length of log, the moccasins propped on sticks to dry, the snow-shoes up-ended in the snow; and across the fire the wolf-dogs snuggling to it for the warmth, wistful and eager, furry and frost-rimed, with bushy tails curled protectingly over their feet; and all about, pressed backward but a space, the wall of encircling darkness.|$|E
60|$|When {{the pipe}} was smoked out, {{she gave the}} child a <b>rabbit-skin</b> to carry, that she might appear the more like her {{ordinary}} companion, {{and told her that}} she was now going to lead her to a public street whence she could inquire her way to her friends. But she cautioned her, with threats of summary and deadly vengeance in case of disobedience, not to talk to strangers, nor to repair to her own home (which may have been too near for Mrs Brown's convenience), but to her father's office in the City; also to wait at the street corner where she would be left, until the clock struck three. These directions Mrs Brown enforced with assurances that there would be potent eyes and ears in her employment cognizant of all she did; and these directions Florence promised faithfully and earnestly to observe.|$|E
60|$|It was {{no small}} plunge for one {{hitherto}} watched, tended, and guarded as Malcolm had been, to set forth entirely alone; {{but as he}} had approached manhood, and strengthened in body, his spirit had gained much in courage, and the anxiety about his sister swallowed up all other considerations. Even while he entreated the prayers of the Abbess, he felt quite sure that he had those of Esclairmonde; {{and when he had}} hunted out of his mails the plain bachelor's <b>rabbit-skin</b> hood and black gown--which, perhaps, was a little too fine in texture for the poor wanderer--and fastened on his back, with a leathern thong, a package containing a few books and a change of linen, his pale and intellectual face made him look so entirely the young clerk, that Patrick hardly believed it was Malcolm.|$|E
6000|$|Three days later, {{having with}} craft ill-concealed his hiding-place, Negore was dragged {{forth like a}} rat and brought before Ivan--"Ivan the Terrible" [...] he was known by the men who marched at his back. Negore was armed with a miserable bone-barbed spear, and he kept his <b>rabbit-skin</b> robe wrapped closely about him, and though the day was warm he shivered as with an ague. He shook his head {{that he did not}} {{understand}} the speech Ivan put at him, and made that he was very weary and sick, and wished only to sit down and rest, pointing the while to his stomach in sign of his sickness, and shivering fiercely. But Ivan had with him a man from Pastolik who talked the speech of Negore, and many and vain were the questions they asked him concerning his tribe, till the man from Pastolik, who was called Karduk, said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{played a}} bit in the City, and won at first, and that swelled his head worse than ever. It also brought him a good deal of sympathy from an Italian Countess, the sort you find at Homburg, and that {{generally}} speaking is a widow. Her chief sorrow was for society--that in him was losing an ornament. She explained to him how an accomplished and experienced woman could help a man to gain admittance into the tiptop circles, which, according to her, were just thirsting for him. As a waiter, he had his share of brains, and it's a business that requires more insight than perhaps you'd fancy, if you don't want to waste your time on a <b>rabbit-skin</b> coat and a paste ring, and give the burnt sole to the real gent. But in the hands of this swell mob he was, of course, just the young man from the country; and the end of it was that he played the game down pretty low.|$|E
60|$|It {{was on the}} 2nd of January--exactly a {{month from}} {{the date of the}} fight in which he was wounded--that, after very many thanks to his kind host and hostess, and after forcing a {{handsome}} present upon them, Ralph started--in a peasant's dress which had been bought for him--for Orleans. He had still plenty of money with him; for he had drawn the reward, of fifty thousand francs, in Paris. The greater portion of this money he had paid into the hands of a banker, at Tours, but Percy and he had kept out a hundred pounds each; knowing by experience how useful it is, in case of being taken prisoner, to have plenty of money. Ralph's wound was still bound up with plaster, and to conceal it a <b>rabbit-skin</b> cap with flaps had been bought so that, by letting down the flaps and tying them under the chin, the greater part of the cheeks were covered.|$|E
60|$|He was hurrying {{down one}} of the long, narrow, stone-flagged lanes between the double lines of crouching, disheveled women and of dirty {{children}} who sat on the hollowed steps of the houses, and basked in the autumn sun. At one side was a barrowman with a load of walnuts, and beside the barrow a bedraggled woman with a black fringe and a chequered shawl thrown over her head. She was cracking walnuts and picking them out of the shells, throwing out a remark occasionally to a rough man in a <b>rabbit-skin</b> cap, with straps under the knees of his corduroy trousers, who stood puffing a black clay pipe with his back against the wall. What the cause of the quarrel was, or what sharp sarcasm from the woman's lips pricked suddenly through that thick skin may never be known, but suddenly the man took his pipe in his left hand, leaned forward, and deliberately struck her across the face with his right. It was a slap rather than a blow, but the woman gave a sharp cry and cowered up against the barrow with her hand to her cheek.|$|E
60|$|He set to work. The wall of ice {{was five}} {{feet above the}} ground on which the boat rested. First {{prospecting}} for the best launching-place, he found where a huge cake of ice shelved upward from the river that ran fifteen feet below {{to the top of the}} wall. This was a score of feet away, and at the end of an hour he had managed to get the boat that far. He was sick with nausea from his exertions, and at times it seemed that blindness smote him, for he could not see, his eyes vexed with spots and points of light that were as excruciating as diamond-dust, his heart pounding up in his throat and suffocating him. Elijah betrayed no interest, did not move nor open his eyes; and Daylight fought out his battle alone. At last, falling on his knees from the shock of exertion, he got the boat poised on a secure balance on top the wall. Crawling on hands and knees, he placed in the boat his <b>rabbit-skin</b> robe, the rifle, and the pail. He did not bother with the ax. It meant an additional crawl of twenty feet and back, and if the need for it should arise he well knew he would be past all need.|$|E
60|$|It was {{his first}} offence, {{but when he was}} taken from the lock-up {{at the top of the}} village street to be {{conveyed}} to Salisbury, his friends and neighbours who had gathered at the spot to witness his removal shook their heads and doubted that Ingden would ever see him again. The confession had made the case so simple a one that he had at once been committed to take his trial at the Salisbury Assizes, and as the time was near the constable had been ordered to convey the prisoner to the town himself. Accordingly he engaged old Joe Blaskett, called Daddy in the village, to take them in his pony cart. Daddy did not want the job, but was talked or bullied into it, and there he now sat in his cart, waiting in glum silence for his passengers; a bent old man of eighty, with a lean, grey, bitter face, in his rusty cloak, his old <b>rabbit-skin</b> cap drawn down over his ears, his white disorderly beard scattered over his chest. The constable Lampard was a big, powerful man, with a great round, good-natured face, but just now he had a strong sense of responsibility, and to make sure of not losing his prisoner he handcuffed him before bringing him out and helping him to take his seat on the bottom of the cart. Then he got up himself to his seat by the driver's side; the last good-bye was spoken, the weeping wife being gently led away by her friends, and the cart rattled away down the street. Turning into the Salisbury road it was soon out of sight over the near down, but half an hour later it emerged once more into sight beyond the great dip, and the villagers who had remained standing about at the same spot watched it crawling like a beetle up the long white road on the slope of the vast down beyond.|$|E
6000|$|... "Garn!" [...] growled the rough, {{with the}} deep rasping {{intonation}} of a savage. [...] "Garn out o' this or I'll----" [...] He {{took a step}} forward with uplifted hand, but in an instant down came cut number three upon his wrist, and cut number five across his thigh, and cut number one full {{in the center of his}} <b>rabbit-skin</b> cap. It was not a heavy stick, but it was strong enough to leave a good red weal wherever it fell. The rough yelled with pain, and rushed in, hitting with both hands, and kicking with his ironshod boots, but the Admiral had still a quick foot and a true eye, so that he bounded backwards and sideways, still raining a shower, of blows upon his savage antagonist. Suddenly, however, a pair of arms closed round his neck, and glancing backwards he caught a glimpse of the black coarse fringe of the woman whom he had befriended, [...] "I've got him!" [...] she shrieked. [...] "I'll 'old 'im. Now, Bill, knock the tripe out of him!" [...] Her grip was as strong as a man's, and her wrist pressed like an iron bar upon the Admiral's throat. He made a desperate effort to disengage himself, but the most that he could do was to swing her round, so as to place her between his adversary and himself. As it proved, it was the very best thing that he could have done. The rough, half-blinded and maddened by the blows which he had received, struck out with all his ungainly strength, just as his partner's head swung round in front of him. There was a noise like that of a stone hitting a wall, a deep groan, her grasp relaxed, and she dropped a dead weight upon the pavement, while the Admiral sprang back and raised his stick once more, ready either for attack or defense. Neither were needed, however, for at that moment there was a scattering of the crowd, and two police constables, burly and helmeted, pushed their way through the rabble. At the sight of them the rough took to his heels, and was instantly screened from view by a veil of his friends and neighbors.|$|E
