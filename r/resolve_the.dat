Petitions can also be brought forward by any EU citizen on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities. The Committee on Petitions hears cases, some 1500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen themselves at the Parliament. While the Parliament attempts to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> issue as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if {{it is necessary to}} <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> citizens dispute.|$|E

5|$|By 4 January 1963, the ONUC Air Division had {{conducted}} 76 air sorties, while patrolling by the J-29 jets had cut off Katanga from {{support in}} Angola and Southern Africa.

5|$|During the {{previous}} administration of President Andrew Johnson, Secretary of State Seward attempted to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> Alabama Claims with the Johnson-Clarendon convention and treaty. The Alabama Claims had arisen out of the American Civil War, when Confederate raiding ships built in British ports (most notably the C.S.S.

5|$|From its inception, the {{position}} of Minister of Defence in the government in exile was heavily contested. The appointment of Henri Rolin, an academic, to {{the position}} was particularly resented. In October 1942, Pierlot dismissed Rolin who he accused of involving himself in factional internal politics of the army, parts of which had begun to behave mutinously about their perceived inaction. To <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> deadlock, Pierlot decided {{to take on the}} position personally. He began a major restructuring of the command structure of the infantry in an ultimately successful attempt to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> situation. A minor mutiny among soldiers from an artillery battery was quickly suppressed in November 1942, but Pierlot was widely criticised by the British press during the soldiers' court martial in January 1943.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Earl of Pembroke {{had been}} {{negotiating}} with France to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> long-standing disagreements over {{the administration of}} Gascony, {{and as part of}} this Edward and Isabella agreed to travel to Paris in June 1313 to meet with Philip IV. Edward probably hoped both to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> problems in the south of France and to win Philip's support in the dispute with the barons; for Philip it was an opportunity to impress his son-in-law with his power and wealth. It proved a spectacular visit, including a grand ceremony in which the two kings knighted Philip's sons and 200 other men in Notre Dame, large banquets along the River Seine, and a public declaration that both kings and their queens would join a crusade to the Levant. Philip gave lenient terms for settling the problems in Gascony, and the event was spoiled only by a serious fire in Edward's quarters.|$|E

5|$|The City of Coronado has {{attempted}} to have a tunnel built from the Coronado bridge to the San Diego Naval Base numerous times, and hired Ledford Enterprises {{to help with the}} lobbying process in 2002 and 2006. The city endorsed a proposed study in 2004 to determine possible alternatives to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> traffic issues, which included keeping the status quo. On June 8, 2010, Coronado voters decided against Proposition H, which would have advised the city to undergo further investigation into building a tunnel between the Coronado bridge and the San Diego Naval Base. This concluded ten years of studies and proposals by the city of Coronado {{to find a way to}} reduce traffic to the naval station during rush hour. Critics of the proposal did not believe that the tunnel would <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> traffic issues. Following this, the Coronado City Council voted to abolish the Tunnel Commission.|$|E
