5|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} {{represent}} a commodity of growing importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oxidation <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E

5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of the Great Powers. The muted <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene.

The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the very}} good <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio audience, a second series was {{commissioned}} before the first had been broadcast. However, journalists were critical of the show, highlighting stylistic similarities to Fawlty Towers.

The second series did not receive a stable broadcast slot, with many episodes aired after 10pm. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated {{that the cause}} of the accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson was critical of the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are often}} {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This ensures that the inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that <b>the</b> {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> action of magnetic fields at body level {{is based on}} <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> unspecific adaptational <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body - stress and anti-stressor reactions; elevated activation, calm activation and training. <b>The</b> character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changes {{in the body and}} its subsystems (reaction pattern) is determined by <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> unspecific adaptational <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body developing under <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> a magnetic field. In <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> stress <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> homeostasis go beyond the norm and protection is interwoven with damage; in anti-stressor unspecific adaptational <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body on training, changes are observed within <b>the</b> lower half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> norm, on calm activation the upper half and with elevated activation are somewhat higher than normal. <b>The</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> on <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> magnetic induction and frequency is periodic: as these parameters change, there is regular repetition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unspecific adaptational <b>reactions</b> at different levels <b>of</b> reactivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. <b>The</b> unspecific adaptational <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body at high reactivity levels (to weak ultralow-frequency magnetic fields) are more favourable, low reactivity levels (strong magnetic fields) have <b>the</b> features <b>of</b> tension and desynchronization. The anti-stressor unspecific adaptational <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, especially activation of high reactivity levels, raise unspecific resistance in contrast to stress, with no elements of damage and no waste of energy and exert an anti-tumour, protective (in relation to toxic preparations and in irradiation) and are rejuvenating effect, promoting self-organization. <b>The</b> patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unspecific adaptational <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body match <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> complex non-equilibrium systems...|$|R
