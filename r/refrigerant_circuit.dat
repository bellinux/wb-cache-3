40|$|Vapour-compression water {{chilling}} machines {{of large}} capacity (megawatts of refrigeration) are extensively utilised for process cooling in the manufacturing, chemical and food industries, and for cooling hot mines. If these machines under-perform, not only may {{the costs of}} consequent losses in production be considerable, but products or working conditions may degrade or become unsafe. Performance monitoring instrumentation, including water flow meters, fitted to machines on site may be infrequently calibrated, though. Therefore, the apparent performance of a machine, indicated by the measurements in its water circuits, should be verified through independent, confirming measurements in its <b>refrigerant</b> <b>circuit.</b> For custom-built machines with screw compressors, though, there is a difficulty with so verifying apparent performance. The oil cooling load of screw compressors is large, and so {{must be taken into}} account in such verification. If the oil is cooled by water, it is easy to measure oil cooling load, but not if the oil is cooled by condensed liquid refrigerant in a thermosyphon ‘loop’, because of the two-phase flow of the refrigerant there. This research report describes a study done on a water chilling machine with a screw compressor, using ammonia as refrigerant, at KDC East Mine, Westonaria, South Africa. This study was of a proposed, alternative way of determining the oil cooling load – by measuring flows and properties in the oil circuit. The oil cooling load so determined could be independently verified by measurements in the water circuit of this machine’s oil-to-water cooler. The chief problem in determining oil cooing load from measurements in the oil circuit is that the ‘oil’ is not pure lubricant, but a solution of oil and refrigerant. Therefore the most accurate available methods of predicting the thermophysical properties of oil-ammonia solutions were identified and employed. The oil cooling load hence determined agreed within 0. 43 per cent with that determined on the water side of the oil cooler. It was hence used to correct the coefficient of performance (COP) calculated from measurements in the machine’s <b>refrigerant</b> <b>circuit.</b> This corrected refrigerant-circuit COP, with the estimate of total mechanical power input to the machine, were then used to indirectly estimate the machine’s water chilling load. This indirectly estimated load compared very closely, within 1. 12 per cent, to the apparent water chilling load determined from the measurements in the machine’s water circuits. It is concluded that in this study, oil cooling load could be determined with satisfactory accuracy from measurements in the oil circuit. Hence, this proposed technique offers promise of being a useful and practicable development, enabling apparent performance of such machines to be more conveniently verified than hitherto...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the results of the study}} to experimentally examine effects of the distribution of refrigerant and air in the evaporator using a conical distributor on system COP and capacity. Several conditions at the distributor inlet are varied including quality, mass flux, and orientation in gravity and the resulting superheat profiles of the evaporator circuit outlets are recorded. To examine possible effect of cone misalignment feeder tubes are switched in several steps and the data shows that there is imbalance in both the evaporator and distributor. It is observed that the imbalanced refrigerant distribution does not change over various operating conditions and is the result of complex interactions between the distributor and the evaporator. Valves are installed on the feeder lines to create an ideal refrigerant distribution, indicated by uniform superheats at the outlets of the evaporator circuits, by adding a pressure drop in order to quantify the reduction in COP and capacity due to imperfect distribution. Using the valves to make the outlet superheat profile uniform improves the system and recovers most of the lost performance. Additionally, the air distribution is made poor by blocking parts of the evaporator face. The impact of air imbalances on system performance is smaller than those of refrigerant. COP declines faster than capacity. Blocking entire <b>refrigerant</b> <b>circuits</b> rapidly deteriorates performance, compared to the same blockage area spread over all circuits.

40|$|Evaporators {{found in}} most HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R {{applications}} use multiple circuits to address the multidimensional optimization problem of cost, capacity, and air-/refrigerant side pressure drop. However, an inherent problem of having multiple <b>refrigerant</b> <b>circuits</b> in evaporators is that maldistribution can occur. This maldistribution can be caused on the refrigerant side by quality and/or mass flow maldistribution at the refrigerant distributor. On the air-side, maldistribution {{can be caused by}} uneven airflow and/or air inlet temperature; on both sides the possibility of uneven fouling exists. To reduce the performance penalties caused by air-side maldistribution, the hybrid control method was used to optimize the refrigerant distribution to individual circuits. The hybrid control uses a primary expansion valve, which provides for most of the pressure drop, and smaller secondary balancing valves, which adjust the individual circuit mass flowrates. This approach was chosen since it is expected that the balancing valves can be manufactured at much lower cost than individual expansion valves for each circuit. In order to assess how severe the influence on maldistribution is, four applications with high potential for air-side maldistribution were selected and investigated experimentally, as well as in simulation studies. ^ Application 1 was a 3 -ton R 404 A walk-in cooler refrigeration system for a storage room with a target temperature of 2 °C (35. 6 °F). It was found that the increasing air-side maldistribution, caused by uneven frost built up over time can lead to severe hunting with liquid overfeed from the evaporator, when using the factory installed thermostatic expansion valve (TXV). An electronic expansion valve (EXV) was used as baseline for the performance evaluations. It was found, that in both the TXV and EXV case, significant refrigerant maldistribution occurred even if the system was tested with no enforced air-side maldistribution.

40|$|Measurements on R 600 a {{refrigerators}} {{have shown}} electricity savings over R 134 a and R 12 up to 20 %. We propose new parameters which are functions of well known refrigerant properties. These parameters show that R 600 a has half the leakage, pressure loss and condenser pressure and double the heat transfer coefcient of R 12 and R 134 a explaining the measurements. Use of R 600 a in small heat pumps and air conditioners is attractive but also requires design changes. 1 Refrigerant History Early refrigerants were toxic or ammable or both. Early refrigerators leaked re-frigerant rapidly, mainly through the seals on the compressor drive shaft, creating a re and health risk. A hermetic motor is sealed inside the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>circuit</b> {{so there is}} no shaft seal to leak. Except for car air-conditioning all small and most large compressors now have hermetic motors minimizing refrigerant risks. Thomas Midgley Jr proposed the use of chlorouorocarbons (CFCs) as refrig-erants in 1930. CFCs have two important advantages as refrigerants, high molec-ular mass and nonammability. Centrifugal compressors are simple, highly ef-cient and easy to drive with hermetic motors but they require refrigerants with high molecular mass to give useful temperature differentials. Centrifugal chillers for air-conditioning large buildings gave CFCs an initial market which could afford their high development cost. Enthusiastic marketing of nonammability allowed rapid expansion of CFC sales in applications where non-toxic but ammable refrigerants were already in use. Everyone was told that ammable refrigerants caused horric res and explo-sions. Ammonia, methyl chloride and hydrocarbons disappeared from domesti...|$|E
40|$|The <b>refrigerant</b> <b>circuits</b> of car {{air-conditioning}} systems are fitted with so-called open type compressors, {{because there is}} only a lip seal preventing the refrigerant from leaking from the compressor housing to the atmosphere. In addition, the cycle uses damping elements between the compressor and the other components on the suction and pressure lines to reduce vibration and noise transfer from the engine to the car body. Both the lip seal and damping elements result in loss of refrigerant as they are made from elastomers and leak with age, and, under high temperature conditions inside the engine room, these elements also allow a relatively high permeation of the refrigerant gas to the atmosphere. With very high refrigerant losses in the older R 12 -cooling cycles and the damage caused by this gas to the ozone layer in the stratosphere, the Montreal protocol phased out this refrigerant and the car industry was forced to revert completely to R 134 a until 1994 / 95. R 134 a has no ozone depletion potential, but it has a direct global warming potential, and, therefore, leakages also have to be minimised. R 134 a has, because of its molecular size, a high permeation potential and, hence, all the refrigerant hoses are lined internally. Unfortunately, these hoses also leak with age and significant refrigerant loss will occur [1] R 134 a can therefore only be viewed as a solution until an alternative refrigerant with no direct global warming potential has been developed. Candidates for new refrigerants are natural substances such as hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide [2]. Unfortunately, both substances have disadvantages and their use is restricted to special cases, for e. g. hydrocarbons are flammable and are not used in car air-conditioners, but in Germany it is used as a refrigerant in household refrigerators with hermetic cycles. What makes the implementation of carbon dioxide (CO 2) difficult are the high system pressures and the low critical point [3]...|$|R
40|$|Introduction This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a case study in which Emerson Climate Technologies’ System Design Simulator, a steady-state system modeling tool, was used to evaluate design options rather than implementing the changes incrementally in a laboratory test and evaluating the results of each change. Simulation software has proven to drastically reduce development time and cost by limiting the need for expensive and time consuming laboratory testing. Three different system types were used in this study to show the capability of the model and identify design options for improving performance. The three system types were: 3 Ton Air Source Heat Pump: It was selected as it is the most common system using conventional round tube finned heat exchangers in indoor and outdoor units. 5 Ton Heat Pump Pool Heater: This unit was selected to show SDS’s ability to model other system types. It uses coaxial heat exchanger in the outdoor unit and round tube finned heat exchanger in the Indoor Unit.. 2. 5 Ton Residential Split System with a Micro Channel Condenser: Unit is equipped with Micro Channel condenser in the outdoor unit whereas the indoor unit has round tube finned heat exchanger. Methodology Several design options that may improve performance were identified for all three systems but only design options for the 13. 7 SEER, 3 ton Heat Pump will be presented, including validation runs for the other two systems. Targeted performance testing was used to validate the modeling tool during the re-design exercise. For simplicity, the following parameters are investigated in this exercise: 1. Optimize refrigerant charge by managing compressor Superheat and Condenser Subcooling) and superheat). 2. Optimize <b>refrigerant</b> <b>circuits</b> in indoor and outdoor coils. 3. Change to higher efficiency fan motors in indoor and outdoor units. 4. Optimizing the air flow rate in indoor and outdoor units. 5. Effect of smaller displacement compressor. 6. Evaluate effect of two-capacity compressor. The overall SEER for the final system configuration was 15. 8 Btu/Wh resulting in gain of about 16 %. Breakdown of gain from each design option will be listed. Using the simulation tool to model the system and analyze numerous design changes eliminated several weeks of laboratory testing and evaluation. While the real cost of engineering time varies by organization, it can safely be shown that there was a significant cost saving associated with using the simulation tool. It also offers opportunity to streamline the product development process and speed of {{the time it takes to}} get new products to market...|$|R
40|$|For an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) unit with a {{vertically}} installed multi-circuit outdoor coil, many parameters would affect system defrosting performance, especially the uneven distribution of <b>refrigerant</b> for each <b>circuit</b> and downwards flowing of melted frost {{due to gravity}} from up circuit(s) to down circuit(s). Currently, the negative effects of melted frost have been demonstrated and quantitatively studied, without however giving a fundamental study on the effects of uneven refrigerant distribution due to gravity and tube internal resistance for an ASHP unit with a vertically installed multi-circuit outdoor coil. Therefore, an experimental study on system defrosting performance when refrigerant was evenly or unevenly distributed into each circuit has been carried out and a comparative and quantitative analysis conducted using the experimental data. In this paper, the negative effects of refrigerant uneven distribution on system defrosting performance were demonstrated and an increase of 6. 9 % in defrosting efficiency when refrigerant evenly distributed, compared with the case of refrigerant unevenly distributed, was reported.
