50|$|Wire {{wrapping}} {{comes from}} the tradition of <b>rope</b> <b>splicing.</b> Early wire wrapping was performed manually; a slow and careful process. Wire wrapping was used for splices and for finishing cable ends in suspension bridge wires and other wire rope rigging, usually with a smaller diameter wire wrapped around a larger wire or bundle of wires. Such techniques were purely mechanical, to add strength or prevent fraying.|$|E
5000|$|In {{nautical}} usage, a cunt splice {{is a type}} of <b>rope</b> <b>splice</b> used to join {{two lines}} in the rigging of ships. Its name has been bowdlerised since at least 1861, and in more recent times it is commonly referred to as a [...] "cut splice".|$|R

5000|$|Modern fids are {{typically}} made of aluminum, steel, or plastic. In addition to holding rope open {{to assist the}} creation of a <b>rope</b> <b>splice,</b> modern push fids have markings for precise measurements in a variety of sizes of rope. The length of these fids is typically 21 or 22 times the diameter of <b>rope</b> to be <b>spliced.</b> A half-inch diameter rope would have any accompanying fid 10.5-11" [...] in length with hash-marks denoting the long and short fid measurements. A short fid is [...] a fid length and a long fid is [...] the overall fid length.|$|R
5000|$|Bell ropes are {{specially}} {{made for}} ringing, {{as they have}} the sally, a woollen grip, woven into the strands, and {{is used for the}} handstroke pull of the bell. The preference is for a natural fibre, formerly Indian hemp, but now mainly flax, as this is kinder on the ringers hands. However, the rope length between the sally and the bell can be a hard-wearing synthetic rope with little stretch, or which has been pre-stretched, to reduce spring. <b>Rope</b> <b>splicing</b> {{plays an important role in}} English style ringing. Judicious splicing can help prolong the life of ropes, as wear tends to occur in specific places, such as at the garter hole, or where passing over the pulley, rather than the whole rope.|$|E
50|$|Picton Castle is {{a working}} tall ship. Sail trainee crew sign {{on with the}} {{knowledge}} that they will be participating fully in ships operations. They stand watch, take turns at the helm, raise the anchor, clean the ship, haul on lines, handle sails, scrub the decks, participate in daily ships maintenance, help in the galley and keep lookout, among other things. The Captain and Mates conduct regular workshops designed to complement daily life on board. Workshops include seamanship, sail handling, sail making, ship maintenance, rigging, wire and <b>rope</b> <b>splicing,</b> knot tying, celestial navigation, plotting and chart work, rules of the road, weather, small boat handling, basic engineer and more. They also conduct regular safety drills onboard so that crew become familiar and comfortable with equipment and safety procedures. These drills include Fire, Man Overboard, and Abandon Ship.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rope</b> <b>splicing</b> in ropework is {{the forming}} of a semi-permanent joint between two ropes or {{two parts of}} the same rope by partly untwisting and then {{interweaving}} their strands. Splices can be used to form a stopper {{at the end of a}} line, to form a loop or an eye in a rope, or for joining two ropes together. Splices are preferred to knotted rope, since while a knot typically reduces the strength by 20-40%, a splice is capable of attaining a rope's full strength. However, splicing usually results in a thickening of the line and, if subsequently removed, leaves a distortion of the rope. Most types of splices are used on 3-strand rope, but some can be done on 12-strand or greater single-braided rope, as well as most double braids.While a spliced 3-strand rope's strands are interwoven to create the splice, a braided rope's splice is constructed by simply pulling the rope into its jacket.|$|E
50|$|In most {{situations}} forming {{loops and}} bends with conventional knots {{is far more}} practical than using <b>rope</b> <b>splices,</b> even though the latter can maintain nearly the rope's full strength. Prudent users allow for a large safety margin in the strength of rope chosen for a task due to the weakening effects of knots, aging, damage, shock loading, etc. The working load limit of a rope is generally specified with a significant safety factor, up to 15:1 for critical applications. For life-threatening applications, other factors come into play.|$|R
5000|$|An {{eye splice}} {{may be used}} to {{terminate}} the loose end of a wire rope when forming a loop. The strands of the end of a wire rope are unwound a certain distance, and plaited back into the wire rope, forming the loop, or an eye, called an eye splice. When this type of <b>rope</b> <b>splice</b> is used specifically on wire rope, it is called a [...] "Molly Hogan", and, by some, a [...] "Dutch" [...] eye instead of a [...] "Flemish" [...] eye.|$|R

He began by helping to lay track at Mine No. 7, then worked at the mine tipple and ran motor. He worked eleven years at Mine No. 7 and went next to Mine No. 5, where he spent ten years, riding <b>rope,</b> <b>splicing</b> rope, and {{operating}} the double-drum hoist. He went next to Mine No. 3, where he ran the electric hoist for one year. After mining coal in Alaska, he returned to Roslyn and worked in Mine No. 9.

5000|$|... {{long splice}} - A splice used to join two rope ends forming one rope {{the length of}} the total of the two <b>ropes.</b> The long <b>splice,</b> unlike most splice types, results in a splice that is only very {{slightly}} thicker than the <b>rope</b> without the <b>splice,</b> but sacrifices some of the strength of the short splice. It does this by replacing two of the strands of each rope end with those from the other, and cutting off some of the extra strands that result. The long splice allows the <b>spliced</b> <b>rope</b> to still fit through the same pulleys, which is necessary in some applications.|$|R
5000|$|... back splice (also {{called an}} end splice) - A splice where {{the strands of}} the end of the <b>rope</b> are <b>spliced</b> {{directly}} back into the end without forming a loop. It is used to finish off the end of the rope to keep it from fraying. The end of the <b>rope</b> with the <b>splice</b> is about twice the thickness of the rest of the rope. With nylon and other plastic materials, the back splice is often no longer used; the rope strands are simply fused together with heat to prevent fraying.|$|R
5000|$|The {{eye splice}} has several advantages. The most notable is the {{permanence}} of the loop. An equally important, but less noted [...] advantage, {{is the lack of}} stress it puts on the <b>rope.</b> <b>Splices</b> average 10-15% of rope strength decay, which is very low compared to even the strongest knots. Literature and reference sources typically attribute only a 5% strength decay for a properly tied splice. Technically, a perfectly tied splice retains 100% of the original strength of the rope, but only a trained professional is considered capable of performing this task. Destructive testing of rope in manufacturing facilities makes use of a professional and spliced eyes for connecting the rope to the testing apparatus.|$|R

40|$|Conveyors are {{prevalent}} in many sectors of industry, especially in mining. Steel-cord rubber belt {{is one of}} the most important parts of a conveyor. Durability of the belt depends mainly on the steel-cord durability. The steel-cord consists of hundred or more steel wire ropes. When a conveyer belt is in use the ropes can be broken or corroded. Besides, <b>rope</b> <b>splice</b> damage is possible. The most of steel cord defects are not visible because of their location inside rubber. Magnetic method of NDT is usual to detect the steel rope brakes inside the belts. But the existing magnetic NDT instruments are rather heavy. The new INTROCON instrument was developed in 2003 - 2004. A scanner with set of eddy current probes installed at the belt under test surface is significantly lighter than magnetic one and can work at the gap up to (10 - 20) mm between them and the belt. The INTROCON was tested at iron and coal pit conveyors. It allows to get, to remember and to display data on steel cord condition in-situ. Using the WINCON soft an operator can get information on <b>rope</b> breaks, corrosion, <b>splice</b> damages and their locations. The INTROCON has been using in mining industry in Russia with high efficiency since 2004...|$|R
5000|$|Marlinspike ( [...] ; {{sometimes}} marlin spike, marlinespike, or the archaic marlingspike/marling-spike) {{is a tool}} used {{in marine}} ropework. Shaped {{in the form of}} a polished metal cone tapered to a rounded or flattened point, they aid in such tasks as unlaying <b>rope</b> for <b>splicing,</b> untying knots, drawing marline tight using a marlinspike hitch, and as a toggle joining ropes under tension in a belaying pin splice.|$|R

50|$|A {{large part}} of American, British, and other {{countries}} who participated in whaling in the 19th century created scrimshaw. Scrimshaw is the practice of drawing on whale teeth {{or other forms of}} ivory with various tools, typically sailor's knives or other sharp instruments. These images were then coated with ink so that the drawing would appear more noticeable on the whale tooth. It is believed that some instruments used by sailors to perform scrimshaw included surgical tools, as with the work done by whaling surgeon William Lewis Roderick. Other forms of ivory included a whale's panbone, walrus ivory, and elephant ivory. Of course, the most common scrimshaw during the whaling period of the 19th century was made from whale parts. Other forms of scrimshaw included whalebone fids (<b>rope</b> <b>splicer),</b> bodkins (needle), swifts (yarn holding equipment) and sailors' canes. The time when most scrimshaw in the 19th century was produced coincided with the heyday of the whaling industry which occurred between 1840-1860. More than 95% of all antique scrimshaw whale teeth known were done by anonymous artists. Some of the better known antique scrimshaw artists include Frederick Myrick and Edward Burdett, who were two of the first scrimshanders to ever sign and date their work. Several museums now house outstanding collections of antique scrimshaw {{and one of the best}} being the New Bedford Whaling Museum in Massachusetts.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} {{the problem of}} ropes joints for {{forestry}} aerial ropeway plants has been studied. The existing legislation defines in way uniform the design criterions related to the ropes in the ropeway sector. Such norm covers all the aspects related to this matter, from the criterions of sizing, to the specifications related to the top connection and to the <b>rope</b> <b>splice,</b> to the check methods and the cut off criterions. Indeed in this study a procedure it {{has been set up}} that allows with a simple algorithm to reach the formulation of the bending maximum stress rising in the joints muffs for line of the ropeway plants. In fact considering the different lines has been possible to obtain four differential equations, with second order, non homogeneous, that have been integrated with the method of the variation of the constants. For them the constants of integration have been determined calculating in correspondence of every section of transition, the deflections and the rotations of the lines that meet in it. In such way making some positions it is possible to obtain a correct formula for this case considered. Such formula is nevertheless interesting because its structure recalls that simpler and summary of Isaachsen and therefore easy results the comparison with it. By mean the computational program FEMLAB has been possible to verify the stress course inside the rope...|$|R

Fourteen different end connections for 14 mm and 16 mm diameter synthetic rope were developed and break tested to determine suitability. Three types of end connections were evaluated: spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. End connections with adhesive had variable strength performance and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware group, the pinned nubbin and knuckle link provided the highest breaking strengths. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long <b>splice,</b> <b>rope</b> clamps, knuckle link, pinned nubbin, and in limited applications, rope clamps. Further research and development is needed on these six concepts with larger sample sizes and under testing and operating varied conditions...|$|R
