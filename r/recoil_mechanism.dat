5|$|The bore {{evacuator}} and the gun's thermal sleeve, {{designed to}} regulate {{the temperature of the}} barrel, are made of glass-reinforced plastic, while the barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life. Originally the gun had an EFC barrel life of ~1,500 rounds, but with recent advances in propellant technology the average life has increased even further. The gun's <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> is composed of two hydraulic retarders and a hydropneumatic assembly.|$|E

50|$|Recoil and counter-recoil were {{controlled}} hydraulically {{by means of}} a piston and spring combination connected to the <b>recoiling</b> <b>mechanism</b> and operating in an oil-filled recuperator cylinder mounted to the stationary trunnion block assembly. The <b>recoiling</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the gun included the tube and tube extension, recuperator piston and piston rod, lock frame assembly, driving spring assemblies, and the breechblock assembly. The nonrecoiling parts included the trunnion block group, the feed box and feeding mechanism, the recuperator cylinder and bushing, the back plate group, and the manual charger assembly.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} American {{self-propelled}} guns produced {{during the early}} World War II period, the prototype was assembled and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The M2 <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{and other parts of}} the M2 howitzer carriage were used in the vehicle mounting. After several tests, the gun carriage proved fragile on bumpy terrain. The problem was corrected by reinforcing the frame, and redesigning the howitzer mount. Demountable headlights were recommended because of the muzzle blast, although they were not available for early production models. Early models had no shield for the howitzer either, but a foldable shield was added during testing. The gun faced forward, like many other half-track models. The total traverse was 40 degrees and the elevation was from −5 to +35 degrees. The armored windshield cover was remounted so it could fold onto the hood. After further testing, it was accepted for production.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{armament}} of the Kongō class {{consisted of}} eight 45-calibre 14-inch guns, mounted in four superfiring twin-gun turrets. The turrets had an elevation capability of 5/+20 degrees except in Kongō whose turrets had a maximum elevation capability of +25 degrees. The shells could be loaded at any angle and the guns had a firing cycle of 30–40 seconds. These guns and their turrets underwent multiple modernizations throughout the ships' careers. During the first {{reconstruction of the}} class during the 1920s, the elevation of the main guns was increased {{to a maximum of}} +33 degrees. The <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to pneumatic system, which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns.|$|E
5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} main engine {{and one of the}} fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint and she had to be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{advance in}} the art of gun laying came with the introduction of the first <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The barrel <b>recoil</b> was absorbed by hydraulic cylinders and then the barrel was returned to its firing position by a spring that had stored some of the recoil energy. This meant the gun {{did not have to be}} repositioned after each time it was fired.|$|R
50|$|The synergy between {{technologies}} {{can also}} affect where battles take place. The arrival of aerial reconnaissance has {{been credited with}} the development of trench warfare, while the combination of high explosives in ammunition and hydraulic <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in artillery, added to aircraft observation, made its subsequent spread necessary, and contributed to the stalemate of WW1. The proliferation of tanks and aircraft changed the dynamics again in WW2.|$|R

25|$|The Type 94 75mm {{mountain}} gun had a single-piece {{gun barrel}} with a sliding breechblock based on German Krupp designs, {{and a long}} split-trail carriage with a hydro-pneumatic <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> based on French Schneider designs. The crew was partially protected by a gun shield made of 1/8-inch (3mm) thick armor plate.|$|E
25|$|U-11 - A {{gun with}} {{identical}} ballistics, but {{equipped with a}} more compact <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> for easier mounting in vehicles. It was tried on the experimental SU-122M and rejected due to insufficient reliability. A variant of the same gun was also mounted on the experimental Obiekt 234 tank, also known as Iosif Stalin no. 2 (not {{to be confused with}} the IS-2).|$|E
25|$|Almost {{from the}} beginning, the army wanted more range than the 10cm NbW 35's , but troop trials of two prototypes didn't take place until May, 1940. Neither was entirely satisfactory, {{but the best}} {{features}} of both were incorporated into the 10cm Nebelwerfer 40. This was a very advanced breech-loading weapon with a <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> and an integral wheeled carriage. It had twice the range of its predecessor, but was eight times the weight and cost nearly ten times as much: 1,500 RM vs 14,000 RM.|$|E
50|$|The metal tubes for {{the barrels}} and gun cradles were {{purchased}} from {{firms in the}} United Kingdom, including Sheffield Forgemasters of South Yorkshire, and Walter Somers of Halesowen. Other components, such as breeches and <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> were ordered from firms in Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy. Baby Babylon was completed, and test shots were fired from it, revealing problems with the seals between the barrel segments. However, as those were being worked on, Bull was assassinated in March 1990, possibly by Mossad, halting the project.|$|R
50|$|After {{a period}} of service, {{ordnance}} personnel began to receive BARs with inoperable or malfunctioning <b>recoil</b> buffer <b>mechanisms.</b> This was eventually traced to the soldier's common practice of cleaning the BAR in a vertical position with {{the butt of the}} weapon on the ground, allowing cleaning fluid and burned powder to collect in the <b>recoil</b> buffer <b>mechanism.</b> Additionally, unlike the M1 rifle, the BAR's gas cylinder was never changed to stainless steel. Consequently, the gas cylinder frequently rusted solid from the use of corrosive-primered M2 service ammunition in a humid environment when not stripped and cleaned on a daily basis. While not without design flaws (a thin-diameter, fixed barrel that quickly overheated, limited magazine capacity, complex field-strip/cleaning procedure, unreliable <b>recoil</b> buffer <b>mechanism,</b> a gas cylinder assembly made of corrosion-prone metals, and many small internal parts), the BAR proved rugged and reliable enough when regularly field-stripped and cleaned.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{when one}} of the Zairian Army's North Korean 130mm guns which could shoot the {{distance}} was fired for the first time, the breech exploded, killing the Zairian lieutenant commanding the two guns; his men refused to fire the other gun after that. The Zairian gun crew was so incompetent that they had forgotten to charge the artillery pieces' <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanisms</b> with lubricant, which caused the gun's breech to erupt on the first firing. Additionally, the guns' firing tables were in Korean and could not be read or used by the guns' French-speaking Zairian crew.|$|R
25|$|The Brandt Mle CM60A1, {{also known}} as the Brandt HB 60LP, MCB-60 HB, or simply as the Brandt 60mm LP Gun-Mortar, is a 60mm (2.36 in.) gun-mortar. Unlike {{conventional}} infantry mortars, it was not designed to be mounted on a bipod and a baseplate, but rather in the turrets of armoured fighting vehicles. The CM60A1 could be fired at a very low angle of elevation, giving it the dual purpose of direct fire artillery. Its hydraulic <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> reduces peak loads, allowing it to be mounted in very light armoured cars such as the Panhard AML-60 or wheeled armoured personnel carriers like the Panhard M3.|$|E
25|$|Although {{occasionally}} {{mentioned as}} {{a copy of the}} French Schneider et Cie Canon de 75 Mle 1933, this connection is dubious. The Type 95 essentially utilized the Model 38 (improved) weapon with sliding-wedge type breechblock and hydropneumatic <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the split trail carriage used on the Type 90. This hybrid design addressed the issue of the heavy weight of the Type 90, which had created problems with field commanders, as well as the need for a simpler, more rugged design that could be transported by a team of six horses. As with the Type 90, the Type 95 was built in two versions: one with wooden wheels suitable for animal draft, and another with solid rubber tires and a stronger suspension for towing by motor vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The Type 1 47mm AT gun was a {{relative}} modern design {{compared to other}} Japanese Second World war designs, being relatively light and easy to handle. As with many Japanese designs, it had a very low profile and {{was intended to be}} operated from a kneeling or prone position. The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner. The carriage appears to have adopted a number of design features from the Soviet ZIK 45 mm anti-tank gun, a number of examples of which were captured by the Japanese during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) in 1939. It used a semi-automatic breech block with a horizontal sliding wedge. When the gun was fired the spent shell casing was automatically ejected, and upon loading a fresh shell, the breech block closed automatically. A hydrospring <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> was housed under the barrel. The weapon had a split trail which opened to an angle of 60 degrees for firing to improve stability. Transport was by towing behind a truck or horse, via two steel disc wheels fitted with sponge rubber filled tires.|$|E
50|$|The new {{metallurgical}} {{and chemical}} industries had created new firepower that briefly simplified defense before {{new approaches to}} attack evolved. Infantry rifles, rifled artillery and hydraulic <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> zigzag trenches and machine guns, and their application {{had the effect of}} making it difficult or nearly impossible to cross defended ground. The hand grenade, already in existence, though crude, developed rapidly as an aid to attacking trenches. Probably the most important was the introduction of high explosive shells, which dramatically increased the lethality of artillery over the 19th-century equivalents.|$|R
50|$|Established as both {{an arsenal}} and {{a center for}} the {{manufacture}} of leather accoutrements and field gear, today it provides manufacturing, logistics, and base support services for the Armed Forces. The Arsenal is the only active U.S. Army foundry, and manufactures ordnance and equipment, including artillery, gun mounts, <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> small arms, aircraft weapons sub-systems, grenade launchers, weapons simulators, {{and a host of}} associated components. Some of the Arsenal's most successful products include the M198 and M119 towed howitzers, and the M1A1 gun mount. About 250 military personnel and 6,000 civilians work there. The 2000 census population was 145.|$|R
50|$|The French {{artillery}} {{entered the}} war in August 1914 with more than 4,000 Mle 1897 75 mm field guns (1,000 batteries of 4 guns each). Over 17,500 Mle 1897 75 mm field guns were produced during World War I, {{over and above the}} 4,100 French 75s which were already deployed by the French Army in August 1914. All the essential parts, including the gun's barrel and the oleo-pneumatic <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were manufactured by French State arsenals: Puteaux, Bourges, Châtellerault and St Etienne. A truck-mounted anti-aircraft version of the French 75 was assembled by the automobile firm of De Dion-Bouton and adopted in 1913.|$|R
500|$|The {{main battery}} of the Fusō class {{underwent}} multiple modernizations throughout the ships' careers.

The guns had a rate of fire of 1.5–2 rounds per minute and could be loaded at any angle between -3 and +20 degrees. In 1921 the elevation was increased to +30 degrees and then to +43 degrees during their mid-1930s modernization, except for No. 6 turret as its supporting structure could not be lowered. The <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to a pneumatic system, which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns.|$|E

5000|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{designed}} in Schneider's Le Creusot works. It was originally planned to arm {{it with a}} 155 mm gun but a weapon of 194 mm was eventually chosen. A few examples of this SPG were armed with a modified 280 mm siege mortar, this version {{was known as the}} M 280 sur chenilles (literally - [...] "M 280 on tracks"). Both weapons used the same chassis and were powered by a [...] Panhard SUK4 M2 engine. Compared to its contemporary British SPG, the Gun Carrier Mark I, the Canon de 194 was much more advanced; it was driven by only one person, had hydraulic brakes and the gun had automatically adjusting <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and pneumatic recuperators.|$|R
50|$|A {{recoilless}} rifle (RCLR) or recoilless gun {{is a type}} of lightweight tube artillery that is designed to allow some of the propellant gases to escape out the rear of the weapon at the moment of ignition, creating forward thrust that counteracts some of the weapon's recoil. This allows for the elimination of much of the heavy and bulky <b>recoiling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of a conventional cannon while still enabling the unit to fire a powerful projectile. Besides this, the lower pressures involved allow thinner walled and lighter tubes, further lowering the weight of the cannon. Technically, only devices that use a rifled barrel are {{recoilless rifle}}s, while smoothbore variants are recoilless guns. This distinction is often lost, and both are often called recoilless rifles.|$|R
500|$|Witnesses {{believed}} that Cain was incapacitated, but within {{half an hour}} his sight returned. [...] He refused morphia and against all advice returned to the front lines, deciding that he [...] "wasn't wounded enough to stay where [...] was". [...] On the following day his eardrums burst from the constant firing and barrage, but he was content to stuff his ears with bandages and continue fighting. [...] On Sunday 24th, shortly after a truce to allow the evacuation of casualties, Cain was alerted to the approach of a Tiger tank. Together with a Royal Artillery gunner he raced for a 6 pounder anti-tank gun, manoeuvred it into position, fired and disabled the tank. [...] He wanted to continue using the gun, but the <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> was destroyed.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot model}} was {{built at the}} Aberdeen Proving Ground in May 1942. The 57mm Gun M1 was mounted in the M12 <b>recoil</b> <b>mechanism</b> and {{installed}} on a tubular pedestal. The tubular pedestal was soon replaced with a conical structure that was designated the [...] "57mm gun mount T5". The gun on the pilot model had a traverse of 27.5 degrees {{either side of the}} centerline (total of 55 degrees), while having an elevation of +15 to -5 degrees. The short-barrelled (43 caliber) British Mark III 6-pounder gun was installed in the pilot, but the longer-barrelled (50 caliber) 57mm Gun M1 was specified for the production models. The original travel lock – to hold the gun in a fixed position when the vehicle was moving – proved to be unsatisfactory, and was replaced by a travel lock on the front hood.|$|E
500|$|The new tank's {{firepower}} requirements {{were met}} by fitting a British [...] Royal Ordnance L7A1 [...] main gun.

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with online tethered coverage, in which a mobile robot of size D {{is attached to a}} fixed point S by a cable of finite length L. Starting at S, the robot has to cover an unknown planar environment containing obstacles, and return to S with the cable fully retracted. The paper first establishes an optimal off-line tethered coverage methodology, then introduces the TC (Tethered Coverage) algorithm that performs online tethered coverage using position and local obstacle detection sensors. The performance of the TC algorithm is measured by its competitiveness, determined by measuring its total online path length, l, relative to the optimal off-line solution lopt. The paper establishes that the TC algorithm has a competitive performance of l ≤ 2 L lopt.
