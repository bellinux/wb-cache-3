30|$|For retailors, {{although}} {{monthly average}} electricity price forecasting {{can help them}} set the rate plan, the contribution of monthly average price to the retailors is very limited. The reason is as follows. Monthly average price is the load weighted price of system load profile. If the load profiles of the customers of the <b>retailor</b> {{are different from the}} system load profile, the average cost per KWh of the <b>retailor</b> may be different from the monthly average electricity price due to the significant price difference between peak and off-peak hours. Therefore, if a month ahead average daily electricity price profile can be forecasted, retailors can set the month-to-month variable rate plan based on the load profiles of the customers.

30|$|Electricity price {{forecasting}} can {{be categorized}} into short-term and mid-term forecasting. Short-term price forecasting can help market participants determine the day-ahead bid/offer for the wholesale market to maximize the benefit and manage the risks [1]. Mid-term monthly average electricity price forecasting (e.g., month ahead) is essential in guiding the participants over mid- and long-term time scales. In retail markets, the month-to-month variable rate plan is prevalent. The retail rate varies from month to month based on the market price and <b>retailors</b> usually issue the retail rate for next month one month ahead of time. In this sense, mid-term price forecasting will be helpful for <b>retailors.</b> In addition, mid-long-term price forecasting can provide price signals for generation expansion.|$|R

Emission of GHG was estimate using life cycle assessment with kg of milk and kg of energy corrected milk (ECM) delivered to the dairy factory, and kg of cheese at the <b>retailor</b> level in Denmark as functional units. Allocation at farm gate, between milk and meat, was made by biological relation between energy requirement to milk and meat production or economic allocation and at the dairy between cheese and whey using either economic allocation or system expansion. Inventory data was based on farm, herd and plant production data from commercial farms participation in on farm research activities with controlled production of hay, in combination with production information from cheese processing and literature estimates, all build into a static model. There was no effect of proportion of herbs in the hay on the emission of GHG, but an effect of breed. The emission per kg cheese was lowest from Jersey, 9. 88 kg CO 2 eq. per kg cheese, compared to 12. 1 and 12. 7 from two Holstein herds, although the emission per kg ECM at farm gate was highest from Jersey, but this was more than offset by higher utilization of Jersey milk for cheese. The emission from farm to <b>retailor</b> was below 10 % of the total emission, with the largest contribution from use of energy during manufacturing at the dairy, including storage. Methane with approximately 50 % of all emission was the major source, followed by emission associated to production of feed and rising of heifers. Use of energy for hay drying adds 7 - 8 % to the emission and soil carbon change in average 3 %, with some variation between farms. The sensitivity analysis showed a potential 6 - 7 % lower emission of methane due to the increased amount of herbs, while a higher amount of roots due to herbs only has marginal effect on soil carbon at product level.

40|$|In UNDP (2008) the UN Commission on the Private Sector and Development {{stresses}} the importance to develop the private sector within the African agricultural sector as a mean in succeeding to reach the Millenium Development Goals. Since the 90 s the number of larger agri-businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa has increased. When an agribusiness establishes in a developing area, it can be mutually beneficial both for the profit {{of the company and}} for the economy of the developing area. However, it can also pose a threat to local small-scale farmers since, as Vorley et al. (2009) points out, for an agribusiness to collaborate with small-scale farmers in comparison with large-scale farmers, involve larger transaction costs. Hall (2012) mentions that there is an increased presence of both South African agribusinesses and large-scale farmers elsewhere in Africa. Consequently, South African agribusinesses choice to either collaborate with small-scale farmers or not, affects people across the continent. The present study considers that to include small-scale farmers in the value chain can be a corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy for large South African agribusinesses. The strategy is a potential method for the agribusinesses to surpass the transaction costs of selecting to collaborate with small-scale farmers compared to large-scale farmers. Buhr & Grafström (2007) finds few previous studies that look at media’s influence in how firms’ managements develop CSR-programs. Yet Alvarez et al. (2005) reflects that newspapers, magazines, businesses’ websites and televised business programs are important sources of information for business managements. The aim of the present study is to specifically address what role South African media play in creating a social expectation on South African agribusinesses to include small-scale farmers in their values chain, as a part of their CSR program. If a relationship exists it indicates that stakeholders who want to empower small-scale farmers can use media to demand more CSR from agribusinesses, to increase the companies’ efforts to include small-scale farmers in their value chain. The theoretical framework of the study constitutes of economies of scale, transaction economics and product differentiation. The topic is approached by a quantitative media discourse analysis, studying the sustainability reporting of 19 different South African agribusinesses and 18 newspapers during the years 2008 - 2012, to see to what extent the topic of the exclusion or inclusion of small-scale farmers is reported in the documents. In order to establish a relationship, the result from the media collection is regressed on the result from the sustainability reporting. The data is regressed using first a panel data approach and then a time series analysis. The study establishes that a causal relationship exists, where media explains the change in sustainability reporting on the topic. However, the characteristic of the relationship, whether it is positive or negative, depends on the level and the time aspect. On an aggregate level and with an instantaneous time aspect, the relationship is found to be positive. Yet, on an individual business’ level, with a six to four months’ time lag, the relationship is found to be negativeThere are some additional findings from the study. South African companies that are subsidiaries of global companies are more likely to report on the CSR-topic. No such conclusion can be drawn that <b>retailor</b> are more likely to address the issue compared to other agribusiness, even though they have direct contact with the final consumer in the value chain. The year 2011 is found to {{have a negative impact on}} the CSR-reporting on the topic. Possible explanations can be that the ongoing food crises lead to a decrease in the demand for CSR-product, since CSR-products can be considered to be normal goods, meaning that the agribusinesses had little economic incentive to provide them...|$|E

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 (GYP) are {{a family}} of membrane-bound enzymes which form a {{component}} of the mixed function oxidase (MFO) system and are involved in the metabolism of many endogenous and exogenous compounds and, as such, play key roles in many physiological, pharmacological and toxicological processes. Due to the diversity of their substrates, it is essential to gain an understanding of how their activities can be modulated. The membrane lipid environment of CYP isoforms has proved to be an essential component for their optimal activities and consequently investigations into this aspect of modulation are fundamental to many areas of research. The work described in this thesis investigates 3 methods for the modulation of hepatic microsomal membrane lipids in order to relate 3 components of the lipid bilayer to the associated GYP isoform activities. The effect of incubating post-mitochondrial fractions with a range of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) concentrations at 37 °G on 4 CYP-catalysed reactions during microsomal fraction preparation was examined. The size of the membrane free fatty acid (FFA) pool was found to increase substantially following PLA 2 treatment, and the main hydrolysis product was revealed to be arachidonate. Although the bulk fluidity of the membrane was unchanged at specific PLA 2 concentrations, differential sensitivities of the GYP isoforms were observed at these concentrations. By assaying the activity of the NADPH-P 450 reductase component of the MFO independently, in addition to using an oxygen surrogate to by-pass the reductase enzyme, it was concluded that it was specifically the GYP proteins that were susceptible to the membrane modulation which consequently lead to the observed decreases in the rates of reaction. The subsequent removal of the FFA pool with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was found not to restore the GYP isoform activities. It has been suggested that the inhibitory effect of FFAs may be due to conformational changes in the lipid environment of the isozymes. Also, hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids by PLA 2 activity results in the formation of FFAs and Iysophospholipids, both of which can affect substrate partitioning within a membrane. Thus, the remaining lysophospholipids following BSA treatment {{may have contributed to the}} decreased activities of the GYP isoforms. A range of PLA 2 concentrations at the lower incubation temperatures of 10 °G and 20 °C were used to <b>retailor</b> microsomal lipids in order to investigate the possibility that the GYP activities were associated with specific lipid domains. As with the 37 °G incubation, the main hydrolysis product within the FFA pool was found to be arachidonate. Although arachidonate release was not significantly affected at any of the incubation temperatures, the activities of individual GYP isoforms were significantly decreased with increases in incubation temperature at specific PLA 2 concentrations. Kinetic studies suggested that PLA 2 treatment of the microsomal membrane modulated CYP activity through the hydrolysis of associated lipid domains, and not by competitive inhibition by the endogenously released arachidonate. In an attempt to elucidate it microsomal membrane fatty acid saturation affected the activities of associated CYP isoforms, a preliminary study was conducted in which membrane lipid species were chemically modified by the use of catalytic hydrogenation. Membrane fractions were successfully hydrogenated, particularly long-chain fatty acids such asarachidonate. The activities of those CYP isoforms investigated were modulated to varying degrees upon hydrogenation of the membrane environment. It was concluded that the use of such catalysts should provide a suitable system for investigations fatty acid unsaturation and CYP activities. Finally, as phosphatidylcholine (PC) has been shown to be important for certain CYP isoform activities, a preliminary study was carried out to determine the effect of the biosynthetic pathway for PC synthesis on mouse hepatic MFO activity. Using microsomal fractions obtained from a transgenic strain in which one of the pathways for PC synthesis was absent, it was found that the PC fatty acid profile was changed compared to that of the wildype fractions. Additionally, the activities of certain CYP isoforms were affected by the biosynthetic origin of PC synthesis. This sensitivity of specific isozymes to the PC biosynthetic pathway may have also been sex-dependent. The work described in this thesis suggests several strategies which could be exploited further to refine and improve experimental studies of CYP isoforms. The results obtained support the concept that the membrane composition and environment of CYP isoforms differentially affects their activities. Due to the complexity of these remarkable biochemical systems, further studies are clearly required to define the membrane properties involved in the modulation of CYP activity...|$|E

40|$|Personal {{behavior}} {{accounts for}} much of the risk associated with chronic disease, thereby providing incentive for development of interventions that offer effective prevention on a large scale. Computer tailored interventions have become increasingly common for facilitating behavior change for a number of health concerns associated with chronic disease. Systematic reviews of tailoring have been completed but a sufficient number of outcomes are now available to facilitate the quantitative analysis of overall effect sizes for this type of intervention. The present study employs meta-analytic techniques to assess the mean effect for tailored interventions focusing on four health behaviors: smoking cessation, increase in physical activity, eating a healthy diet, and receiving regular mammography screening. Clinically and statistically significant overall effect sizes were found across each of the four behaviors. <b>Retailored</b> interventions were found to have increased efficacy over tailored interventions based on one assessment only. The addition of counselor calls to the feedback produced greater effects initially, but these were not sustained over time when compared to <b>retailored</b> interventions. A nonsignificant trend was found for effect sizes decreasing over time, with the most significant drops after six months post-intervention. Mean effects did not differ by recruitment strategy and differences by theory or study group could not be adequately assessed due to sample size. Gender was the only demographic predictor associated with effect size. This analysis quantifies the effect of tailored interventions, demonstrating the ability to reach large numbers of people with effective techniques that promise to reduce chronic disease burden if implemented consistently. ...|$|R

Sea food industry provides jobs for commercial fishers, wholesaler and <b>retailors.</b> The rapidly increasing use of pesticides in agriculture, poses serious danger, both to the public health, fisheries and aquatic ecosystem. Pesticides enter in aquatic ecosystem causes undesirable loss {{in the form of}} pathology or mortality of aquatic animals, which causes decline of aquatic micro-organisms, fish and other aquatic species, like prawns, frogs, turtles, muscles, water birds etc. These aquatic animals are main source of natural food chains. If flesh of these insecticides accumulated animals, eaten by other animals and by men, are also affected by these pesticides. Pesticides must be used with great care, so that the health of humans, animals and the environment are protected. Disadvantages of pesticides include their toxicity to some humans, animals and useful plants, and the persistence (long life) of some of these chemicals in the environment, which causes serious hazard both to the public health and the environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of long-chain polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (LC-PUFA) provides an intriguing example on how multi-enzymatic cascades evolve. Essential LC-PUFA, such as arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA), can be acquired from the diet {{but are also}} endogenously <b>retailored</b> from C 18 precursors through consecutive elongations and desaturations catalyzed, respectively, by fatty acyl elongase and desaturase enzymes. The molecular wiring of this enzymatic pathway de nes {{the ability of a}} species to biosynthesize LC-PUFA. Exactly when and how in animal evolution a functional LC-PUFA pathway emerged is still elusive. Here we examine key components of the LC-PUFA cascade, the Elovl 2 /Elovl 5 elongases, from amphioxus, an invertebrate chordate, the sea lamprey, a representative of agnathans, and the elephant shark, a basal jawed vertebrate. We show that Elovl 2 and Elovl 5 emerged from genome duplications in vertebrate ancestry. The single Elovl 2 / 5 from amphioxus e ciently elongates C 18 and C 20 and, to a marked lesser extent, C 22 LC-PUFA. Lamprey is incapable of elongating C 22 substrates. The elephant shark Elovl 2 showed that the ability to e ciently elongate C 22 PUFA and thus to synthesize DHA through the Sprecher pathway, emerged in the jawed vertebrate ancestor. Our ndings illustrate how non-integrated “metabolic islands” evolve into fully wired pathways upon duplication and neofunctionalization...|$|R
