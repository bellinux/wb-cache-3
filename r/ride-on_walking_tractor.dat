40|$|Brazilian {{family farming}} has at its {{disposal}} planters whose furrowing mechanisms, whether disc or shank, require a large vertical force. In smaller planters, this is reflected in low efficiency when opening the furrow or in a high demand for mass (weight). Rotary furrowers require less vertical force for the same operation. This study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility and performance of rotary furrowers mounted on the powertrain of a <b>walking</b> <b>tractor</b> working under direct seeding, and compare them with shank-type furrowers using bibliographic data. The parameters used in the comparison were the depth and width of the furrow, the area of disturbed soil and the cross-sectional area of the furrow with no soil after the operation. The experiment was carried out on wheat stubble that had lain fallow for six months. Twelve treatments were employed in a factorial design: three models of rotary furrowers, two values for revolutions per unit of linear displacement, and two forward speeds. The variable, cross-sectional area of the furrow with no soil, was statistically affected only by the factor, furrower. However there was significant interaction between the factors, furrower, revolutions per metre and speed, for the variables of depth, furrow width and area of disturbed soil. The values obtained for the variables of width, depth and disturbed area in the cross-section of the furrows, with {{the three types of}} rotary furrowers driven by the powertrain of a <b>walking</b> <b>tractor,</b> were similar to those generated by shank-type furrowers...|$|R

50|$|The Garden King Model W was {{introduced}} {{as a high}} crop walkbehind garden tractor but sometime in 1947 or 1948 the tractor was also available in a lower stance version. This new design came equipped with a new type ratchet differential drive based on the original Model W differential. By 1950 the tractor had {{become known as the}} Model G. To steer this type of tractor, the operator did not have to overcome the power in the drive wheels because of the differential design. When the clutch is disengaged the tractor can be easily moved in forward or backward motion. According to a 1950 magazine advertisement, the Model-G <b>walking</b> <b>tractor</b> had a list price of $175.00.|$|R

These are also known as power tillers or <b>walking</b> <b>tractors.</b> Years ago they were considered only useful for rice growing areas, where they were fitted with steel cage-wheels for traction, but now the same are being used in both wetland and dryland farming all over the world. They have multiple functions with related tools for dryland or paddys, pumping, transportation, threshing, ditching, spraying pesticide. They can be used on hills, mountains, in greenhouses and orchards. Diesel designs are more popular in developing countries than gasoline.|$|R
50|$|Two-wheel <b>tractor</b> or <b>walking</b> <b>tractor</b> motoculteur Einachsschlepper oder Bodenfr√§se are generic terms {{understood}} in the USA and in parts of Europe to represent a single-axle tractor, which is a tractor with one axle, self-powered and self-propelled, which can pull and power various farm implements such as a trailer, cultivator or harrow, a plough, or various seeders and harvesters. The operator usually walks behind it or rides the implement being towed. Similar terms are mistakenly applied to the household rotary tiller or power tiller; although these may be wheeled and/or self-propelled, they are not tailored for towing implements. A two-wheeled tractor specializes in pulling any of numerous types of implements, whereas rotary tillers specialize in soil tillage with their dedicated digging tools. This article concerns two-wheeled tractors as distinguished from such tillers.|$|R

The research and extension projects came {{in response to}} a renewed interest in rural mechanization, which for decades has received little attention in international development. The projects aimed at strengthening equity of access, poverty reduction and gender orientation in current rural mechanization processes in Nepal and South Asia. Specifically, the projects promoted machine-based resource conservation and drudgery reduction technologies in tillage and crop establishment among small farmers. The result was a combined participatory action research and extension project in Nepal, where farmers and scientists from CIMMYT and National Agricultural Research Systems worked towards equitable access to new resource conservation technologies. In the Nepal research site, the basic power source for most of the technologies are Chinese power tillers (PTs), which are two-wheel <b>walking</b> <b>tractors</b> with mobile power units.

The Grillo winning idea was to detach the motorized tractor from the attachments. It became possible to fit tines, ploughs, and trailers, and via fitting a water pump {{it was possible to}} irrigate. In 1955 the factory started the first series production of 15 different models per year. In 1957 [...] "Grillo" [...] became the name of the factory (formerly Pinza) and a brand. In the late 1960s, Grillo formed a technology-sharing venture with the Italian manufacturer BCS, with the goal of expanding their versatility in implement types to include mowing and other front-PTO applications. The two companies worked together until the early 1980s. In the 1980s the company experienced a considerable growth in garden machines, and also in lawn-care equipment; In that decade the Grillo research and development department created the first Italian lawnmower with a double hydrostatic system. Today thousands of machines are sold throughout the world annually. The name [...] "Grillo" [...] means [...] "Cricket" [...] in Italian.|$|R

A 12 hp power tiller, {{commonly known as the}} <b>walking</b> two wheel <b>tractor</b> is used as the test platform after after introducing electrical actuators for its remote and autonomous operation. The mathematical model of the power tiller has been developed and simulated in MatLab SImulink. A vision based outdoor localization system is developed using off-the-shelf electronic components, and its accuracy has been verified in small agricultural fields. Visual odometry using a downward faced camera is tested with better resolution for relative localization, and popular visual odometry algorithms were tested for speed and accuracy in agricultural fields. A stereo vision based range measurement system has also been developed and field tested as an absolute localization system that can bound the incremental error caused by the visual odometry system. The extended Kalman filter with measurement gaiting has been implemented using both visual odometry and stereo range measurement data. Experimental results verified that the proposed system as an effective low cost technique for outdoor localization of field robots in small agricultural fields...|$|R
40|$|Low Power Mechanisation and Small-scale Vegetable Production in the Tunisian Sahel Region. Part 1 : Inquiry. In this study, it was {{investigated}} {{to what extent}} low power mechanisation could be introduced in vegetable production in the Tunisian Sahel region {{by means of an}} inquiry held among local vegetable growers and at the mechanisation market. Data were collected as to acquire precise information on exploitation characteristics (number and area of the parcels, crops grown, adopted mechanisation, etc.) and on equipment available at the local market (type, power, etc.). The results demonstrated the predominance of small exploitations, which mainly consist of two separate parcels on which several crops are grown. Most exploitations were managed by young and well experienced farmers. Only soil preparation was found to be entirely mechanised. Mechanisation was mainly based on relatively large and high power tractors (typically more than 50 kW). The local machinery market of low power mechanisation was found to offer 5 to 7 kW motor hoes, 6 to 10. 5 kW <b>walking</b> (two wheel) <b>tractors</b> and two types of small (four wheel) tractors of 12 and 16 kW.
