40|$|Accurate clock {{synchronization}} {{is essential in}} the operation of networks. In applications in which it can be performed frequently, the process generally relies upon the estimation of the <b>relative</b> <b>offset</b> of two different clocks. However, due to limited power resources in Wireless Sensor Networks, it cannot be performed often. Thus in order to obtain a longer lasting synchronization, the relative frequency of two clocks is also estimated. In the literature, there are estimators for <b>relative</b> <b>offset</b> and frequency based on a variety of techniques including graphical methods, maximum likelihood estimation, and least squares estimation. However, there has been no extensive study to compare the performance of these estimators. In this dissertation, the existing estimators are examined in detail and several alternative least squares-based estimators are developed and compared with the existing estimators in an exhaustive study. Although there is a large literature on estimating <b>relative</b> <b>offset</b> and frequency, there is little to no research regarding inference. This topic is of potentially great importance because it may possibly lead to limiting unneeded synchronization, resulting in better conservation of network power resources. Recent work has focused on the construction of confidence intervals for <b>relative</b> <b>offset</b> and while it does not address relative frequency, it is an important first step towards developing procedures that do. In this work, it has been assumed that the network delays that occur during the synchronization process are independent, but this may not be appropriate in all applications. The network delays are often modeled as independent exponential random variables. Thus to improve upon the existing confidence interval methodology, in this dissertation the use of bivariate exponential distributions is introduced to capture the anticipated correlation between the network delays. Moreover, an alternative confidence interval procedure for offset is developed and is then used to illustrate how the assumption of independent network delays can potentially lead to improper inference about <b>relative</b> <b>offset...</b>|$|E

40|$|Two {{lightning}} detectors, of {{the magnetic}} direction finder type, form part of a two station system for determining the position of lightning strikes. The detectors are on a baseline of approximately 600 m, and the ultimate aim {{of the system is}} to accurately detect and map lightning within a radius of 30 km. Although no real time capability is present, the archive data collected from each separate station is used to find the offset errors in the azimuthal orientation, as well as in time (using processes described in Appendix A). The <b>relative</b> <b>offset</b> errors are determined by shifting the time and azimuthal information for one station’s data and calculating the maximum possible matching records (within certain time and azimuth criteria) for each incremental shift. An analysis of the peaks in total matching records, when plotted against the relevant shift increments, is performed in order to obtain the values of the offset errors. Between the two individual stations, the <b>relative</b> <b>offset</b> in orientation is found to be 24. 5 degrees, and in time to be 0. 001305 days (112. 75 seconds). The individual stations, as well as the triangulated data calculated from matching records, can also be calibrated using data from the South African Weather Service Lightning Detection Network (SAWSLDN). Individual station calibration indicated an offset of + 6. 4 degrees and 0. 00575 days (496. 8 seconds) for Station 1, with the offsets for Station 2 determined as + 29. 4 degrees and − 0. 000105 days (9. 07 seconds). Comparison of triangulated data to SAWSLDN data yields unexpected results with regard to resultant shifts, which may point to an error or anomaly in the triangulation calculations.

This issue has gained increasing importance with the emergence of new resource constrained networks such as wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a new distributed clock synchronization algorithm, referred to as Weighted Consensus Clock Synchronization (WCCS), whose objective is to achieve a consensus clock among network nodes. In this distributed approach and in contrast to centralized schemes, each node periodically exchanges the local clock reading with its immediate neighbor nodes. Then, each node employs these time informations to calculate its <b>relative</b> <b>offset</b> and skew with respect to its neighbor nodes using a weighted average consensus based technique.

40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} {{the relative importance}} of local feature and spatial filter models for hyperacuity, vernier thresholds were determined for gratings consisting of a fundamental (Fo) and third harmonic (3 F) presented alone, and added together in compound gratings where the <b>relative</b> phase <b>offsets</b> of 3 F to Fo was 0, 90, 180 and 270 °. Thresholds were determined for a range of spatial frequencies of Fo (0. 5 – 16 c deg− 1) for abutting and non-abutting stimuli. Compound grating vernier performance was found to be: (i) invariant with <b>relative</b> phase <b>offset</b> for the abutting and non-abutting conditions; and (ii) predictable from the vernier thresholds for the individual grating components making up the compound stimulus. The results support a view that supra-threshold components in a multi-frequency stimulus act independently and it is the spatial frequency content, not the local feature characteristics, which limit vernier performance...|$|R
40|$|The design {{luminosity}} of {{the future}} linear colliders requires transverse beam size at the nanometre level at the interaction point (IP), as well as stabilisation of the beams at the sub-nanometre level.
