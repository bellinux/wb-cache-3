25|$|A {{government}} decree of March 1982 {{sought to}} provide greater employment {{security for the}} increasing number of workers on part-time and fixed-term contracts by restricting the circumstances in which employers could use such labour (this was largely to ensure that permanent employees were not displaced by cheaper and more easily dismissed part-time workers). The law set out to ensure that such workers receive the same benefits as full-time workers and trade unions were given statutory rights to institute legal proceedings against employers or temporary work agencies if the provisions of the new law were evaded. That same year, the government passed legislation to ensure the full, legal eligibility of women for all civil service posts and an active policy was adopted to encourage them to come forward for promotion. In 1981, legislation was passed which permitted the establishment of local private radio stations. In March 1982, a “Special Statute” was granted to Corsica, which set the territory apart legally from other regions and provided it with additional state subsidies and greater autonomy over cultural, social, economic, and educational policies. Various measures were also introduced to improve conditions for migrants. A new drive began in 1981 to encourage local authorities to establish programmes including literacy programmes, housing schemes, and the setting up of young people’s and women’s groups, and in 1983 France ratified the Council of Europe’s Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers. The Association Law of 1981 allowed foreigners {{for the first time to}} form associations in France under the same rules that governed citizens, and these new immigrant associations were thereafter eligible to receive public funding. New policies removed the French language requirements of immigrants to run for seats in employee institutions, and foreign workers became eligible for the first time to sit on important industrial relations councils known as the Conseils des Prud’hommes. In 1982, an existing programme to assist the repatriation of Algerian nationals was replaced by a system offering a choice between vocational training, assistance to set up a small business and a <b>repatriation</b> <b>grant.</b>|$|E

50|$|UN General Clark {{received}} new instructions. Accordingly, all POWs were to {{be handed}} over to the commission and allowed a 90- or 120-day period during which the non-repatriates {{were to be}} convinced to return home. After that the remaining men would either be given civilian status or their futures would be decided by the UN General Assembly. Also the commission were to decide all disputes by voting and to favour a simple majority. It was decided that the commission would provide for 120 days of custody. After that the POWs who refused <b>repatriation</b> would be <b>granted</b> civilian status.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the hunger}} strike that {{resulted}} in the death of Michael Gaughan, the Price sisters, Feeney and Kelly were <b>granted</b> <b>repatriation</b> to Ireland. Stagg was denied repatriation, and was transferred to Long Lartin Prison. During his time there he was subject to solitary confinement for refusing to do prison work and was also subjected, along with his wife and sisters during visits, to humiliating body searches. In protest against this he began a second hunger strike that lasted for thirty-four days. This ended when the prison governor agreed to an end to the strip-searches on Stagg and his visitors. Stagg was bed-ridden {{for the rest of his}} incarceration in Long Lartin, due to a kidney complaint.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the claim that}} the Cyrus cylinder was the ‘first declaration of human rights’, a claim that was actively promoted by the former Shah of Iran and later by several organizations in the West that promote Iranian heritage. Also the present government of Iran is interested in the cylinder and had it exhibited in Teheran in 2010 - 1, after a diplomatic row about the right to borrow the object from the British Museum. The misuse of the cylinder has gone so far, that a fake translation has appeared on the internet that is quoted widely. We see the claim also in adverts announcing the recent exhibit of the cylinder in the USA and in various scholarly works. The cylinder, however, {{is nothing more than a}} document in which Cyrus justifies his conquest of Babylon by seeking the support of the local god, Marduk, and by <b>granting</b> <b>repatriation</b> of abducted gods and people from Mesopotamia and the eastern plain of the Tigris; a policy that was not new. The article also explores the image of Cyrus in the Greek world and the Hebrew Bible. A new translation of the cylinder is provided...|$|R
5000|$|While {{completing}} her dissertation, Sullivan {{worked for}} the Dickson Mounds branch of the Illinois State Museum and subsequently received a job with Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. White a doctoral student, she had previously worked for SIU as a project director for CRM projects. Sullivan was the University's first non-graduate to serve as curator of the Center for Archaeological Investigation's collections. Following her job at Southern Illinois, Sullivan became the first female Curator of Anthropology at the New York State Museum in Albany, New York. During her thirteen-year-long employment at that museum, Sullivan {{played a major role}} in the renovation and reorganization of the Museum's vast archaeological collections. She obtained two National Science Foundation Systematic Anthropological Collections grants to do the first comprehensive inventory and records organization of the 150-year-old archaeological collections, as well a national Native American Graves Protection and <b>Repatriation</b> Act <b>grant</b> to do the first ever inventory of the Museum's human osteology collections [...] She also began field schools at the Ripley site, a late prehistoric and proto-historic site in western New York which had been partially excavated by Arthur C. Parker in the early twentieth century. With colleagues Sarah and Phillip Neusius, she won National Science Foundation funding for that project. While in New York, Sullivan continued her main research interests in the Mississippian Period in eastern Tennessee. She obtained National Science Foundation funding for a pottery seriation project and began a small field school on the Hiwassee Island site with Appalachian State University and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. In 1999, Sullivan left her post in New York and returned to the site of her undergraduate education in order to take the Curator of Archaeology position at the University of Tennessee's McClung Museum. Sullivan has {{worked for the}} University of Tennessee for twelve years, performing duties both in her capacity as Curator of Archaeology and as Adjunct Professor of Anthropology. She is responsible for managing the museum's extensive collections, advising a small group of graduate students, and conducting her own research for publication. Additionally, she served as the first female editor of Southeastern Archaeology, the Southeastern Archaeological Conference's annual journal, as well as chair of the Society for American Archaeology's Committee on Museums, Collections, and Curation.|$|R
