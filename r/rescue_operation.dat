5|$|In June 1976, Amin {{allowed an}} Air France {{airliner}} from Tel Aviv to Paris hijacked by {{two members of}} the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO) and {{two members of the}} German Revolutionäre Zellen to land at Entebbe Airport. The hijackers were joined there by three more. Soon after, 156 non-Jewish hostages who did not hold Israeli passports were released and flown to safety, while 83 Jews and Israeli citizens, as well as 20 others who refused to abandon them (among whom were the captain and crew of the hijacked Air France jet), continued to be held hostage. In the subsequent Israeli <b>rescue</b> <b>operation,</b> codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (popularly known as Operation Entebbe), on the night of 3–4 July 1976, a group of Israeli commandos were flown in from Israel and seized control of Entebbe Airport, freeing nearly all the hostages. Three hostages died during the operation and 10 were wounded; 7 hijackers, about 45 Ugandan soldiers, and 1 Israeli soldier, Yoni Netanyahu, were killed. A fourth hostage, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, an elderly Jewish Englishwoman who had been taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala before the <b>rescue</b> <b>operation,</b> was subsequently murdered in reprisal. The incident further soured Uganda's international relations, leading the United Kingdom to close its High Commission in Uganda.|$|E

5|$|As weather {{conditions}} worsened, Royal Navy destroyers were {{only able to}} rescue 90 survivors from the three German ships. Before the <b>rescue</b> <b>operation</b> was suspended to engage TA 20, Wheatland {{pulled out of the}} sea three officers and 68 seamen—most of them crew of UJ 202. The Kriegsmarine sortied TA 40 and TA 45 corvettes as well as S 33 and S 154 E-boats to look for survivors, finding seventeen TA 20 crew members on the islet of Trstenik on 3 November. The group included seven wounded, tended by a local lighthouse crew. Besides them, the ships rescued one UJ 202 and three UJ 208 crew members from the sea. The deteriorating weather also prevented retrieval of the coast watchers for four days. More than two hundred Germans perished in this action, including the flotilla commander and all three ship commanding officers.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the Commonwealth forces {{after a long}} siege stormed {{and took}} Smolensk in 1611.

Prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin effectively led the Russians, a new <b>rescue</b> <b>operation</b> attempted by Hetman Chodkiewicz had failed and a capitulation of the Polish and Lithuanian forces at the Kremlin terminated in 1612 their involvement there. Mikhail Romanov, son of the imprisoned in Poland (since his rejection of Sigismund III's demand for the Russian throne) Patriarch Filaret, became the new tsar in 1613.|$|E
5|$|Ladd and the {{commander}} of the SOG compound (whose men and camp had been incorporated into the defenses of KSCB) proposed that, if the Marines would provide the helicopters, the SOG reconnaissance men would go in themselves to pick up any survivors. The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to issue an order to Cushman to allow the <b>rescue</b> <b>operation</b> to proceed. It was not until 15:00 hours that the relief effort was launched and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 Americans at the camp, 10 had been killed and 11 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The South Vietnamese M113s had {{no problem}} {{crossing}} the generally shallow streams and rivers typical of the Mekong Delta, but the heavy 10-ton M113s became bogged down in the deeper Cong Ba Ky Canal, forcing the crews and the infantry company on board to cut down brush and trees and fill the canal until it was shallow enough for the M113s to cross. The <b>rescue</b> <b>operation</b> was further delayed when Ba tried to obtain proper authorization to advance, because he was under orders not to take commands directly from the American advisers. Vann, who was flying above the armored formation, demanded that Ba advance immediately. Ba replied {{that he would not}} take instructions from Americans. When Vann threatened to have Ba shot, he reluctantly continued to advance, although very slowly, toward the entrenched Viet Cong.|$|E

A second rescue attempt, Operation Credible Sport, was ordered, and Brown was involved in planning and preparation. The follow-up rescue included U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and Army assets. The Army units involved were the battalions {{that made up the}} 101st Aviation Group: the 158th Aviation Battalion, the 229th Aviation Battalion and the 159th Aviation Battalion. All three battalions formed Task Force 158. President Carter meanwhile appointed the former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral James L.
