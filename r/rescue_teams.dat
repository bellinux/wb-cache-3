5|$|The world responded {{rapidly to}} the {{disaster}} in Leninakan and Spitak, {{with much of}} Europe sending cargo aircraft loaded with medical supplies, rescue equipment, and trained personnel {{to assist in the}} recovery, and even more reinforcement came in from Latin America and the Far East. Mikhail Gorbachev was in New York on his first day of visits with Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush {{at the time of the}} earthquake, and once the scale of the disaster was realized, a quick departure was made back to Armenia, with the Kremlin formally asking for American help. Washington immediately responded with offers of doctors, medical equipment, and <b>rescue</b> <b>teams,</b> and by the first weekend the first US plane arrived in Yerevan with search and <b>rescue</b> <b>teams</b> and detection dogs.|$|E
5|$|Because Armero's {{hospital}} {{was destroyed in}} the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and <b>rescue</b> <b>teams</b> came {{from all over the}} country. Of the 1244 patients spread over the clinics, 150 died from infection or associated complications. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their lacerations been thoroughly cleaned, many of these people could have been saved.|$|E

5|$|Also, {{electrical}} {{lines and}} drinking water supplies were cut in La Paz. Also, communication lines were extensively damaged. The La Paz airport received damage during the hurricane; however, by {{the afternoon of}} October1, the airport re-opened, thus allowing the military to provide much-needed aid to victims. Wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered throughout La Paz. By October 2, <b>rescue</b> <b>teams</b> had covered 38sqmi (100sqkm) to configure the damage. Throughout the city, a total of 412 people had been killed, 150 were missing people within the resort city, five of which were later presumed dead.

5|$|Although it {{was only}} a Category 1 hurricane, Charley caused {{significant}} damage in southern Jamaica. Saint Elizabeth Parish sustained the worst damage. About 750 farmers reported damage, and at one point, flooding isolated 30 families. The only fatality in Jamaica occurred after a man attempted to rescue a family but was swept away by flood waters. Following the storm, search and <b>rescue</b> <b>teams</b> were deployed to flooded regions. Days later, officials allocated roughly $7.6million (JMD; US$86,000) to repair damaged roads. Residents in areas that sustained severe agricultural losses also requested assistance from the government.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{eventually}} estimated at $100million, and many countries {{responded to the}} emergency with donations of blankets, tents, clothing, and food. <b>Rescue</b> <b>teams</b> were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris. The destruction around the earthquake's epicenter was, in places, almost total; this {{has been attributed to}} poor construction practices in rural areas, and imparted momentum to a growing movement for changes in building codes for earthquake-safe buildings. With 1 in 3,000 deaths in Iran attributable to earthquakes, a US geophysicist has suggested that a country-wide rebuilding program would be needed to address the ongoing public safety concerns.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Ismael {{produced}} 30foot (9m) waves {{over the}} Gulf of California and coastal waters off of Mexico. The hurricane, which was forecast {{to move more}} slowly, left hundreds of fisherman unprepared due to deficient communications between the boats and harbor authorities. As a result, 52 boats were wrecked, of which 20 sank. 57 fishermen died offshore, with dozens washing ashore as the high tides receded. About 150 fishermen survived the storm by waiting on islands, sandbars, or disabled fishing boats. Navy <b>rescue</b> <b>teams</b> and other fishermen searched for days off the Mexican coast to find victims and survivors from the storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{tropical}} cyclone watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas, while <b>rescue</b> <b>teams</b> and the U.S. Coast Guard were put on standby.

5|$|Prior {{to moving}} ashore, {{officials}} in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, advised residents in low-lying or flood-prone areas to consider {{moving to a}} safer location. A shelter was opened in Lake Charles, where 29people stayed during the storm. Flood watches and warnings were issued for portions of Mississippi and Louisiana as the storm tracked across the region. Texas Governor Rick Perry, prepared state resources for the potentially impacted areas, including the deployment of 200 Texas Military Forces soldiers and six Black Hawk helicopters and two water <b>rescue</b> <b>teams</b> for search and rescue missions. The Texas State Operations Center was activated shortly after the cyclone developed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the storm, the National Park Service closed visitor centers and campgrounds along the Outer Banks. For about 12hours, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was closed. North Carolina Governor Mike Easley put <b>rescue</b> <b>teams</b> and the National Guard on standby. Residents and {{tourists}} were advised to secure loose objects, and to remain indoors. As the storm's effects were expected to be minor, no evacuations were ordered. On Ocracoke Island, boats were hauled out. The threat of the storm forced the cancellation of a fishing tournament at Atlantic Beach, which resulted in effects to the local economy.|$|E
5|$|Roads in Saint Elizabeth {{sustained}} substantial damage, with 32 separate roads experiencing severe impacts. Throughout the country, a {{total of}} $7.6million (JMD; US$86,000) was provided to repair the roads, $4.23million (JMD; US$48,000) of which was used in Saint Elizabeth alone. Widespread damage to crops also resulted in an increased price in store costs. The loss to farmers was untimely as it followed a three-month drought that was preceded by damaging hailstorms that ruined crops. Following the storm, search and <b>rescue</b> <b>teams</b> were deployed, mainly in Saint Elizabeth Parish following reports of flooding.|$|E

5|$|Shaw {{explored}} what {{he could}} of the western workings, before he {{and some of the}} survivors began tackling the fire. The water pipes from the surface in the Lancaster shaft were all fractured, and hand-extinguishers were used. Shaw returned to the surface at 9:30am to arrange for rescue and fire-fighting teams from neighbouring collieries. From 11:00am the specialist mines <b>rescue</b> <b>teams</b> began arriving at the colliery from the Rhymney and Rhondda Valleys, as did Red Cross workers and local ambulance services; a police detachment was sent from Cardiff in a special train.

5|$|After Babs {{passed the}} hardest hit areas, workers were {{initially}} unable to distribute food and medicine due to ferry service being halted. Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel to be reached by national aid workers.

The country's National Food Authority provided about 73,000sacks of rice to storm victims, and the country planned to import 300,000tonnes of rice to overcome the lost crops. The Philippine Red Cross deployed search and <b>rescue</b> <b>teams,</b> as well as distributing food and coffee to 35,500people.
