25|$|The {{labelled}} {{product is}} generated via reverse transcription and sometimes with an optional PCR amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, {{most of which}} is rRNA); miRNA microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labelling {{is dependent on the}} microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls. The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl uridine triphosphate (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as cyanine dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labelled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a phosphate buffer solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a <b>reactive</b> <b>dye.</b> A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa).

Reactive dyeing is the most important method for the coloration of cellulosic fibres. Reactive dyes can also be applied on wool and nylon; in the latter case they are applied under weakly acidic conditions. Reactive dyes have a low utilization degree compared to other types of dyestuff, since the functional group also bonds to water, creating hydrolysis.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Some {{patients}} with occupational asthma resulting {{from exposure to}} reactive dyes have skin reactivity to the causative dyes and specific IgE to reactive dyes {{have been found in}} these patients. However, the usefulness of skin prick tests (SPTs) and serological measurement of specific IgE in screening, diagnosis, and monitoring the occupational asthma resulting from exposure to reactive dyes have not yet been assessed. In this study, the clinical validation of SPTs and measurement of specific IgE to vinyl sulphone reactive dyes by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was evaluated.  METHODS— 42  Patients with occupational asthma from reactive dyes (true positive group) were enrolled. In these the causative <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> was confirmed by bronchial challenge test. 93  Asymptomatic factory workers with negative challenge to the <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> (true negative group) and 16  unexposed controls with negative challenge to the <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> were also enrolled. Skin prick tests were done with 10  mg/ml <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> in 0. 4 % phenol/ 0. 9 % saline. IgE specific to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA) was measured with enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).  RESULTS—None of the unexposed controls had a positive response to SPTs. The sensitivity (76. 2 % v 53. 7 %), specificity (91. 4 % v 86. 0 %), positive predictive value (80. 0 % v 62. 9 %), and negative predictive value (89. 5 % v 80. 8 %) of SPTs were higher than those of ELISAs. The mean weal size of reaction to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> was weakly correlated with the ELISA optical density of IgE to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> conjugate in {{patients with}} occupational asthma from reactive dyes (n= 41, r= 0. 337, p< 0. 05). In four patients with occupational asthma from reactive dyes and eight control subjects exposed to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye,</b> IgE specific to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> conjugated to HSA was detected with ELISA even though they showed negative skin reactivity. Six patients completely avoided the <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> for a mean (SD) 27. 8  (10. 3) months, IgE specific to reactive dyes decreased in all six patients (p< 0. 05) during this time.  CONCLUSIONS—Both SPTs and detection of IgE specific to <b>reactive</b> <b>dye</b> in serum samples could be valuable for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring occupational asthma resulting from exposure to reactive dyes.
