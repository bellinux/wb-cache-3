40|$|In recent years, new {{visualisation}} {{techniques and}} devices, such as <b>remote</b> <b>visualisation</b> and stereoscopic displays, {{have been developed}} to help researchers. In a <b>remote</b> <b>visualisation</b> environment the user may want to see visualisation on a different device, such as a PDA or stereo device, and in different circumstances. Each device needs to be configured correctly, otherwise it may lead to an incorrect rendering of the output. For end users, however, {{it can be difficult to}} configure each device without a knowledge of the device property and rendering. Therefore, in a multiple user and multiple display environment, to obtain the correct display for each device can be a challenge. In this project, the focus on investigating a solution that can support end users to use different display devices easily. The proposed solution is to develop an application that can support the ad-hoc use of any display device without the system being preconfigured in advance. Thus, end users can obtain the correct visualisation output without any complex rendering configuration. We develop a client-server based approach to this problem. The client application can detect the properties of a device and the server application can use these properties to configure the rendering software to generate the correct image for subsequent display on the device. II The approach has been evaluated through many tests and the results show that using the application is a useful in helping end users use different display devices in visualisation...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In the recent past application areas such as virtual reality experiences, digital cinema and computer gamings {{have resulted in a}} renewed interest in advanced research topics in computer graphics. Although many research challenges in computer graphics have been met due to worldwide efforts, many more are yet to be met. Two key challenges which still remain open research problems are, the lack of perfect realism in animated/virtually-created objects when represented in graphical format and the need for the transmissiim/storage/exchange of a massive amount of information in between remote locations, when 3 D computer generated objects are used in <b>remote</b> <b>visualisations.</b> These challenges call for further research to be focused in the above directions. Though a significant amount of ideas have been proposed by the international research community in their effort to meet the above challenges, the ideas still suffer from excessive complexity related issues resulting in high processing times and their practical inapplicability when bandwidth constraint transmission mediums are used or when the storage space or computational power of the display device is limited. In the proposed work we investigate the appropriate use of geometric representations of 3 D structure (e. g. Bezier surface, NURBS, polygons) and multi-resolution, progressive representation of texture on such surfaces. This joint approach to texture synthesis has not been considered before and has significant potential in resolving current challenges in virtual realism, digital cinema and computer gaming industry. The main focus of the novel approaches that are proposed in this thesis is performing photo-realistic texture synthesis on surfaces. We have provided experimental results and detailed analysis to prove that the proposed algorithms allow fast, progressive building of texture on arbitrarily shaped 3 D surfaces. In particular we investigate the above ideas in association with Bezier patch representation of 3 D objects, an approach which has not been considered so far by any published world wide research effort, yet has flexibility of utmost practical importance. Further we have discussed the novel application domains that can be served by the inclusion of additional functionality within the proposed algorithms...|$|R

While some recent work has focused on automatically computing the best view(s) of a given model, {{little attention has been}} given to the problem's dynamic counterpart - best fly.

We then use the model's geometric properties to determine the speed and zoom of the camera along the path...|$|E
40|$|When working {{remotely}} {{with physical}} objects obvious problems of reference arise {{because of the}} lack of a mutually shared object. Systems aiming to support such work tend to be based on understandings of face-to-face interaction and frequently use video. However, video introduces new interactional problems. This paper describes a field study of remote interaction around objects that is telephone-centred, namely in a call centre for troubleshooting office devices. We describe how breakdowns in mutual orientation stem from three main problematics: 1) The inadequate fidelity of operators' support resources; 2) The lack of mutual access to indicative resources; 3) operators' lack of direct access to customers' actions and orientation. From this analysis, we have developed a design proposal for supporting such work. Rather than using video, we propose that utilising a linked problem representation would address these problems. To this end we describe our proposal for a bidirectional <b>remote</b> <b>visualisation</b> of the troubleshooting problem...|$|E

In the client-server based architecture, the CityServer 3 D, both geometrical and texture data describing highly detailed threedimensional city models is streamed to the client. In order to achieve significant reduction of the huge amount of data we take advantage of LOD concepts and a predictive approach to anticipate user navigation: After estimation of future viewing parameters, the server chooses bandwidth-adequate representations of threedimensional objects and delivers them to the client. By this means, we ensure that only user-relevant data is sent.

40|$|NRENs {{have started}} to deploy 40 Gbps in the core, but for {{applications}} {{it is far from}} trivial to make full use of those speeds. This article describes the work SARA is doing to increase the client to server data flow of a single application to more than 10 Gbps. SARA’s <b>remote</b> scientific <b>visualisation</b> uses a client server setup. The client consists of a tiled panel display of 35 million pixels in total. The server side is a visualisation and render cluster that generates images and streams those images over the network to the tiled panel display. Streaming with a frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps) would generate a data flow of approximately 27 Gbps. This article describes the challenges encountered in reaching those speeds and what techniques are used to meet these challenges. SARA’s tiled panel display consists of nine high resolution (2560 by 1600 pixels) LCD screens in a 3 × 3 setup. Five high end servers are used to drive the display. Four of the five servers have two screens connected to them, one server drives only one screen. So each server handles a part of the total image...|$|R

This paper, {{as part of a}} larger project aimed to develop a multipurpose 4 d-ultrasonic force-sensitive robot for medical applications, focuses on achieving real-time <b>remote</b> <b>visualisation</b> for 4 d ultrasound image transfer. This was possible through implementing our software modification on a GE Vivid 7 Dimension workstation, which operates a matrix array probe controlled by a KUKA LBR iiwa 7 7 -DOF robotic arm. With the help of robotic positioning and the matrix array probe, fast volumetric imaging of target regions was feasible. By testing ultrasound volumes, which were roughly 880 kB in size, while using gigabit Ethernet connection, a latency of ∼ 57 ms was achievable for volume transfer between the ultrasound station and a remote client application, which as a result allows a frame count of 17. 4 fps.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{progressive}} texture map (PTM) format that encodes the mipmap levels of a texture map into a compact and progressive way. In order to man-age these PTMs for a purpose of <b>remote</b> <b>visualisation</b> of architectural 3 D scenes, we make use of a space subdivi-sion and a visibility computation algorithm that are per-formed in a preprocessing step. In addition to this prepro-cessing, we precompute a metric which is used during the navigation to select the texture mipmap levels to be down-loaded and those to be added/removed to/from the graphics hardware memory. Thanks to these mechanisms, we gen-erate and visualize scalable databases for architectural 3 D scenes that contain {{a large number of}} high resolution tex-ture maps. The visualisation system we propose is based on a client/server architecture and allows for the transmis-sion and the visualization of 3 D scenes using either a re-mote server connected via low bandwidth networks or a local server.

ISMM is a biannual event bringing together researchers, students, and practitioners of Mathematical Morphology to present and discuss advances on topics ranging from new theoretical developments to novel applications, solving complex image analysis problems. ISMM was established as the main scientific event {{in the field and}} this anniversary edition marked the tenth successful organisation in the series, that was initiated in 1993 in Barcelona. The call for papers was answered with 49 submissions. Each submitted paper was peer-reviewed by 3 referees selected from the Programme Committee. A total of 39 papers were accepted for publication in this volume. The final programme of ISMM 2011 was divided in nine thematic areas: theory, lattices and order, connectivity, image analysis, processing and segmentation, adaptive morphology, algorithms, <b>remote</b> sensing, <b>visualisation,</b> and applications.

40|$|Abstract: Grid {{computing}} {{provides a}} global-scale distributed computing infrastructure for executing scientific and business applications. An important requirement {{is the need}} to make this infrastructure appear as a single logical coordinated resource – which in reality consists of a variety of resources aggregated across different administrative domains. The aggregation of network resources is often undertaken over a ‘best effort ’ infrastructure as provided by the Internet – however many applications, which necessitate soft-real time constraints, such as collaborative working or <b>remote</b> <b>visualisation,</b> require more stringent traffic guarantees. Managing Quality of Service (QoS) requirements across these aggregated resources therefore becomes an important concern. Such QoS criteria must extend to computational, data and network resources, and are often expressed in a Service Level Agreement, multiples of which may co-exist over the entire collection of resources. In this paper we focus on network QoS as part of our wider work on the Grid QoS Management (G-QoSm) framework. Provisioning of such QoS support is provided via the Differentiated Services architecture, and relies on the use of a Bandwidth Broker (BB) component. Performance results of using the BB alongside other elements in G-QoSm are presented...|$|E

Representative viewpoints of the shape are extracted, and an interpolating path is computed as a trajectory for a virtual camera. Speed and zoom of the camera along the path are controlled. Here, we show several scenes extracted {{from left to right}} in sequence from our animation of the Lion vase model. The blue line on the viewsphere represents the camera’s trajectory and the rightmost image shows how the camera speed (top) and zoom (bottom) vary along the trajectory.

40|$|Industry 4. 0 is {{changing}} the manufacturing landscape towards smart and digital manufacturing. The implementation and integration of various technologies, such as sensors, actuators and robotics, together with devices {{that allow them to}} communicate and sense with the surrounding environment, will make manufacturing industry to move towards connected and integrated factories. As a result, manufacturing companies will be capable of improving productivity while reducing lead time and costs. Nevertheless, manufacturers’ scepticism about the benefits provided by Industry 4. 0 still represents a barrier to its diffusion. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how Internet of Things and Analytics technologies can bring benefits regarding remote performance monitoring. The intended aim is achieved through the development of a monitoring system concept and its concrete implementation on the Festo Flexible Mechatronics System (MPS 202), a small-scale automated production line. The integration and connection of various sensors allow data collection and communication to a cloud infrastructure, where data are processed and analysed. Data analytics can highlight key performance metrics that are visualised in streaming on a dashboard, facilitating the understanding of process conditions. Furthermore, the system generates alarms on mobile devices in case of anomalies in the Festo system, allowing users to immediately realise whether an undesired event is occurring in the system. The monitoring system enhances process performance awareness, as key performance metrics such as productivity, cycle time and parts produced are displayed. Moreover, the cloud infrastructure enables <b>remote</b> <b>visualisation</b> and monitoring. Additionally, automating data gathering and visualisation, the project addresses the challenge of supporting information flow from the shop floor to the management level. The project demonstrates how the implementation of simple and inexpensive IoT devices represents an efficient way to provide new monitoring capabilities for legacy machines, as a valuable alternative option to the purchase of new and expensive ones...|$|E

This scalability is further facilitated by specialised object distribution algorithms and an open framework for the implementation of novel partitioning techniques. CVE application development is eased by a scripting language, which enables rapid development and favours experimentation. This scripting language interfaces many aspects of the system and enables the prototyping of distribution-related components as well as user interfaces. It is the key construct of a distributed environment to which components, written in different languages, connect and onto which they operate in a network abstracted manner. The solutions proposed are exemplified and strengthened by three collaborative applications. The Dive room system is a virtual environment modelled after the room metaphor and supporting asynchronous and synchronous cooperative work.

40|$|Visualisation {{is widely}} used in many areas to help people {{interpret}} data. People may wish to share the visualisation that they are currently using with others. Mobile devices provide one way to share a visualisation, but they have limitations for visualisation {{compared to the use}} of standard desktop in terms of memory, graphics hardware and CPU performance. In this thesis, a <b>remote</b> <b>visualisation</b> approach is used to overcome some of these limitations. As the Paraview visualisation system can operate in client-server mode, the focus is on investigating a solution that can efficiently transfer visualisations from the Paraview system onto a smart phone. The solution developed is an application that can view and update the rendered image generated from the existing visualisation system. The visualization system {{does not need to be}} re-built or installed on the smart phone. End users can easily retrieve the correct visualization without complex user configuration. In order to generate correct visualisation without having to re-build the client for the mobile device, the thesis uses a gateway approach acting as middleware to communicate between the render server (Paraview system) and our generic client (running on smart phone). The gateway handles all of the requests between the user and the server which runs locally to the gateway. The gateway passes the final rendered image to the smart phone via the network for display and interacting. An end user trial is conducted to evaluate and compare the usability of the smart phone client with the traditional desktop client. The results showed that using gateway as a middleware is a useful approach for a smart phone to manipulate the visualisation with the Paraview system. The customised visualisation application on the smart phone is simple, without having to store data and without installing Paraview system on the device...|$|E
