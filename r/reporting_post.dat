2500|$|The {{airfield}} {{was built}} by the Luftwaffe as an emergency landing field during the early 1940s. In addition to this, it stationed a detachment of reconnaissance aircraft. The Royal Norwegian Air Force established a radio station at Kautokeino in 1945. Transport to the new airport was among other means carried out using seaplanes which used the Altaelva river to land. The station was upgraded in 1955 and received a radar and was designated as a <b>reporting</b> <b>post.</b> Its first upgrade took place in 1958, {{the same year as}} renovations of the airfield were carried out. The main users of the airfield were Twin Otters from Bodø Main Air Station. On occasion supplies would be dropped by parachute. Once only a jet fighter has landed here, even if the field is too short for them. In June 1970 an F5 landed and took off, then using a parachute and extra rockets.
