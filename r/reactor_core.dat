5|$|Thorium fuels {{also result}} in a safer and better-performing <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> because thorium dioxide has a higher melting point, higher thermal conductivity, lower {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion and is more stable chemically than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide, which can further oxidise to triuranium octoxide (U3O8).|$|E
5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|Bane lures Gotham's police {{underground}} and uses explosives to trap them {{and destroy the}} bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces Dr. Leonid Pavel, a Russian nuclear physicist he kidnapped from Uzbekistan, to convert the <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> into an atomic bomb before killing him as well. Bane then uses the bomb to hold the city hostage and isolate Gotham from the world. Using Gordon's stolen speech, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's crimes to the public, and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, initiating anarchy. The wealthy and powerful are then taken captive and given show trials presided over by Jonathan Crane, where all are sentenced to death.|$|E
25|$|There are 1693 fuel {{channels}} and 170 control rod channels {{in the first}} generation RBMK <b>reactor</b> <b>cores.</b> Second generation <b>reactor</b> <b>cores</b> (such as Chernobyl-4) have 1661 fuel {{channels and}} 211 control rod channels.|$|R

5|$|Samus {{intercepts}} a {{distress signal}} from the Space Pirate frigate Orpheon, whose crew have been slaughtered by the Pirates' own genetically modified, experimental subjects. At the ship's core, she battles with the Parasite Queena giant version of the tiny parasites aboard the ship. The Parasite Queen is defeated and falls into the ship's <b>reactor</b> <b>core,</b> initiating {{the destruction of the}} ship. While Samus is escaping from the doomed frigate, she encounters a cybernetic version of Ridley called Meta-Ridley. During her escape, an electrical surge and explosion damages her power suit, which revert to her original Power Suit. Samus escapes the frigate and chases her nemesis in her gunship towards the nearby planet Tallon IV.|$|E
5|$|VERA is a {{light water}} reactor {{simulation}} written at the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL) on Jaguar. VERA allows engineers to monitor the performance and status of any part of a <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> throughout the lifetime of the reactor to identify points of interest. Although {{not one of the}} first six projects, VERA was planned to run on Titan after optimization with assistance from CAAR and testing on TitanDev. Computer scientist Tom Evans found that the adaption to Titan's hybrid architecture was more difficult than to previous CPU-based supercomputers. He aimed to simulate an entire reactor fuel cycle, an eighteen to thirty-six month-long process, in one week on Titan.|$|E
5|$|When Altares {{encounters}} a star cluster, Anna tells Jane of Einstein's accomplishments {{in the areas}} of special relativity and unified field theory. Shortly after, the ship is hit by a meteor shower that damages various systems and causes the photon drive to re-activate, hurling Altares through space at such velocity that the travellers are knocked out. A fail-safe brings the vessel, now powerless, to a halt within the gravitational field of a red giant on the brink of supernova. Donning a heat suit, Captain Masters risks his life by entering the <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> in a bid to repair the drive. He succeeds, and Anna and Jane pilot the ship outside the blast radius of the star before it explodes.|$|E

5|$|Chell and GLaDOS {{return to}} the modern {{chambers}} and face Wheatley, who is driven by GLaDOS's software to test them against a series of traps, which Chell escapes. In their final confrontation, Chell attaches three corrupted personality cores (Nolan North) to Wheatley, allowing a second core transfer to restore GLaDOS to control. However, Wheatley blows up the button needed to activate the transfer. With the facility exploding around them due to the impending meltdown of its <b>reactor</b> <b>core,</b> the roof collapses revealing the night sky, whereupon Chell places a portal on the moon overhead. The vacuum of space pulls her and Wheatley through the other portal still inside the chamber, and GLaDOS reasserts her control. GLaDOS retrieves Chell, who falls unconscious, and Wheatley is left in space with a corrupt personality core orbiting him.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Modine {{appears as}} Peter Foley, Gordon's second-in-command that disdains Batman. Ben Mendelsohn portrays John Daggett, a rival billionaire socialite who employs Bane in {{his plan to}} take control of Wayne Enterprises, and Burn Gorman appears as Daggett's {{assistant}} and Executive Vice President Philip Stryver. Alon Abutbul portrays Leonid Pavel, a Russian nuclear physicist who is kidnapped from Uzbekistan by Bane and forced to convert the new Wayne Enterprises <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> into a bomb. Juno Temple plays Jen, Kyle's friend and accomplice, and Daniel Sunjata portrays Mark Jones, a U.S. Special Ops officer who leads a task force into Gotham to assist Gordon and the GCPD in freeing the city from Bane's rule. Chris Ellis appears as Father Reilly, a priest at the orphanage that Blake grew up in. Brett Cullen portrays Byron Gilley, a U.S. congressman who is kidnapped on Harvey Dent Day by Kyle.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the artifact, Shepard has {{a vision of the}} Reaper fleet approaching. Kenson and her entire team, however, turn out to have been indoctrinated from having spent too much time studying the artifact. She attacks Shepard, who is eventually overwhelmed by her soldiers. Upon awakening two days later, Shepard manages to escape and reach the control room, where he/she sets the asteroid on course to hit the Bahak system's relay. In retaliation, Kenson plans to destroy the asteroid by overloading the <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> of the facility, but Shepard ultimately stops her. Shepard then contacts his/her starship and escapes shortly before the asteroid hits the Relay, resulting in the destruction of the entire Bahak system. Shepard is later met by Admiral Steven Hackett, their superior officer, who explains that he/she has to go to Earth and face the consequences, setting the stage for Mass Effect 3.|$|E
40|$|KamLAND is a reactor {{neutrino}} oscillation {{experiment with}} a very long baseline. This experiment successfully measured oscillation phenomena of reactor antineutrinos coming mainly from 53 reactors in Japan. In order to extract the results, {{it is necessary to}} accurately calculate time-dependent antineutrino spectra from all the reactors. A simple model of <b>reactor</b> <b>cores</b> and code implementing it were developed for this purpose. This paper describes the model of the <b>reactor</b> <b>cores</b> used in the KamLAND reactor analysis.

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Radiation-induced changes in microstructures often lead to significant changes in mechanical properties of alloys used {{in the construction of}} nuclear reactors. It is desirable to test small specimens to make efficient use of the small volumes available in test and commercial <b>reactor</b> <b>cores</b> and also because small specimens are less affected by the sometimes steep flux gradients experienced in <b>reactor</b> <b>cores</b> and the sometimes large temperature gradients developed in the specimens from gamma heating.

5|$|Master Chief first {{appears in}} the games as the protagonist of Halo: Combat Evolved and the 2003 novelization, Halo: The Flood. During the opening {{cinematic}} of Halo: Combat Evolved, the Chief is awakened from cryonic sleep. Upon exiting slipspace, the Pillar of Autumn is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on Halo, a ring-shaped megastructure. Master Chief escapes the ship via an escape pod. Upon landing on Halo, his first task is to find other survivors. While fighting the Covenant, Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the Forerunners, as a {{last line of defense}} against an alien parasite called the Flood. The Covenant accidentally release the Flood, which begins to spread across the ring. At the request of the installation's resident AI 343 Guilty Spark, Master Chief retrieves the Index, a device used to activate Halo's defenses and eliminate the Flood. However, Guilty Spark neglects to inform the Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius, essentially starving the Flood to death. Cortana intervenes to prevent the activation of Halo. She and the Master Chief destroy it by detonating the Pillar of Autumns fusion <b>reactor</b> <b>core.</b> The Master Chief and Cortana escape in a Longsword spacecraft, believing they are the only survivors.|$|E
25|$|On 24 June TEPCO {{completed}} {{repairs to}} the Reactor Building Equipment Cooling Water system of Unit 5 which removes {{heat from the}} main Fuel Pool Cooling and Clean-up system {{as well as other}} equipment. The fuel pool and <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> are now being cooled simultaneously, the fuel pool by the Fuel Pool Cooling System and Equipment Cooling Water System and the <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> by the Residual Heat Removal System. Previously the Residual Heat Removal System was alternately being switched between cooling the <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> and fuel pool. On 16 September, the same was accomplished in Unit 6 and now the reactors and storage pools of both units are being cooled separately.|$|E
25|$|Recovered {{portions}} of the <b>reactor</b> <b>core,</b> including the fuel and all {{other parts of the}} reactor that were important to the incident investigation, were taken to the INEL's Test Area North for study. After the incident investigation was complete, the reactor fuel was sent to the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant for reprocessing. The <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> minus the fuel, along with the other components sent to Test Area North for study, was eventually disposed of at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex.|$|E
25|$|Corium (also called fuel {{containing}} material (FCM) or lava-like fuel containing material (LFCM)) is {{the name}} for the lava-like mixture of fissile material created in a nuclear <b>reactor's</b> <b>core</b> during a nuclear meltdown.|$|R

25|$|However the <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> has to {{be larger}} for the same power output, and the fuel burnup ratio at {{discharge}} is lower so the fuel is used less efficiently, countering the thermal efficiency advantage.|$|E
25|$|On December 21, 1960, {{the reactor}} {{was shut down}} for maintenance, {{calibration}} of the instruments, installation of auxiliary instruments, and installation of 44 flux wires to monitor the neutron flux levels in the <b>reactor</b> <b>core.</b> The wires were made of aluminum, and contained slugs of aluminum–cobalt alloy.|$|E
50|$|In {{the history}} of atomic power development, at least 60 {{criticality}} accidents have occurred, including 22 in process environments, outside of nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>cores</b> or experimental assemblies, and 38 in small experimental reactors and other test assemblies.|$|R
25|$|Continued cooling of {{the melted}} <b>reactor</b> <b>cores</b> is {{required}} in order to remove excess heat. Due to damage to the integrity of the reactor vessels, radioactive water accumulated inside the reactor and turbine buildings.

25|$|Since {{nuclear fission}} creates radioactivity, the <b>reactor</b> <b>core</b> is {{surrounded}} by a protective shield. This containment absorbs radiation and prevents radioactive material from being released into the environment. In addition, many reactors are equipped with a dome of concrete to protect the reactor against both internal casualties and external impacts.|$|E
25|$|At 20:05 JST on 12 March, the Japanese {{government}} ordered seawater to be {{injected into}} Unit 1 {{in a new}} effort to cool the <b>reactor</b> <b>core.</b> The treatment had been held {{as a last resort}} since it ruins the reactor. TEPCO started seawater cooling at 20:20, adding boric acid as a neutron absorber to prevent a criticality accident. The water would take five to ten hours to fill the <b>reactor</b> <b>core,</b> after which the reactor would cool down in around ten days. The injection of seawater into the reactor pressure vessel was done by fire department trucks. At 01:10 JST on 14 March, injection of seawater was halted for two hours because all available water in the plant pools had run out (similarly, feed to Unit 3 was halted). NISA news reports stated 70% of the fuel rods had been damaged when uncovered.|$|E
25|$|Molten salt reactor designs {{carry out}} {{fluoride}} volatility reprocessing continuously or at frequent intervals.
