25|$|Due to {{concerns}} about its toxicity, {{the use of}} trichloroethylene in the food and pharmaceutical industries has been banned {{in much of the}} world since the 1970s. Legislation has forced the substitution of trichloroethylene in many processes in Europe as the chemical was classified as a carcinogen carrying an R45 <b>risk</b> <b>phrase,</b> May cause cancer. Many degreasing chemical alternatives are being promoted such as Ensolv and Leksol; however, each of these is based on n-propyl bromide which carries an R60 <b>risk</b> <b>phrase</b> of May impair fertility, and they would not be a legally acceptable substitute.|$|E

40|$|The {{toxicological}} {{background for}} hazard assessment using a simple to use toolkit for assessment {{and management of}} health risks from occupational dermal exposure is presented. Hazard assessment is intended {{to answer the following}} questions: (i) is the substance under consideration capable of damaging the skin; (ii) is the substance under consideration capable of leading to systemic health effects after having penetrated the skin; (iii) to what extent may the substance become systemically available; (iv) is the hazard influenced by the concentration? Local effects (like irritation or corrosion) and systemic effects (like drowsiness or liver damage) are treated separately, taking into account their possible interrelations. Hazard assessment is performed on the basis of easily available <b>risk</b> <b>phrases,</b> which give a short characterization of the inherent toxicity of a pure chemical or preparation. The information provided by <b>risk</b> <b>phrases</b> and possibly additional data is transformed into a one-dimensional ranking system of intrinsic toxicity (IT) scores. IT scores are expressed in broad categories like low, moderate, high or extreme. This ranking provides plausible information on the relevance of potential skin contact to health effects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract There is {{widespread}} {{concern over the}} risks, real or feared, from the rapidly increasing inventory of chemicals in commercial use. Many users of chemicals rely for their information on their supplier and safety data sheets (SDS). These summaries of properties are difficult for the average user to convert into practical control action. It is possible to take the classification data (the <b>Risk</b> <b>Phrases)</b> which are globally harmonised and link these directly to control advice given {{a knowledge of the}} process and purpose of the chemical- information immediately available to many. A level of control can be introduced, which although lacking the specific assurance of a professional hygiene and toxicological assessment does present sensible action. This approach has received widespread support by employers, workers and professional hygienists in the UK, and is now being taken forward in other countries, through the European Commission, and globally through ILO.

40|$|Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining: {{abstract}} no. 305449 We {{study the}} distributions of Lasso-type regression estimators in a moving-parameter asymptotic framework, and consider various bootstrap methods for estimating them accordingly. We show, in particular, that the distribution functions of Lasso-type estimators, including even those possessing the oracle properties {{such as the}} adaptive Lasso and the SCAD, cannot be consistently estimated by the bootstraps uniformly over {{the space of the}} regression parameters, especially when some of the regression coefficients lie close to the origin. Such lack of uniform consistency poses difficulties in practical applications of the bootstraps for making Lasso-based inferences. In the light of this seemingly negative result, we seek, however, to develop criteria for assessing the relative <b>risks,</b> <b>phrased</b> in terms of their uniform consistency properties, of the various bootstrap methods, based on which an optimal bootstrap strategy may be formulated in an adaptive manner. A simulation study is provided to demonstrate the non-normal nature of the distributions of Lasso-type estimators, and to assess the performances of various bootstrap estimates across different values of regression parameters. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The 7 th {{amendment}} of the EU Cosmetic Directive {{will lead}} to the ban of animal testing for cosmetic ingredients in 2009 (acute tests). Many efforts have been made in order to find reliable and relevant alternatives methods to eye irritation testing. 3 -D in vitro technology allows the evaluation of chemicals in conditions similar to in vivo use. In this study, we have used the SkinEthic Human Corneal Epithelial Model (HCE) to evaluate in vitro eye irritation potential of chemicals. Viability (MTT test) was used as the main endpoint to classify test-chemicals. The optimization of the in vitro protocol was based on a specific 60 min. contact time, adapted applied quantities (60 mg or 60 µl/cm) and a specific 16 hours post-treatment incubation period. A set of 102 chemicals belonging to different families, with known in vivo data was investigated in order to internally validate the protocol. The derived Predictive Model using a 50 % viability cut off allowed the prediction of 2 classes: Irritants (R 41 and R 36 EU <b>risk</b> <b>phrases)</b> and Non Irritants (Non Classified). Performances were characterized by a good sensitivity (86 %), a good specificity (83 %) and good accuracy (84 %). Results showed that the HCE model and the associated PM is a promising in vitro tool for the prediction of ocular irritancy...|$|R
30|$|If DRR and DRM {{are to be}} {{possibly}} {{investigated for}} phasing out as (disaster) <b>risk</b> science <b>phrases,</b> what would replace them? Perhaps the focus could be back to basics: risk combines hazards (or probabilities) and vulnerabilities (or consequences)—encompassing exposure and so {{eliminating the need for}} the “exposure” term. “Hazard,” “vulnerability,” and “risk” still require definitions and discussions. At least they are fewer and simpler terms coming from an existing, foundational literature. They can be used to highlight baseline ideas melding risk science and dealing with disasters (and so into sustainable development), providing a grounding for applying this science for positive action.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{diversity}} of chemicals used in hospitals (detergents-disinfectants, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, drugs, etc.) and {{recent developments in}} indoor air quality regulation of public access buildings require {{a better understanding of}} chemical risks in this particular environment. We developed a methodology for semi-quantitative chemical risk assessments in this environment to prioritize inhalation risks by sector and chemical. This methodology is based on a similar approach in the workplace that defines classes of exposures and of hazards. Their combination produces a risk matrix. Four criteria were used to determine the exposure classes: quantity and frequency of the chemical's use, volatility (vapor pressure), and the type of collective protective equipment associated with each area. The hazard class is also derived from four criteria: classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic to reproduction, the existence of a toxicity reference value, occupational exposure limit values, and <b>risk</b> <b>phrases</b> (official <b>risk</b> descriptions, on labels, data sheets, etc). This methodology was tested in the Rennes University Hospital (Rennes, France) in five different hospital areas, with a specific survey undertaken to collect data about chemicals in each area. The results show the spatial specificity of chemical risks. Among the various sites analysed, the chemical risks of two require priority attention: the parasitology-mycology laboratory and patients' rooms. Because of their wide use in the hospital and the volatility of some of their components (alcohols), detergents-disinfectants contribute to increasing risk levels in all areas. The model is therefore discriminatory in terms of areas and substances...|$|R
