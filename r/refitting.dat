5|$|Queen Mary was <b>refitting</b> in January and February 1915 {{and did not}} {{participate}} in the Battle of Dogger Bank; she received her main battery director in December 1915.|$|E
5|$|After her seizure and <b>refitting,</b> {{the former}} liner was {{chartered}} to the United States Army as USAT Iroquois. In 1918, {{her name was}} again changed, this time to Freedom. On 24 January 1919, Freedom was acquired by the United States Navy and commissioned the same day, with Lieutenant J. C. C. Holier, USNRF, in command.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944, {{he succeeded}} his friend (and fellow Duntroon classmate) Major General George Vasey as {{commander}} of the 7th Division. The division had been resting and <b>refitting</b> in Australia since its withdrawal in early 1944 from New Guinea following the Ramu Valley campaign, which had been conducted {{in the aftermath of}} the capture of Lae.|$|E
50|$|Between 1828 and 1840, Falmouth {{made two}} cruises with the West Indies Squadron and two with the Pacific Squadron. Between cruises, {{she was in}} {{ordinary}} for repairs and <b>refittings</b> at either New York or Norfolk or Norfolk Navy Yard.|$|R
50|$|The over {{utilized}} Cleveland City Council Chambers underwent major renovations in 1951 and 1977. However, {{the outside}} of the building has remained largely unchanged since 1916, save for normal repairs, <b>refittings</b> and the usual upkeep of the superstructure. The Hall stands next to Willard Park.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{technological}} restraints, the 051-type was {{vulnerable to}} air and submarine attack. In order to mitigate these weaknesses, {{it went through}} continuous <b>refittings,</b> which resulted in all the ships being very different. Despite its shortcomings, it ended an era when the Chinese navy relied on imports. It also nurtured expertise {{in the design and}} use of large warships.|$|R
5|$|Renown {{did not see}} combat {{during the}} war and was reconstructed twice between the wars; the 1920s {{reconstruction}} increased her armour protection and made other more minor improvements, while the 1930s reconstruction was much more thorough. The ship frequently conveyed royalty on their foreign tours and served as flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron when Hood was <b>refitting.</b>|$|E
5|$|When World War I {{began in}} August 1914, Aki was <b>refitting</b> at Kure Naval Arsenal. She was {{assigned}} to the 1st Battleship Squadron upon the completion of her refit and remained with it until she was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Squadron in 1918, seeing no combat during the war. From December 1915 to December 1916, she was commanded by Captain Kiyokazu Abo.|$|E
5|$|While the {{division}} was <b>refitting</b> and rearming following {{the fighting in}} Greece and Crete, Elliott was promoted to lance sergeant, then platoon sergeant. In November 1941, during Operation Crusader, his platoon {{was attached to the}} headquarters of the 5th Infantry Brigade for security. On 27 November, he, along with 700 other men, were captured when the headquarters was overrun by elements of Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps, which had outflanked the Allies. He spent two months under harsh conditions in captivity before being liberated by South African troops. He lost a considerable amount of weight during his time as a prisoner of war. He rejoined the 2nd New Zealand Division which was <b>refitting</b> in Syria, but then contracted malaria and missed out on its hasty recall to Egypt and the subsequent fighting at Minqar Qaim.|$|E
50|$|In 1932, the German sail {{training}} ship Niobe suffered a similar fate, killing 69. Parrott draws parallels to the sudden losses of the Marques (1984) {{and the original}} Pride of Baltimore (1986), which were similarly affected by large sail areas; {{in the case of}} the Marques, this was likewise the result of <b>refittings</b> over the years of her existence.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} small towns, {{the decline of}} local {{commerce}} has resulted in Connah's Quay overdeveloping its houses {{at the expense of}} shops and businesses. Many of these houses were indeed <b>refittings</b> of former shops. As a result, the town's population has swollen from a few hundred inhabitants to close to twenty thousand over a period of 50 years. Minister for Housing and Regeneration and Assembly Member for Alyn and Deeside since 2003, Carl Sargeant, lives in the town.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, archaeologists {{from the}} 'Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology, Polish Academy of Sciences' in Poznań, {{unearthed}} {{the remains of}} a settlement with numerous postholes, pits and hearths estimated to be 15,000 years old. Previously it was believed that permanent structures were associated with the exodus from Africa and the consequent occupation of regions in Europe and Asia. The position of the site, lithic artefacts collected in 2003 and 2012-2014, freshness, <b>refittings</b> and dispersion of the artefacts all suggest that it was a late Middle Stone Age workshop used intermittently and for short periods.|$|R
5|$|All six {{boats were}} {{completed}} from 1985 to 1989 at the Brodogradilište Specijalnih Objekata (BSO) in Split, SR Croatia and named after rivers in SFR Yugoslavia: Tisa (P-911), Una (P-912), Zeta (P-913), Soča (P-914), Kupa (P-915) and Vardar (P-916). Further planned improvements included {{the addition of}} a Stirling engine, either by <b>refitting</b> the existing boats or building a new, seventh one, but the imminent breakup of Yugoslavia happened before anything was realized.|$|E
5|$|By December, Etruria {{had been}} moved to Tobruk, where she {{provided}} gunfire support to the Italians defending the city. She was joined there by Etna and twelve torpedo boats. In the meantime, most of the fleet had returned to Italy for <b>refitting.</b> In January 1912, Etruria was moved back to Benghazi. For {{the next six months}} she remained here, supporting the garrison against Ottoman counter-attacks. The ship repeatedly shelled the Ottoman camps outside the city. On 15 October, the Ottomans surrendered, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|Canopus {{served in}} the Mediterranean Fleet upon {{commissioning}} until 1903, when she was decommissioned for <b>refitting.</b> In 1905, she was sent to East Asia, but the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance that year rendered her presence in Asian waters unnecessary. She instead returned to Britain and served with several fleet commands in British waters, including the Atlantic Fleet, the Channel Fleet, and finally the Home Fleet. Another short deployment to the Mediterranean followed in 1908–1909. Upon returning to Britain, she was placed in reserve.|$|E
5000|$|Fredericksburg was {{for some}} time the oldest tanker in the U.S. fleet, and its age showed. She was subject {{to a number of}} <b>refittings</b> and retrofittings, such as the 1983 {{forecastle}} overhaul. [...] Also, towards the end of her career, she had a number of safety problems. For example, on 10 June 1999 when loaded, after experiencing a steering failure, she [...] "grounded under power at mile forty-three in the Columbia River." [...] Fortunately, she [...] "came ashore in an area of the river characterized by soft mud banks and suffered no damage." ...|$|R
5000|$|In June 1848, {{a severe}} storm knocked down the metal {{structure}} of the tower. A year later it {{was replaced by a}} lower roof. In June 1863 the building housed the Cleaning Department of Streets and latrines. Then, in 1875, in the building was installed a fire station, with space for firefighting cars and stables. Successive <b>refittings</b> strongly interfered in the primary structure of architectural interiors and exteriors. Western and southern walls of the nave had large holes cut for gates, large opening doors were created in a southern chapel, and to the east was built a low building with a flat pseudo merloned roof. Inside, significant renovations were performed: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{house has}} a fourteenth century core, with seventeenth-century {{additions}} and eighteenth-century internal <b>refittings.</b> It was restored by George Frederick Bodley, the Gothic revival architect, in the 1870s. A generation later, in the late 1890s, Charles Robert Ashbee, {{a leader in the}} English Arts and Crafts Movement, made additions such as a billiard room and a chapel, as well as many decorative external features. In 1912, just after the estate changed hands, the Wolverhampton architect J.K.H.E. Lavender was engaged. The gardens continued to be opened to the public on certain occasions; for example, in 1936 the Wodehouse joined the National Gardens Scheme, and as recently as in 2011 hosted the AGM of the Staffordshire Gardens and Parks Trust.|$|R
5|$|Captain Archer and {{the crew}} are welcomed back to Earth {{following}} the successful Xindi mission. As Enterprise undergoes repairs and <b>refitting,</b> Archer is reunited with a former girlfriend, Captain Erika Hernandez, who has been appointed to Starfleet's second Warp 5 starship, Columbia (NX-02). Archer is debriefed by Admiral Maxwell Forrest and Ambassador Soval. After reacting in anger when Soval asks pointed questions about , he is ordered by Forrest to take some relaxation leave.|$|E
5|$|Captain Charles Morris assumed {{command of}} Congress and {{assigned}} to the squadron under Bainbridge. After repairs and <b>refitting,</b> she transported the Minister to Holland William Eustis to his new post. Congress departed in June {{and after a few}} weeks at Holland, sailed for the Mediterranean and arrived at Cartagena, Spain in early August joining Bainbridge's squadron. By the time of Congresss arrival, however, Commodore Decatur had already secured a peace treaty with Algiers.|$|E
5|$|Despite Nelson's {{fondness for}} the ship, she was {{frequently}} {{in need of}} repair and <b>refitting,</b> and would likely have been hulked or scrapped in 1802 had war with France not recommenced. She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, as part of Nelson's weather column, where she forced the surrender of the Spanish four-decker Santísima Trinidad. Agamemnons later career was served in South American waters off Brazil.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} analyze whether {{the results of}} the survey with regard to system {{acceptance}} and the self-reported judgment of learning help to explain parts of the variances for the average fuel consumption, the LMM is refitted with data of the survey. The <b>refittings</b> are done by replacing the original variable System Experience either by the SAS scores or Judgment of Learning. Other explanatory variables of the original model remain unchanged. Evaluation {{of the quality of the}} model is done by fitting the model with a maximum log-likelihood (ML) approach and analyzing the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) [41, 42]. For the estimation of the fixed-effect values regarding the specific predictors, their t- and p-values, the restricted maximum log-likelihood (REML) method is used.|$|R
50|$|Constitution entered {{dry dock}} in 1992 for an {{inspection}} and minor repair period {{that turned out}} to be her most comprehensive structural restoration and repair since she was launched in 1797. Multiple <b>refittings</b> over the 200 years of her career had removed most of her original construction components and design, as her mission changed from a fighting warship to a training ship and eventually to a receiving ship. In 1993, the Naval History & Heritage Command Detachment Boston reviewed Humphreys' original plans and identified five main structural components that were required to prevent hogging of the hull, as Constitution had 13 in of hog at that point. Using a 1:16 scale model of the ship, they were able to determine that restoring the original components would result in a 10% increase in hull stiffness.|$|R
60|$|I use {{the word}} 'founded' in a literal as well as figurative sense. While the merchants, in their year of victories, threw down {{the walls of the}} war-towers, they as eagerly and {{diligently}} set their best craftsmen to lift higher the walls of their churches. For the most part, the Early Norman or Basilican forms were too low to please them in their present enthusiasm. Their pride, as well as their piety, desired that these stones of their temples might be goodly; and all kinds of junctions, insertions, <b>refittings,</b> and elevations were undertaken; which, the genius of the people being always for mosaic, are so perfectly executed, and mix up twelfth and thirteenth century work in such intricate harlequinade, that it is enough to drive a poor antiquary wild.|$|R
5|$|During 1951 Belfast {{mounted a}} number of coastal patrols and bombarded a variety of targets. On 1 June she arrived at Singapore for <b>refitting,</b> {{arriving}} back on patrol on 31 August. In September 1951 Belfast provided anti-aircraft cover for a salvage operation to recover a crashed enemy MiG-15 jet fighter. She conducted further bombardments and patrols before receiving a month's leave from operations, returning to action on 23 December.|$|E
5|$|Flying Scotsman {{returned}} to Britain in 1990 and continued {{working on the}} main line until its mainline certificate expired in 1993. 4472 then toured preserved railways. To raise funds for its upcoming overhaul it was {{returned to}} BR condition with the <b>refitting</b> of the German-style smoke deflectors and double chimney, and repainting in BR Brunswick green. By 1995 it was in pieces at Southall Railway Centre in West London, owned by a consortium that included McAlpine as well as music guru and railway enthusiast Pete Waterman.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, the Mahan-class destroyers began {{a wartime}} {{armament}} <b>refitting</b> process, {{but most of}} the class was not fully refitted until 1944. Mahan was refitted in June 1944 at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The notable refits to the Mahan-class included the removal of one 5 inch/38 gun, typically replaced with two twin Bofors 40 mm guns and five 20 mm Oerlikon guns.|$|E
50|$|In the end, {{what really}} doomed the Virginia nuclear-powered cruisers was economics. They were coming due {{for their first}} nuclear refuelings, mid-life overhauls, and NTU <b>refittings,</b> which were all {{expensive}} projects, together costing about half {{the price of a}} new ship. Further, they required relatively large crews, straining Navy personnel resources. The 1996 Navy Visibility and Management of Operating and Support Costs (VAMOSC) study determined the annual operating cost of a Virginia-class cruiser at $40 million, compared to $28 million for a Ticonderoga-class cruiser, or $20 million for an , the latter two classes designed with the much more capable Aegis Combat System. Given a lower requirement for cruisers, it was decided to retire (this decision was made while Texas {{was in the middle of}} her refueling overhaul) these nuclear ships as a money-saving measure. The early Ticonderoga-class cruisers which lacked the Vertical Launch System had equally short careers, serving between 18 and 21 years.|$|R
6000|$|SECTION V. The great façade which fronts {{the spectator}} looks southward. Hence the two traceried windows {{lower than the}} rest, {{and to the right}} of the spectator, may be {{conveniently}} distinguished as the [...] "Eastern Windows." [...] There are two others like them, filled with tracery, and at the same level, which look upon the narrow canal between the Ponte della Paglia and the Bridge of Sighs: these we may conveniently call the [...] "Canal Windows." [...] The reader will observe a vertical line in this dark side of the palace, separating its nearer and plainer wall from a long four-storied range of rich architecture. This more distant range is entirely Renaissance: its extremity is not indicated, because I have no accurate sketch of the small buildings and bridges beyond it, and we shall have nothing whatever to do with this part of the palace in our present inquiry. The nearer and undecorated wall is part of the older palace, though much defaced by modern opening of common windows, <b>refittings</b> of the brickwork, etc.|$|R
40|$|Technological and typological {{analysis}} of lithic assemblages from southern Oman have been undertaken for this study. These assemblages {{are characterized by}} the production of elongated end products (i. e., blades/leptoliths) using varied core reduction modalities exemplified here. These modalities have been identified based on technological {{analysis of}} production waste and core reconstructions using artefact <b>refittings.</b> Such blade technologies are accompanied by formal tool such as tanged projectile called Fasad point, burins, endscrapers and pseude-backed knifes. This technological and typological package has been identified on both systematic surface collections and stratified sites, {{making it possible to}} place these assemblages chronologically between 10. 000 and 7. 000 before present (BP). The chronological and techno-typological characterization of these blade assemblages warrants its status as a lithic industry of the Late Palaeolithic technocomplex. At present, blade assemblages from stratified sites in Yemen (Shi’bat Dihya) and Oman (al Hatab) which dated to 55. 000 and 11. 000 BP, represent the possible source of the techno/typological package found across Southern Oman {{at the beginning of the}} Holocene. No technological or typological resemblance with any other industry from outside of Arabia has been noted, enforcing the local, Arabian, origin of the Early Holocene Populations of the South Arabian Highlands...|$|R
5|$|In early 1942, the Mahan-class destroyers began {{a wartime}} {{armament}} <b>refitting</b> process, {{but most of}} the class was not fully refitted until 1944. The notable refits to the Mahan class included the removal of one 5-inch/38 gun, typically replaced with two twin Bofors 40 mm guns (1.6in) and between four and six 20 mm Oerlikon (0.9in) guns to increase the ships' light anti-aircraft (AA) armament.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1836, Independence {{returned}} to New Orleans for <b>refitting</b> and while there Commodore Hawkins died of smallpox. When Independence sailed from New Orleans on 10 April 1837, with Texas minister to the United States, William H. Wharton aboard, she was skippered by her new Captain, George W. Wheelwright, who had been left without a command after the forced sale of Liberty in May 1836.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard in the 1930s, and {{underwent}} further <b>refitting</b> from 1939 to 1943. During the Second World War, {{the ship}} was anchored in Salvador as the main defense of the port, as it {{was too old to}} play an active part in the war. For the last nine years of its service life, Minas Geraes remained largely inactive, and was towed to Italy for scrapping in March 1954.|$|E
5000|$|According to Sheldon, the squall {{hitting the}} Albatross {{was a white}} squall, i.e. an unpredictably sudden, very strong squall. His opinion was that the Albatross was {{essentially}} a stable, [...] "safe" [...] ship, and that the crew of teenagers—who had already spent about eight months on board—were sufficiently trained, but that this rare weather phenomenon left the ship no chance. Critics of this view, however, have argued that <b>refittings</b> of the Albatross {{over the years by}} her various owners had made her top heavy, which affected her secondary stability, that is, her ability to remain stable or even right herself after tilting to the side, as opposed to capsizing. In her times as North Sea pilot schooner, the ship had a far smaller and lower sail area, which means that the force of the wind did not have as much power and as powerful an angle as it did the day she sank. Almost 40 years after the loss of the Albatross, Daniel S. Parrott reanalyzed some of the documents about the ship and comparable ships in his book, Tall Ships Down. He suggested that due to the ship's impaired stability, even a [...] "normal" [...] squall could have sunk her; according to him, only the expert handling of the ship and the habitual prudence of the ship's captain(s) to reduce sail area early had prevented the refitted Albatross from capsizing in previous strong wind conditions.|$|R
40|$|Purpose :  The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} world-wide patterns of fitting contact lenses for the correction of presbyopia. Methods :  Up to 1, 000 survey forms were sent to contact lens fitters in each of 38 countries between January and March every year over five consecutive years (2005 to 2009). Practitioners were asked to record data relating to the first 10 contact lens fittings or <b>refittings</b> performed after receiving the survey form. Results :  Data were received relating to 16, 680 presbyopic (age 45 years or older) and 84, 202 pre-presbyopic (15 to 44 years) contact lens wearers. Females are over-represented in presbyopic versus pre-presbyopic groups, possibly reflecting a stronger desire for the cosmetic benefits of contact lenses among older women. The extent to which multifocal and monovision lenses are prescribed for presbyopes varies considerably among nations, ranging from 79 per cent of all soft lenses in Portugal to zero in Singapore. There appears to be significant under-prescribing of contact lenses for the correction of presbyopia, although {{for those who do}} receive such corrections, three times more multifocal lenses are fitted compared with monovision fittings. Presbyopic corrections are most frequently prescribed for full-time wear and monthly replacement. Conclusions :  Despite apparent improvements in multifocal design and an increase in available multifocal options in recent years, practitioners are still under-prescribing with respect to the provision of appropriate contact lenses for the correction of presbyopia. Training of contact lens practitioners in presbyopic contact lens fitting should be accelerated and clinical and laboratory research in this field should be intensified to enhance the prospects of meeting the needs of presbyopic contact lens wearers more fully. <br /...|$|R
