5000|$|Decauville KE, KG and IS type bogie {{carriages}}. These carriages were 1st/2nd, 2nd/3rd and all 3rd. There was one carriage {{from the}} Paris Exposition which was furnished with a bar. It was later {{converted to a}} 1st/2nd <b>railcar</b> <b>trailer.</b> The KE type coaches were originally all open, but later acquired glass end screens.|$|E
50|$|Van 68, on {{the other}} hand, was {{modified}} in 1919 with the guard compartment shifted to {{the centre of the}} van, requiring removal of the fish compartment. In 1930 the van was altered for use as a <b>railcar</b> <b>trailer,</b> and in 1941 the fish compartment was restored. Finally, in 1953, the van was condemned.|$|E
25|$|Eight Billard <b>railcar</b> <b>trailers,</b> built 1938.|$|R
50|$|De Dion-Bouton built <b>railcars</b> and <b>railcar</b> <b>trailers</b> used {{on many of}} the metre gauge {{railways}} in France and abroad. The first railcars {{were produced}} in the early 1920s, with the Chemin de Fer des Côtes-du-Nord receiving its first railcars in 1923.|$|R
5000|$|Several <b>railcars</b> and <b>trailers</b> {{have been}} {{preserved}} for excursion trains, among them ...|$|R
5000|$|Trailer cars 50 - 64 were Walkers <b>railcar</b> <b>trailers</b> {{placed in}} service between 1948 and 1954. They were {{primarily}} placed behind the [...] and [...] variations, but occasionally were coupled to [...] versions. Of note, is that Walker trailers 50 and 51 were originally classed RMT instead of MT. They were reclassed to the norm by 1949.|$|R
5000|$|In 1935 the Ferrocarril Central del Paraguay (Paraguay Central Railway) {{acquired}} three oil-fired <b>railcars</b> with <b>trailers</b> for {{the suburban}} service between Asunción and Ypacarai.|$|R
25|$|In 1934, two <b>railcar</b> <b>trailers</b> {{emerged from}} York Road works. Of light weight construction, they weighed only 17 tons (17 tonne) but each could seat 100 passengers. They had a low roof profile {{so that the}} railcar driver in his {{elevated}} cab could more easily see ahead when propelling them. Elderly former BNCR Class I1 bogie brake tricomposite coaches dating from the 1890s supplemented the purpose built trailers and provided an interesting contrast between the latest technology and Victorian design.|$|R
50|$|The train {{involved}} in the disaster was composed of Breda M2.123 class diesel <b>railcar</b> and Breda <b>trailer</b> RA 1006.|$|R
5000|$|An initial {{order of}} twelve [...] railcars, six [...] <b>railcars</b> with <b>trailers</b> and twelve [...] railcars from Walker Brothers in Wigan, England was placed, {{and this was}} {{extended}} to include a further ten 153 hp railmotors and trailers. The first was delivered in 1948, with new additions to the fleet running through to 1955.|$|R
50|$|In {{many rural}} or {{suburban}} areas, metre-gauge railways were built to transport agricultural produce. Such {{was the case}} of two light railways east of Pudong, Shanghai. They were isolated systems using small tank engines, like 4-4-2Ts. Later, experiments were made with gasoline <b>railcar</b> and <b>trailer</b> sets having Ford engines. They were closed in the 1950s and 1970s respectively and replaced by bus services.|$|R
50|$|In 1959 {{he bought}} the Aberdeen Plywood Co., in Aberdeen, Washington. As the CEO of Aberdeen Plywood and Veneers Inc. he orchestrated a merger with Plymouth, Michigan based Evans Products in 1961. He became {{president}} of Evans moving the corporate headquarters to Portland, Oregon. Under Orloff's leadership the company developed a combination of retail building materials stores, building and wood products, <b>railcar</b> and <b>trailer</b> manufacturing, heavy equipment leasing and home building and financing.|$|R
25|$|In 1922, {{trials were}} {{undertaken}} with railbuses between Plouëscat and Rosporden. As {{a result of}} the trials, three <b>railcars</b> and three <b>trailers</b> were purchased initially, later more railbuses were added to the fleet. The railbuses were from three different manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} replace pre-war railcars and steam-hauled {{passenger}} trains on branch lines, Waggonbau Bautzen started designing {{a new series}} of light railcars started in 1955 and completed the first two prototypes in 1959. One of them had a Büssing engine, the other one from Dieselmotorenwerk Berlin-Johannisthal. They entered regular service in 1962. In the same year, six more <b>railcars</b> with <b>trailers</b> were built, and in 1963 sixteen more railcars {{and for the first time}} some driving trailers, too. Further vehicles were built by Waggonbau Görlitz.|$|R
50|$|WAM Technologies: In 2015 ORBCOMM also {{acquired}} WAM Technologies LLC (WAM), {{an affiliate}} of Mark-It Services, Inc. and provider of remote management and control solutions for ocean transport refrigerated containers and intermodal equipment. With the acquisition of WAM, ORBCOMM’s cold chain monitoring solutions now include <b>trailers,</b> <b>railcars,</b> gensets and sea containers.|$|R
50|$|For {{passenger}} transport a Drewry railcar and three Wickham <b>railcars</b> with five <b>trailers</b> were used. The key {{objective of the}} Wickham railcars was to provide rolling stock for the School Train. A few flat wagons were also modified for transporting passengers. These were for instance used for the Picture Train, to transport passengers {{to and from the}} island’s cinema. There were also two unusual rail vehicles for carrying passengers on an incline.|$|R
50|$|The FS ordered 60 trains, each made of 4 elements: 30 trains had two <b>railcars</b> and two <b>trailers</b> (ALe 724 + Le 884 + Le 883 + ALe 724) and due {{to their}} high {{acceleration}} were destined to the suburban services; the other 30 trains had only one railcar, with a pilot trailer {{on the other side}} (ALe 724 + Le 884 + Le 884 + Le 724) and were destined to the regional services. Each train can carry 320 sitted people.|$|R
50|$|Methylamine is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with a formula of CH3NH2. This colorless gas is a derivative of ammonia, but with one hydrogen atom {{being replaced by}} a methyl group. It is the simplest primary amine. It is sold as a solution in methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, or water, or as the anhydrous gas in pressurized metal containers. Industrially, methylamine is transported in its anhydrous form in pressurized <b>railcars</b> and tank <b>trailers.</b> It has a strong odor similar to fish. Methylamine {{is used as a}} building block for the synthesis of many other commercially available compounds.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complex computer-based heuristic procedure for sizing customer orders and developing three dimensional load diagrams for rail and truck shipment of low density products. This heuristic procedure was developed for, {{and is in}} various phases of implementation at, a large multinational U. S. -based consumer products company. Products are shipped daily in high volume from inventory in corrugated containers of various sizes {{depending on the product}} package sizes and customer requirements. Vehicles used include <b>railcars,</b> truck <b>trailers</b> and tandem truck trailers, which also vary in size depending upon need and availability. In most cases, product volume or material handling considerations limit the amount of product loaded into vehicles before weight restrictions are met. Hence, the emphasis here is on low density products. The procedure developed has been demonstrated to significantly increase vehicle utilization, and improve customer service. It is fast and accurate enough to be used in real time during the order entry process. It has also been used successfully in a vehicle feasibility study of single versus tandem trailers...|$|R
5000|$|Metre gauge.The railway {{operates}} a basic hourly frequency on all its lines using {{a fleet of}} electric <b>railcars</b> with driver <b>trailers.</b> The oldest operational class is Be 4/4 dating from 1903 which are, nowadays used on the special trains in conjunction with visits to the chocolate factory at Broc, or on special excursions. These usually, subject to demand, work with an elderly passenger coach as trailer. Normal services {{are in the hands}} of either class Be 4/4 single cab power units built in 1977 or double ended BDe 4/4 built in 1972 coupled to single end driving trailer cars (class Bt) to form two-coach sets or double ended class BDe 4/4 units built by Ateliers de Constructions Mécaniques de Vevey (ACMV) / ABB in 1992 (No's 121 to 124 inclusive) which work on their own on lightly loaded trains or with driving trailers by the same makers. For (school) peak traffic, some more driving trailers may be added.The line was home to just two main line electric locomotives, Class GDe 4/4, built by SLM / BBC in 1983 and which are identical to the Class 6001 of the Chemin de Fer Montreux-Oberland- Bernoise. These are No. 101, named [...] "Ville de Bulle" [...] and No. 102, named [...] "Neirivue". They were usually used on workings with standard gauge wagons loaded on transporter bogies or ballast hopper trains originating from Grandvillard. The company has also in its stocklist two vintage electric shunting locomotives, Class Te 2/2, No's 11 and 12, built by Oerlikon in 1912. One of these is usually to be found at Bulle in connection with the wagon transfer between standard and metre gauge, the other at Montbovon.|$|R
