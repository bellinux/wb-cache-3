25|$|In the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence {{ranking of}} 10 {{antidepressants}} for efficacy and cost-effectiveness citalopram is fifth in effectiveness (after mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline) and fourth in cost-effectiveness. The ranking results {{were based on}} the meta-analysis by Andrea Cipriani. In another analysis by Cipriani, citalopram was found to be more efficacious than paroxetine and <b>reboxetine,</b> and more acceptable than tricyclics, <b>reboxetine,</b> and venlafaxine, but less efficacious than escitalopram.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 12 new-generation antidepressants showed that sertraline and escitalopram {{are the best}} in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of adults with unipolar MDD. <b>Reboxetine</b> was significantly worse.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparative}} {{meta-analysis of}} 12 major antidepressants found that venlafaxine, mirtazapine, escitalopram, and sertraline {{were significantly more}} efficacious than duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and <b>reboxetine.</b> A combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine achieved remission rates (defined as a HAM-D score of 7 or less) of 58% in one controlled trial. In combination with an antipsychotic medicine aripiprazole, better results in treatment resistant depression in older adults have been demonstrated.|$|E
500|$|Humphrey Rang of the British Pharmacological Society {{wrote that}} Goldacre had chosen his target well and had {{produced}} some shocking examples of secrecy and dishonesty, particularly the nondisclosure {{of data on}} the antidepressant <b>reboxetine</b> (chapter one), in which only one trial out of seven was published (the published study showed positive results, while the unpublished trials suggested otherwise). He argued that Goldacre had gone [...] "over the top" [...] in devoting a whole chapter (chapter five) to recommending large clinical trials using electronic patient data from general practitioners, without fully pointing out how problematic these can be; such trials raise issues, for example, about informed consent and regulatory oversight. Rang also criticized Goldacre's style, describing the book as too long, repetitive, hyperbolic, and in places too conversational. He particularly objected to the line, [...] "medicine is broken", calling it a [...] "foolish remark".|$|E
2500|$|Like other SSRIs, {{sertraline}} {{is associated}} with sexual side effects, including sexual arousal disorder and difficulty achieving orgasm. The observed frequency of sexual side effects depends greatly on whether they are reported by patients spontaneously, as in the manufacturer's trials, or actively solicited by the physicians. There have been several double-blind studies of sexual side effects comparing sertraline with placebo or other antidepressants. While nefazodone (Serzone), bupropion (Wellbutrin) and <b>reboxetine</b> (Edronax) did not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties vs. 18% before the treatment (or 61% vs. 0% according to another paper). Similarly, {{in a group of}} women who initially did not have difficulties achieving orgasm, 41% acquired this problem during treatment with sertraline. A 40% rate of orgasm dysfunction (vs. 9% for placebo) on sertraline was observed in a mixed group in another study. Sexual arousal disorder, defined as [...] "inadequate lubrication and swelling for women and erectile difficulties for men", occurred in 12% of patients on sertraline as compared with 1% of patients on placebo. The mood improvement resulting from the treatment with sertraline sometimes counteracted these side effects, so that sexual desire and overall satisfaction with sex stayed the same as before the sertraline treatment. However, under the action of placebo the desire and satisfaction slightly improved.|$|E
50|$|In a {{randomised}} double-blind placebo-controlled trial <b>reboxetine</b> {{significantly improved}} {{the symptoms of}} panic disorder. Another randomised controlled trial that compared paroxetine to <b>reboxetine</b> found that paroxetine significantly outperformed <b>reboxetine</b> {{as a treatment for}} panic disorder. Despite this discouraging finding an open-label trial examining the efficacy of <b>reboxetine</b> in SSRI-resistant panic disorder demonstrated significant benefit from <b>reboxetine</b> treatment.|$|E
50|$|According to a {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis by IQWiG, including unpublished data, published data on <b>reboxetine</b> overestimated {{the benefit of}} <b>reboxetine</b> versus placebo by up to 115% and <b>reboxetine</b> versus SSRIs by up to 23%, and also underestimated harm, concluding that <b>reboxetine</b> was an ineffective and potentially harmful antidepressant. The study also showed that nearly {{three quarters of the}} data on patients who took part in trials of <b>reboxetine</b> were not published by Pfizer until now.|$|E
50|$|A {{case series}} and open-label pilot study have {{demonstrated}} the efficacy of <b>reboxetine</b> in treating bulimia nervosa. Reboxetine's efficacy in treating therapy-resistant paediatric nocturnal enuresis. A pilot study demonstrated the efficacy of <b>reboxetine</b> {{in the treatment of}} narcolepsy. <b>Reboxetine</b> may also attenuate olanzapine-induced weight gain.|$|E
50|$|Two meta-analyses of the {{efficacy}} of <b>reboxetine</b> as an antidepressant demonstrated attempts to detect publication bias in clinical trials. Based on positive trial data, <b>reboxetine</b> was originally passed {{as a treatment for}} depression in many countries in Europe and the UK in 2001 (though in practice it is rarely used for this indication). A 2010 meta-analysis concluded that <b>reboxetine</b> was ineffective and that the preponderance of positive-outcome trials reflected publication bias, mostly due to trials published by the drug manufacturer Pfizer. A subsequent meta-analysis published in 2011, based on the original data, found flaws in the 2010 analyses and suggested that the data indicated <b>reboxetine</b> was effective in severe depression (see <b>Reboxetine</b> § Efficacy). Examples of publication bias are given by Goldacre and Wilmshurst.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reboxetine</b> is {{contraindicated}} in narrow-angle glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, patients concomitantly on MAOIs {{and those}} hypersensitive to <b>reboxetine</b> {{or any of}} its excipients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reboxetine</b> has two chiral centers. Thus, four {{stereoisomers}} may exist, the (R,R)-, (S,S)-, (R,S)-, and (S,R)-isomers. The {{active ingredient}} of <b>reboxetine</b> is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, the (R,R)-(-)- and (S,S)-(+)-isomer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reboxetine</b> is {{a fairly}} {{selective}} norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) with approximately 20.4x selectivity for the norepinephrine transporter over the serotonin transporter. Despite this selectivity <b>reboxetine</b> does slightly inhibit the reuptake of serotonin at therapeutic doses.|$|E
50|$|Both the (R,R)-(-) and (S,S)-(+)-enantiomers of <b>reboxetine</b> are {{predominantly}} metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme.The primary metabolite of <b>reboxetine</b> is O-desethylreboxetine, {{and there are}} also three minor metabolites - Phenol A, Phenol B, and UK1, Phenol B being the most minor.|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{reliance}} on CYP3A4, <b>reboxetine</b> O-desethylation is markedly inhibited by papaverine and ketoconazole. It weakly inhibits CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. <b>Reboxetine</b> is an intermediate-level inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, which gives it the potential to interact with ciclosporin, tacrolimus, paroxetine, sertraline, quinidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine.|$|E
5000|$|Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs): atomoxetine, mazindol, <b>reboxetine.</b>|$|E
50|$|A meta {{analysis}} published in BMJ in 2011 {{concluded that the}} selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor <b>reboxetine</b> is indistinguishable from placebo {{in the treatment of}} depression. A second review by the European Medicines Agency concluded that <b>reboxetine</b> was significantly more effective than placebo, and that its risk/benefit ratio was positive. The latter review, also examined the efficacy of <b>reboxetine</b> as a function of baseline depression, and concluded that it was effective in severe depression and panic disorder but did not show effects significantly superior to placebo in mild depression.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} much debate as to whether <b>reboxetine</b> is more efficacious than placebo into the {{treatment}} of depression. According to a 2009 meta-analysis of 12 second-generation antidepressants, <b>reboxetine</b> was no more effective than placebo, and was [...] "significantly less" [...] effective, and less acceptable, than the other drugs in treating the acute-phase of adults with unipolar major depression.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQEHC) {{published}} {{results of}} a meta-analysis of clinical trial data for <b>reboxetine</b> in acute depression, which included data on about 3000 subjects that Pfizer had never published but had mentioned; IQEHC had combed through Pfizer's publications and <b>reboxetine</b> approvals and had determined this data was missing from the publication record. The analysis of the complete data set yielded a result that <b>reboxetine</b> was not more effective than placebo but had more side effects than placebo and more than fluoxetine; the paper led to widespread and sharp criticism of Pfizer, and stronger calls for publication of all clinical trial data.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Reboxetine</b> is {{considered}} a relatively low-risk antidepressant in overdose. The symptoms are as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|IQWiG hit {{international}} {{headlines in}} October 2010 {{with a report}} slamming <b>Reboxetine</b> as inefficient and harmful.|$|E
5000|$|The British MHRA said in September 2011 {{that the}} study had several limitations, and that [...] "Overall the balance of {{benefits}} and risks for <b>reboxetine</b> remains positive in its authorised indication." [...] A UK and Europe-wide review of available efficacy and safety data has confirmed that <b>reboxetine</b> has benefit over placebo in its authorised indication. Efficacy was clearly shown in patients with severe or very severe depression.|$|E
50|$|Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) such as <b>reboxetine</b> {{prevent the}} reuptake of norepinephrine, {{providing}} a different {{mechanism of action}} to treat depression. However <b>reboxetine</b> is no {{more effective than the}} SSRIs in treating depression. In addition, atomoxetine has found use in the treatment of ADHD as a non-addictive alternative to Ritalin. The chemical structure of atomoxetine is closely related to that of fluoxetine (an SSRI) and also duloxetine (SNRI).|$|E
50|$|In the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence {{ranking of}} 10 {{antidepressants}} for efficacy and cost-effectiveness citalopram is fifth in effectiveness (after mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline) and fourth in cost-effectiveness. The ranking results {{were based on}} the meta-analysis by Andrea Cipriani. In another analysis by Cipriani, citalopram was found to be more efficacious than paroxetine and <b>reboxetine,</b> and more acceptable than tricyclics, <b>reboxetine,</b> and venlafaxine, but less efficacious than escitalopram.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reboxetine</b> {{has been}} found to inhibit both brain and cardiac GIRKs, a {{characteristic}} it shares with the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine.|$|E
50|$|Overall in the {{aforementioned}} 2009 meta-analysis <b>reboxetine</b> was significantly less well-tolerated {{than the other}} 11 second-generation antidepressants compared in the analysis.|$|E
50|$|Structurally related drugs include dapoxetine, duloxetine, edivoxetine, femoxetine, paroxetine, <b>reboxetine,</b> and viloxazine, all {{of which}} act, similarly, as monoamine reuptake inhibitors, and most of which are, again similarly, antidepressants.|$|E
5000|$|Edronax is {{the brand}} name of <b>reboxetine</b> in every English-speaking country that has {{approved}} it for clinical use. Brand names include (where † denotes a product {{that is no longer}} marketed): ...|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{clinical}} trials have provided {{support for the}} efficacy of <b>reboxetine</b> {{in the treatment of}} attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in both the short and long-term and in both children/adolescents and adults.|$|E
50|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 12 new-generation antidepressants showed that sertraline and escitalopram {{are the best}} in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of adults with unipolar major depression. <b>Reboxetine</b> was significantly worse.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reboxetine</b> was {{discovered}} at Farmitalia-Carlo Erba and {{was first published}} in 1984; Farmitalia did the first clinical studies. Farmitalia was acquired by Pharmacia in 1993, and Pharmacia in turn acquired by Pfizer in 2003.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of an aryloxypropanamine scaffold has generated {{a number of}} potent MAOIs. Before the development of duloxetine, the exploration of aryloxypropanamine SAR resulted {{in the identification of}} fluoxetine and atomoxetine. The same motif can be found in <b>reboxetine</b> where it is constrained in a morpholine ring system. Some studies have been made where the oxygen in <b>reboxetine</b> is replaced by sulfur to give arylthiomethyl morpholine. Some of the arylthiomethyl morpholine derivatives maintain potent levels of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. Dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition resides in different enantiomers for arylthiomethyl morpholine scaffold. Possible drug candidates with dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitory activity have also been derived from piperazine, 3-amino-pyrrolidine and benzylamine templates.|$|E
50|$|Esreboxetine is a {{selective}} norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor which was under development by Pfizer {{for the treatment}} of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia but failed to show significant benefit over currently available medications and was discontinued. It is the (S,S)-(+)-enantiomer of <b>reboxetine</b> and is even more selective in comparison.|$|E
50|$|The {{locus coeruleus}} may figure in {{clinical}} depression, panic disorder, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and anxiety. Some medications including norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (<b>reboxetine,</b> atomoxetine), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine, duloxetine), and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (bupropion) {{are believed to}} show efficacy by acting upon neurons in this area.|$|E
5000|$|Atomoxetine (or <b>reboxetine</b> in Europe) is an {{adrenergic}} reuptake inhibitor {{which increases}} wakefulness (generally less strongly than the medications which act on dopamine) {{and which has}} been argued to have a [...] "clear use in the therapeutic arsenal against narcolepsy and hypersomnia although undocumented by clinical trials." ...|$|E
5000|$|Manipulation of {{norepinephrine}} {{suggests it}} may actually {{play a role}} in creating a feeling of fatigue. <b>Reboxetine,</b> an NRI inhibitor, decreased time to fatigue and increased subjective feelings of fatigue. [...] This may be explained by a paradoxical decrease in adrenergic activity lead by feedback mechanisms.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "third {{generation}} antidepressant" [...] {{is sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to newer antidepressants, from the 1990s and 2000s, often selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as; fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft), as well as some non-SSRI antidepressants such as mirtazapine, nefazodone, venlafaxine, duloxetine and <b>reboxetine.</b> However, this usage is not universal.|$|E
