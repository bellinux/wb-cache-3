40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a novel knowledge-based multi-agent system for remote fault diagnosis, which {{is composed of}} learning and diagnostic agents (LDAs), machine agents (MAs) and a central management agent (CMA). Machines are remotely diagnosed by the LDAs through the communication channels between the MAs and the LDAs. When faults that cannot be solved by the present knowledge base occur, the LDAS can acquire new knowledge, translate it into rules using a <b>rule</b> <b>builder,</b> and update the rules into the CKB(Central Knowledge Base). The CKB will become mature through a continuous learning process. A prototype system has been developed and used for remote fault diagnostics of tool wear in computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining...|$|E

In all cases, {{there needs to be}} an underlying data mining system, and this mining system must be highly scalable. To this end, we describe a new rule learner called DataSqueezer. The learner belongs to the family of inductive supervised rule extraction algorithms. DataSqueezer is a simple, greedy, <b>rule</b> <b>builder</b> that generates a set of production rules from labeled input data. In spite of its relative simplicity, DataSqueezer is a very effective learner. The rules generated by the algorithm are compact, comprehensible, and have accuracy comparable to rules generated by other state-of-the-art rule extraction algorithms. The main advantages of DataSqueezer are very high efficiency, and missing data resistance. DataSqueezer exhibits log-linear asymptotic complexity with the number of training examples, and it is faster than other state-ofthe-art rule learners. The learner is also robust to large quantities of missing data, as verified by extensive experimental comparison with the other learners. DataSqueezer is thus well suited to modern data mining and business intelligence tasks, which commonly involve huge datasets with a large fraction of missing data...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper that}} is being {{submitted}} deals primarily {{with the implementation of}} firewall technology on Linux based systems. It focuses on the features of the visual medium for the creation and management of firewall rules, Visual Firewall <b>Rule</b> <b>Builder</b> – VFRB. VFRB has been written in Java and has a modular construction. The program consists of an object-oriented graphical user interface and a policy compiler for iptables. In VFRB, a firewall security policy is a viewed as a set of rules, where each rule is made up of abstract objects that represent real network objects and services (hosts, networks, protocols and so on). VFRB helps maintain a database of objects and enables the editing of firewall policy using simple drag and drop operations. 1 Firewall Survey Network security has become an important issue for companies and private users [1],[3]. Although the Internet has evolved into an extremely powerful tool for the distribution and gathering of information, at the same time, its use is not risk-free. Information theft, computer related criminal activities, data loss, are all potential dangers, that no organization or individual can ignore. In such a dangerous environment as the Internet, a firewall is the best method to safeguard a network. Although a satisfactory level of security can only be achieved when a firewall is used in conjunction with other types of protection, this technology should be at th...|$|E

40|$|General {{knowledge}} is widely applicable, but relatively slow {{to apply to}} any particular situation. Specific knowledge can be used rapidly where it applies, but is only narrowly applicable. We present an automatic scheme to migrate general knowledge to specific knowledge during reasoning. This scheme relies on a nested rule representation which retains the <b>rule</b> <b>builder's</b> intentions about which of the possible specializations of the rule will be most useful. If both general and specific {{knowledge is}} available and applicable, a system may be slowed down by {{trying to use the}} general knowledge as well as, or instead of, the specific knowledge. However, if general knowledge is purged from the system after migration, the system will lose the flexibility of being able to handle different situations. To retain the flexibility without paying the price in speed, a shadowing scheme is presented that prevents general knowledge from being used when specific knowledge migrated from it is available and [...] ...|$|R

During this era the abbey was led by major abbots Dom Hunaud de Gavarret and Dom Ansquitil, who had the doorway and tympanum built.

40|$|A {{study of}} the old master <b>builder's</b> <b>rules</b> for {{structural}} design of arches, vaults and domes, reveals a persistent presence of 'proportional rules', rules that produce structures geometrically similar. The square-cube law, however, demonstrates that in structures subject to their own weight, stresses grow linearly with size, invalidating these rules from an elastic point of view. A more detailed examination {{taking into account the}} problem of stability, i. e. the position of lines or surfaces of thrust, shows that the condition of sufficient stability in masonry structures is what causes an overall geometry for the structure. This excess of dimensions makes that, in fact, the square-cube law begins to apply only to very large spans. The size at which elastic design begins depends on the form of the structure, but for traditional forms, it clearly includes the dimensions of all historical architecture. The rigorous theoretical proof of this argument was implicit in Rankine's theorem of parallel projection as applied to masonry structures. In the present discussion the methods and concepts of Dimensional Analysis have been applied...|$|R

500|$|The Wii U version {{features}} high-definition 1080p {{graphics and}} a special mode that allows up to eight players simultaneously. This mode is restricted to certain larger stages and cannot be played online, though additional stages were made available for eight players via post-release update patches. Various modes from the 3DS version, such as Classic mode, feature various changes in the Wii U version, with some modes allowing two players to play cooperatively or {{against each other in}} other modes. The Wii U version also features three exclusive new game modes; Smash Tour, Special Orders, and Event Mode. Smash Tour is a traditional board game-type mode in which up to four players assemble a team of fighters that they pick up on the board. Players have the ability to change size of the game board, the number of turns, and choose if they allow to have custom characters on the board (not including Miis). In this mode, players earn stat increasing power-ups, triggering various battles and events along the way. Special Orders is a series of challenges set by Master Hand and Crazy Hand, which players can attempt to earn rewards. Each time a battle is won, the reward and the stakes will rise, but if a round is lost, all accumulated prizes will be lost. In Event Mode, one or two players can participate in themed challenges, moving along the path by completion. The Wii U version has vast compatibility with controllers; Wii U GamePad, Wii Remote, Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro, Wii U Pro Controller, GameCube controller through GameCube Controller Adapter for Wii U, and the Nintendo 3DS systems (using either a copy of the 3DS version, or a Smash Controller app released on June 14, 2015). Returning features unique to this version include Special Smash, allowing for unique <b>rules,</b> Stage <b>Builder</b> and Photo mode, which allow players to create personalized stages and dioramas (with a compatible SD card), and demo versions of classic games in a [...] "Masterpieces" [...] gallery. An update on April 15, 2015 added content-sharing features, with a Miiverse stage added for free on June 14, 2015. An update released on July 31, 2015 added an online tournament mode.|$|R
