40|$|Background Reticulocytes are {{the most}} {{sensitive}} index available to authorities who seek to sanction athletes for blood doping based on deviations beyond individual reference ranges. Because such data comprise longitudinal results that are generated by different laboratories, the comparability of <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> from different instruments is of crucial importance. Aims To enhance between-instrument comparability of <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> reported by the Sysmex XT- 2000 i automated haematology analyser. Methods We optimised recalibration of instruments towards assigned values of control material (e-CHECK) in tandem with fresh blood verification. Results In terms of <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> reported {{as a percentage of}} all cells in a fresh blood sample, it was possible to recalibrate all three test instruments so that the mean of 10 samples was within 0. 1 % of the comparative instrument’s mean value. Conclusions This approach provides a straightforward means of reducing between-instrument differences in <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> generated by the Sysmex XT- 2000 i...|$|R
50|$|<b>Reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> {{can now be}} {{performed}} by many analysers, giving an alternative to time-consuming manual <b>counts.</b> Many automated <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts,</b> like their manual counterparts, employ {{the use of a}} supravital dye such as new methylene blue to stain the red cells containing reticulin prior to counting. Some analysers have a modular slide maker which is able to both produce a blood film of consistent quality and stain the film, which is then reviewed by a medical laboratory professional.|$|R

50|$|The {{reticulocyte}} {{production index}} (RPI), also called a corrected <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> (CRC), is a calculated value {{used in the}} diagnosis of anemia. This calculation is necessary because the raw <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> is misleading in anemic patients. The problem arises because the <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> {{is not really a}} count but rather a percentage: it reports the number of reticulocytes {{as a percentage of the}} number of red blood cells. In anemia, the patient's red blood cells are depleted, creating an erroneously elevated <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> is {{decreased}} due to destruction of fragile and abnormal megaloblastic erythroid precursor.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a slight}} {{correlation}} between polychromasia and reticulocytosis. It {{is much easier to}} test for polychromasia in blood cells than to perform special staining for reticulocytosis. If polychromasia is found in the blood cells, the <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> is taken to detect further disease or stress. If a low count of reticulocytes are found, it usually indicates bone marrow stress. If a high <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> is found, it is usually linked to hemolysis, but a Coombs test may be performed in this case to rule out immune-mediated hemolysis. Polychromasia can also be seen in blood smears when there is a normal <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count.</b> This can be caused by infiltration of the bone marrow due to tumors as well as fibrosis, or scarring, of the marrow.|$|E

40|$|<b>Reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> {{are widely}} used in {{laboratories}} to evaluate bone marrow erythropoietic activity and have great diagnostic and prognostic importance {{in the treatment of}} anemias. Reticulocytes are supravitally stained with new methylene blue or brilliant cresyl blue, which highlight the characteristic aspect of the reticulum visible by light microscopy.

40|$|Background: Evaluation of {{bioactivity}} of {{recombinant erythropoietin}} {{is essential for}} pharmaceutical industry, quality control authorities and researchers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare real time RT-PCR and flow cytometry for the assay of biological activity of recombinant erythropoietin. Methods: Three concentrations of recombinant erythropoietin BRP (80, 40 and 20 IU/ml) were injected subcutaneously to mice. After 4 days the blood was collected and used for <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> by flow cytometry and also for the RNA extraction. Real time RT-PCR amplification was carried out for &beta;-globin. Results and conclusion: There was a significant correlation between the total RNA amounts (R 2 = 0. 9995), relative quantity of &beta;-globin mRNA (R 2 = 0. 984) and <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> (R 2 = 0. 9742) with rhEpo concentrations. Total RNA and quantitative RT-PCR showed significant dose dependent results as well the <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> by flow cytometry for the biological activity assay of rhEpo and so these methods could be considered as alternatives for flow cytometry...|$|R
40|$|Insulin receptors on {{erythrocytes}} {{were studied}} in normal and diabetic pregnant women {{to clarify the}} mechanism of insulin resistance in pregnancy. The assays of insulin receptors were performed according to the method of Kobayashi, which is a slight modification of the method of Gambhir. 125 I-insulin binding showed {{no significant differences between}} normal pregnant women during the first (n= 18), the second (n= 15) and the third (n= 54) trimesters and nonpregnant controls (n= 52). There were also {{no significant differences between the}} values before and after delivery (n= 8). <b>Reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> significantly increased in pregnant women during the second trimester and during the later periods. There was a positive correlation between 125 I-insulin binding and <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> in late pregnancy. These findings suggest that <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> should always be considered in estimating erythrocyte insulin receptors in pregnancy. Then, insulin binding in late pregnant women with <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counts</b> below 10 % (n= 20) was studied. The value was slightly decreased as compared to that in the nonpregnant controls, but difference was not significant. 125 I-insulin binding in gestational diabetes (n= 6) was decreased, but that in overt diabetes (n= 4) was not. Patients with overt diabetes had been receiving insulin therapy. Insulin resistance in normal pregnancy cannot be explained by the changes of insulin receptors from this study. It may be due to some post-receptor abnormalities. But decreased insulin binding might be one of the factors that manifest or deteriorate gestational diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Currently, the <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counting</b> is a {{challenge}} for clinical laboratories in Brazil, mainly for the ordinary ones, which still use the manual method. This method has some limitations, since it consists of a laborious method, time consuming, with low accuracy. Objectives: This study has developed and evaluated {{the performance of a}} New Laboratory Protocol for flow cytometry (FC) <b>reticulocytes</b> <b>counting</b> using acridine orange (AO) as dye, aiming to standardize a more precise, easy, fast implementation, and low cost protocol. After standardization of the New Protocol (FC/AO), it was compared with the manual method. The results were analyzed according to the recommendations of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), now known as Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), to evaluate the interchangeability of methods in linear regression analysis and paired t test, besides other quality control tests. Conclusion: Based on these results concerning to the correlation between the methods and the tests related to quality control, we can admit that FC/AO for <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>counting</b> shows undeniable advantages when compared to the preexisting manual method...|$|R
5000|$|Whereas normal reticulocytes {{lose their}} RNA within 24 hours, a {{severely}} anemic {{patient with a}} full erythropoietin response will release reticulocytes that take from 2-3 days to lose their RNA. This {{has the effect of}} raising the <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> simply because reticulocytes produced on any singleday will spend more than 1 day in circulation as reticulocytes and, therefore, will be counted for 2 or more days. The simplest method for correcting the <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count,</b> to obtain a more accurate daily production index, is to divide the corrected count by a factor of 2 (or multiply with ½) whenever polychromasia ( [...] the presence of immature marrow reticulocytes or [...] "shift" [...] cells) is observed on the smear or the immature fraction on the automated counter is increased.|$|E

5000|$|In modern counters, four {{parameters}} (RBC count, hemoglobin concentration, MCV and RDW) are measured, allowing others (hematocrit, MCH and MCHC) to be calculated, {{and compared}} to values adjusted for age and sex. Some counters estimate hematocrit from direct measurements.Reticulocyte counts, and the [...] "kinetic" [...] approach to anemia, {{have become more}} common {{than in the past}} in the large medical centers of the United States and some other wealthy nations, in part because some automatic counters now have the capacity to include reticulocyte counts. A <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> is a quantitative measure of the bone marrow's production of new red blood cells. The reticulocyte production index is a calculation of the ratio between the level of anemia {{and the extent to which}} the <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> has risen in response. If the degree of anemia is significant, even a [...] "normal" [...] <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> actually may reflect an inadequate response.If an automated count is not available, a <b>reticulocyte</b> <b>count</b> can be done manually following special staining of the blood film. In manual examination, activity of the bone marrow can also be gauged qualitatively by subtle changes in the numbers and the morphology of young RBCs by examination under a microscope. Newly formed RBCs are usually slightly larger than older RBCs and show polychromasia. Even where the source of blood loss is obvious, evaluation of erythropoiesis can help assess whether the bone marrow will be able to compensate for the loss, and at what rate.When the cause is not obvious, clinicians use other tests, such as: ESR, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, RBC folate level, serum vitamin B12, hemoglobin electrophoresis, renal function tests (e.g. serum creatinine) although the tests will depend on the clinical hypothesis that is being investigated.When the diagnosis remains difficult, a bone marrow examination allows direct examination of the precursors to red cells, although is rarely used as is painful, invasive and is hence reserved for cases where severe pathology needs to be determined or excluded.|$|E
