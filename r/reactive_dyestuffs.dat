40|$|This study {{compared}} <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs</b> and vat dyestuffs in the dyeing of cotton, {{evaluating the}} reuse of the effluent generated, the ecological costs, {{water and energy}} consumption. The experiments with vat dyestuffs showed slight advantage in ecological costs, generating less molecules of carbon dioxide than the experiments conducted with <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs,</b> lower consumption of energy, greater possibility of reuse of treated effluent, which presented decolorization efficiency above 99 % in all cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented research {{was to examine the}} potential of capillary electrophoresis (CE) for the analysis of structurally different <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs,</b> their activation and posterior hydrolysis, with special focus on optimization of the working conditions. Preliminary, the effect of various additives to the background electrolyte on the resolution improvements versus migration time of Reactive Black 5 as a model dyestuff was investigated. Based on these results, the electropherograms of eight commercially interesting <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs</b> of various chemical structures and their converted forms upon alkaline pH were carried-out. In order to examine the behavior of the reactive dyestuff during the dyeing process, the dye-bath absorbance was monitored throughout the Reactive Black 5 exhaustion, and the conversion of the dye 2 ̆ 7 s form was highlighted using the CE technique. The obtained results unequivocally prove that CE could offer a fast and efficient detection method of structurally different <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs,</b> as well as their hydrolysis products in the dye-baths and effluents later on...|$|E
40|$|Wastewater of baths {{after an}} exhaust dyeing of cotton knitted fabric with <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs,</b> soaping and rinsing was investigated. It {{was found that}} the {{wastewater}} of rinsing baths after dyeing in a light shade, which had a small amount of dyes and electrolytes, could be used for dyeing or rinsing after dyeing in a dark shade. The dyes present in the wastewater can be removed by treatment with cross-linked cationic starch (CCS) with a degree of substitution of about 0, 3. In all cases wastewater must be filtered before reuse. Such a wastewater was used for dyeing of cotton knitted fabrics in a dark shade with a laboratory apparatus. It {{was found that the}} use of wastewater in the dyeing process was risky because in some cases the colour of coloured products did not satisfy colour standards. Filtered wastewater as well as that treated with CCS were used for rinsing after dyeing of cotton and viscose knitted fabrics in a dark shade with <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs</b> in industrial-scale experiments. The colour of dyed textiles satisfied colour standards, and the colour fastness to rubbing was good...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the ability of}} {{chitosan}} to remove acid, basic, <b>reactive</b> and direct <b>dyestuffs</b> by adsorption was studied. The effect of several factors influencing dye adsorption such as dye concentration, grain size, pH and temperature were investigated. Desorption of dyes at different pH was also examined. It was shown that the adsorption capacities of chitosan were comparatively high for acid and direct dyes and that the adsorption was controlled by the acidity of the solution. The kinetics of adsorption {{were found to be}} of pseudo second order. Batch isotherm studies showed that adsorption of dyes from aqueous solution by chitosan was described by the Langmuir equation...|$|R
40|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of our research}} was to compare {{the impact of the}} conventional dyeing process and the power ultrasonic technique on dye-bath exhaustion and, consequently, on dye-bath effluents during the dyeing of four dissimilar fabrics (cotton, viscose, wool and polyamide) using chemically-different <b>dyestuffs</b> (<b>reactive,</b> direct, acid and 1 : 1 metal complex) at two concentrations, regarding different operational parameters, in order toestimate the environmental impact of numerous parameters and dyeing systems. The efficiency of various dyeing procedures was verified by measuring on-line absorbance, followed by the calculation of exhaustion rate. After dyeing, the selected pollution parameters were monitored in dye-baths effluents, i. e. pH, total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5). The obtained results indicated superior exhaustion of dyestuffs during ultrasound assistance in comparison to conventional dyeing, thus causing a reduction in dyeing time and energy consumption. Moreover, the selected pollution parameters were diminished in all the dye-baths effluents after ultrasonic dyeing, thus also enhancing environmental protection...|$|R
40|$|The plasma {{generated}} {{around the}} anode during contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE) {{is a rich}} source of hydroxyl (OH) radicals that can efficiently degrade organic contaminants in aqueous solutions. The degradation of textile azo <b>dyestuffs,</b> <b>Reactive</b> Yellow 176 (Y 3 RS), Reactive Red 239 (R 3 BS) and Reactive Black 5 (B 5), by anodic CGDE was investigated in the presence of chloride (Cl−) ions. The degradation kinetics of the dyes was dependent on the concentration of Cl− ions and on the respective dye being treated. R 3 BS degradation was inhibited by Cl− ions in the range of 0 – 0. 01 M. When the Cl− ion concentration was less than 0. 02 M, the dyes followed pseudo first-order degradation kinetics. For concentrations greater than 0. 02 M, the degradation of Y 3 RS and B 5 was significantly enhanced compared to the degradation of R 3 BS and deviated from first-order reaction kinetics. The presence of Cl− ions (0. 03 M) did not appear to improve dye mineralization but resulted in the formation of adsorbable organic halogens (AOX). The results indicated that the AOX could be abated with prolonged electrolytic treatment. This observation is significant for the assessment of the environmental impact of this technology for wastewater treatment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs</b> {{are used}} {{more than other}} {{suitable}} dyes in dyeing and printing ofcotton fabrics with relatively good washing fastness. Time, temperature and alka-li concentration constitute the most important parameters affecting the fixation process, in other words, the colour yield. Reactive dyes are fixed on cotton through a covalent link formed between the reactive group of the dyestuff and hydroxyl groups of cellulose. It is {{the aim of this}} research to present a model for colour yield as a function of these three parameters. For this purpose, two phase wet fixation dyeing trials were car-ried out for 9 <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs</b> belonging to vinyl sulphone, monocholorotriazine, dichlorotriazine and trichloropyrimidine groups. The samples were padded with dyestuff solution, dried and fixed in fixation baths with conditions according to a matrix of time, temperature and alkali concentraion values. After measuring the reflectance values of these samples, their K/S and FK values were calculated. These values with their related parameters were used to obtain models through regression analysis. From the first set of obtained models for the nine dyestuffs, only one met the necessary conditions. Modification was carried out for the other eight and at the end five other models could be accepted as a representation of the colour yield of the dyes as a function of time, tem-perature and alkali concentration...|$|E
40|$|Textile {{materials}} {{provide a}} simple and convenient protection against UV radiation. To assign the degree of UV radiation protection of textile materials, the Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) is commonly used. This paper reports the effect of woven fabric construction (yarn fineness, type of weave, relative fabric density), the colour of bi-functional <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs,</b> and Cibacron dyed fabrics on the ultraviolet protection of light summer woven fabrics. A predictive model, determined by genetic programming, was derived to describe the influence of fabric construction. Warp and weft densities, weave factor and CIELab colour components were taken into account by developing the prediction model for UPF. The results show very good agreement between the experimental and predicted values...|$|E
40|$|The {{target of}} the current work {{is to examine the}} effects of {{different}} kinds of finishing treatments on the hand properties of the woven fabrics produced with compact spun yarns. Plain, twill and satin fabrics were produced with 100 % cotton compact yarns in two yarn counts of 20 tex and 12 tex. All the fabrics were divided into two groups and mercerization process was applied to the one of the groups. The mercerized fabrics were dyed and printed with <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs.</b> The other non mercerized groups of fabrics were divided into three such as reactive dyed, reactive printed and pigment printed. As a result, 30 different fabrics were obtained. In order to measure the handle properties of the fabrics objectively, Shirley stiffness tester, circular bending rigidity tester and thickness tester were used. It was determined that yarn count, fabric weave and finishing treatment have a statistically significant effect on handle properties of the fabrics woven with compact spun yarns...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} three natural waste {{materials}} containing chitin {{were used as}} adsorbents for textile dyestuffs, namely the Anodonta (Anodonta cygnea) shell, the Sepia (Sepia officinalis) and the Squid (Loligo vulgaris) pens. The selected dyestuffs were the Cibacron green T 3 G-E (CI reactive green 12), and the Solophenyl green BLE 155 % (CI direct green 26), both from CIBA, commonly used in cellulosic fibres dyeing, the most used fibres in the textile industry. Batch equilibrium studies showed that the materials’ adsorption capacities increase after a simple and inexpensive chemical treatment, which increases their porosity and chitin relative content. Kinetic studies suggested {{the existence of a}} high internal resistance in both systems. Fixed bed column experiments performed showed an improvement in adsorbents’ behaviour after chemical treatment. However, in the column experiments, the biodegradation was the main mechanism of dyestuff removal, allowing the materials’ bioregeneration. The adsorption was strongly reduced by the pore clogging effect of the biomass. The deproteinised Squid pen (grain size 0. 500 – 1. 41 mm) is the adsorbent with highest adsorption capacity (0. 27 and 0. 037 g/g, respectively, for the <b>reactive</b> and direct <b>dyestuffs,</b> at 20 ºC), followed by the demineralised Sepia pen and Anodonta shell, behaving like pure chitin in all experiments, but showing inferior performances than the granular activated carbon tested in the column experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of 17 selected process effluents, 11 <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs</b> and 8 auxiliaries from a textile dyeing and finishing mill in Ayazaga, Istanbul, Turkey was evaluated by bioluminescence test using bacteria Vibrio fischeri in LUMIStox 300. The EC 20 and EC 50 for auxiliaries, the EC 20 for dyestuffs were determined. For selected process effluents GL-values, the dilution {{level at which}} a wastewater sample causes less than 20 % inhibition, were examined. Our results demonstrate that the toxicity assessment with luminescent bacteria is effective and of practical use for chemicals applied in textile finishing industry with the limitation of the deep dark-colored dye bath samples and for the related effluents. Inhibition effects of numerous dyestuffs as well as auxiliaries to luminescent bacteria differed considerably with a range 5 - 600 mg 1 (- 1) for EC 20 and 9 - 6930 mg 1 (- 1) for EC 50, respectively. Among 17 effluents, 1 sample exhibited high toxicity (GL = 100), 7 showed moderate toxicity (GL = 12 32), and 9 had a GL-value < 10 indicating a low or no toxicity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{recipe for}} {{reactive}} dyeing of cotton {{can be divided}} into three steps: the pretreatment. the dyebath and the final rinse. The consumption of chemicals and water in the rinse {{has been found to be}} considerable: three quarters of the total COD discharge of the recipe have relations to auxiliary chemicals used and three quarters of the total water consumption have relation to the rinse. The improvement potential in the rinsing procedure were found to be considerable. and [he newly developed recipe focuses on improvements in the rinse. Tests with the new recipe have documented that neutralization, detergents and complexing agents can be left out completely with no adverse effect on product quality. All recognized tests of fastness and shade have been performed and evaluated in cooperation with the dyehouses. More than 50 full-scale dyeing experiments have been carried out in jets, overflow and drum batch machines. The experiments include 25 different <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs,</b> among these azo. anthrachinon. phtalocyanin and formazan dyestuffs. including both monoreactive and bireactive dyestuffs of which 15 had the vinyl sulfone as reactive group.

Hot membrane filtration of the hot rinsing uater has been investigated in parallel projects and i t is documented that membrane filtration saves chemicals, water and production time, and also gives larg...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the removal of}} various (DyStar and CIBA) <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs</b> (red - blue - yellow) and their {{trichromatic}} mixtures was examined by flotation techniques. The scope of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of dispersed - air flotation (DispAF), dissolved - air flotation (DAF) and electroflotation (EF), {{in the treatment of}} simulated aqueous solutions and, consequently, of real industrial textile effluents, originating either from the dyeing reactor or from the equalization tank of a dye-house, bearing the same dyes as the simulated effluents. The main objectives were to characterize the experimental parameters affecting the three flotation processes, such as: the concentration and sort of dye (single dye solution, trichromatic mixture, real effluent), the concentration of added surfactants (CTAB, SDS), polyelectrolyte (Neoflock, PE) and flocculant (Zetag 87), the presence of electrolyte (NaCl) in the solution, the tension of the direct electric current (applied in electroflotation). To meet the demands of conservation of resources and sustainable development, this study was followed up by dyeing experiments and ultrasonic irradiation in order to investigate the possibility of water reuse and dyestuff degradation, respectively. The results of this study show that flotation seems to be an effective process for the removal of coloring matter from simulated effluents and textile industry effluents. Treated water could be totally reused in textile dyeing, if a small amount of supplement dye is used. The presence of collector in the effluent, in small quantities, favors the destruction of coloring matter. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2007. The {{removal of}} colour from {{effluent}} after dyeing of cellulosic fibres {{is a major}} problem due to the difficulty in treating such effluents by conventional treatment methods. Cellulosic fibres of a specific shade (colour) are produced by reacting the fibres with a mixture of <b>reactive</b> <b>dyestuffs,</b> salt and auxiliary chemicals. Reactive dye exhaustion to the fibre is about 80 % i. e. 20 % remains in the effluent; this is hydrolysed dye which cannot be reused for dyeing. The exhausted reactive dye bath together with first rinse represents 6 to 30 L effluent/kg of fabric and most of the colour and salt. The total water consumption for reactive dyeing ranges from 25 to 100 L effluent/kg fabric while the water consumption from total textile finishing ranges from 30 to 150 L effluent/kg fabric. Thus the concentration of the dye and salts are 5 times more concentrated when obtained at source. The use of activated carbon adsorption for the removal of colour from exhausted dyebath for the re-use of water, salt and energy has been studied. Four different commercial reactive dye chemistries and associated auxiliaries were tested and commercial activated carbon was used as an adsorbent. Different temperatures (20 °C to 100 °C), pH values (acidic, neutral, basic) and salt concentrations (50 g/L to 100 g/L) were evaluated and the high adsorption results were achieved when using high temperature, low pH (acidic) and high salt concentrations. The Freundlich adsorption parameters were obtained for activated carbon adsorption capacity and adsorption bond strength between reactive dyes and activated carbon. The overall removal of the reactive dye shades was 36 % to 53 % (based on colour in the effluent), salt recovery was about 94 % to 97 %, the water recovery ranged from 14 % to 25 % and energy savings of 17 % to 32 % could be achieved. Column adsorption test were performed at different temperatures and flowrates. The saturated activated carbon was regenerated and repeatedly used by elution with 1. 0 M NaOH. The regenerated carbon was found to be effective up to 3 cycles of operations. A column system for treatment of reactive dyes using activated carbon was designed. The outcome of this study showed that treatment of reactive dyebath with activated carbon adsorption technique can allow re-use of water, salt and energy, thus enabling environmental improvements with a savings in salt, energy, water and treatment costs...|$|E
