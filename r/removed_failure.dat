[...] The objective of this was not due to any excesses {{on the part of the}} band, but was a method to determine how much attention to detail the crew at a local venue paid to the requests specified in the rider. Should the bowl be absent, or if brown M&M's were present, it would give band members reason to suspect other, legitimate, technical and safety issues were also being performed poorly or were outright overlooked. David Lee Roth stated in his autobiography that this request was made as a result of faulty workmanship at a venue on an earlier tour which nearly cost the life of a member of Van Halen's road crew. He added that at one venue where he found brown M&M's, the management's failure to read weight requirements in the rider resulted in the band's equipment sinking through the floor and causing over $80,000 of damage.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Fabricated {{steel beam}} {{specimens}} with rectangular holes {{cut in the}} webs were subjected to load tests to analyze {{the behavior of the}} modified section. Beam-depth to hole-depth ratio was in all cases 2. 0; however, ratio of hole length to hole height varied from 2. 0 to 3. 0. The primary instrumentation of electrical resistance strain gages was located at ratios of nominal bending moment to shear for the solid section of 40 and 64. Instrumentation was located with regard to flexural behavior in the tee-sections, rather than the determination of stress concentrations near the hole corners. The approximate Vierendeel method, although not new, is developed for the analysis of beams with web holes; such beams are commonly called Vierendeel beams. Also included is a more precise development of the Vierendeel analogy by matrix analysis techniques. Experimental strain results are correlated with predictions by both the approximate Vierendeel analysis, which is currently used for design analysis, and by the actual Vierendeel analysis. Experimental deflection results are correlated with deflection predictions by the actual Vierendeel analysis. Predictions by the theory of elasticity method are discussed, but due to the complexities of the solution, comparisons with the experimental results are not presented. Tests in which the beam specimens were loaded to failure were conducted to study the type of failure when web material is <b>removed.</b> <b>Failure</b> was a form of lateral instability before the desired failure mode was obtained...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that such {{mechanical}} factors as arterial hypertension or valvular defects increase the work of the myocardium and so result in cardiac enlargement. The amount of this compensatory response, however, varies strikingly from case to case. Even when all the known factors tending to produce hypertrophy and those known to limit it are comparable, some hearts are found at autopsy to have doubled their size while others have remained essentially unchanged. These differences are at present unexplained and stimulate further interest in the actual mechanism of the compensatory process itself. Compensatory hypertrophy is easily produced in one kidney after ablation of the other. This has been shown to occur in dogs, rabbits, and rats 1 ' 2, 9, 1 Furthermore, McQueen-Williams and Thompson, ' in carefully controlled experiments on rats, have shown that hypertrophy does not occur if the pituitary has been <b>removed.</b> <b>Failure</b> of the remaining kidney to enlarge after hypopliysectomy has been reported by Gonzalez! in experiments on batrachians. Similar results with rat adrenal and thyroid have been obtained. 4 ' 5 11 It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to contribute a preliminary report on the relation of the pituitary body to compensatory renal hypertrophy in dogs. Method Young adult dogs of good stock (from dealers, but not thoroughbred) were subjected, under nembutal anesthesia, to transpharyngeal hypophysectomy as described by McLean. 7 The advantages of this method are that it is comparatively easy technically and causes less shock to the animal than does the elevation of a bone flap. Only the dura surrounding the sella is incsed. However, it has the disadvantage of being performed through the pharynx, which never provides an aseptic field for operation. Several dogs were lost from a basilar meningitis. Also, the exposure, limited by the oval of the surrounding circular sinus, makes difficult a complete removal of the proximal portion of the hypophyseal stalk...|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of inexpensive, on demand synthetic DNA has enabled numerous powerful applications in biotechnology, in turn driving considerable present {{interest in the}} de novo synthesis of increasingly longer DNA constructs. The synthesis of DNA from oligonucleotides into products even as large as small viral genomes has been accomplished. Despite such achievements, the costs and time required to generate such long constructs has, to date, precluded gene-length (and longer) DNA synthesis from being an everyday research tool {{in the same manner}} as PCR and DNA sequencing. A critical barrier to low-cost, high-throughput de novo DNA synthesis is the frequency at which errors pervade the final product. Here, we employ a DNA mismatch-binding protein, MutS (from Thermus aquaticus) to <b>remove</b> <b>failure</b> products from synthetic genes. This method reduced errors by > 15 -fold relative to conventional gene synthesis techniques, yielding DNA with one error per 10 [*] 000 base pairs. The approach is general, scalable and can be iterated multiple times for greater fidelity. Reductions in both costs and time required are demonstrated for the synthesis of a 2. 5 kb gene...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{research}} is {{on the development of}} the concept of floating flexible thin film arrays for renewable electricity generation, in marine and lacustrine application areas. This research was motivated by reliability issues from wave energy converters which are prone to large loads due to the environment which they are exposed in; a flexible system would not need to withstand these loads but simply yield to them. The solid state power take off is an advantage of photovoltaic (PV) technology which <b>removes</b> <b>failure</b> risks associated with mechanical machinery, and also potential environmental hazards such as hydraulic oil spillage. The novelty of this technology requires some development before it could even be considered feasible for large scale installation. Techno-economics are a big issue in electricity developments and need to be scoped in order to ensure that they would be cost-competitive in the market and with other technologies. Other more technical issues relate to the change in expected electrical yield due to the modulation of the PV array according to the waves and the electrical performance of the PVs when in wet conditions. Results from numerical modelling of the modulating arrays show that there is not expected variation in electrical yield at central latitudes (slightly positive), although at higher latitudes there could be considerable depreciation. With regards to the electrical performance a notable improvement was measured due to the cooling effect, slight decrease in performance was also estimated due to water absorption (of ~ 1. 4 %) within the panels. Overall results from both economic and technical analysis show the feasibility of the concept and that it is a possibility for future commercialisation. Doctoral These...|$|R
