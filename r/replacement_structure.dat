50|$|Microbial {{cellulose}} {{has also}} been used for internal treatments, such as bone grafts and other tissue engineering and regeneration. A key ability of microbial cellulose for medical applications {{is that it can}} easily be molded into various shapes while still retaining all of its useful properties. By molding microbial cellulose into long, hollow tubes, they can be used as <b>replacement</b> <b>structures</b> for several different areas, such as the cardiovascular system, the digestive tract, urinary tract, or the trachea. A recent application of microbial cellulose has been as synthetic blood vessels and stents. The cellulose can also be modeled into mesh membranes {{that can be used for}} internal <b>replacement</b> <b>structures,</b> such as the brain's outer membrane, the dura mater. In addition to <b>replacement,</b> these <b>structures</b> have also been used as grafts to interact with existing internal biological material. Microbial cellulose {{has also been}} used in guided tissue regeneration. Bioprocess ® and Gengiflex ® are some of the common trademarked products of microbial cellulose that now have wide applications in surgery and dental implants. One example involves the recovery of periodontal tissues by separating oral epithelial cells and gingival connective tissues from the treated root surface.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with the quality of}} the concrete and steel, it was initially envisioned that the bridge would be dismantled and replaced by a newly designed footbridge. Due to complaints about this course of action, plans for its removal were not finalised until 2012.

The building was closed, and portable classrooms were used instead of Keyser's 17 classrooms. The mold grew due to runoff from the hillside the building was situated on. Keyser Hall was demolished {{during the summer of}} 2006; a state-of-the-art <b>replacement</b> <b>structure,</b> also named Keyser Hall, was opened in January 2009.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} LeRoy Barnett, [...] "this county highway {{quickly became}} one of the most popular motoring destinations in the Midwest." [...] The Ironwood Daily Globe reported that in December 1938, [...] "at least one million persons" [...] had traveled on Brockway Mountain Drive in the first five years it was open, sparking a tourism boom in the area. The eastern end of the roadway was paved in 1938, with the final [...] done in 1940. The first Skytop Inn was built at the summit of Brockway Mountain in 1935. A <b>replacement</b> <b>structure</b> was built in 1965. During the first few winters of 1946/47 and 1947/48, a ski hill was operated down the roadway on the western end.|$|E
50|$|The Phoenix Union {{student body}} {{finally began to}} shrink; at the same time, it began to be {{composed}} of more minorities. In one decade's time, Phoenix Union had shrunk from its all-time high student enrollment to just 1,860 students. At its closure, enrollment had shrunk to a mere 1,200 students. A new building for the vocational center and some <b>replacement</b> <b>structures</b> {{were built in the}} late 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The east end, last to be {{completed}} in 1968 during the original construction, was the first to be demolished, {{with the exception of the}} JCPenney Auto Center. The demolition crew worked from east to west, and as one part of the structure was completely removed, construction on <b>replacement</b> <b>structures</b> began. The only original structure left in the redevelopment was the former Foley's building, which was renovated to house the new Englewood Public Library and City Hall.|$|R
5000|$|The original, Kirkbride plan, {{structure}} was still around in 1960 for its centennial and {{was known as}} [...] "Old Main", but {{the second and third}} floors of the wings were not being used for patients due to fire-related safety concerns. However, with <b>replacement</b> <b>structures</b> finished in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it would not survive much longer. Demolition began on the west wing of Old Main starting in September 1964. The central wing of Old Main dated to 1860 and the west wing dated back to 1862.|$|R
500|$|It is {{probable}} that a new city hall {{was built on the}} site of the Stadt Huys around 1740; historians at the New York State Museum (NYSM) claim it was 1741. Growing tired of increasingly cramped space, the city government was able to secure funds from the provincial government to construct a new city hall on the same site. This building was also commonly known as the Stadt Huys, even though it was a completely new structure and the English had been in control of New York for more than 75 years. The NYSM describes the new Stadt Huys as a three-story brick structure, adding that it was a [...] "more substantial building" [...] than its predecessor. This new building was the third-largest building in Albany, surpassed only by the local Dutch church (though not the one that stands today) and Fort Albany. The roof of the new structure was gabled and was topped with a cupola and belfry. Howell and Tenney claim that the original Stadt Huys was in use for at least 160 years (meaning a <b>replacement</b> <b>structure</b> would not have been needed until 1795 at the earliest), which is in disagreement with the idea that a new Stadt Huys was built in the 1740s.|$|E
2500|$|Founded in 1137 {{following}} the Treaty of Mautern, the partially constructed Romanesque church was solemnly dedicated in 1147 to Saint Stephen {{in the presence}} of Conrad III of Germany, Bishop Otto of Freising, and other German nobles who were about to embark on the Second Crusade. [...] Although the first structure was completed in 1160, major reconstruction and expansion lasted until 1511, and repair and restoration projects continue to the present day. From 1230 to 1245, the initial Romanesque structure was extended westward; the present-day west wall and Romanesque towers date from this period. In 1258, however, a great fire destroyed much of the original building, and a larger <b>replacement</b> <b>structure,</b> also Romanesque in style and reusing the two towers, was constructed over the ruins of the old church and consecrated 23 April 1263. The anniversary of this second consecration is commemorated each year by a rare ringing of the Pummerin bell for three minutes in the evening.|$|E

50|$|As one of {{the oldest}} 400-series freeways, several vintage {{overpasses}} have been demolished in recent years to accommodate the future expansion of Highway 400 to a ten-lane freeway in the section from Vaughan to Barrie. Sixteen of these historic structures, sub-standard by today's freeway requirements, remained as of summer 2009, with all slated for replacement in the near future. In order to preserve some of this heritage the Ministry of Transportation created a 1800mm x 1625mm reusable urethane mould of the provincial coat-of-arms from the 5th Line overpass located south of Bradford, which will be used to decorate the <b>replacement</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R
40|$|Regeneration is a {{remarkable}} feat that varies across the animal kingdom. For example, certain salamanders and fish completely regenerate lost appendages while the mammalian capacity to regenerate either limbs or digits is limited. Successful regeneration requires not only generation of new tissues but also patterning the newly formed tissues into suitable <b>replacement</b> <b>structures.</b> The information responsible for this patterning is called positional memory. Despite years of study, many of the factors responsible for positional memory during vertebrate appendage regeneration remain to be discovered. To help bridge this knowledge gap, here zebrafish pectoral fin regeneration was utilized to identify positional memory factors in a genetically tractable vertebrate. The identification of candidate positional memory factors was accomplished through morphological measurements, gene expression analysis, the generation of transgenic zebrafish, and chemical treatments. Using these methods, two strikin...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{automated}} {{building of}} a protein model into an electron density map remains a challenging problem. In the ARP/wARP approach, model building is facilitated by initially interpreting a density map with free atoms of unknown chemical identity; all structural information for such chemically unassigned atoms is discarded. Here, this is remedied by applying restraints between free atoms, and between free atoms and a partial protein model. These are based on geometric considerations of protein structure and tentative (conditional) assignments for the free atoms. Restraints are applied in the REFMAC 5 refinement program and are generated on an ad hoc basis, allowing them to fluctuate from step to step. A large set of experimentally phased and molecular <b>replacement</b> <b>structures</b> showcases individual structures where automated building is improved drastically by the conditional restraints. The concept and implementation we present can also find application in restraining geometries, such as hydrogen bonds, in low-resolution refinement...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{so-called}} freeze-foaming method, for achieving open porous and mainly interconnected foam structures, was {{combined with the}} Additive Manufacturing technique Lithography-based Ceramic Manufacturing which provides personalized and complex 3 D structures. After a co-sintering step, composite structures, combining the advantages of dense and porous features in one single part were achieved. These novel potential bone <b>replacement</b> <b>structures</b> might serve as possible next-generation bioceramics/-composites used for personalized implants which, additionally, allow a structural adaption according to the customer's needs. In other current projects, metal-ceramic composites were obtained by tape-casting technologies and reshaping methods like lamination and deep drawing. After final co-sintering demonstrators of a bipolar scissor and a miniature button-sized device for medical application were developed. These composites provide biocompatible and isolating properties given by zirconia {{and at the same}} time, conductive properties given by steel layers.
