40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} identification of qualified and adulterated oil product using hyperspectral imaging(HIS) technique, a novel feature set based on quantized histogram matrix (QHM) and feature selection method using improved kernel independent component analysis (iKICA) is proposed for HSI. We use UV and Halogen excitations in this study. Region of interest(ROI) of hyperspectral images of 256 oil samples from four varieties are obtained within the spectral region of 400 - 720 nm. Radiation indexes extracted from each ROI are used as feature vectors. These indexes are individual band <b>radiation</b> <b>index</b> (RI), difference of consecutive spectral band <b>radiation</b> <b>index</b> (DRI), ratio of consecutive spectral band <b>radiation</b> <b>index</b> (RRI) and normalized DRI (NDRI). Another set of features called quantized histogram matrix (QHM) are extracted by applying quantization on the image histogram from these features. Based on these feature sets, improved kernel independent component analysis (iKICA) is used to select significant features. For comparison, algorithms such as plus L reduce R (plusLrR), Fisher, multidimensional scaling (MDS), independent component analysis (ICA), and principle component analysis (PCA) are also used to select the most significant wavelengths or features.

40|$|Abstract. We {{analyze the}} degree of spatial {{organization}} of soil moisture {{and the ability of}} terrain attributes to predict that organization. By organization we mean systematic spatial variation or consistent spatial patterns. We use 13 observed spatial patterns of soil moisture, each based on over 500 point measurements, from the 10. 5 ha Tarrawarra experimental catchment in Australia. The measured soil moisture patterns exhibit a high degree of organization during wet periods owing to surface and subsurface lateral redistribution of water. During dry periods there is little spatial organization. The shape of the distribution function of soil moisture changes seasonally and is influenced by the presence of spatial organization. Generally, it {{is quite different from the}} shape of the distribution functions of various topographic indices. A correlation analysis found that ln(a), where a is the specific upslope area, was the best univariate spatial predictor of soil moisture for wet conditions and that the potential <b>radiation</b> <b>index</b> was best during dry periods. Combinations of ln(a) or ln(a/tan(b)), where b is the surface slope, and the potential solar <b>radiation</b> <b>index</b> explain up to 61 % of the spatial variation of soil moisture during wet periods and up to 22 % during dry periods. These combinations explained the majority of the topographically organized component of the spatial variability of soil moisture a posteriori. A scale analysis indicated that indices that represent terrain convergence (such as ln(a) or ln(a/tan(b))) explain variability at all scales from 10 m up to the catchment scale and indices that represent the aspect of different hillslopes (such as the potential solar <b>radiation</b> <b>index)</b> explain variability at scales from 80 m to the catchment scale. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the organizing processes and in terms of the use of terrain attributes in hydrologic modeling and scale studies. A major limitation on the predictive power of terrain indices is {{the degree of}} spatial organization present in the soil moisture pattern at the time for which the prediction is made. 1...|$|E

The reserve has an underlying substrate of aeolian sand dunes, which create a unique landscape with a varying topographic relief. This results in a difference in exposure to solar radiation among the different topographic units, which again affects growth conditions of {{the different types of}} vegetation through for example moisture. Sampling of data was done under a stratified approach with 8 transects of 8 plots each. Within these plots, measurements were made of relative <b>radiation</b> <b>index,</b> number of recruits, DBH structure, degree of canopy cover and cover of ground vegetation. Soil samples were taken to estimate moisture and loss-on-ignition. Several analyses were done with the compiled data, including correlation, t-tests, regression, multiple regression and analysis of spatial autocorrelation. The size of adult trees varied greatly, depending on which topographic unit they were located on, and its specific growth conditions. Regeneration was mostly successful for the native Pinus sylvestris, whereas the introduced pine, Pinus mugo ssp. uncinata had little to no on-going reproduction. The inferential statistics indicated that difference in exposure to solar radiation (expressed as <b>radiation</b> <b>index)</b> across the sand dunes had an effect on the %-moisture in the soil, which also affects distribution of lichens and ericaceous dwarf shrubs. Regeneration of Scots pine was interpreted to be strongly inhibited by lichens as well as ericaceous dwarf shrubs (mainly heather) when one life-form dominated the ground vegetation. However, a mosaic of both life forms gave the optimal conditions for Pinus sylvestris seedlings.

In the first part, four selected interpolation algorithms: inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), multiple linear regression method (MLR) and residual kriging (RK) are evaluated due to the quality and plausibility of spatial information, using cross-validation technique and visual inspection of maps. The MLR method is finally found to be the most accurate- in each case regression explains 94 - 95 % of variation, so the inclusion of physically meaningful „environmental “ relationships is found to improve prediction accuracies and quality of maps.
