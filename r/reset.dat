40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} of how to achieve responsiveness in cellular manufacturing systems, with special emphasis given to the rapid <b>resetting</b> between product runs. Findings from action research in cellular manufacturing systems are presented, along with a comprehensive methodology for <b>resetting</b> improvements based on performance evaluation. Summing up, it is argued that long <b>resetting</b> times mainly originate from drawbacks in the manufacturing organisation and not from the manufacturing technology in use. Manufacturing technology for fast and adjustment-free <b>resetting</b> is available today. Short and stable <b>resetting</b> times, however, are strongly dependent on the manufacturing organisation´s ability of continuously maintaining a high level of method utilization, competence development, and system utilisation. Short <b>resetting</b> times are only sustained, if all related work tasks are performed consistently with timeliness and quality. To reach these objectives, an improvement methodology - the RPE framework - is outlined in this thesis. This improvement methodology is derived from considerations of a scientific base for <b>resetting</b> processes. The scientific base and its implications are discussed in the thesis. The framework for <b>resetting</b> performance evaluation - RPE framework - proposed here offers a comprehensive improvement methodology for <b>resetting</b> processes. A detailed procedure on how to evaluate <b>resetting</b> performance on method-, organization-, and profitability levels is provided. The results from performance evaluation hence will guide the improvement work irrespective of the improvement methodology chosen. Further, the use of modern computer tools supporting <b>resetting</b> evaluation and improvement is suggested. <b>Resetting</b> improvement is a constant interplay between work methods, workforce performance, and system utilisation. The scientific evaluation of <b>resetting</b> performance, as proposed in this thesis, builds the base for successful and sustainable improvement of <b>resetting</b> time and responsiveness in cellular manufacturing systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{analyzes}} {{published and}} unpublished data on phase <b>resetting</b> of the circadian oscillator in the fungus Neurospora crassa and demonstrates {{a correlation between}} period and <b>resetting</b> behavior in several mutants with altered periods: As the period increases, the apparent sensitivity to <b>resetting</b> by light and by cycloheximide decreases. Sensitivity to <b>resetting</b> by temperature pulses may also decrease. We suggest that these mutations affect the amplitude of the oscillator and that a change in amplitude {{is responsible for the}} observed changes in both period and <b>resetting</b> by several stimuli. As a secondary hypothesis, we propose that temperature compensation of period in Neurospora can be explained by changes in amplitude: As temperature increases, the compensation mechanism may increase the amplitude of the oscillator to maintain a constant period. A number of testable predictions arising from these two hypotheses are discussed. To demonstrate these hypotheses, a mathematical model of a time-delay oscillator is presented in which both period and amplitude can be increased by a change in a single parameter. The model exhibits the predicted <b>resetting</b> behavior: With a standard perturbation, a smaller amplitude produces type 0 <b>resetting</b> and a larger amplitude produces type 1 <b>resetting.</b> Correlations between period, amplitude, and <b>resetting</b> can also be demonstrated in other types of oscillators.

40|$|Abstract. An {{array of}} phase retarders {{can be used}} as an optical phased array OPA to steer light McManamon et al., Proc. IEEE 842, 268 – 298 1996. The {{introduction}} of <b>resets</b> enables steering to larger angles without requiring an optical path difference OPD greater than one wavelength. These <b>resets,</b> however, are correct only at the design wave-length. The beam steerer is therefore very dispersive. It has been shown theoretically that <b>resets</b> of an integer multiple of the wavelength will make the beam steerer less dispersive McManamon and Watson, Proc. SPIE 4369, 140 – 148 2001. We offer the first experimental proof that <b>resets</b> of n are less dispersive than <b>resets</b> of a single. We also show experimentally that the dispersion associated with fixed period <b>resets</b> does vary, but only within a fixed limit. Last, we show the equivalent of power shifting from one order to the next as larger <b>resets</b> move from being divisible by one integer times the nondesign wavelength toward being divisible by the next integer times the nondesign wavelength...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} {{and extent of}} rapid or acute <b>resetting</b> of the aortic baroreceptors were studied in long-term renal hypertensive rats during 30 minutes of sustained hypertension produced by phenylephrine infusion. The aortic baroreceptors of hypertensive rats exhibited complete <b>resetting</b> to hypertension because during the control period the systolic threshold pressure for activation of the baroreceptors was similar (137 ± 5 vs. 142 ± 4 mm Hg) to the control diastolic pressure. Five minutes after onset of hypertension, a <b>resetting</b> of 32 % (percent change of mean pressure threshold divided by total change of mean pressure) was demonstrable. The extent of <b>resetting</b> was 39 %, 38 %, and 41 % after 10, 20, and 30 minutes of hypertension, respectively. When the percent change of systolic threshold pressure divided by total change of control diastolic pressure was {{used to calculate the}} extent of <b>resetting,</b> similar results were obtained.

40|$|Successful {{approaches}} to the robot localization problem include Monte Carlo particle filters, which estimate non-parametric localization belief distributions. However, particle filters fare poorly at determining the robot’s position without a good initial hypothesis. This problem has been addressed for robots that sense visual landmarks with sensor <b>resetting,</b> by performing sensorbased resampling when the robot is lost. For robots that make sparse, ambiguous and noisy observations, standard sensor <b>resetting</b> places new location hypotheses across a wide region, in positions that may be inconsistent with previous observations. We propose Multi-Observation Sensor <b>Resetting,</b> where observations from multiple frames are merged to generate new hypotheses more effectively.

40|$|Abstract We present here an {{analysis}} of strong, weak, and critical bright-light <b>resetting</b> trials in humans, and report not only phase but also amplitude data for the first time. For this analysis, an appropriate iterative smoothing procedure for phase transition curves is introduced, in which the data are sequenced so as to minimize the perpendicular distance from the data to the smoothed fit. From these smoothed data, we create polar phase-amplitude <b>resetting</b> maps (PARMs) in order to fully illustrate {{the effects of the}} <b>resetting</b> stimuli on both circadian amplitude and phase, and thereby to determine whether these <b>resetting</b> results can be decribed by a phase-only model or whether a phase-amplitude model is required. Our results indicate that a single 5 -hr episode of bright light induces weak type 1 <b>resetting</b> of the human circadian pacemaker. Two cycles of exposure to the same stimulus on consecutive days induce critical <b>resetting,</b> in which significant amplitude reduction may be observed. A three-cycle stimulus induces strong type 0 <b>resetting</b> with different effects on circadian amplitude, depending on the initial phase of the stimulus application. When a three-cycle stimulus is centered near the nadir of the temperature cycle, large phase shifts are achieved via amplitude suppres-sion. However, when this stimulus is centered away from the temperature nadir, smaller phase shifts are achieved in which both small increases and small decreases in circadian amplitude are observed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Self-resetting {{logic is}} a {{commonly}} used piece of circuitry {{that can be}} found in use with memory arrays as word line drivers. Self <b>resetting</b> logic implemented in dynamic logic families have been proposed as viable clock less alternatives. While these circuits can produce excellent performance, they display serious limitations in terms of area cost and power consumption. A middle of the road alternative, which can provide a good performance and avoid the limitations see in dynamic self <b>resetting</b> circuits, would be to implement self <b>resetting</b> behavior in static circuits. This alterative has been introduced recently as self <b>resetting</b> logic. The dynamic circuits are becoming increasingly popular because of the speed advantage over static CMOS logic circuits; hence they are widely used today in high performance and low power circuits. This paper says that by using this self <b>resetting</b> logic the low power VLSI circuits can be designed efficiently for counters...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{characterize}} the excitable gap of the reentrant circuit in atrial flutter. Background. The electrophysiologic substrate of typical atrial flutter has not been well characterized. Specifically, {{it is not known}} whether the properties of the tricuspid valve isthmus differ from those of the remainder of the circuit. Methods. <b>Resetting</b> was performed from two sites within the circuit: proximal (site A) and distal (site B) to the isthmus in 14 patients with type I atrial flutter. <b>Resetting</b> response patterns and the location where interval-dependent conduction slowing occurred were assessed. Results. Some duration of a flat <b>resetting</b> response (mean ± SD 40. 1 ± 20. 9 ms, 16 ± 8 % of the cycle length) was observed in 13 of 14 patients; 1 patient had a purely increasing response. During the increasing portion of the <b>resetting</b> curve, interval-dependent conduction delay most commonly occurred in the isthmus. In most cases, the <b>resetting</b> response was similar at both sites. In three patients, the <b>resetting</b> response differed significantly between the two sites; this finding suggests that paced beats may transiently change conduction within the circuit or the circuit path, or both. Conclusions. Some duration of a flat <b>resetting</b> response was observed in most cases of type I atrial flutter, signifying a fully excitable gap in all portions of the circuit. The isthmus represents the portion of the circuit most vulnerable to interval-dependent conduction delay at short coupling intervals...|$|R
