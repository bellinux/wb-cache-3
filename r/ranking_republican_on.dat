5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, the <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent {{a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E

Richard Lugar (R-Indiana), the <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> the Foreign Relations Committee, {{expressed an interest in}} President Bill Clinton's foundation reject foreign contributions to avoid possible conflict of interest.

50|$|By {{the spring}} of 1939, after the {{collapse}} of the <b>Republican</b> forces <b>on</b> other fronts, it was clear that the Republican cause in Madrid was doomed.

They were opposed by the Republican Colonel Segismundo Casado and others, who wanted to negotiate the surrender of Madrid to spare Republican supporters the worst of the Nationalist retribution.

2500|$|Through his {{testimony}} before Congress on {{issues ranging from}} the Patriot Act to U.S. Attorney firings, he commonly admitted ignorance.

[...] The <b>ranking</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>on</b> the Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter, said to Gonzales, [...] "Your credibility has been breached to the point of being actionable."
