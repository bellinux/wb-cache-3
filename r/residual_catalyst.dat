50|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{conducted}} in attempts to improve the yield and quality of the product obtained using the oxidative polymerization technique. In addition to ferric chloride, other oxidizing agents, including ferric chloride hydrate, copper perchlorate, and iron perchlorate have also been used successfully to polymerize 2,2'-bithiophene. Slow addition of ferric chloride to the monomer solution produced poly(3-(4-octylphenyl)thiophene)s with approximately 94% H-T content. Precipitation of ferric chloride in situ (in order to maximize the surface area of the catalyst) produced significantly higher yields and monomer conversions than adding monomer directly to crystalline catalyst. Higher molecular weights were reported when dry air was bubbled through the reaction mixture during polymerization. Exhaustive Soxhlet extraction after polymerization with polar solvents was found to effectively fractionate the polymer and remove <b>residual</b> <b>catalyst</b> before NMR spectroscopy. Using a lower ratio of catalyst to monomer (2:1, rather than 4:1) may increase the regioregularity of poly(3-dodecylthiophene)s. Andreani et al. reported higher yields of soluble poly(dialkylterthiophene)s in carbon tetrachloride rather than chloroform, which they attributed to the stability of the radical species in carbon tetrachloride. Higher-quality catalyst, added at a slower rate and at reduced temperature, was shown to produce high molecular weight PATs with no insoluble polymer residue. Laakso et al. used a factorial design to determine that increasing the ratio of catalyst to monomer increased the yield of poly(3-octylthiophene), and claimed that a longer polymerization time also increased the yield.|$|E

The surface modification of CNTs with strong acids is usually used to improve the dispersion of CNTs in polar solvents (such as H 2 O, ethanol, and DMF), but that could also disrupt the sp 2 structure and conjugation of the CNTs [12]‐[14].

40|$|Unsaturated polyesters {{based on}} {{ethylene}} glycol have been synthesized {{using a variety}} of anhydride, saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and various catalysts. The structure of the polyesters and the effect of the different compositions on the colour of cured polyesters are studied by FTIR, DSC and colorimetry. The structure of cured polyesters greatly depends on the isomerization of maleic acid to fumaric acid during polyesterification. The colour of unsaturated polyesters cured with the most common curing system (MEKP as initiator and CoNp as accelerator) is firstly influenced by the curing accelerator CoNp via the d-d transitions of the transition metal cobalt. Secondly, the composition of the dicarboxylic acids and anhydride used in the polyesterification influences the colour of the polyesters which depends especially on the isomerization of maleic acid. The cured maleate polyesters have more unreacted double bonds and more polar structure {{because of the presence of}} carbonyl groups, compared to the corresponding fumarate polyesters, and this structure affects the colour.

40|$|We {{report on}} the room {{temperature}} ferromagnetic properties of continuous macroscopic fibers made up of carbon nanotubes grown by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition. Their ferromagnetic behavior originates from the presence of <b>residual</b> <b>catalyst</b> nanoparticles: martensite with 0. 77 wt% C content and FCC Fe. The first is intrinsically ferromagnetic, but the latter only due to severe lattice distortion {{as a consequence of}} C supersaturation. The stabilization of martensite and austenite occurs mainly because of the small diameter of the nanoparticles, in the range of 4 - 20 nm. This is smaller than the embryonic nucleus of the relevant equilibrium phases, but also implies that large C concentrations can build up in FCC Fe before C can be segregated as a stable graphitic nucleus. The room temperature remanence ranges from 10 % to 25 % and the coercivity from 55 to 300 Oe, depending on the choice of promoter for fiber synthesis (S or Se). Superparamagnetic behavior is only observed in S-grown samples on account of the smaller diameter of <b>residual</b> <b>catalyst</b> particles.

Two samples of the copolymer, only differing for the Pd content (9 and 3360 ppm), are considered and compared. The transport of positive carriers is characterized by a lower mobility and a higher dispersion in the Pd-rich PFB-co-FT sample. The photovoltaic parameters of PFB-co-FT:PCBM solar cells show a significant dependence on the <b>residual</b> <b>catalyst</b> impurities, attributed to a different concentration of trap states. Variations in charge mobility and trapping induced by impurities was confirmed also by ESR (Electron Spin Resonance) experiments: an increased concentration of trapped charges {{in the presence of a}} higher level of metal impurities was revealed by light induced ESR, while the variation of polaron mobility correlates with the lifetime variation of the photogenerated PCBM triplet state detected by time-resolved ESR.

The temperature dependence of the time to maximum CL intensity showed an apparent activation energy, Ea, of 88. 1 ± 0. 6 kJ/mol that was independent of [Ti] but the pre-exponential factor, A′, decreased with increasing [Ti] according to a power law: A′= 4. 7 × 10 − 8 [Ti]− 0. 3.
