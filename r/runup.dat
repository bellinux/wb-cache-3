In April 2009, {{it was reported}} that an Apache had been used to intercept a suicide bombing attack in Helmand province. During the Summer of 2009, British Apaches were an integral component of Operation Panther's Claw, which was aimed at pushing insurgents out of civilian areas in the <b>runup</b> to the 2009 Afghan Elections. During this major offensive, Apaches from the UK routinely flew alongside US Cobra helicopters to provide air support to soldiers of 3rd Battalion Black Watch and the Royal Marines conducting ground operations. During the Summer 2009 operations, a senior Taliban leader, Mullah Mansur, and several accomplices were killed in a precision strike launched by an Apache.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{casualties}} and damage were caused by a tsunami affecting the west coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, {{and it was one}} of three tsunamis to occur within a span of six months. <b>Runup</b> heights were measured shortly after the earthquake and reached heights of up to 9.9 meters, though the average height was 3 to 8 meters. The tsunami was disproportionately large for its surface wave magnitude, or Ms, and the duration of the rupture process was 100 s, unusually long for its size. The moment magnitude was 7.6, larger than the 20-s Ms of 7; this Ms–Mw difference is a characteristic of tsunami earthquakes. Tide gages were set up at Corinto and Puerto Sandino, which showed an impulsive tsunami originating 61 minutes after the earthquake. It ran inland 1,000 meters to Masachapa, the hardest hit major town of all, with 9 fatalities.|$|E

40|$|Earthquakes are a {{commonly}} cited mechanism for triggering submarine landslides {{that have the}} potential to generate locally damaging tsunamis. With measured <b>runups</b> of over 35 metres in northern Sumatra from the December 26 th 2004 tsunami source, these <b>runups</b> might be expected to be due, in part, to local submarine landslides. Mapping of the convergent margin offshore of Sumatra using swath bathymetry, single channel seismic and seabed photography reveals that seabed failures are common, but mainly small-scale, and composed of blocky debris avalanches and sediment flows. These failures would have contributed little to local tsunami <b>runups.</b> Large landslides are usually formed where there is significant sediment input. In the instance of Sumatra, most sediment is derived from the oceanic plate, and there is little sediment entering the system from the adjacent land areas. Input from the oceanic source is limited because of the diversion of sediment entering the subduction system off of Sumatra, that is attributed to collision between the Ninetyeast ridge and the Sunda Trench at approximately 1. 5 million years ago...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of firm level beta and volatility around seasoned equity offerings. Beta increases prior to the SEO and decreases thereafter. This pattern is generally consistent with a real options explanation of SEO risk dynamics, but existing models predict a sharp risk drop, while we find a gradual decline. To reconcile this difference, we extend the theory to consider investment commitment and internal financing. In the cross-section, we show that firms with high prior return <b>runups</b> experience larger post-issuance underperformance, {{as well as more}} substantial post-issuance declines in beta. By contrast, large market-wide <b>runups,</b> which might be taken as a measure of sentiment, do not precede either postissuance underperformance or post-issuance beta declines. Finally, equity issues coincide with low points in both own firm and market-wide volatility, suggesting the possibility of volatility timing in corporate financing activities...|$|R
