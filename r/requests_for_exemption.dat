The populations compared were constituted by all patients diagnosed as having breast cancer requesting exemption from making co-payments (ALD 30 entitlement) in 1994 or in 1998. The results showed an increase in the declared number of breast cancers in 1998. This progression could be explained, in part, by a the relative aging of the population. At the same time, part of this increase appears unrelated to age. An analysis of the stages at which this disease was diagnosed demonstrates that in the department of the Puy-de-Dôme, there was a statistically significant increase in the number of breast cancers diagnosed at earlier stages...|$|E
40|$|This series {{comprises}} correspondence files {{maintained in}} the Prime Minister's Office from October 1941, when John Curtin became Prime Minister, to December 1944. The series also reflects the extended periods in 1944 when F M (Frank) Forde was Acting Prime Minister, {{but does not}} include the correspondence for the last six months of Curtin's term of office until his death in early July 1945. The files mainly contain representations made directly to Curtin. The earliest of these relate to matters initially raised with Curtin as Member for Fremantle and then again with him in his capacity as Prime Minister, or matters that were passed on to him from the previous Fadden Government. Some letters are addressed to Curtin's wife (Mrs Elsie Curtin), his Private Secretary (Eric W Tonkin) or, in 1944, to Forde. The correspondence originated from political colleagues, personal friends, branches of political parties (particularly the Australian Labor Party), trade unions, local government authorities, returned servicemen associations, business interests, the general public, churches, women's groups and other community organisations. The subject matter is wide ranging, relating to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>exemption</b> or release from military service, pay and conditions of servicemen and their families, pensions, rationing, liquor question, censorship, manpower, effect of particular National Security Regulations, requisitioned property, aliens and internees, war loans, daylight saving, pay-as-you-earn taxation, comments on the government's conduct of the war and expressions of support, American Forces in Australia, 1944 referendum, appointment of HRH the Duke of Gloucester as Governor-General, re-appointment of S M Bruce as High Commissioner in London, post-war planning etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis is}} to analyse {{practical}} impacts of special rules for determination of applicable legislation {{in accordance with the}} Regulation No. 883 / 2004 and its implementing Regulation No. 987 / 2009. Further the thesis seeks to identify potential negative effects connected to application of the single insurance principle as well as deficiencies arising out of practical performance of European coordination and to discuss the eventual solutions to undesirable effects caused by weak sides of coordination regulations. The thesis is divided into four chapters: an introduction is followed by a chapter about general principles of European coordination of social security systems and about current developments in this field. The topic of a second part is an institute of posting according to Art. 12 of the Regulation No. 883 / 2004, a distinction here is made between employees and self-employed persons. This chapter further contains procedural rules and an overview of issued portable documents A 1 (E 101 forms) during the years 2009 - 2011. Third chapter deals with pursuit of activities in two or more Member States in accordance to Art. 13 of the Regulation No. 883 / 2004. Special attention is paid to a fine line between posting and pursuit of activities. A problem with retroactive determination of applicable legislation is discussed in the last subchapter of the thesis. This problem is being recently solved by Czech institutions and employers. They are trying to find a solution preventing negative consequences of such a retroactive determination. Exception governed in Art. 16 of the Regulation No. 883 / 2004 is a subject of the fourth chapter. Situations where an exception is a possible and suitable solution are presented here as well as statistics about <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>exemption</b> from Czech resp. foreign laws...|$|E
