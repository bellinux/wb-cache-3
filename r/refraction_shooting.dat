40|$|The compressional and the {{shear wave}} {{velocities}} in the Greenland ice sheet {{are derived from}} seismic records of the EGIG 1959. Further the variation of velocities in the firn and the dependance of Poisson's ratio from depth are determined. At Station Centrale, two P-waves are recorded from underground layers. Their velocities show that the ice basement consists of crystalline rocks. The P-wave velocities derived from reflections agree well with those obtained by <b>refraction</b> <b>shooting.</b> From this agreement results that the ice is ± homogenous and ± isotropic for Pwaves. The elastic constants for isotropic ice are calculated. Finally the temperature dependence of the velocities is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Summary An {{ensemble}} of geophysical techniques: airborne radio echo sounding combined with magnetic and gravity measurements {{as well as}} surface seismic <b>refraction</b> <b>shooting</b> provide high levels of resolution of the sub-ice surface and its material properties and hence geological inferences. Residual magnetic anomaly fields are produced by variations {{in the distribution of}} magnetised material in the uppermost crustal layers. In order to model possible structures and geological units from magnetic surveys magnetic susceptibilities are required. During long-range airborne geophysical missions in the later 1970 s by the Scott Polar Research Institute in conjunction with National Science Foundation and Technical University of Denmark magnetic data were collected over West Antarctica and have been reported by Jankowski (1981). To assist their interpretation magnetic susceptibility measurements were made of rocks specimens from West Antarctic outcrops collected or assembled by Cam Craddock and examples of their use in the modelling the geophysical architecture of West Antarctica are outlined.

40|$|Refraction and {{reflection}} seismic studies {{were made on}} the route between from Station No. 102 and Station No. 227 during the trip across the Yamato Mountains (See Fig. 1). We used the seismic equipment with 24 recording channels and geophones having the natural frequency of 20 cps (type M- 3), supplied by the Electro-Technical Labs. It was mounted on a caboose hauled by a snow-car, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The 12 geophones were placed at intervals of 20 m, straightly along the traverse route. The shots for the reflection shooting ranged from 1 to 2 kg of TNT placed in 2 shot-holes, drilled 1 or 2 m apart at depths between 4 m and 6 m {{in the center of}} the 12 geophones. Velocity variation with depth for P wave was calculated for Station No. 95 using the equation: h = 1 /π∫^D_ 0 cosh^ (V_D) /(V_x) dx, where h=depth at which velocity V_D occurs; x=horizontal distance; V_x=velocities from travel time curve in Fig. 6. The travel time curve was plotted from the results of <b>refraction</b> <b>shooting</b> at Station No. 95. Fig. 7 shows variation of the velocity of P wave with depth. Further, from the curve, density variation with depth in neve was deduced by the equation: ρ= 2. 21 × 10 ^ V_P+ 0. 059, whereρis density in g/cm^ 3 and V_p is velocity of P wave in m/s. The result is shown in Fig. 12. As is known from the figure the rate of increase of density with depth in this area is larger than in the Ross Shelf and Queen Maud Land. The reflection shooting was performed at intervals of 10 km on the route of 270 km in total length. Ice thickness profile obtained from the seismic prospecting is shown in Fig. 10. As seen in this figure, 3 deep valleys were detected beneath the traverse route. These may be the sources of the Shirase Glacier...|$|E
