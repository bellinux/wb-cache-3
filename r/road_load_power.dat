40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{approaches}} to vehicle traction and propulsion analysis have used spread-sheets or numerical integrations {{owing to the}} diculty in deriving closed-form solutions. This is inconvenient if a parameter is to be varied, and {{it is even more}} dicult when multiple parameters of a complex model are evaluated at the design phase. In this paper, it is intended to formulate two non-linear dierential equations representing <b>road</b> <b>load</b> and <b>power</b> consumption. By expanding inertia force, air drag, rolling resistance, gravitational force and tyre tractive force, the equations can be simplied as functions of velocity v, i. e. s 1 vb=s 2 s 3 v 2 and mvb=(r 1 v 3 r 2 v+r 3) /v respectively. With these two equations, engineers can use either numerical or analytical methods to study key parameters at the design phase. To demonstrate the eectiveness of these equations, Wright State’s electric car model is used. The results for front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive cases are presented...|$|R

40|$|Load {{forecasting}} {{has always}} been the essential part of an efficient power system planning and operation. Several electric power companies are now forecasting <b>load</b> <b>power</b> based on conventional methods. However, since the relationship between <b>load</b> <b>power</b> and factors influencing <b>load</b> <b>power</b> is nonlinear, it is difficult to identify its nonlinearity by using conventional methods. Most of papers deal with 24 -hour-ahead load forecasting or next day peak load forecasting. These methods forecast the demand power by using forecasted temperature as forecast information. But, when the temperature curves changes rapidly on the forecast day, <b>load</b> <b>power</b> changes greatly and forecast error would going to increase. In conventional methods neural networks uses all similar day's data to learn the trend of similarity. However, learning of all similar day's data is very complex, and it does not suit learning of neural network. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the neural network structure and learning time. To overcome these problems, we propose a one-hour-ahead load forecasting method using the correction of similar day data. In the proposed prediction method, the forecasted <b>load</b> <b>power</b> is obtained by adding a correction to the selected similar day data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} a simple <b>load</b> <b>power</b> {{estimator}} for the three-phase quasi-direct ac-ac converter system is reported. Since the ac-ac converter control {{by means of}} pulse-width modulation (PWM) {{is based on the}} power balance concept, its <b>load</b> <b>power</b> should be known. Two control boards, based on the dSMC (digital Smart Motion Controller) 30 MIPS 32 -bit fixed-point digital signal processor (DSP), were involved in the ac-ac system driving. By using the power balance control, the DC link voltage variation at the load changes can be reduced. In this way a small DC link capacitor is required to handle the dc voltage error control. The feed-forward (Sul and Lipo, 1990) current component provides fast correction of the reference control to <b>load</b> <b>power</b> variation. In order to obtain the feed-forward current component, the <b>load</b> <b>power</b> must to be known. In this paper the <b>load</b> <b>power</b> is estimated from the dc link, indirectly, through a dc load current estimator. In this way the author overcomes the use of the serial communication between control boards (Gaiceanu, 2004) in order to deliver the <b>load</b> <b>power</b> information from the inverter side. The load current estimator is based on the DC link voltage and on the load current of the supply converter. This method presents certain advantages instead of using measured method, which requires a low pass filter: no time delay, the feed-forward current component has no ripple, no additional hardware, and more fast control response. Through simulation and experimental results the performances of the proposed load current estimator scheme are demonstrated...|$|R
