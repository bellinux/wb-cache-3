5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity hold, they expose a <b>relationship</b> suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This <b>relationship</b> can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a <b>relationship</b> named real interest rate parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate.

In 2002, Liz arrives in Harmony to seek revenge on her sister, who left her in an abusive household, but Eve keeps Liz's identity as her adoptive sister a secret from her family and the town. In a 2002–2004 storyline, Eve relies more on Julian as Liz attempts to expose her and seduce her husband. Eve works with Julian to find their child. Overwhelmed by Liz's desire for vengeance {{and the search for}} her child, Eve is unaware of Whitney's <b>relationship</b> with Chad. The storyline culminates in July 2004, when Liz brings Eve's aunt Irma Johnson to tell T. C. the truth about her <b>relationship</b> with Julian and their child. Whitney turns against her mother, incorrectly assuming that her child with Julian is Chad (making her <b>relationship</b> with him incestuous). T.

Path analyses with cross-lagged effects indicated transmission from adolescent-parent, but not inter-parental, conflict management styles to adolescent-friend and adolescent-partner relationships: Conflict engagement and positive problem solving utilized by adolescents in conflicts with parents were significantly, positively related to conflict engagement and positive problem solving, respectively in adolescent-friend <b>relationships</b> 1 year later and adolescent-partner <b>relationships</b> 2 years later. No significant longitudinal effects emerged with regard to withdrawal. For all three conflict management styles, the results yielded no mediation of adolescent-parent <b>relationships</b> between inter-parental and adolescent-friend/partner <b>relationships.</b> Thus, the study showed that the way adolescents manage conflicts with parents, but not inter-parental conflict management, predicts how adolescents handle conflicts later on in <b>relationships</b> outside the family...|$|R
5|$|Grand Forks has {{an active}} sister city program {{designed}} to encourage cultural and economic exchanges. Grand Forks' first sister city was Ishim in the Soviet Union. The <b>relationship</b> with the Siberian city formally began in 1984 during the Cold War. Sometime in the late 1990s, however, political and economic turmoil in Russia ended the <b>relationship.</b> While the <b>relationship</b> with Ishim faded, Grand Forks found a new sister in Awano, Japan. An informal <b>relationship</b> began in 1994 when the school districts of both cities began exchanging students. In 1998, the two formally proclaimed themselves sister cities. The most concrete evidence of the <b>relationship</b> {{between the two is}} a Japanese rock garden in Grand Forks' Sertoma Park and a sculpture of an American bison in an Awano park. However, the annexation of Awano by the larger city of Kanuma has led {{to the end of the}} sister city <b>relationship.</b> Grand Forks' <b>relationship</b> with Dickinson, North Dakota, began in 2002, when delegations from each city visited the other. Grand Forks Mayor Michael Brown has said he thinks having friends in western North Dakota, which typically has diverging interests from eastern cities, could help at the state legislature. Sarpsborg, Norway, became a sister city in 2005 following several exchanges among leaders from both cities. The city became interested in building a <b>relationship</b> with Sarpsborg because many Grand Forks residents have Norwegian heritage.|$|E

40|$|Topological <b>relationships</b> between {{objects in}} space are of great {{importance}} in many disciplines. Due {{to the lack of}} local topological information between components, i. e. faces, in the model of topological <b>relationships</b> between complex regions, recently, localized topological <b>relationships</b> have been defined for complex regions based on the <b>relationships</b> between simple regions with holes. However, unlike for simple regions, topological <b>relationships</b> between simple region with holes are not widely implemented. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach to derive topological <b>relationships</b> between simple regions with holes based on well known topological <b>relationships</b> between the simple regions as their components. This will allow localized topological predicates between complex regions to be implemented using only topological <b>relationships</b> between simple regions. Furthermore, localized topological predicates between complex regions can be used to implement topological <b>relationships</b> between complex regions. Therefore, this work allows topological <b>relationships</b> between complex regions to be implemented using only topological <b>relationships</b> between simple regions. ...|$|R
