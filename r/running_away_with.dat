Jelliffe, asked for another adjournment to await the arrival of Willis to testify to the collision. Voorhees opposed the adjournment and moved for Jackalow's immediate release {{on the ground that}} there was no jurisdiction because no crime had been proved to have been committed. Jeliffe replied that he intended to charge murder, piracy, and <b>running</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> a vessel with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an adjournment until Tuesday at 11am.

5|$|Serious {{damage is}} rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser <b>running</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> {{little more than}} a few {{scratches}} to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.|$|E

Psychiatrists and doctors who were consulted, stated she had nothing to run away from but had rather enthusiastically looked forward to the future. It was also suggested that her body could have been weighed down and sunken in Lake Dallas, which was too large and too deep to be dragged. Virginia knew three of the victims who were murdered by the [...] "Phantom Killer", and thus, it was wondered if he {{had something to do with}} her disappearance.|$|R

That defeat left United two points behind Dunfermline, and the final game of the season was against third-placed Morton.

25|$|The season it {{all came}} {{together}} for the Runnin’ Rebels was 1989–90. Future NBA star Larry Johnson transferred from Odessa College, joining Greg Anthony, Stacey Augmon, David Butler and Anderson Hunt. The Rebels began the season ranked No. 1 in almost every poll and rolled through the competition. UNLV suffered a surprising loss at New Mexico State and finished the season as co–champions of the Big West Conference. However, Johnson and Co. flexed their muscles in the Big West Tournament, <b>running</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the title and the No. 1 seed in the West Region. In NCAA Tournament play, the Rebels toughest game came {{in the third round}} at Oakland, Calif., when Ball State hung tough before falling 69–67. UNLV also ended Loyola Marymount’s Cinderella season with a 131–101 thrashing in the regional final. The win set up a semifinal match with Georgia Tech at McNichols Arena in Denver. Trailing by seven at the half, UNLV rallied for an 89–80 triumph and a date in the championship. The 1990 NCAA Championship was all UNLV as an 18–0 run midway through the second half sent Duke reeling as the Rebels ran up the most lopsided victory in championship history, 103–73. Hunt was named Most Outstanding Player at the Final Four for his performance as the Rebels finished the season 35–5. The squad was inducted into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Halas's {{replacement}} was Jim Dooley. In Dooley's {{first season}} {{at the helm of}} the team, the Bears finished with a 7–7 record. The low point of the season, though, was not the mediocre performance but a career threatening knee injury to Gale Sayers, from which he never fully recovered. The decade though was highlighted with the 1969 season. After Sayers's injury, back-up running back Brian Piccolo did not believe he deserved the job because of the injury. Instead of <b>running</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> his opportunity as most athletes would, Piccolo, who was a popular figure in the Chicago area and roomed with Sayers for a few years on road trips, during the entire off-season pushed Sayers to get his knee back into football playing shape. Sayers got back into the lineup, and Piccolo was back on the bench when the season started. Sayers rushed for 1,000 yards and earned the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. This was the ultimate display of friendship between Piccolo and Sayers, who were friends despite race differences within society during the 1960s. The Bears finished the season, even with Sayers's performance, with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. The Bears' hopes worsened due to the fact that they have the No. 2 pick, while the Steelers have the first overall pick (with the Bears defeating them), allowing Pittsburgh to draft future Hall-of-Famer Terry Bradshaw.|$|E
25|$|Upon his return, Frank {{was once}} again pivotal to many {{explosive}} storylines including accidentally killing Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) with his car, his marriage to Peggy, and a battle {{to regain control of}} The Queen Vic from Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). However, in early 2000, Reid began to go through some poor health. After suffering with nervous exhaustion, which he attributed to EastEnders grueling filming schedule, Reid was forced to take an unplanned break from the show. Penned scripts and plots had to be completely rewritten to account for his absence, including the departure of Sid Owen who played Reid's on-screen son Ricky. The storyline initially planned to have Frank and Ricky involved in one of EastEnders renowned two-hander episodes, but due to Reid's absence Steve McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell, had to stand in for the episode; resulting in a slightly less plausible plotline. Upon Reid's return further problems arose, allegedly regarding the producers decision not to allow him to attend a charity function that was being held in his honour. Reid allegedly quit in protest, although the BBC have since denied this. Reid was persuaded by producer John Yorke to remain in the role for a further six months in order to facilitate one further explosive storyline. Frank resumed his relationship with old flame Pat whilst still married to Peggy, but was famously caught out and shamed by his fuming wife in front of a packed pub on Guy Fawkes Night 2000, although Pat had decided against <b>running</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> Frank at the last minute.
