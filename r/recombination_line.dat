40|$|Based on {{high quality}} {{observations}} of multiplet V 1 of OII and the NLTE atomic computations of OII we study the density and temperature {{of a sample}} of HII regions. We find that the signature for oxygen rich clumps of high density and low temperature is absent in all objects of our sample: one extragalactic and eight Galactic HII regions. The temperatures derived from: a) <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> of OII, and b) <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> of HI together with Balmer continua are lower than those derived from forbidden lines, while the densities derived from <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> of OII are similar or smaller than densities derived from forbidden lines. Electron pressures derived from collisionally excited lines are about two times larger than those derived from <b>recombination</b> <b>lines.</b> These results imply that the proper abundances are those derived from <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> and suggest that other processes in addition to direct photoionization, such as dissipation of turbulent energy in shocks, magnetic reconnection, and shadowed regions, might {{be responsible for the}} large ADF and t 2 values observed in HII regions.

40|$|We {{examine the}} use of {{submillimeter}} (submm) <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> of H, He, and He^+ to probe the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) luminosity of starbursts (SBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find that the submm <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> of H, He, and He^+ are in fact extremely reliable and quantitative probes of the EUV continuum at 13. 6 eV to above 54. 6 eV. At submm wavelengths, the <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> originate from low energy levels (n = 20 - 50). The maser amplification, which poses significant problems for quantitative interpretation of the higher n, radio frequency <b>recombination</b> <b>lines,</b> is insignificant. Lastly, at submm wavelengths, the dust extinction is minimal. The submm line luminosities are therefore directly proportional to the emission measures (EM_(ION) = n_e × n_(ion) × volume) of their ionized regions. We also find that the expected line fluxes are detectable with ALMA and can be imaged at ~ 0. " 1 resolution in low redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Imaging of the H I lines will provide accurate spatial and kinematic mapping of the star formation distribution in low-z IR-luminous galaxies, and the relative fluxes of the H I and He II <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> will strongly constrain the relative contributions of SBs and AGNs to the luminosity. The H I lines should also provide an avenue to constraining the submm dust extinction curve...|$|R

In the near future, the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) will allow observers to study <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> in the radio and submillimetre regimes in unprecedented detail.

40|$|We present {{models of}} {{physical}} conditions in Perseus arm clouds {{observed in the}} direction of Cas A. Theoretical predictions of carbon radio <b>recombination</b> <b>line</b> intensities are compared with observations spanning the frequency range 14 to 775 MHz. Best-fitting model parameters are then combined with the results of lambda 21 cm H I absorption line observations, and low-frequency hydrogen <b>recombination</b> <b>line</b> observations, to evaluate the thermal and pressure balance in these clouds. A critical reexamination of the available <b>recombination</b> <b>line</b> data shows that the lowest frequency carbon line observations have underestimated the integrated optical depths in the line by up to a factor of 3. This is due to the removal of large Lorentzian wings from the pressure broadened line profiles during baseline subtraction. Models where {{some or all of the}} <b>recombination</b> <b>line</b> optical depth originates in molecular clouds do not give satisfactory results. Models based on standard calculations of <b>recombination</b> <b>line</b> intensites (Salem & Brocklehurst 1979; Walmsley & Watson 1982) have high pressures and are out of thermal balance. We modified the theoretical calculation of line intensities, described by Salem & Brocklehurst (1979) and Walmsley & Watson (1982), by imposing a different boundary condition at large principal quantum number n. Instead of assuming an infinite number of levels populated according to thermodynamic equilibrium, we impose a cutoff in level populations above a critical principal quantum number ncr, as suggestd b y Gulyaev & Nefedov (1989). We followed the occupation probability formalism presented by Hummer & Mihalas (1988) to calculate ncr. Using these new line intensity calculations, we find that, with the exception of the <b>recombination</b> <b>line</b> width, all of the Cas A <b>recombination</b> <b>line</b> and lambda 21 cm H I absorption line data can be attributed to a region where the physical conditions are typical of the cold neutral medium of the interstellar medium.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of carbon radio <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> towards Cassiopeia A using LOFAR {{observations}} in the frequency range 10 - 33 MHz. Individual carbon α lines are detected in absorption against the continuum at frequencies as low as 16 MHz. Stacking several Cα lines we obtain detections in the 11 - 16 MHz range. These are the highest signal-to-noise measurements at these frequencies. The peak optical depth of the Cα lines changes considerably over the 11 - 33 MHz range with the peak optical depth decreasing from 4 × 10 ^- 3 at 33 MHz to 2 × 10 ^- 3 at 11 MHz, while the line width increases from 20 km s^- 1 to 150 km s^- 1. The combined change in peak optical depth and line width results in a roughly constant integrated optical depth. We interpret this as carbon atoms close to local thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work we focus on how the 11 - 33 MHz carbon radio <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> {{can be used to}} determine the gas physical conditions. We find that the ratio of the carbon radio <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> to that of the 158 μm [CII] fine-structure line is a good thermometer, while the ratio between low frequency carbon radio <b>recombination</b> <b>lines</b> provides a good barometer. By combining the temperature and pressure constraints with those derived from the line width we are able to constrain the gas properties (electron temperature and density) and radiation field intensity.

Aims. We work out theoretically and suggest to observe previously unexplored class of spectral lines [...] metal recombination lines in optical and near-infrared bands [...] emitted by the cold ionized and cooling plasma in the fast-moving knots. Methods. By tracing ion radiative and dielectronic recombination, collisional $l$-redistribution and radiative cascade processes, we compute resulting oxygen, silicon and sulphur <b>recombination</b> <b>line</b> emissivities.
