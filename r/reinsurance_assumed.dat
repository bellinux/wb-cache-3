50|$|Property {{including}} treaty business, as well {{as direct}} and facultative coverage for commercial and industrial risks against physical damage and business interruption. The treaty account covers cedants on a global basis, predominantly on an “excess of loss” basis for both per risk and catastrophe coverage, with {{a limited amount of}} proportional treaty and <b>reinsurance</b> <b>assumed</b> business.|$|E
50|$|Providers cannot afford reinsurance, {{which would}} further deplete their {{inadequate}} capitation payments, as the reinsurer's expected loss costs, expenses, profits and risk loads {{must be paid}} by the providers. The goal of reinsurance is to offload risk and reward to the reinsurer in return for more stable operating results, but the provider's additional costs make that impractical. <b>Reinsurance</b> <b>assumes</b> that the insurance-risk-transferring entities do not create inefficiencies when they shift insurance risks to providers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the determination of}} optimal retention in a stop-loss <b>reinsurance.</b> <b>Assume</b> that we only have incomplete information on a risk XX for an insurer, we use an upper bound for the value at risk (VaR) of the total loss of an insurer after stop-loss reinsurance arrangement as a risk measure. The adopted method is a distribution-free approximation which allows to construct the extremal random variables {{with respect to the}} stochastic dominance order and the stop-loss order. We derive the optimal retention such that the risk measure used in this paper attains the minimum. We establish the sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of the nontrivial optimal stop-loss reinsurance. For illustration purpose, some numerical examples are included and compared with the results yielded in Theorem 2. 1 of Cai and Tan (2007). postprin...|$|R
40|$|This is the author's {{version of}} the article. In this paper we {{consider}} a <b>reinsurance</b> syndicate, <b>assuming</b> that Pareto optimal allocations exist. Under a continuity assumption on preferences, we show that a competitive equilibrium exists and is unique. Our conditions allow for risks that are not bounded, and we show that the most standard models satisfy our set of sufficient conditions, which are thus not too restrictive. Our approach is to transform the analysis from an infinite dimensional to a finite dimensional setting...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of maximizing the expected discounted utility of dividend payments for an insurance company that controls risk exposure by purchasing proportional <b>reinsurance.</b> We <b>assume</b> the preference of the insurer is of CRRA form. By solving the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, we identify the value function and the corresponding optimal strategy. We also analyze the asymptotic behavior of the value function for large initial reserves. Finally, we provide some numerical examples to illustrate the results and analyze {{the sensitivity of the}} parameters...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{threshold}} proportional reinsurance strategy and we analyze the effect on some solvency measures: ruin probability and time of ruin. This dynamic <b>reinsurance</b> strategy <b>assumes</b> a retention level that is not constant and depends {{on the level of}} the surplus. In a model with inter-occurrence times being generalized Erlang(n) -distributed, we obtain the integro-differential equation for the Gerber-Shiu function. Then, we present the solution for inter-occurrence times exponentially distributed and claim amount phase-type(N). Some examples for exponential and phase-type(2) claim amount are presented. Finally, we show some comparisons between threshold reinsurance and proportional reinsurance...|$|R
40|$|We compare {{two types}} of {{reinsurance}}: excess of loss (EOL) and largest claim reinsurance (LCR), each of which transfers the payment of part, or all, {{of one or more}} large claims from the primary insurance company (the cedant) to a reinsurer. The primary insurer’s point of view is documented in terms of assessment of risk and payment of reinsurance premium. A utility indifference rationale based on the expected future dividend stream is used to value the company with and without <b>reinsurance.</b> <b>Assuming</b> the classical compound Poisson risk model with choices of claim size distributions (classified as heavy, medium and light-tailed cases), simulations are used to illustrate the impact of the EOL and LCR treaties on the company’s ruin probability, ruin time and value as determined by the dividend discounting model. We find that LCR is at least as effective as EOL in averting ruin in comparable finite time horizon settings. In instances where the ruin probability for LCR is smaller than for EOL, the dividend discount model shows that the cedant is able to pay a larger portion of the dividend for LCR reinsurance than for EOL while still maintaining company value. Both methods reduce risk considerably as compared with no reinsurance, in a variety of situations, as measured by the standard deviation of the company value. A further interesting finding is that heaviness of tails alone is not necessarily the decisive factor in the possible ruin of a company; small and moderate sized claims can also {{play a significant role in}} this...|$|R
50|$|First {{announcements}} {{about the}} establishment of TMR with an initial capital of US$ 125 million in Bermuda were made in 2000. TMR was expected to start its operation beginning of April 2000 with Shin-ichiro Okada named as CEO. The parent company initially announced that TMR's primary mission was not to earn a profit through <b>assumed</b> <b>reinsurance</b> but to use reinsurance {{as a tool to}} make effective use of its capital.|$|R
40|$|A purely {{theoretical}} reinsurance {{model is}} presented, where the <b>reinsurance</b> contract is <b>assumed</b> to be simultaneously of an excess-of-loss {{and of a}} proportional type. The stochastic structure of the set of pairs (claim's arrival time, claim' sizes) is described by a Spatial Mixed Poisson Process. By using an invariance property of the Spatial Mixed Poisson Processes, we estimate the amount that the ceding company obtains in a fixed time interval in force of the reinsurance contract...|$|R
5000|$|Insurance {{companies}} {{allege that}} asbestos litigation has taken too heavy {{a toll on}} insurance and industry. A 2002 article in the British Daily Telegraphs associate quoted Equitas, the <b>reinsurance</b> vehicle which <b>assumed</b> Lloyds of Londons liabilities, which argued that asbestos claims were the [...] "greatest single threat to Lloyds of Londons existence." [...] Of note is that Lloyds of London had been sued for fraud by its investors, who claimed Lloyds misrepresented pending losses from asbestos claims.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal dividend problem with proportional reinsurance and capital injection {{for a large}} insurance portfolio. In particular, the <b>reinsurance</b> premium is <b>assumed</b> to be calculated via the variance principle instead of the expected value principle. Our objective is to maximize the expectation of the discounted dividend payments minus the discounted costs of capital injection. This optimization problem is studied in four cases depending on whether capital injection is allowed and whether there exist restrictions on dividend policies. In all cases, closed-form expressions for the value function and optimal dividend and reinsurance policies are obtained. From the results, {{we see that the}} optimal dividend distribution policy is of threshold type with a constant barrier, and that the optimal ceded proportion of risk exponentially decreases with the initial surplus and remains constant when the initial surplus exceeds the dividend barrier. Furthermore, we show that the optimization problem without capital injection is the limiting case of the one with capital injection when the proportional transaction cost goes to infinity. © 2011 Elsevier B.
