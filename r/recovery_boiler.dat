25|$|Development of <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> {{main steam}} {{pressure}} and temperature was rapid at the beginning. By 1955, not even 20 years from birth of <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> highest steam pressures were 10.0 MPa and 480oC. The pressures and temperatures used then backed downward somewhat due to safety. By 1980 {{there were about}} 700 recovery boilers in the world.|$|E

25|$|<b>Recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> is {{the part}} of Kraft process of pulping where {{chemicals}} for white liquor are recovered and reformed from black liquor, which contains lignin from previously processed wood. The black liquor is burned, generating heat, which is usually used in the process or in making electricity, much as in a conventional steam power plant. The invention of the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> by G.H. Tomlinson in the early 1930s was a milestone in the advancement of the kraft process.|$|E

25|$|The first <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> had {{horizontal}} evaporator surfaces, {{followed by}} superheaters and more evaporation surfaces.

25|$|Fourth {{generation}} {{air systems}} are the multilevel {{air and the}} vertical air. As the feed of black liquor dry solids to the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> have increased, achieving low sulfur emissions is not anymore {{the target of the}} air system. Instead low NOx and low carryover are the new targets.|$|E
25|$|Combustion {{of black}} liquor in the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> furnace {{needs to be}} {{controlled}} carefully. High concentration of sulfur requires optimum process conditions to avoid production of sulfur dioxide and reduced sulfur gas emissions. In addition to environmentally clean combustion, reduction of inorganic sulfur must be achieved in the char bed.|$|E
25|$|Some {{features}} of the original <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> have remained unchanged to this day. It was the first recovery equipment type where all processes occurred in a single vessel. The drying, combustion and subsequent reactions of black liquor all occur inside a cooled furnace. This is the main idea in Tomlinson’s work.|$|E
40|$|Heat <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> {{are widely}} used in process plants for {{recovering}} energy from various waste gas streams, either from the consideration of process or of economy. Sulfuric, as well as nitric, acid plant heat <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> are examples {{of the use of}} heat recovery due primarily to process considerations. On the other hand, cost and payback are main considerations in the case of gas turbine and incineration plants, where large quantities of gases are exhausted at temperatures varying from 800 ?F to 1800 ?F. This gas, when recovered, can result in a large energy savings and steam production. This paper attempts to outline some of the engineering considerations in the design of heat <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> for turbine exhaust applications (combined cycle, cogeneration mode), incineration plants (solid waste, fume) and chemical plants (reformer, sulfuric acid, nitric acid) ...|$|R

25|$|Feed {{water comes}} {{in through the}} {{economizer}} and then exits after having attained saturation temp in the water or steam circuit.

25|$|The heat <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> is item 5 in the COGAS figure shown above. No {{combustion}} of fuel {{means that}} there is no need of a fuel handling plant, and it is simply a heat exchanger.

25|$|A modern <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> {{consists}} of {{heat transfer surfaces}} made of steel tube; furnace-1, superheaters-2, boiler generating bank-3 and economizers-4. The steam drum-5 design is of single-drum type. The air and black liquor are introduced through primary and secondary air ports-6, liquor guns-7 and tertiary air ports-8.

25|$|<b>Recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> also {{improved}} the smelt removal. It is removed {{directly from the}} furnace through smelt spouts into a dissolving tank. Some of the first recovery units employed the use of Cottrell’s electrostatic precipitator for dust recovery.|$|R
25|$|Concentrated {{black liquor}} {{contains}} organic dissolved wood residue {{in addition to}} sodium sulfate from the cooking chemicals added at the digester. Combustion of the organic portion of chemicals produces heat. In the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> heat is used to produce high pressure steam, {{which is used to}} generate electricity in a turbine. The turbine exhaust, low pressure steam is used for process heating.|$|E
25|$|Recovery boilers {{have been}} the {{preferred}} mode of Kraft mill chemical recovery since the 1930s and {{the process has been}} improved considerably since the first generation. There have been attempts to replace the Tomlinson <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> with recovery systems yielding higher efficiency. The most promising candidate appears to be gasification, where Chemrec's technology for entrained flow gasification of black liquor could prove to be a strong contender.|$|E
25|$|To achieve solid {{operation}} and low emissions the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> air system {{needs to be}} properly designed. Air system development continues and has been continuing as long as recovery boilers have existed. As soon as the target set for the air system has been met new targets are given.

40|$|Black liquor is a {{byproduct}} of the chemical pulping process and a critical source of energy for the pulp and paper industry. It contains the spent caustic cooking chemicals and the organic content from the wood liberated during the cooking process. Conventionally, black liquor is incinerated in <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> to recover {{energy in the form}} of steam and the cooking chemicals in the form of molten salt. The steam can be used in the mill for heating and drying; it can also be used in a steam turbine to generate electricity. However, <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> are not thermally efficient in comparison with coal or gas fired power generation boilers. Clearly, improvements in efficiency will result in considerable cost savings. Therefore, alternative technologies have attracted increasing interest recently. One such technology is fluidized bed gasification, which has significant advantages over conventional <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers.</b> The product gas of black liquor gasification is a mixture of CO, H 2, CO 2 and H 2 O, which can be cleaned and burned in a gas turbine or fuel cell to produce electricity, or fired in a boiler to produce process steam for the mill. In this paper, a three-phase hydrodynamic model has been developed to simulate black liquor gasification in a commercial-scale fluidized bed with horizontal heat exchange tubes. ...|$|R
40|$|Black liquor <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> are an {{essential}} part of kraft mills. Their design and operating procedures have changed over time with the goal of providing improved boiler performance. These performance improvements are frequently associated with an increase in heat flux and/or operating temperature with a subsequent increase in the demand on structural materials associated with operation at higher temperatures and/or in more corrosive environments. Improvements in structural materials have therefore been required. In most cases the alternate materials have provided acceptable solutions. However, in some cases the alternate materials have solved the original problem but introduced new issues. This paper addresses the performance of materials in the lower portion of <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> and, particularly, the problems associated with use of co-extruded tubes and the solutions that have been identified...|$|R
