25|$|Both the PPE and SPE are RISC {{architectures}} with a fixed-width 32-bit instruction format. The PPE {{contains a}} 64-bit general purpose <b>register</b> <b>set</b> (GPR), a 64-bit floating point <b>register</b> <b>set</b> (FPR), and a 128-bit Altivec <b>register</b> <b>set.</b> The SPE contains 128-bit registers only. These {{can be used}} for scalar data types ranging from 8-bits to 64-bits in size or for SIMD computations on a variety of integer and floating point formats. System memory addresses for both the PPE and SPE are expressed as 64-bit values for a theoretic address range of 264 bytes (16 exabytes or 16,777,216 terabytes). In practice, not all of these bits are implemented in hardware. Local store addresses internal to the SPU (Synergistic Processor Unit) processor are expressed as a 32-bit word. In documentation relating to Cell a word is always taken to mean 32 bits, a doubleword means 64 bits, and a quadword means 128 bits.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{possible}} to change the mode of operation for the FIRQ interrupt. Instead of stacking the PC and CC registers (normal 6809 behavior) the FIRQ interrupt can be set to stack the entire <b>register</b> <b>set,</b> as the IRQ interrupt does. In addition, the 6309 has two possible trap modes, one for an illegal instruction fetch and one for division by zero. The illegal instruction fetch is not maskable, and many TRS-80 Color Computer users reported that their 6309's were [...] "buggy" [...] when in reality it was an indicator of enhanced and unknown features.|$|E

50|$|While {{embedded}} instruction sets such as Thumb {{suffer from}} extremely high register pressure {{because they have}} small <b>register</b> <b>sets,</b> general-purpose RISC ISAs like MIPS and Alpha enjoy low register pressure.

50|$|Of the 26-register data memory, {{the first}} ten ("primary registers") could be {{accessed}} directly, ten more as an alternate <b>register</b> <b>set,</b> and the remaining six through the user defined keys A-E and as an index register.

50|$|The goal of {{multithreading}} hardware {{support is}} to allow quick switching between a blocked thread and another thread ready to run. To achieve this goal, the hardware cost is to replicate the program visible registers, {{as well as some}} processor control registers (such as the program counter). Switching from one thread to another thread means the hardware switches from using one <b>register</b> <b>set</b> to another; to switch efficiently between active threads, each active thread needs to have its own <b>register</b> <b>set.</b> For example, to quickly switch between two threads, the register hardware needs to be instantiated twice.|$|E
