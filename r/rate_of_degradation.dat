2500|$|A {{commonly}} used synthetic material is PLA - polylactic acid. This is a polyester which degrades within {{the human body}} to form lactic acid, a naturally occurring chemical which is easily removed from the body. Similar materials are polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL): their degradation mechanism {{is similar to that}} of PLA, but they exhibit respectively a faster and a slower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> compared to PLA. While these materials have well maintained mechanical strength and structural integrity, they exhibit a hydrophobic nature. [...] This hydrophobicity inhibits their biocompatibility, which makes them less effective for in vivo use as tissue scaffolding. In order to fix the lack of biocompatibility, much research has been done to combine these hydrophobic materials with hydrophilic and more biocompatible hydrogels. While these hydrogels have a superior biocompatibility, they lack the structural integrity of PLA, PCL, and PGA. By combining the two different types of materials, researchers are trying to create a synergistic relationship that produces a more biocompatible tissue scaffolding.|$|E

40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> chloroform {{has been}} investigated in aqueous suspensions of TiO_ 2 over the wavelength range of 310 - 380 nm. A detailed reaction mechanism has been proposed in which the rate-determining step is the reaction of surface-bound *OH with adsorbed CHCl_ 3. A pH-stat titration technique was developed for the measurement <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> chlorinated hydrocarbons. The quantum efficiency (Ф = 0. 56 at ⋋ = 330 nm) <b>of</b> the <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> CHCl_ 3, {{was found to be}} inversely proportional to the square root of the incident light intensity. This relationship can be explained in terms of a direct competition between a second-order recombination of surface-bound 'OH and the rate-determining reaction of surface-bound 'OH with CHCl_ 3. The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> several electron donors have been correlated with their computed surface speciation. The results of this study show that the adsorption of electron donors and acceptors to the TiO_ 2 surface plays a more important role in determining the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the photocatalytic reactions than the effect of pH-dependent Fermi-level shifts...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Chlorinated phenols are toxic {{compounds}} and often released into natural environments from improper disposal or non-point sources. One {{important factor in}} assessing the environmental fate and transport is the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> microbial <b>degradation</b> in soils and natural waters. In this study, eight chlorophenols (4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP), 2, 4 -dichlorophenol (2, 4 -DCP), 3, 4 -dichlorophenol (3, 4 -DCP), 3, 5 -dichlorophenol (3, 5 - DCP), 2, 3, 5 -trichlorophenol (2, 3, 5 -TCP), 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol (2, 4, 5 -TCP), 3, 4, 5 - trichlorophenol (3, 4, 5 -TCP), and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (2, 4, 6 -TCP)) were chosen as the model compounds because they represent the major degradation products for the anaerobic metabolic products of pentachlorophenol (PCP). Aerobic <b>degradation</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> all eight compounds were determined under controlled laboratory conditions.

The M-CK subunits is slightly more stable and is degraded {{with an average}} apparent half-life of 75 h, whereas that of the B-CK subunit was shorter with 63 h. The turnover properties of M-CK subunit from soluble and of myofibril-bound MM-CK homodimeric {{creatine kinase}} isoenzyme isolated from breast muscle of young chickens were identical. The apparent half-life of the B-CK subunit was also determined in subcultured fibroblasts and 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine-treated cells, and found to be shorter than in myotubes (46 h and 37 h respectively). Similar observations were made for myosin heavy chain, actin and total acid-precipitable material. It appears therefore that proteins are in general degraded more slowly in differentiated myogenic cells.
