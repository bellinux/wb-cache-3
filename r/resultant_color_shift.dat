40|$|Land's two-color method {{gives rise}} to {{apparent}} full-color perception, even though only two colors (e. g., red and gray) are used. Previous studies indicate that chromatic adaptation, color memory, and inductive effects contribute to the <b>shifts</b> of <b>color</b> perception from real to illusory colors (e. g., Kuriki, 2006 Vision Research 46 3055 – 3066). This paper investigates {{the relationship between the}} <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> induced by Land images and the skewness of the luminance histogram. In Experiment 1, several Land images are created based on a yellow ball, and the magnitude of the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> of the images are measured. The results of Experiment 1 show a significant correlation between the magnitude of the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> and skewness, suggesting that skewness is critical for the <b>color</b> <b>shifts.</b> In Experiment 2, we test the hypothesis that <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> depends on just skewness; the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> should be invariant even if the Land images are scrambled. However, the results of Experiment 2 demonstrate that scrambled Land images exhibit less intense <b>color</b> <b>shifts,</b> suggesting that <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> are determined by the object's overall shape or surface gloss, not just skewness. Taken together, we conclude that both low-level visual processes, such as those associated with luminance histogram skew, and high-level cognitive functions, such as object interpretation or understanding of surface gloss, are involved in the <b>color</b> <b>shift</b> of Land images...|$|R

40|$|Color-to-color {{misregistration}} {{refers to}} misregistration between color separations in a printed or display image. Such misregistration in printed halftoned images {{can result in}} several image defects, a primary one being <b>shifts</b> in average <b>color.</b> The present paper examines the variation in average color for two-color halftoned images {{as a function of}} color-to-color misregistration distance. Dot-on-dot/dot-off-dot and rotated dot screen configurations are examined via simulation and supported by print measurements. The <b>color</b> and <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> were calculated using a spectral Neugebauer model for the underlying simulations. As expected, dot-on-dot/dot-off-dot <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> were very high, while rotated dots screens exhibited very little <b>color</b> <b>shift</b> under the present idealized conditions.

Short-term {{chromatic adaptation}}, on the other hand, results from exposure {{for a few minutes}} or less, with <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> measured within seconds or a few minutes after the adapting light is extinguished; recovery to the pre-adapted state is complete in less than an hour. Here, both types of adaptation were combined. All adaptation was to reddish-appearing long-wavelength light. Shifts in unique yellow were measured following adaptation. Previous studies demonstrate shifts in unique yellow due to VLT chromatic adaptation, but shifts from short-term chromatic adaptation to comparable adapting light can be far greater than from VLT adaptation. The question considered here is whether the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> from VLT adaptation are cumulative with large shifts from short-term adaptation or, alternatively, does simultaneous short-term adaptation eliminate <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> caused by VLT adaptation. The results show the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> from VLT and short-term adaptation together are cumulative, which indicates that both short-term and very-long-term chromatic adaptation affect color perception during natural viewing...|$|R

40|$|The {{fluorescent}} colors at {{room temperature}} of various completely-reacted manganese-activated zinc beryllium silicate phosphors can be changed by reheating them to tem-peratures lower than the original firing temperature with subsequent cooling at a rate in effect similar to the original cooling rate. A radical change in the cooling rate, as by quenching in water, also produces <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> apart from the change due to reheating alone. When a zinc beryllium silicate (Mn) phosphor is reheated at various temperatures from 700 ~ to 1200 ~ with subsequent ormal cooling, shifts to the green occur in all cases with a maximum shift at 950 ~ With increased time of retiring, especially at the higher temperatures, the <b>colors</b> <b>shift</b> back toward the original phosphor color. With reheating and subsequent water quenching, the <b>color</b> <b>shift</b> to the green increases almost linearly with temperature over the range 800 ~ to 1200 ~ and extrapolates to zero <b>color</b> <b>shift</b> at 700 ~ The magnitude of the <b>color</b> <b>shift</b> is greater with quenching than with normal cooling. The data require two equilibrium approach rates for interpretation. The first or rapid change involves the equilibrium of manganese between its red-emitting and green-emitting states, with the green-emitting structure predominating athigh temperatures. The second or slow change involves the migration of beryllium between substitutional positions either for silicon or zinc in the crystal. The equilibrium favors the beryllium-for-zinc substitution more for higher temperatures. The beryllium position in turn modifies the manganese-state distribution, and this third equilibrium between the primary equilibria ccounts for the time dependence of the <b>color</b> <b>shifts...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractInducing {{patterns}} that selectively stimulate the S cones can induce large <b>shifts</b> in <b>color</b> appearance. For example, a “peach” test-ring presented within contiguous purple and non-contiguous lime inducing rings appears pink while the physically identical peach test-ring appears orange when presented within contiguous lime and non-contiguous purple inducing rings (Fig. 1 c). These shifts have been {{accounted for by}} a neural substrate which predicts that chromatic assimilation and simultaneous contrast can operate synergistically to produce large shifts with these patterns [Monnier, P., & Shevell, S. K. (2004). Chromatic induction from S-cone patterns. Vision Research, 44, 849 – 856]. Here, induction was measured for test-rings that stimulated the S cones either {{more or less than}} did the inducing rings. According to standard definitions of induction, <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> for test s-chromaticities either lower or higher than both inducing chromaticities should be attenuated compared to test-rings of intermediate S-cone stimulation. On the other hand, a previously proposed model of induction predicted independence of the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> with test-ring s-chromaticity. Consistent with standard definitions of induction, a reduction in the magnitude of the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> for test-ring chromaticities either lower or higher in S-cone excitation than the inducing chromaticities was observed. Additional measurements with {{patterns that}} have been shown to isolate assimilation and simultaneous contrast were conducted. For these patterns, expectations based on standard definitions of induction suggested that the magnitude of the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> should be monotonic with the S-cone stimulation of the test-ring, and the direction of the <b>color</b> <b>shift</b> should reverse for test-ring chromaticities either lower or higher than both inducing chromaticities compared to test-rings of intermediate chromaticity. In contrast, the previously proposed model of induction based on a receptive-field with S-cone spatial antagonism predicted the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> should be independent of the test-ring chromaticity (Monnier & Shevell, 2004). <b>Color</b> <b>shifts</b> were generally independent of the level of the test-ring chromaticity, supporting the S-cone antagonistic model of induction...|$|R

40|$|Halftoned separations of {{individual}} colorants, typically cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, are overlaid on a print substrate in typical color printing systems. Displacements between these separations, {{commonly referred to}} as “interseparation misregistration”, can cause objectionable <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> in the prints. We study this misregistration-induced <b>color</b> <b>shift</b> for periodic clustered-dot halftones using a spatiospectral model for the printed output that combines the Neugebauer model with a periodic lattice representation for the individual halftones. Using Fourier analysis in the framework of this model, we obtain an analytic characterization for the conditions for misregistration invariance in terms of colorant spectra, periodicity of the individual separation halftones, dot shapes, and misregistration displacements. We further exploit the framework in a hybrid analytical-numerical simulation that allows us to obtain quantitative estimates of the <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> due to misregistration, thereby providing a characterization for these shifts {{as a function of the}} optical dot gain, halftone periodicities, spot shapes, and interseparation misregistration amounts. We present simulation results that demonstrate the impact of each of these parameters on the <b>color</b> <b>shift</b> and demonstrate qualitative agreement between our approximation and experimental data...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{identification}} of objects, illuminants, and transparencies {{are probably the}} most important perceptual functions of color. This paper examines the effects of perceptual scission, image junctions, color adaptation, and color correlations on identification. Simulations of natural illuminants, materials, and filters were used in a forced-choice procedure to simultaneously measure thresholds for identifying filters and objects across illuminants, and discrimination thresholds within illuminants. In {{the vast majority of the}} cases, if observers could discriminate within illuminants they could identify across illuminants. Since results were similar for identical color distributions, whether transparency cues like X-junctions were present or not, the primary cues for color identification were systematic <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> across illuminants. These <b>color</b> <b>shifts</b> can be well described by three-parameter affine transformations, and the parameters can be derived from differences and ratios of mean chromaticities. A strategy based on post-transformation color matching predicts generally accurate identification despite perceptible <b>color</b> <b>shifts,</b> and also provides plausible reasons for those few conditions where identification thresholds are significantly higher than discrimination thresholds...|$|R
