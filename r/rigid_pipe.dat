50|$|In the {{offshore}} industry the word catenary {{is used as}} an adjective or noun with a meaning wider than is its historical meaning in mathematics. Thus, an SCR that uses a rigid, steel pipe that has a considerable bending stiffness {{is described as a}} catenary. That is because in the scale of depth of the ocean, the bending stiffness of a <b>rigid</b> <b>pipe</b> has little effect on the shape of the suspended span of an SCR. The shape assumed by the SCR is controlled mainly by weight, buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces due to currents and waves. Thus, in spite of using conventional, rigid steel pipe, the shape of an SCR can be closely approximated with the use of ideal catenary equations, used historically to describe the shape of a chain suspended between points in space. A chain line has by definition a zero bending stiffness and those described with the ideal catenary equations use infinitesimally short links.|$|E

50|$|The <b>rigid</b> <b>pipe</b> of the SCR forms a {{catenary}} {{between its}} hang-off {{point on the}} floating or rigid platform, and the seabed. A free-hanging SCR assumes a shape roughly similar to the letter 'J'. A catenary of a lazy wave SCR consists in fact {{of at least three}} catenary segments. The top and the seabed segments of the catenary have negative submerged weight, and their curvatures 'bulge' towards the seabed. The middle segment has buoyant material attached along its entire length, so that the ensemble of the steel pipe and the buoyancy is positively buoyant. Accordingly, the curvature of the buoyant segment 'bulges' upwards (inverted catenary), and its shape can also be well approximated with the same ideal catenary equations. The positively and negatively buoyant segments are tangent to each other at the points where they join. The overall catenary shape of the SCR has at those locations points of inflection. Lazy Wave SCRs were first installed on a turret moored FPSO offshore Brazil (BC-10, Shell) in 2009, even though Lazy Wave configuration flexible risers had been in a wide use for several decades beforehand.|$|E

30|$|Buried pipes can be {{classified}} as either flexible or rigid {{depending on whether the}} pipe itself can deform up to 2  % without incurring damage. <b>Rigid</b> <b>pipes,</b> such as reinforced/non-reinforced concrete, and clay pipes, may experience significant structural cracks if they deflect more than 2  % (Zhao et al., 1998). Flexible pipes have been defined as conduits that can deflect at least 2  % without exhibiting any sign of structural distress such as cracking (Uni-Bell PVC Pipe Association, 2001). Flexible pipes include thermoplastics [i.e., Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) and High Density Polyethylene (HDPE)], thermosetting, and corrugated steel pipes.|$|R

It is also much easier to protect the brake mechanism from the outside environment, and protect it from water, dust, and oil. Of secondary importance is flexible brake <b>pipes</b> are avoided; <b>rigid</b> <b>pipes</b> allow increases in brake fluid pressure, allowing for a smaller disc to manage a given braking torque.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to use {{numerical}} modelling to evaluate practical guidelines for soil and large diameter <b>rigid</b> <b>pipe</b> interaction problems. A detailed critique is also given on current design methods, followed by {{an explanation of the}} alternative general criteria for field performance. Conventional design methods are generally based on Marston-Spangler theory developed for small diameter concrete non-prestressed pipe in the 1920 's, which take no account of the actual material properties, true geometry and field construction procedure. Numerical analyses have been performed using the geotechnical finite element package CRISP, together with data from full scale site installation trials and three-edge bearing load tests. Practical guidance is given for various construction conditions. A brief summary of the main factors influencing the behaviour of buried <b>rigid</b> <b>pipe</b> are: the elastic properties of both the pipe and the surrounding soil, the placement, compaction, and any subsequent volumetric changes in the soils placed around the pipe, the variation of earth cover, geometry and bedding conditions, the weight of water, internal pressures, and prestressing effects from helically-wound steel wires. From this study, {{it was found that the}} prestressing and internal water pressures significantly affect the behaviour of buried pipe, leading to the change of bending stresses in the pipe wall. The improvement of construction techniques is also very important in terms of bedding condition and compaction of side fill, etc. In conclusion, current design practice is highly deficient, causing very uneconomical designs for buried large diameter <b>rigid</b> <b>pipe.</b> The finite element method has provided useful insights into an important practical engineering problem, and has indicated the critical design factor for large diameter buried <b>rigid</b> <b>pipe...</b>|$|E

40|$|Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} {{syndrome}} {{is now considered}} as a major health care topic. An in-vitro setup which reproduces and simplifies upper airway geometry has been the basis to study the fluid/walls interaction that leads to an apnea. It consists of a <b>rigid</b> <b>pipe</b> (the pharynx) in contact with a deformable latex cylinder filled with water (the tongue). Air flows out of the <b>rigid</b> <b>pipe</b> and induces pressure forces on the cylinder. We present a numerical model of this setup: a finite element model of the latex cylinder is in interaction with a fluid model. Simulation of an hypopnea (partial collapsus of the airway) has been possible and in agreement with observations from the in-vitro setup. The same phenomenon has been simulated on a soft palate model obtained from a patient sagittal radiography. These first results encourage us to improve the model so as it could reproduce the complete apnea phenomenon, and {{be used for a}} planification purpose in sleep apnea surgery...|$|E

It is confirmed that the point of onset of unstable collapse is generally well modelled by the critical pressure predicted from two-dimensional models. The effect of end restraint can generally be neglected, except in the case of short liners, where the buckling mode collapse can be inhibited, to be replaced by material failure...|$|R

30|$|Trickey and Moore (2007) {{performed}} a numerical analysis for pipes of varying stiffness and embedment depth. It {{was found that}} the burial depth had little impact on the peak deformation for stiff (<b>rigid)</b> <b>pipes</b> located close to the ground surface.

(2010) used a linear elastic finite element model to study the effects of geometric and mechanical parameters that characterize the soil-structure interaction developed in a buried pipe located under highways. The study concluded that the soil-pipe interaction system considerably depends not only on the pipe material and stiffness, but also on the geometric parameters defining the pipe trench.|$|R

40|$|Summary: This work {{is focused}} on the {{evaluation}} of the performance of a small-scale inflatable, or plug, placed in a confined space provided by a circular <b>rigid</b> <b>pipe</b> as a way to contain the propagation of floods. The <b>rigid</b> <b>pipe</b> is a simplified and scaled approximation of an actual tunnel section. The evaluations were conducted using an inflatable plug made of a single layer of coated Vectran ® fabric. Friction coefficients of the system were calculated for three different materials lining the pipe so a comparison could be made. These friction coefficients were also compared to laboratory friction machine testing of the same lining materials. This comparison showed that the friction coefficients of the pipe-plug system were lower than the laboratory friction machine tests. Rates of water leakage around the plug were also studied. The leakage rates were recorded for several different plug pressures while varying the tunnel pressure accordingly. It was observed that as pressure differential decreased between the plug and pipe, the leakage rate increased. Results showed also that the plug was able to withstand a pressure differential with manageable water leakage rates...|$|E
40|$|Soil-pipe {{interaction}} studies generally recognise {{the significance}} of deformations in the pipe due to soil loading, but not differential ground and structure movements, which can induce excessive stress concentrations in the pipeline. Plastics pipes can suffer failure due to such movements, though their flexibility makes them less vulnerable than <b>rigid</b> <b>pipes.</b> This paper examines the settlements and how the redistribution of the soil sub grade reactions caused by the installation of a pipeline within a soil mass, can then be estimated by treating the pipeline as a beam on elastic foundation.
