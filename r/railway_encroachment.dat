50|$|The North British belatedly {{set about}} {{improving}} and expanding Waverley station. This {{was not easy}} because of the constrained location in a high amenity area, and hostility to <b>railway</b> <b>encroachment</b> was at a high level. Nonetheless, on 5 July 1891 the North British obtained Parliamentary powers to quadruple the line from Corstorphine (that is, Saughton Junction) {{in the west to}} Waverley, and from Waverley to Abbeyhill in the east. This involved duplicating the three tunnel sections. In addition Waverley station itself was much expanded, and when the work was completed in 1900 it covered 23 acres and had nineteen platforms. North Bridge was reconstructed and incorporated into the station structure; one-third of the cost was borne by the North British Railway, and the whole scheme at Waverley cost Â£1.5 million. The station was architecturally magnificent, although the baroque stone and joinery work in the booking hall was somewhat oppressive, and the pedestrian access from the street was still narrow and bleak.|$|E
