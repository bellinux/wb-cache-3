I do this upon <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> and constitutional policy. I do not want to censure the present judges. I think them to be excused for their error. Ignorance is no excuse for a judge; it is changing the nature of his crime; it is not absolving. It must be such error as a wise and conscientious judge may possibly fall into, and must arise from one or both these causes:--1. A plausible principle of law; 2. The precedents of respectable authorities, and in good times. In the first, the principle of law, that the judge is to decide on law, the jury to decide on fact, is an ancient and venerable principle and maxim of the law; and if supported in this application by precedents of good times and of good men, the judge, if wrong, ought to be corrected,--he ought not to be reproved or to be disgraced, or the authority or respect to your tribunals to be impaired. In cases in which declaratory bills have been made, where by violence and corruption some fundamental part of the Constitution has been struck at, where they would damn the principle, censure the persons, and annul the acts,--but where the law has been by the accident of human frailty depraved or in a particular instance misunderstood, where you neither mean to rescind the acts nor to censure the persons, in such cases you have taken the explanatory mode, and, without condemning what is done, you direct the future judgment of the court.|$|E

This finding is different from the “pecking order hypothesis” of Myers and Majluf (1984).

5000|$|Condign merit supposes an {{equality}} between {{service and}} return; it {{is measured by}} commutative justice (justitia commutativa), and thus gives a real claim to a reward. Congruous merit, owing to its inadequacy {{and the lack of}} intrinsic proportion between the service and the recompense, claims a reward only on the ground of equity. This early-scholastic distinction and terminology, which developed in the controversies with the Pelagians and Semipelagians, were again emphasized by Johann Eck, the famous adversary of Martin Luther (cf. Greying, [...] "Joh. Eck als junger Gelehrter," [...] Münster, 1906, pp. 153 sqq.). The essential difference between meritum de condigno and meritum de congruo is based on the fact that, besides those works which claim a remuneration under pain of violating strict justice (as in contracts between employer and employee, in buying and selling, etc.), there are also other meritorious works which at most are entitled to reward or honour for <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> (ex œquitate) or mere distributive justice (ex iustitia distributiva), {{as in the case of}} gratuities and military decorations. From an ethical point of view the difference practically amounts to this that, if the reward due to condign merit be withheld, there is a violation of right and justice and the consequent obligation in conscience to make restitution, while, in the case of congruous merit, to withhold the reward involves no violation of right and no obligation to restore, it being merely an offence against what is fitting or a matter of personal discrimination (acceptio personarum). Hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver, though not purely and simply on his good will.|$|E

The value of ultra-brief interventions has been examined. These issues are considered in a selective review, drawing in particular on the work of the Sheffield/Leeds psychotherapy of depression research group. This research treats the number of treatment sessions as an independent variable, thereby providing a causal analysis of the dose-response relationship over a range from two to 16 sessions, illuminated by a comparative analysis of change processes in treatments of different durations.

Since the federal Young Offenders Act came into effect, the minimum limit has been established at twelve years of age. Consequently, sections 12 and 13 of the Criminal Code have been repealed. In the Province of Quebec, before Bill 60 came into effect, the lower age limit was fourteen years. Since the bill came into force, however, the Youth ProtectionAct has become essentially a law of protection and all federal offences must be treated in accordance with the Young Offenders Act. Many reasons persuaded the legislator to lower the minimum age from fourteen to twelve years of age, but it seems that the most convincing was a decline of the age of juvenile criminality. Finally, the Young Offenders ACt establishes the maximum age limit at eighteen years of age and standardizes that age accross Canada from April 1, 1985. <b>Reasons</b> <b>of</b> uniformity, <b>equity</b> and constitutionality have influenced the legislator in setting the upper age limit at eighteen years of age...|$|R

The National Strategy for an Ageing Australia provides a framework for national response to the challenges and opportunities that an older Australia presents. Healthy ageing {{is one of the}} four areas identified in the Strategy that affect population ageing well. Healthy ageing is defined as the development and maintenance of optimal physical, social and mental wellbeing for Australian people throughout their lives. To achieve the goal of healthy ageing, the Australian Aged Care Reform Package 2012 aims at providing $ 955. 4 million over five years in its spent to help older people to stay at home, namely, ageing in place (AiP). AiP as a philosophy of care means older people are supported to remain in the same environment as their care needs increase.

Three senior families from different cultural backgrounds—Anglo Australian, Indigenous Australian and Forced Migrant Australian each—took part in the research. The participants reported that they were vulnerable to heat wave and natural disasters such as cyclones. Compared to older people in general population, Indigenous and forced migrant participants reported higher levels of vulnerability to heat wave and natural disasters due to their lower social economic status and less access to aged care services.

40|$|Transition economies have {{introduced}} {{a range of}} OECD active labor market policies to combat unemployment - albeit often on paper only, as with rising unemployment passive policies have crowded out active ones. But even in the Czech Republic, active labor market policies have contributed only marginally to reducing unemployment. One task for policymakers in Central and Eastern Europe must be to conveythe message that, even under the best circumstances, active labor policies can play only a marginal role in reducing unemployment. OECD labor policies cannot be applied mechanically in Central and Eastern Europe because the situation there is different. Severe and persistent shortages in capital and managerial ability are sure to keep labor demand weak in the medium term, while labor supply will be abundant. As enterprises are restructured and liquidated, the newly unemployed workers cannot be absorbed by the weak private sector and must compete for scarce jobs. Women and older, less educated men have particular trouble finding work. Which active labor policies does the author suggest might be effective? Limited funds for active labor policies might best be spent retraining the most able unemployed workers to develop skills needed in the private sector. Public employment programs might be targeted especially to problem groups of workers and to the long-term unemployed - more for <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> than of efficiency. The point {{is to have a}} clear idea whether both aims of efficiency and equity can be pursued and, if efficiency gains are unrealistic, whether equity considerations are politically indispensable. Because nontradable services are underdeveloped, Central and Eastern European countries might eliminate credit rationing that discourages self-employment (the self-employed have trouble getting financing). Improving consulting services for the unemployed in Hungary, Poland, and Russia makes more sense than applying a broad menu of OECD programs. The labor market in the Russian Federation appears to be more dynamic than in Hungary and Poland, but this is probably because of massive labor hoarding in Russian enterprises. Once they start shedding labor in earnest, their employment figures will look more like those in the other Central and Eastern European countries.

40|$|Includes bibliographyLand {{distribution}} in Latin America {{is characterized by}} striking inequality. Notwithstanding the emergence of modern structures in some regions, a few huge land holdings are found alongside {{a large number of}} small ones. This situation has long been considered undesirable for <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> social <b>equity</b> as well as for <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> efficiency. The topic remains high on the political agenda. The ultimately disappointing results of past redistributive reforms have caused contemporary policy-makers to search for alternatives. In recent years attention has focused on the institution of private property rights and land transactions through market mechanisms. This paper argues that it is extremely helpful to approach the issue from an institutional perspective. The objective here is not to prescribe concrete solutions, but rather to shed light on issues such as how transactions are actually being carried out in the rural setting; the role of transaction costs and of institutions such as property rights; and what influence externalities may have. The theme of this paper is that a meaningful analysis of how rural land markets work cannot be done in a conventional neoclassical framework. The rural economic environment is characterized by imperfect markets, asymmetric information and uncertainty. In addition, economic behaviour is often guided by the intrinsic logic of the peasant farm, which differs markedly from the way in which commercial agriculture operates. No single property rights regime is universally valid. Indeed, a whole array of agricultural institutions has emerged as a response to different and evolving economic parameters. The complexities of rural land markets have to be considered in order to design effective policies. This article hopes to contribute to {{a deeper understanding of the}} issues. Thus, after laying the theoretical groundwork, an overview of viable policy instruments is given and a number of case studies are presented...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) allows most {{foreign investors}} from any NAFTA country to seek {{monetary}} damages for properties {{that might be}} appropriated, or any measure that might be deemed "tantamount to an expropriation" by the governments {{of any of the}} other NAFTA parties (Canada, Mexico, and the United States); to obtain such damages, the investor must go through the dispute settlement process provided in chapter 11 part B. A number of investors have used these provisions to argue that diminished value of an investment due to environment regulation is indeed tantamount to an expropriation and hence subject to monetary damages. If this line of argumentation is generally upheld, it would amount to a requirement that governments compensate investors for losses resulting from requirements to implement environmental safeguards (or to cease from activities that cause environmental damage). This article uses the reasoning of Ronald Coase, which is extensively articulated for the benefit of readers not familiar with this reasoning, to argue that in fact that such a requirement can in fact lead to an optimal outcome in terms of tradeoff of cost/benefit of an environmental regulation. However, Coase argued also that a requirement that the "polluter pay" can also lead to an optimal outcome, and for <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>equity,</b> this latter approach is most often implemented in environmental regulation. The article goes further to argue that for a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> not considered by Coase, the latter approach might, in an imperfect world where conditions for optimality are violated, in fact come closer to achieving an optimal outcome than the former. ...|$|R

Ces objectifs sont déterminés par l'équité et l'intérêt commun. L'analyse des faits révèle qu'il existe certaines discriminations inacceptables dans la rémunération des instituteurs et que notre expansion économique et la maîtrise de nos destinées sont compromises par des déficiences dans le « capital humain » dont la province dispose. Dans ces circonstances, il devient nécessaire de rétablir l'équité et d'améliorer la valeur de notre « capital humain ». A cette fin, l'auteur a indiqué certaines des mesures qu'il faudrait prendre. This article {{deals with}} the problem of the wage structure in the field of education and its relations to the implementation of given objectives. Those objectives are based on equity and the common good. The analysis reveals there exist inacceptable discriminations in the salaries of teachers and that the economic expansion of the province is compromised by deficiencies in the « human capital » available. In those circumstances, it appears clearly that decisions ought to be taken in order to re-establish equity and provide the required «human capital ». Some measures are proposed to that effect. The acquisition of knowledge brings benefits to the nation {{as well as to the}} individuals. These benefits have an economic value that can (and has) been measured. In that respect, educational expenses are an investment as much as any expenses made to expand physical facilities. In fact, the yield on investments made in that sector has been shown to be greater than (or at least as great as) that of similar investments in physical capital. The average income of men with 12 years of schooling is more than 50 % above the average income of men with 8 years of schooling. Besides, the income of the former increases more rapidly than that of the latter. It is now widely recognized that investment in « human capital » is the most important lever in increasing productivity. It is not necessarily the nations gratified with the best natural resources that can provide the highest standard of living. Highly qualified workers are an input essential to insure the best uses of other inputs. Recent studies have shown that a higher degree of education is an explanation of the astonishing economic revival of Germany after the war and has caused 30 % of the increase in the American G. N. P. since 1920. Governments have an important role to play in the improvement of the quality of the labour force. Such an objective cannot be left to the blind forces of market for its implementation. It is the responsability of the government to make sure, that sufficient resources are diverted into the field of education. It has to make sure that they be diverted as long as its marginal efficiency is higher than that of investments in other fields, even if that means a decrease in expenses on road construction, etc. * * *If the best of our human resources are to be used in the field of education, salaries have to be increased. Salaries are a powerful factor in the allocation of human resources between the different sectors of economic activity. So far, it seems that not enough qualified teachers are found in our schools. In the Catholic schools at the secondary level 12. 82 % of the teachers were classified grade 4 or above in 1959 - 60. In the Protestant schools, it was 58. 3 %. Salaries ought to be raised to retain teachers: turnover rates are higher for Catholics than Protestants, in Quebec than in Ontario. Regional differentials ought to disappear as long as they prevent qualified teacher to be equally distributed throughout the Province. Children from poorer area have a right equal to those from richer areas to be taught by qualified teachers. It is widely accepted throughout the world that there should not exist any differential in the salaries of women and men teachers. This principle is generally applied in seven provinces in Canada. Sex differentials are a characteristic of the salary structure of teachers in Quebec. For <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity,</b> such differentials ought to disappear gradually as long as the services rendered are the same. * * *Higher salaries for higher qualification should be stressed. Qualifications and not seniority should be the principal factor in salary determination. That is specially important when an improvement in the qualifications of teachers is a public objective. Such a differential should be consistent with the financial reward expected from the investment in higher education. A priori, no particular wage structure is to be considered best.

The study recommends that policies that improve domestic savings, as a principal source <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital, be enacted as an increase should lead to a reduction in the cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital, interest rates and increase the appeal <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> and foreign investments...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} whether intellectual capital (IC) and financial disclosures jointly affect the firm’s cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital. In contrast to prior research, we disaggregate disclosures into IC and financial disclosures and examine whether the two disclosure types are jointly {{related to the}} cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital. We also investigate whether IC and financial disclosures have an interaction effect on the cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital. Using data for a sample of 125 UK firms, we find a negative relationship between the cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital and IC disclosure. We find {{that the relationship between}} financial disclosure and the cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital is magnified when combined with IC disclosure. Additionally, we find that IC and financial disclosures interact in shaping their effects on the cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital. Further analyses suggest that the effect of financial disclosure on the cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital is augmented for firms characterised by a medium level of IC disclosure. These results provide important insights into the relationship between disclosures and cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital and have policy and practical implications...|$|R
60|$|Lawyers, I know, cannot {{make the}} {{distinction}} for which I contend; {{because they have}} their strict rule to go by. But legislators ought to do what lawyers cannot; for they have no other rules to bind them but the great principles <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> and <b>equity</b> and the general sense of mankind. These they are bound to obey and follow, and rather to enlarge and enlighten law by the liberality <b>of</b> legislative <b>reason</b> than to fetter and bind their higher capacity by the narrow constructions of subordinate, artificial justice. If we had adverted to this, we never could consider the convulsions of a great empire, not disturbed by a little disseminated faction, but divided by whole communities and provinces, and entire legal representatives of a people, as fit matter of discussion under a commission of Oyer and Terminer. It is as opposite to reason and prudence {{as it is to}} humanity and justice.|$|R
40|$|The non-contractual-contractual divide {{represents}} the basic criterion of qualification in private law liability. The essential {{difference between them}} is that whereas tortious obligation arises as a liability obligation i. e. as an obligation to pay damages, contractual obligation arises as a duty of performance which changes itself into an obligation of damages only in case of non-performance. What is true is that both contractual and extracontractual liability have damage in common, the objective element of every private law liability. The question is not always one of alternative between contractual and non-contractual liability. On the contrary, both {{can be thought of}} as being simoultaneously apt to rule single types of fact. A coincidence between contractual and non-contractual liability is typically the case when performance is so to say applied directly to the person or a good of the creditor, as in cases of medical practice or services in general. The counterway of a possible overlap is that in which conduct of debtor is not in itself non performance but infringes some other protected interest of creditor, giving rise to a tort. The judicial trend shows that courts talk of possible concurrence of tortious liability with the contractual one when this ends up in favour of the victim; on the other hand they opt for a purely contractual approach if this produces the only or most effective remedy for the victim. Through a analytical appraisal of the courts' attitude, the author concludes that the rule of concurrence in Italian law has only a sectorial range. This explains the idea manifested in literature, according to which concurrence between contractual and non contractual liability hardly can be justified in dogmatic terms, whereas it appears to find only <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> «pure <b>equity</b> and contingent empiricism»...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to observe the effect of audit quality on {{earnings}} management and cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital. Audit quality is measured by the composite measure (variable AQMS), earnings management is measured by the modified Jones model, the cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital is measured with a modified Ohlson models with random walk. This study uses manufacturing firms for samples during 2010 - 2012 by using purposive sampling and regression analysis for analyst the data. The results showed that audit quality has a significant effect on earnings management and cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital, while for the control variables size and leverage, only leverage which has significant effect to cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital, and the other has no significant effect on earnings management and cost <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> capital.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{assessment}} <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> access to primary health care in Portugal and has three specific objectives: (1) to present a conceptual model for performance evaluation in primary health care, (2) to evaluate the <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> access {{in a sample of}} Portuguese health centers groupings (ACES), (3) to analyze the relationship between the level <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> access and other variables theoretically related to <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> access in primary care. We use the technique Data Envelopment Analysis to compare <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> access. The level <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> access across the ACES compared varies between 56 % and 100 % with an average of 82 %. Seven ACES (17 % of the total) have a relative level of 100 % <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> access. These results suggest that the geographical distribution of human resources in the ACES compared could be improved {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of the local health needs in each ACES. Based on correlation analysis, it was concluded that the relative level <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> access is positively correlated with the rate of use of hospital emergency rooms, suggesting effects of transferring demand from health centers to hospitals...|$|R
