40|$|This {{study has}} {{developed}} optimal hedging policies for the multi-purpose Ubonratana Reservoir in northeastern Thailand {{based on its}} existing rule curves. The hedging policy was applied whenever the reservoir storage falls below a critical level for each month of the year.

Performance was summarized in terms of reliability (time- and volume-based) and vulnerability. The results showed that the vulnerability was significantly reduced by using the optimized hedging rules. However, the number of water shortages increased with the optimized rules, causing the time-based reliability to worsen significantly. This should not be of concern since, although the number of shortages increased, the associated shortage quantities on most of these additional occasions were small, leaving the volumetric reliability largely unchanged...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{significant}} increase of the human influence on the natural systems both at the global and local scale. Accurately modeling the human component and its interaction with the natural environment is key to characterize the real system dynamics and anticipate future potential changes to the hydrological regimes. Modern distributed, physically-based hydrological models are able to describe hydrological processes with high level of detail and high spatiotemporal resolution. Yet, they lack in sophistication for the behavior component and human decisions are usually described by very simplistic rules, which might underperform in reproducing the catchment dynamics. In the case of water reservoir operators, these simplistic rules usually consist of target-level <b>rule</b> <b>curves,</b> which represent the average historical level trajectory. Whilst these rules can reasonably reproduce the average seasonal water volume shifts due to the reservoirs’ operation, they cannot properly represent peculiar conditions, which influence the actual reservoirs’ operation, e. g., variations in energy price or water demand, dry or wet meteorological conditions. Moreover, target-level <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> are not suitable to explore the water system response to climate and socio economic changing contexts, because they assume a business-as-usual operation. In this work, we quantitatively assess how the inclusion of adaptive reservoirs’ operating rules into physicallybased hydrological models contribute to the proper representation of the hydrological regime at the catchment scale. In particular, we contrast target-level <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> and detailed optimization-based behavioral models. We, first, perform the comparison on past observational records, showing that target-level <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> underperform in representing the hydrological regime over multiple time scales (e. g., weekly, seasonal, inter-annual). Then, we compare how future hydrological changes {{are affected by the}} two modeling approaches by considering different future scenarios comprising climate change projections of precipitation and temperature and projections of electricity prices. We perform this comparative assessment on the real-world water system of Lake Como catchment in the Italian Alps, which is characterized by the massive presence of artificial hydropower reservoirs heavily altering the natural hydrological regime. The results show how different behavioral model approaches affect the system representation in terms of hydropower performance, reservoirs dynamics and hydrological regime under different future scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Reservoir {{managers}} use operational <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> {{as guides}} for managing and operating reservoir systems. However, this approach saves no water for impending droughts, resulting in large shortages during such droughts. This {{problem can be}} tempered by integrating hedging with the <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> to curtail the water releases during normal periods of operation and use the saved water to limit the amount and impact of water shortages during droughts. However, determining the timing and amount of hedging is a challenge. This thesis presents the application of genetic algorithms (GA) for the optimisation of hedging-integrated reservoir <b>rule</b> <b>curves.</b> However, due {{to the challenge of}} establishing the boundary of feasible region in standard GA (SGA), a new development of the GA i. e. the dynamic GA (DGA), is proposed. Both the new development and its hedging policies were tested through extensive simulations of the Ubonratana reservoir (Thailand). The first observation was that the new DGA was faster and more efficient than the SGA in arriving at an optimal solution. Additionally, the derived hedging policies produced significant changes in reservoir performance when compared to no-hedging policies. The performance indices analysed were reliability (time and volume), resilience, vulnerability and sustainability; the results showed that the vulnerability (i. e. average single periods shortage) in particular was significantly reduced with the optimised hedging rules as compared to using the no-hedging <b>rule</b> <b>curves.</b> This study also developed a monthly inflow forecasting model using artificial neural networks (ANN) to aid reservoir operational decision-making. Extensive testing of the model showed that it was able to provide inflow forecasts with reasonable accuracy. The simulated effect on reservoir performance of forecasted inflows vis-à-vis other assumed reservoir inflow knowledge situations showed that the ANN forecasts were superior, further reinforcing the importance of good inflow information for reservoir operation. The ability of hedging to harness the inherent buffering capacity of existing water resources systems for tempering water shortage (or vulnerability) without the need for expensive new-builds is a major outcome of this study. Although applied to Ubonratana, the study has utility for other regions of the world, where e. g. climate and other environmental changes are stressing the water availability situation...|$|R

This study proposes a novel hedging rule to improve the efficiency of a reservoir operated to supply water, in which, based on two triggers, hedging is initiated with three different hedging sub-rules through a two-step approach. In the first step, the sub-rule is triggered based on the relationship between the initial reservoir storage level and the level of the target <b>rule</b> <b>curve</b> or the firm <b>rule</b> <b>curve</b> {{at the end of the}} current period. This step is mainly concerned with increasing the water level or not in the current period. Hedging is then triggered under the sub-rule based on current water availability in the second step, in which the trigger implicitly considers both initial and ending reservoir storage levels in the current period. Moreover, the amount of hedging is analytically derived based on the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. In addition, the hedging parameters are optimized using the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm coupled with a rule-based simulation. A single water-supply reservoir located in Hubei Province in central China is selected as a case study. The operation results show that the proposed rule is reasonable and significantly improves the reservoir operation performance for both long-term and critical periods relative to other operation policies, such as the standard operating policy (SOP) and the most commonly used hedging rules...|$|E
40|$|Sensitivity {{analysis}} (SA) {{theory and}} techniques {{were used in}} this study to estimate the sensitivity of input variables on the yield estimate of an urban water supply system. The SA techniques considered were Morris method and Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST), including the related extended FAST. A case study on a simple urban water supply system was conducted to assess the applicability and to study the limitations of these techniques and the SA framework adopted. Findings showed that the streamflow dominated all experiments, with the supply reliability threshold, the upper restriction <b>rule</b> <b>curve</b> and the consecutive months in restrictions threshold of subsequent importance. In a screening pass, importance ranking of the 26 considered variables from the Morris method were verified with FAST and extended FAST. ...|$|E
30|$|In this article, {{a hybrid}} model {{developed}} for simultaneously optimizing water allocation and searching the new reservoir hedging rules {{to minimize the}} impacts of droughts is shown. For this purpose, a hedging rule simulation base on fuzzy rationing factor has been connected to the multi-objective NSGA-II. The NSGA-II was used to minimize MSI values by identifying the new hedging rule. In previous studies (Tu et al. 2003, 2008; Guo et al. 2013; Taghian et al. 2014), as usual the rule curves divide reservoir storage into several zones so that the reservoir storage belongs to only one zone at each time step, whereas {{in the present study}} it applied concept of fuzzy logic to the rationing factors. According to this concept, there is an interval around each <b>rule</b> <b>curve</b> (transition zone) instead of a crisp boundary. Whenever the reservoir volume enters the transition zone the rationing factor will be changed on base of fuzzy logic concept. In order to analyze the effect of the proposed operation rule, the multi-reservoir system in Iran, namely Zohre system, is employed as a case study. According to the obtained results, the proposed hedging rule has caused marked differences in severity of shortages in comparison to applying the <b>rule</b> <b>curve</b> alone which is the usual operational policy. Table  3 shows that the proposed method has improved the results of annual system performance from 0.8 till 100 percent in comparing {{of the results of the}} simple method. Also Table  2 indicates improvement of the long-term system performance of the proposed method in comparing with the simple method from 10 till 27 percent. Table  2 shows that agriculture MSI is equal for both methods, while the proposed method improved the minimum flow MSI 63 and 46 percent in comparison with simple method for points 2 and 3, respectively. Dispersion of fuzzy-hedging factors in comparison with simple hedging factors increased the ability and flexibility of the proposed method for reducing the long-term and annual system performance during failure years. The main objective of the water resources system is reduction of MSI of minimum flow demands and the presented method can decrease it considerably.|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} improved, hedging-integrated reservoir <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> on the current and climate-change-perturbed future performances of the Pong reservoir, India. The Pong reservoir was formed by impounding the snow- and glacial-dominated Beas River in Himachal Pradesh. Simulated historic and climate-change runoff series by the HYSIM rainfall-runoff model {{formed the basis of}} the analysis. The climate perturbations used delta changes in temperature (from 0 ° to + 2 °C) and rainfall (from − 10 to + 10 % of annual rainfall). Reservoir simulations were then carried out, forced with the simulated runoff scenarios, guided by <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> derived by a coupled sequent peak algorithm and genetic algorithms optimiser. Reservoir performance was summarised in terms of reliability, resilience, vulnerability and sustainability. The results show that the historic vulnerability reduced from 61 % (no hedging) to 20 % (with hedging), i. e., better than the 25 % vulnerability often assumed tolerable for most water consumers. Climate change perturbations in the rainfall produced the expected outcomes for the runoff, with higher rainfall resulting in more runoff inflow and vice-versa. Reduced runoff caused the vulnerability to worsen to 66 % without hedging; this was improved to 26 % with hedging. The fact that improved operational practices involving hedging can effectively eliminate the impacts of water shortage caused by climate change is a significant outcome of this study...|$|R
40|$|The <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> {{developed}} {{for a specific}} reservoir are {{used to evaluate the}} performance of the reservoir within a year and compare to the forecast performance by using inflow and benefit summation curves. The range of annual benefit from lower values in dry years and higher values in wet years is obtained under certain risk conditions. The 32 -year period of reservoir routing indicates that the boundaries of annual benefit may be higher or lower expressed as positive or negative quantities added to the annual benefit. It is proven that the realized reservoir level variation followed the forecast one from August to November, and from April to July. Due to several reasons the reservoir was lowered from December to March, indicating an extremely intense lowering. Higher rates of power production are also present at the end of September - beginning of October, the first fortnight of December and in middle March. In the months of middle October to end of November due to testing of the turbines and in April due to the plant maintenance no power was produced. Although the variation of the power factor is not considerably great, it is easily understood that operation of the reservoir at lower levels than those suggested by the lower boundary of the <b>rule</b> <b>curves,</b> results in energy loss which may be in considerable amounts...|$|R
