2500|$|Beyond {{not using}} American {{military}} personnel {{to fly the}} U-2, Eisenhower preferred to use non-US citizens. [...] the nationalities of the foreign pilots recruited remains classified. The language barrier {{and a lack of}} appropriate flying experience proved problematic; by late 1955, foreign pilots had been dropped from the program. USAF pilots had to resign their military commissions before joining the agency as civilians, a process referred to as [...] "sheep dipping", and were always called [...] "drivers", not pilots. The program only recruited from fighter pilots with reserve USAF commissions, as regular commissions complicated the resignation process. The program offered high salaries and the USAF promised that pilots could return to their units at the same rank as other officers. The CIA's standards for selection were higher than the USAF's once the latter began its own U-2 flights; although more candidates were rejected, the CIA's program had a much lower accident <b>rate.</b> <b>Test</b> pilot Tony LeVier trained other Lockheed pilots to fly the U-2. By September 1955 he had trained six USAF pilots, who in turn trained other [...] "sheep-dipped" [...] pilots. As no two-seat trainer model was available for the program's first 15 years, training was done before the trainee's first solo flight and via radio. Pilots had to adjust to the U-2's unusual combination of jet engines and enormous, high-lift glider wings; because of the [...] "coffin corner" [...] they learned of the need to pay complete attention to flying when not using the autopilot.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the relative <b>rate</b> <b>test</b> has many strengths that make it invaluable for experimenters. For example, using this test, the date of divergence between two species is not needed. Also, a generalized test minimizes sampling bias and the bias of the fossil record.However, the relative <b>rate</b> <b>test</b> is very poor in some areas, such as detecting major differences compared to rate constancy if it is {{being used as a}} test for the molecular clock. Robinson claims that for this test, size does matter. The relative <b>rate</b> <b>test</b> may have a problem picking up significant variations if the tested sequences are less than one thousand nucleotides. This may be because variations are within the expected error of the test, and because there are so few nucleotides to compare, {{there is no way to}} be absolutely sure.So, the relative <b>rate</b> <b>test</b> is strong by itself, but it is usually not the only basis for a conclusion. It tends to be paired with other tests, such as branch length or two-cluster tests in order to make sure conclusions are accurate and not based on faulty results.|$|E

50|$|The other use of {{the test}} is to {{determine}} the effect of metabolic processes. It had previously been believed that birds have a much slower molecular evolutionary rate than other animals, such as mammals, but that was based solely on the small genetic differences between birds, which relied on the fossil record. This was later confirmed with the relative <b>rate</b> <b>test,</b> however the theory was that this was because of metabolic rate and a lower body temperature in birds. Mindell’s paper explains that there was no direct correlation found between these and molecular evolution in the test taxa of birds based on mitochondrial evolution, but birds as a whole do have a lower mutation rate. There are still many hypotheses in this area of study that are being tested, but the relative <b>rate</b> <b>test</b> is proving crucial in order to overcome the fossil record bias.Although these are specific instances of the relative <b>rate</b> <b>test,</b> it may also be used to compare species for phylogenetic purposes. For example, Easteal wanted to compare nucleotide substitution rates in four genes of four eutherian mammals. He did this via the relative <b>rate</b> <b>test</b> and then, using this data, he was able to construct a phylogeny using various methods, including parsimony and maximum likelihood. He took the same approach in another experiment to compare humans to other primates, and found no significant difference in evolutionary rates.|$|E

50|$|Two main {{uses for}} the {{relative}} <b>rate</b> <b>test</b> are to determine if and how generation time and metabolic processes affect mutational rate. Firstly is generation time.
