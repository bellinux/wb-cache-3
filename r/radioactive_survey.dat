40|$|The CTBTO {{verification}} {{system comprises an}} On-Site Inspection (OSI) {{to verify}} the suspicion of a forbidden nuclear test. An OSI comprises different methods of verification, one of them being the radiological survey of the inspection area. Specific equipment with high sensitivity is needed for the gamma radiation survey. Airborne and carborne survey should clearly {{be carried out by}} gross gamma counting with devices of high efficiency, whereas the definition of a sampling spot with handheld measuring devices should focus on the relevant isotopes. In fact the treaty only allows measuring some specific nuclides, which limits the inspector's ability to analyze the results and to verify the correct functioning of his measuring equipment. For example, variations in natural background may be misinterpreted easily. Until now most of the equipment used in exercises for OSI was not "blinded". The presentation will address some issues specific to this type of instrument. In recent years high resolution gamma systems with electric cooling have become really portable and reliable. Now these systems are also suitable for search tasks in the field. We carried out measurements comparing the performance of low resolution gamma measuring devices (e. g. identifinder) and high resolution gamma devices (e. g. microDetective) for searching and identifying radioactive isotopes. In an OSI the next step after finding an anomaly in the <b>radioactive</b> <b>survey</b> is to take samples and analyze these samples in the field laboratory which is located close to the base of operations. Sample preparation and sample measurement {{turned out to be a}} bottleneck in OSI performance in the last OSI exercises. Therefore, it would be of great value to the OSI if sampling could be focused to relevant spots only thus avoiding unnecessary sample analysis of non-relevant samples. Portable high resolution gamma measuring equipment may help in that...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} radioactivity monitoring programs {{start in}} the late 1950 s of the 20 th century following the global fallout from testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, becoming a cause of concern regarding health effects. Later, the necessity of world industrialization for new energy sources led to develop national plans on electricity production from nuclear technology, initializing in this context world wide exploration for fuel minerals: uranium exploration gained a particular attention in late 1940 's in USA, Canada and former USSR and in 1951 in Australia with respective national plans. Nowadays there are about 440 nuclear power plants for electricity generation with about 70 more NPP under construction giving rise to the nuclear emergency preparedness {{of a large number}} of states (like Radioactivity Environmental Monitoring (REM) data bank and EUropean Radiological Data Exchange Platform (EURDEP). Furthermore, a lot of applications in the field of geosciences are related to the environmental radioactivity measurements going from geological mapping, mineral exploration, geochemical database construction to heat -flow studies. Gamma-ray spectroscopy technique is widely used when dealing with environmental radioactivity monitoring programs. The purpose of this work is to investigate the potentialities that such a technique offers in monitoring radioactivity concentration through three different interventions in laboratory, in-situ and airborne measurements. An advanced handling of gamma-ray spectrometry method is realized by improving the performances of instruments and realizing and testing dedicated equipments able to deal with practical problems of radioactivity monitoring. For each of these gamma-ray spectrometry methods are faced also the problems of calibration, designing of monitoring plans and data analyzing and processing. In the first chapter I give a general description for the common radionuclides present in the environment having a particular interest for monitoring programs. Three categories of environmental radionuclides classified according to their origin as cosmogenic, primordial and man-made are discussed. The cosmic rays continuously produce radionulides and also direct radiation, principally high energetic muons. Cosmogenic radionuclides are originated from the interaction of cosmic rays with stable nuclides present in the Earth’s atmosphere. Primordial radionuclides are associated with the phenomenon of nucleosynthesis of the stars and are present in the Earth’s crust. Man-made radionuclides commonly present in natural environments are principally derived from radioactive fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing and peaceful applications of nuclear technology like nuclear power plants for electricity generation and the associated nuclear fuel cycle facilities. A relevant contribution, generally with local implication comes from the so called non-nuclear industries which are responsible for technologically enhancement of natural radioelements producing huge amounts of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM/TENORM). In the second chapter is described a homemade approach to the solution of the problem rising in monitoring situations in which a high number of samples is to be measured through gamma-ray spectrometry with HPGe detectors. Indeed, in such cases the costs sustaining the manpower involved in such programs becomes relevant to the laboratory budget and sometimes becomes a limitation of their capacities. Manufacturers like ORTEC® and CANBERRA produce gamma-ray spectrometers supported by special automatic sample changers which can process some tens of samples without any human attendance. However, more improvements can be done to such systems in shielding design and detection efficiency. We developed a fully automated gamma-ray spectrometer system using two coupled HPGe detectors, which is a well known method used to increase the detection efficiency. An alternative approach on shielding design and sample changer automation was realized. The utilization of two coupled HPGe detectors permits to achieve good statistical accuracies in shorter time, which contributes in drastically reducing costs and man power involved. A detailed description of the characterization of absolute full-energy peak efficiency of such instrument is reported here. Finally, the gamma-ray spectrometry system, called MCA_Rad, was used to characterize the natural radioactivity concentration of bed-rocks in Tuscany Region, Italy. More than 800 samples are measured and reported here together with the potential radioactivity concentration map of bed rocks in Tuscany Region. In the third chapter is described the application of portable scintillation gamma -ray spectrometers for in-situ monitoring programs focusing on the problems of calibration and spectrum analysis method. In-situ γ-ray spectrometry with sodium iodide scintillators is a well developed and consolidated method for <b>radioactive</b> <b>survey.</b> Conventionally, a series of self-constructed calibration pads prevalently enriched with one of the radioelements is used to calibrate this portable instrument. This method was further developed by introducing the stripping (or window analysis) described in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines as a standard methods for natural radioelement exploration and mapping. We realized a portable instrument using scintillation gamma-ray spectrometers with sodium iodide detector. An alternative calibration method using instead well-characterized natural sites, which show a prevalent concentration of one of the radioelements, is developed. This procedure supported by further development of the full spectrum analysis (FSA) method implemented in the non-negative least square (NNLS) constrain was applied for the first time in the calibration and in the spectrum analysis. This new approach permits to avoid artifacts and non physical results in the FSA analysis related with the χ 2 minimization process. It also reduces the statistical uncertainty, by minimizing time and costs, and allows to easily analyze more radioisotopes other than the natural ones. Indeed, as an example of the potentialities of such a method 137 Cs isotopes has been implemented in the analysis. Finally, this method has been tested by acquiring gamma Ombrone -ray spectra using a 10. 16 cm× 10. 16 cm sodium iodide detector in 80 different sites in the basin, in Tuscany. The results from the FSA method with NNLS constrain have been compared with the laboratory measurements by using HPGe detectors on soil samples collected. In the forth chapter is discussed the self-construction of an airborne gamma-ray spectrometer, AGRS_ 16. 0 L. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry (AGRS) method is widely considered as an important tool for mapping environmental radioactivity both for geosciences studies and for purposes of radiological emergency response in potentially contaminated sites. Indeed, they have been used in several countries since the second half of the twentieth century, like USA and Canada, Australia, Russia, Checz Republic, and Switzerland. We applied the calibration method described in the previous chapter using well -characterized natural sites and implemented for the first time in radiometric data analysis FSA analysis method with NNLS constrain. This method permits to decrease the statistical uncertainty and consequently reduce the minimum acquisition time (which depend also on AGRS system and on the flight parameters), by increasing in this way the spatial resolution. Finally, the AGRS_ 16. 0 L was used for radioelement mapping survey over Elba Island. It is well known that the natural radioactivity is strictly connected to the geological structure of the bedrocks and this information has been taken into account for the analysis and maps construction. A multivariate analysis approach was considered in the geostatistical interpolation of radiometric data, by putting them in relation with the geology though the Collocated Cokriging (CCoK) interpolator. Finally, the potential radioelement maps of potassium, uranium and thorium are constructed for Elba Island...|$|E

40|$|When {{the field}} {{consists}} of multi-pay reservoirs with the heterogeneity {{scale of the}} porous medium smaller than the marker spacing (10. 5 m) a great care must be exercised {{in the interpretation of}} a <b>radioactive</b> marker <b>survey.</b> The rock may expand, or, if the monitored depth interval incorporates thin low permeable layers or the measurement is made in an active well, the measured compaction can occur in non-oedometric conditions. In the present paper a set of radioactive marker measurements made by ENI-Divisione Agip over the last decade in 3 deep boreholes of the Northern Adriatic basin are simulated {{with the aid of a}} FE coupled poroelastic model. The modeling results show that the measurements can be reproduced satisfactorily in several case, both from a qualitative and also quantitative viewpoint, and indicate that an efficient marker installation requires that the monitored depth interval be made mostly of sand entirely depleted, with the markers placed far from a producing well and approximately 10. 5 m apart. The cM constitutive law used in the numerical analysis appears to be realistically accurate for a depth larger than 2500 m and generally underestimated between 800 and 1500 m.

40|$|Stabilization {{techniques}} for {{the storage of}} <b>radioactive</b> wastes are <b>surveyed,</b> with emphasis on immobilization in a primary barrier of synthetic rock. The composition, half-life, and thermal-emission characteristics of the wastes are shown to require thermally stable immobilization enduring at least 100, 000 years. Glass materials are determined to be incapable of withstanding the expected conditions, average temperatures of 100 - 500 C for the first 100 years. The geological-time stability of crystalline materials, ceramics or synthetic rocks, is examined in detail by comparing their components with similar naturally occurring minerals, especially those containing the same radioactive elements. The high-temperature environment over the first 100 years is seen as stabilizing, since it can recrystallize radiation-induced metamicts. The synthetic-rock stabilization technique {{is found to be}} essentially feasible, and improvements are suggested, including the substitution of nepheline with freudenbergite and priderite for alkaline-waste stabilization, the maintenance of low oxygen fugacity, and the dilution of the synthetic-rock pellets into an inert medium...|$|R

The survey was conducted in three phases: Phase 1 on December 11 - 12, 2007 (Areas 1 and 2), Phase 2 on February 28, 2008 (Area 3), and Phase 3 on March 19, 2008 (Area 4). The total completed survey covered a total of 44. 6 square miles. The flight lines (without the turns) over the surveyed areas are presented in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4. A total of eight 2. 5 -hour-long flights were performed at an altitude of 150 ft above ground level (AGL) with 300 feet of flight-line spacing. Water line and test line flights were conducted over the Lake Mead and Government Wash areas to ensure quality control of the data. The data were collected by the AMS data acquisition system (REDAR V) using an array of twelve 2 -inch x 4 -inch x 16 -inch sodium iodide (NaI) detectors flown on-board a twin-engine Bell 412 helicopter. Data, in the form of gamma energy spectra, were collected continually (every second) {{over the course of the}} survey and were geo-referenced using a differential Global Positioning System.

The instrument consists of a flexible rubber hose with an integrated gamma ray spectrometer that measures the full gamma spectrum between 0. 1 and 1. 8 MeV while being towed along the seafloor by a ship. The data processing methods described allow for quantification of 137 Cs and 134 Cs concentration in marine sediments, and a technique has been developed to optimize the spatial resolution of the measurements for each radioactive species for a given level of statistical uncertainty. The system was deployed during August and November 2012 to measure the distribution of radionuclides along three transects within an 80 km radius of the plant. Increased levels of 137 Cs and 134 Cs were recorded and their distributions mapped continuously over distances of 1. 6, 12. 5 and 22 km respectively. The levels of 137 Cs and 134 Cs were found to vary significantly with location. The in situ measurements show good agreement with laboratory analyzed samples obtained during the surveys.

40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) is the UK {{public sector}} {{research}} establishment {{with the prime}} function of compiling national inventories of geological resources and managing the resource environment. We provide essential research and baseline evidence to support policy on energy supply, natural resources, infrastructure planning and environmental management. This influences almost all major sectors of society, the national economy, and the private sector. Topical examples include: ▪▪ assessment of shale gas resources from hydraulic fracturing (‘fracking’) ▪▪ development of {{carbon capture and storage}} ▪▪ advice to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority on geological disposal of radioactive waste ▪▪ site selection for major projects such as the Olympic Games or the third runway at Heathrow ▪▪ natural hazards (volcanoes, earthquakes, space weather, sink holes, flooding) ▪▪ mining subsidence ▪▪ maintaining the UK as a leader in global geoscience. This requires us to map, observe and model the landmass, which is done in close association with government, private sector stakeholders and the universities. This collaboration is essential to provide robust testing of data and models through research. We must develop deeper partnerships with ecologists, sociologists, economists and the public, and our data is available to share for a multitude of uses via digital media. This business plan aims to underpin our activities for 2016 / 17 to 2018 / 19. It includes key objectives and indicators of success and provides a forward look for new markets and research directions. The BGS strategy Gateway to the Earth was published in 20131 and sets out our vision and aspirations to be a pre-eminent researchactive global geological survey, working with new technology and data to understand and predict the geological and environmental processes that matter to people’s lives and livelihoods. This will be achieved by combining new technologies with our existing expertise in geology, geochemistry, geophysics, informatics and data management so that we understand how geological processes act in real time and can predict their effects on geological resources (energy, minerals and waste), geohazards and environmental change. We will continue to operate a mixed funding model which involves public national good science, research, innovation funds and capital funds from NERC or other government sources. The model also includes competitively won non-NERC income which currently represents approximately 50 per cent of our total budget. We anticipate that during the financial years 2016 / 17 to 2018 / 19 we will change our relationship with our current parent body, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

40|$|The {{response}} of large volume Airborne Gamma Spectrometry (AGS) detectors has been modelled using Monte Carlo methods {{as part of}} an assessment of ways to enhance monitoring of beaches and other coastal areas for <b>radioactive</b> particles. Airborne <b>survey</b> methods are capable of rapid surveys of large areas, and of covering diverse environments effectively, including areas where ground based work is difficult to implement safely. They have potential for increasing the effectiveness of ground based surveys, working in a complementary manner to identify areas where detailed work including recovery operations would be targeted. The study presented here is a continuation of an earlier study defining point source detection limits for airborne gamma spectrometry in natural radioactivity backgrounds representative of the West Cumbria beaches. Here anthropogenic backgrounds in the area are also reviewed together with their impact on detection limits. Similarly the signals that would be expected from particles already recovered from the beaches of West Cumbria are assessed in comparison with observed background for 137 Cs to appraise the extent to which those particles recovered may have contributed to past airborne surveys of the beaches. Theoretical sensitivities have been assessed using airborne systems operated under two survey designs: a “rapid” design at 75 m (200 ft) ground clearance and a 70 knot (30 m s- 1) survey speed, capable of surveying > 60 km of shore in a 2 h survey with multiple lines; and also a “slow and low” design based on 15 m (50 ft) ground clearance and 15 knot (5 ms- 1) forward velocity, suitable to surveys of 5 km of beach in a 2 h flight. Additional consideration is given to surveys at further reduced height and speed, to meet a detection criterion of 105 Bq sources at 10 cm burial depth. Monte-Carlo methods were used to simulate the full spectral responses for a series of 137 Cs and 241 Am point sources placed in simulated natural background environments with varying 137 Cs background distributions. The MCII Monte Carlo code developed at SUERC, which has been extensively validated in the past and incorporates statistical estimation procedures to simulate spectra at airborne source-detector separations, was used. A review of the distribution of dispersed 137 Cs on the beaches showed areas of beach with negligible 137 Cs activity, areas with approximately uniform 137 Cs backgrounds, and areas with patches of dimensions of 5 - 10 m with elevated 137 Cs activity. Samples collected from the higher activity areas of the beaches had activity concentrations of 50 Bq kg- 1. Spectra were simulated for 137 Cs background distributions for single and multiple patches of activity with 10 m dimensions and 50 Bq kg- 1 concentrations, and uniform distributions of different concentrations, at 75 and 15 m heights. The analyses for point sources with the medium natural background conducted in the earlier study were repeated with these different 137 Cs backgrounds. The data for the location, depth and activity for the recovered particles were used to simulate the spectra that an airborne system would observe from these particles, and compared with the spectra recorded during earlier surveys of the beaches of West Cumbria. Each particle recovered is below the detection limit of a 75 m survey, and even cumulatively the recovered finds would not result in any observed signal in the past surveys.

40|$|Corrective Action Site (CAS) 02 - 37 - 02, Gas Sampling Assembly, is {{associated}} with nuclear test MULLET. MULLET was an underground safety test conducted on October 17, 1963. The experiment also involved prompt sampling of particulate material from the detonation, similar to CAS 09 - 99 - 06, Gas Sampling Assembly, which {{is associated}} with PLAYER/YORK. The sampling system at MULLET {{was similar to that}} of PLAYER/YORK and was used to convey gas from the MULLET emplacement hole (U 2 ag) to a sampling assembly. Beyond the sampling assembly, the system had a &#x 27;Y&#x 27; junction with one branch running to a filter unit and the other running to a scrubber unit. The total system length was approximately 250 feet and is depicted on the attached drawing. According to the available background information, retrieval of the sample material from the MULLET event caused significant alpha (plutonium) contamination, limited to an area near ground zero (GZ). Test support Radiological Control Technicians did not detect contamination outside the immediate GZ area. In addition, vehicles, equipment, and workers that were contaminated were decontaminated on site. Soil contamination was addressed through the application of oil, and the site was decommissioned after the test. Any equipment that could be successfully decontaminated and had a future use was removed from the site. The contaminated equipment and temporary buildings erected to support the test were buried on site, most likely in the area under the dirt berm. The exact location of the buried equipment and temporary buildings is unknown. No information was found describing the disposition of the filter and scrubber, but they are not known to be at the site. The COMMODORE test was conducted at U 2 am on May 20, 1967, and formed the crater next to CAS 02 - 37 - 02. The COMMODORE test area had been surveyed prior to the test, and alpha contamination was not identified. Furthermore, alpha contamination was not identified during the COMMODORE re-entry survey, and routine surveys around the crater lip did not identify alpha contamination. Background information includes several radiological surveys conducted after these two tests. The MULLET area has been surveyed frequently. The early surveys indicate the area as both contaminated and containing buried <b>radioactive</b> material. A <b>survey</b> conducted in 1970 found the radiological/chemical piping partially intact, including the &#x 27;Y&#x 27; junction, and shows two runs of intact piping running past the U 2 am crater lip. The survey focused on the piping system itself and detected alpha contamination from 4 counts per minute (cpm) to 900, 000 cpm. The highest value was at a pipe flange between a dirt pile and a dirt berm within the current site fence line. All readings were direct, and no smears were taken. A 1972 survey was essentially a repeat of the 1970 survey; however, it does not show the &#x 27;Y&#x 27; junction nor does it show piping extending past the U 2 am crater lip. It also shows a new fence line separating the radiological/chemical piping from the U 2 am crater area with all piping within the fence. Alpha contamination was detected on pipe flanges during the survey, but alpha contamination was not detected on the dirt pile or the dirt berm. All readings were direct, and no smears were taken. Additional surveys were conducted in 1986, 1990, 1992, 1993, and 1996. One of the surveys focused on determining the extent of soil contamination around GZ. An alpha contamination plume extending approximately 200 feet south of GZ was detected in a swath approximately 100 feet wide. The maximum measurement was 15, 000 cpm alpha. All surveys show the piping within the fence line. Recent surveys (2007 and 2008) were performed around the current fence line by the demarcation group. No removable contamination was identified during these surveys. In late 2008, a visual inspection of the site was conducted by the National Security Technologies, LLC, Environmental Restoration group. All piping is within the fence line.

This study examined the theoretical sensitivities that might be obtained using airborne systems operated at 75 m (200 ft) ground clearance and a 70 knot (30 m s- 1) survey speed, and also a “slow and low” design based on 15 m (50 ft) ground clearance and 15 knot (5 ms- 1) forward velocity, or slower. Monte-Carlo methods were used to simulate the full spectral responses for a series of 137 Cs and 241 Am point sources placed in simulated natural background environments. The MCII Monte Carlo code, which has been extensively validated in the past and incorporates statistical estimation procedures to simulate spectra at airborne source-detector separations, was used. This code was set up for automatic sampling of the complex gamma ray spectra associated with the natural uranium and thorium decay series, with energy- intensity files collated from the JEFF 3. 1. 1 nuclear data for all lines from the natural decay series and 40 K, without truncating low intensities. Thus a comprehensive description of the photon intensities of natural sources was achieved. The code was re-validated in this study using simulated and measured data for concrete calibration pads at SUERC and shown to be in excellent agreement with measured spectra in close coupled geometries. A brief assessment of the GEANT Monte Carlo package indicated that it was not ideally suited to the large source-detector geometries of airborne measurements. The geology and geochemistry of the Cumbrian coastline was reviewed, and data used to define mass absorption coefficients for substrates with a composition similar to St Bees Sandstone. For energies above 200 keV, the mass absorption coefficients are insensitive to the range of major element compositions of different materials in the Sellafield area. These coefficients were incorporated in the Monte Carlo code, and used to simulate reference spectra for unit concentrations of 40 K, Uranium and Thorium series sources at the two airborne survey ground clearances defined for the study. Uniform vertical and lateral activity distributions were used for these natural background reference spectra, representing a reasonable starting point for the work. These were combined and scaled to the natural radioelement concentrations determined previously from an area of beach south of St. Bees Head, and north of Sellafield, which had been surveyed in 2000 {{as part of a larger}} study commissioned by DEFRA. The agreement with the measured spectra from the earlier survey in the energy range associated with natural gamma rays was excellent, thus validating the simulation at airborne heights. Data from past surveys and other ground based measurements were also reviewed to assess the levels and variations of natural background sources in the coastal areas of West Cumbria. These were used to define three working levels (“Low”, “Medium” and “High”) of natural background concentrations, whose AGS contributions were simulated at the two airborne survey ground clearances, to form the natural background levels against which detection limits for point sources could be considered in the study. Additional simulations of the system responses to 137 Cs sources in superficial locations, and at a burial depth of 10 cm, and of superficial 241 Am sources were conducted for the two reference heights, and a series of source-detector offset distances. These were used to assess detection limits and signal significance levels for different survey scenarios, based on full energy peak count rates for the source spectra and the simulated backgrounds. The signal profiles corresponding to flight lines directly over and adjacent to the sources were also simulated for the first time. The results have shown that AGS surveys at 75 m (200 ft) ground clearance and 70 knots (30 m s- 1), capable of surveying > 60 km of shore in a 2 h survey with multiple lines, should detect 137 Cs sources of 5 - 10 MBq or greater in the presence of uniform natural radiation fields representing typical compositions for the area. More detailed surveys at 15 m (50 ft) ground clearance and 5 knots (2 m s- 1) should detect 137 Cs sources of 105 Bq at a depth of 10 cm. Surveys at these reduced heights and speeds should also detect superficial 241 Am sources of 106 Bq or greater. A high density survey, in which the source is registered in more than one measurement, would increase the significance of the summed signal by about 0. 5 σ. Reducing ground clearance would increase full energy peak count rates, by an order of magnitude at 5 m compared to 15 m. It would be expected that surveys at these ground clearances would significantly increase the significance of full-energy peak counts from sources, although the natural series spectra have not been simulated to quantify this.
