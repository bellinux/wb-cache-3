5|$|Thorium dioxide is a <b>refractory</b> <b>material</b> {{with the}} highest melting point among any known oxide (3390°C). Adding 0.8–1% ThO2 to {{tungsten}} stabilizes its structure, so the doped filaments have better mechanical stability to vibrations. To dissolve ThO2 in acids, it is heated to 500–600°C; heating above 600°C produces a very resistant to acids and other reagents form of ThO2. Small addition of fluoride ions catalyses dissolution of thorium dioxide in acids.|$|E
