5|$|After {{moving to}} the Montreal area, the LeDucs debuted in the International Wrestling Association with a scripted attack on local wrestler Johnny <b>Rougeau.</b> This led to a feud between the LeDucs and the Rougeaus (Johnny and his real-life brother Jacques). Jos LeDuc was booked to win the Montreal version of the International Heavyweight Championship by {{defeating}} Johnny <b>Rougeau</b> in 1971. The bookers also decided {{to give him a}} run with the International Tag Team Championship that year, which LeDuc won while teaming with Tony Baillargeon. While in Montreal, the LeDucs also competed for Grand Prix Wrestling and were booked in a feud with the Vachon brothers (Mad Dog and Butcher) as well as Killer Kowalski. The LeDucs had two reigns as the Grand Prix Wrestling Tag Team Championship in 1972 and 1973.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, LeDuc {{returned}} to Southeastern Championship Wrestling {{and was given}} two more tag team title reigns while teaming with Fuller. Ultimately, however, the team split up and vacated the title. LeDuc was then booked in singles competition, winning the Southeastern Heavyweight Championship twice more with victories over Jacques <b>Rougeau,</b> Jr. and Terry Gordy. He was also put over Terry Gordy to win the NWA Alabama Heavyweight Championship in May 1982, but LeDuc dropped the title that summer to Austin Idol.|$|E
5|$|The event {{began with}} a match between The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond <b>Rougeau).</b> As soon as the bell rang to signify that the match had begun, Smith {{attacked}} Jacques. The two teams traded blows until The Rougeaus flipped Dynamite Kid over their heads so that he fell on {{his back to the}} mat. Dynamite Kid escaped another offensive maneuver before tagging in his partner, Smith, and The British Bulldogs performed a double-team maneuver on Jacques. Despite having the upper hand, The Bulldogs failed to pin Jacques in time, and the match ended in a twenty-minute time draw.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Rougeaus</b> had {{a real-life}} altercation with Tom Billington (the Dynamite Kid from The British Bulldogs) {{backstage}} in 1988. [...] "Mr. Perfect" [...] Curt Hennig had framed the Bulldogs in a prank at the Rougeaus' expense where the Dynamite Kid repeatedly slapped and punched Jacques {{in the face}} while Jacques had his back turned. Tension between Dynamite and the <b>Rougeaus</b> mounted until the night Jacques punched him in the mouth with a roll of quarters in hand causing Dynamite to lose four teeth. After the attack, Billington harbored a grudge against the <b>Rougeaus,</b> and it was feared that he might try to get his revenge after their 10-team, 20-man elimination match at the Survivor Series 1988 PPV (which was his final match in the WWF). The match had the <b>Rougeaus,</b> Demolition, Brain Busters, The Bolsheviks, and Los Conquistadores vs. The British Bulldogs, The Rockers, The Hart Foundation, The Young Stallions, and The Powers of Pain. For fear of the Dynamite Kid taking his revenge, the match was booked so the <b>Rougeaus</b> were the first team eliminated, with Bret Hart pinning Raymond in the bout's opening minutes with a small package. The Bulldogs were kept in the match until they {{were one of the}} final four teams remaining. By the time the Bulldogs had been eliminated and made their way back to the locker room, the <b>Rougeaus</b> had already been rushed out of the building. In the event, during the actual match, Dynamite worked with the <b>Rougeaus</b> without incident.|$|R

5|$|Wrestling with a {{lumberjack}} gimmick, he {{debuted in}} Stampede Wrestling with his kayfabe brother, Paul LeDuc. The pair later won several titles in Montreal, where they feuded with the <b>Rougeau</b> wrestling family, and Florida, where {{they held the}} NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. After an injury ended Paul's career, LeDuc competed as a singles wrestler and involved in a heated feud with Dusty Rhodes. LeDuc then moved to Tennessee, where he had a rivalry with Jerry Lawler over the NWA Mid-America Southern Tag Team Championship, notably legitimately breaking Lawler's leg when he threw him over the top rope onto the announcer's desk.|$|E
25|$|The Bulldogs {{left the}} WWF after {{backstage}} pranks and altercations with The <b>Rougeau</b> Brothers {{which led to}} Jacques <b>Rougeau</b> knocking several of Dynamite's teeth out with a suckerpunch (<b>Rougeau</b> was actually carrying a bunch of quarters in his fist to make the punch harder). Billington himself, however, has claimed that the <b>Rougeau</b> incident was not the final straw that drove {{him to leave the}} WWF. Rather, he has stated, it was a dispute with WWF management over issuing of complimentary plane tickets, over which he resigned from the company on principle and, to his surprise in retrospect, Smith followed suit.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} WCW Blondin {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} Canadian wrestling in Quebec and Eastern Canada. In 2001, Blondin made several appearances for Jacques <b>Rougeau,</b> Jr.'s Lutte International 2000. During its June 1 show at the Auditorium de Verdun, Blondin addressed the 3,500 crowd with Jacques Rougeau's son Cedric opening for the professional debut 12-year-old Jean Jacques <b>Rougeau,</b> another of Jacques' sons, against midget wrestler Little Broken. The previous month, he had appeared at a press conference with the Jacques <b>Rougeau,</b> Sr. {{and the rest of the}} <b>Rougeau</b> family to promote the event and gave a speech on the Rougeau's contributions to Canadian professional wrestling.|$|E

5000|$|The Rougeaus' {{next big}} feud was against The Rockers in 1989. The feud {{began when the}} Rockers debuted a new theme song for {{themselves}} with them singing (this new theme was soon dropped, however). The <b>Rougeaus</b> claimed that the Rockers were [...] "copycats," [...] and hit Shawn Michaels in the throat with Jimmy Hart's megaphone. The teams feuded over the summer of 1989, producing many excellent, raved-about matches. At SummerSlam 89, the <b>Rougeaus</b> teamed with fellow Canadian Rick Martel, defeating the Rockers and Martel's former Strike Force tag-team partner Tito Santana in a six-man tag team match. After their initial feuds against the face teams of the era, the <b>Rougeaus</b> quickly devolved into a comedy tag team, often coming out on the short end against The Bushwhackers.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{match was}} a tag team match between The Bushwhackers (Luke and Butch) and The Fabulous <b>Rougeaus</b> (Jacques and Raymond). The Bushwhackers grabbed Rougeaus' manager Jimmy Hart's jacket but <b>Rougeaus</b> caught them {{and went on}} the attack. Luke and Raymond began the match and Luke missed a fist drop on Raymond, but Luke and Butch hit him a {{battering}} ram. Luke made the cover but Jacques came in and accidentally hit a knee drop on Raymond as {{he was going to}} hit Luke but Luke sidestepped. <b>Rougeaus</b> double-teamed Luke for a while as the referee was busy with Butch. They kicked Luke in the gut and then celebrated. They celebrated too much that Bushwhackers hit Raymond a battering ram and a rib breaker. Luke then pinned Raymond to win the match.|$|R
25|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, he began {{training}} with his uncles Real Choinard and Aldrick Harvey who wrestled occasionally for promoter Johnny <b>Rougeau.</b> In 1968, he began touring northern Ontario {{during the summer}} for Larry Kasaboski. During {{his time in the}} area, he was trained by Vic Tanney and later wrestled for Johnny <b>Rougeau</b> in Quebec for a time before traveling to Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling.|$|E

They {{got involved in}} a feud with The Bolsheviks, {{which was to be}} settled at WrestleMania V. Bolsheviks missed the event, however, so they were replaced by The Fabulous <b>Rougeaus</b> (Jacques and Raymond), whom Bushwhackers beat. Bushwhackers and <b>Rougeaus</b> continued to feud with each other {{for the rest of the}} year, culminating in a tag team match at Royal Rumble 1990.|$|R
25|$|In February, the Bushwhackers began a {{feud with}} The Fabulous <b>Rougeau</b> Brothers, the first feud to really feature the Bushwhackers on WWF television. The two teams took their {{conflict}} to WrestleMania V, which saw the Bushwhackers victorious in their WWF Pay Per View debut as a team. The WrestleMania match {{was not the}} end of the Bushwhackers/Rougeau feud, as the teams clashed again on the 14 October edition of Saturday Night's Main Event (taped 21 September); again, the Bushwhackers were victorious. The Bushwhackers and the Rougeaus clashed twice more, first at the 1989 Survivor Series and again at the 1990 Royal Rumble; the Bushwhackers got the best of the <b>Rougeau</b> brothers both times.|$|E
25|$|August 17: A trio of Big Red {{players were}} {{selected}} to the Canadian U22 National Team. Sophomore Catherine White and incoming freshmen Lauriane <b>Rougeau</b> and Laura Fortino were selected among the 23-player roster. Chelsea Karpenko participated at the camp but was not named to the team.|$|E
25|$|With {{impressive}} local signings, {{next came}} the two imports. The first import announced was former UNLV Runnin' Rebels swingman René <b>Rougeau,</b> {{who was a}} star performer in his four years at the college. The Sharks struggled {{in their search for}} a second import as they were running out of time {{before the start of the}} season. With captain Luke Martin's responsibilities to the Wollongong Hawks keeping him from joining the squad on time, the Sharks signed former Melbourne Tigers' shooting guard Mike Rose to a short-term deal. The Sharks also acquired the services of Invercargill-based players Paratene McLeod, Bubba Lau'ese, Izaac Williams, Andrew Wheeler and Tevita Bauer.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Rougeaus</b> {{actually}} won the WWF Tag Team Championship on August 10, 1987 at the Forum, in a House Show, defeating The Hart Foundation. Jimmy Hart, the Hart Foundation's manager, {{tried to}} interfere {{on their behalf}} with his signature foreign object, a megaphone. The megaphone was intercepted by the <b>Rougeaus,</b> who used it to get the pin and win the titles. They were announced as the new tag team champions, but the decision was later reversed and their title win was never recognized by the WWF.|$|R
25|$|During 1989, Gaylord {{would also}} appear on WWF Wrestling Challenge teaming with Tim Horner against The Fabulous <b>Rougeaus</b> on April 16, before {{returning}} to World Class Championship Wrestling facing veterans such as Jimmy Jack Funk and Kerry Von Erich.|$|R

25|$|In {{their first}} ever NBL game on 6 March 2010, at Stadium Southland, the Sharks faced the Hawke's Bay Hawks {{in front of}} 1,500 fans. Their {{starters}} Martin Iti, James Paringatai, René <b>Rougeau,</b> Mike Rose and Daniel Munday all put up strong performances, with Munday scoring the team's first basket. After 40 minutes, the teams could not be separated, with the scores locked at 84-all. With an overtime period needed, the Hawks came out victorious, winning 105–90. After losing their next game 96–82 away from home to the Harbour Heat at the North Shore Events Centre, the Sharks took revenge against first-up opponents, Hawke's Bay, to achieve their first ever win. After their first win, they were bought back down to earth as they were thrashed by 44 points by the Wellington Saints. After seven games, Mike Helms replaced Rose as the Sharks' second import. The Sharks left themselves {{in a good position}} to reach the playoffs {{for the first time in}} their first season as they only needed to win two of four away games to end the season. Their away trip began with the Sharks losing in overtime to the second-placed Waikato Pistons at Hamilton Boys' High School. They then came one win closer to the playoffs with a win against the Taranaki Mountainairs. A loss to the Nelson Giants saw the Sharks needing to beat the lowly Manawatu Jets in their regular season finale. With a 96–88 win over the Jets, the Sharks claimed sixth spot and booked themselves a playoff berth. They went on to lose in their quarter-final match-up to the Nelson Giants, 82–67, ending their inaugural season in the NBL. Centre Martin Iti earned Rookie of the Year honours, while import swingman René <b>Rougeau</b> was named to the All-Star Five.|$|E

25|$|In the National Wrestling Federation, Wisniski {{defeated}} Johnny Powers for the NWF North American Heavyweight Championship on September 1, 1972. Powers beat Wisniski for {{the title}} in October, but Wisniski won the title again from Abdullah the Butcher on October 19. He was stripped of the title following a match with Johnny Powers. On November 23, he captured the title from Powers, but lost it again in January. In the Japan Wrestling Association, Wisniski won the International Tag Team title on February 22, 1973, and then the United National Heavyweight Championship on March 2. He lost the Tag title on March 6, and the United Heavyweight title on March 8.

25|$|They competed against The Twin Towers, Akeem and Big Boss Man, at WrestleMania V. According to Michaels' autobiography, he was {{nursing a}} severe {{hangover}} {{in the hours}} before this match. In spring 1989, The Rockers started a storyline with The Fabulous <b>Rougeau</b> Brothers that kicked off with an underhanded attack on Michaels during a match. The Rougeaus assaulted Michaels with manager Jimmy Hart’s megaphone and drew blood. This storyline put The Rockers' issues with The Brain Busters on the back burners while The Rockers and the Rougeaus fought. The issue between The Rockers and Rougeaus was the storyline reason for introducing the “Iron Man match” to the WWF. Despite wrestling 5 Iron Man matches against each other none of the matches were ever televised or released on a commercial tape. On August 28, 1989, the Rockers/Rougeau feud made it to PPV as the Rougeaus teamed with Rick Martel to defeat The Rockers and Tito Santana at SummerSlam.|$|E
25|$|However WWF owner Vince McMahon {{seemed to}} lose {{interest}} {{in the idea of}} pushing the team. This may have been due, in part, to the fact that Powers and Roma did not get along with each other behind the curtain. In later interviews, Roma called Powers difficult to work with. The Stallions lost house show matches to The <b>Rougeau</b> Brothers (Jacques and Raymond) in May, then dropped multiple encounters to The Bolsheviks the following month. Roma & Powers even lost to The Conquistadors on a house show in Warwick, Rhode Island on July 3, {{and by the end of}} the summer had lost all momentum, losing multiple encounters to The Killer Bees. The team that had shocked the world less than a year earlier was now devoid of a push, and was fodder for the Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard) in the fall. A year after winning the inaugural Survivor Series, The Young Stallions found themselves the second team eliminated in the 1988 event.|$|E

Similarly, Adam Nedeff of 411mania.com called the tag team match between The British Bulldogs and The <b>Rougeaus</b> [...] "a solid match" [...] but stated that the [...] "lack of a finish was a disappointment". Although he reviewed most of the matches negatively, he called the WWF World Tag Team Championship match a [...] "good match".
