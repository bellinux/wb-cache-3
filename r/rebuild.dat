40|$|Stock-rebuilding time {{isopleths}} relate constant {{levels of}} fishing mortality (F), stock biomass, and management goals to <b>rebuilding</b> times for overfished stocks. We used simulation models with uncertainty about FMSY and variability in annual intrinsic growth rates (ry) to calculate <b>rebuilding</b> time isopleths for Georges Bank yellowtail flounder, Limanda ferruginea, and cowcod rockfish, Sebastes levis, in the Southern California Bight. Stock-rebuilding time distributions from stochastic models were variable and right-skewed, indicating that <b>rebuilding</b> may take less or substantially {{more time than}} expected. The probability of long <b>rebuilding</b> times increased with lower biomass, higher F, uncertainty about FMSY, and autocorrelation in ry values. Uncertainty about FMSY had the greatest effect on <b>rebuilding</b> times. Median recovery times from simulations were insensitive to model assumptions about uncertainty and variability, suggesting that median recovery times {{should be considered in}} <b>rebuilding</b> plans. Isopleths calculated in previous studies by deterministic models approximate median, rather than mean, <b>rebuilding</b> times. Stochastic models allow managers to specify and evaluate the risk (measured as a probability) of not achieving a <b>rebuilding</b> goal according to schedule. <b>Rebuilding</b> time isopleths can be used for stocks with a range of life histories and can be based on any type of population dynamics model. They are directly applicable with constant F <b>rebuilding</b> plans but are also useful in other cases. We used new algorithms for simulating autocorrelated process errors from a gamma distribution and evaluated sensitivity to statistical distributions assumed for ry.

40|$|Under the U. S. Sustainable Fisheries Act, <b>Rebuilding</b> Plans must be {{developed}} for overfished stocks. <b>Rebuilding</b> Plans typically include analyses to determine the minimum time to recover to BMSY and the fish-ing mortality {{that is consistent with}} stock recovery within the required timeframe and with specified probability PMAX. Seven rockfish stocks are currently under <b>Rebuilding</b> Plans adopted by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC). Progress toward meeting <b>rebuilding</b> objec-tives must be evaluated at least every second year, which could lead to changes to how these stocks are managed. Although a harvest control rule has been adopted by the PFMC for healthy stocks, and methods for conducting the initial analyses needed to develop <b>Rebuilding</b> Plans for overfished stocks are well established, there are presently no agreed upon methods (“Rebuilding Revision Rules”) for (1) assessing adequacy of progress toward <b>rebuilding</b> and (2) altering <b>Rebuilding</b> Plans, given a change in stock status. To assist decision-making, we conducted a man-agement strategy evaluation (MSE) to compare alternative <b>Rebuilding</b> Revision Rules using a suite of performance measures selected to quan-tify likely PFMC goals for <b>rebuilding.</b> The results of the MSE show that (1) adjustments to harvest rates occur often, (2) a policy that attempts to maintain the original PMAX tends to be overly responsive to noise, and (3) setting PMAX to a high value provides a buffer against uncertainty. 330 Punt and Ralston—Rebuilding Revision Rule...|$|R

40|$|Effective <b>rebuilding</b> of {{international}} fisheries {{is one of}} the major challenges of fisheries management, and it is recognised that joint effort is required to ensure sustainable fisheries for highly migratory and transboundary stocks. Two Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) <b>rebuilding</b> plans are described in this section, namely the Southern Bluefin Tune managed under the auspices of the Commission for Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) and Greenland Halibut, under the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO). These cases reveal that the issues identified in COFI’s publication on Strengthening Regional Fisheries Management Organizations are also a factor during the <b>rebuilding</b> process. Specifically, ― … lack of political will, disparate national agendas, divergent economic priorities, different time horizons and scientific uncertainty …‖ 2 also play a role in the design, implementation and enforcement of <b>rebuilding</b> plans.

40|$|Abstract onlyThe OECD {{fisheries}} committee is finalizing a {{project on the}} economics of <b>rebuilding</b> fisheries. The focus of the study has been the economic and institutional aspects of the <b>rebuilding</b> process, and the main objectives were to identify economic, social and governance components underpinning successful <b>rebuilding</b> based on the experiences of OECD countries, {{and to develop a}} set of practical and evidence based principles and guidelines for designing and implementing fisheries <b>rebuilding</b> plans. Norway has contributed to this project with a review of the Norwegian policy on fisheries <b>rebuilding</b> programs, supported by case studies on the <b>rebuilding</b> of the Northeast Arctic cod and Norwegian Spring Spawning herring. The case of the cod fishery {{is an example of a}} successful <b>rebuilding</b> where many challenges are accounted for, including joint management (with Russia), segmented fleet structure (trawlers and coastal vessels), regional differences and distributional issues. The <b>rebuilding</b> process stressed to secure a precautionary level of fishing mortality, while at the same time restructuring the fishing fleet to secure economic viability. The outcome is a significant improvement from both a biological and economic point of view. The backdrop for fisheries management and <b>rebuilding</b> across the OECD-member countries is not uniform, and this has also been one of the main challenges when developing a set of principles and guidelines that could be adopted by consensus in the {{fisheries committee}}.
