25|$|When Herbert Hoover {{graduated}} from Stanford in June 1895, {{they had decided}} to delay wedding plans while she continued her education and he pursued his engineering career in Australia. In 1898, the year she {{graduated from}} Stanford, Hoover cabled a marriage proposal, which she promptly accepted by <b>return</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
25|$|Long-distance {{electromagnetic}} telegraph {{systems from}} 1820 onwards used {{two or more}} wires to carry the signal and return currents. It was then discovered, probably by the German scientist Carl August Steinheil in 1836–1837, that the ground {{could be used as}} the return path to complete the circuit, making the <b>return</b> <b>wire</b> unnecessary. However, there were problems with this system, exemplified by the transcontinental telegraph line constructed in 1861 by the Western Union Company between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. During dry weather, the ground connection often developed a high resistance, requiring water to be poured on the ground rod to enable the telegraph to work or phones to ring.|$|E
500|$|The Paddington to West Drayton {{telegraph}} originally used six wires {{rather than}} five, {{although it was}} a five-needle system. [...] The sixth wire was to provide a common return so that the needles could be operated independently, thus giving the possibility of more available codes. [...] Using these codes, however, would have required more extensive operator training since the display could not be read on sight from the grid as the simple alphabetic codes were. [...] Telegraph systems were later to use earth return to avoid the need for a <b>return</b> <b>wire,</b> but this [...] principle was not established at the time of Cooke and Wheatstone's telegraph. [...] The economic need {{to reduce the number of}} wires in the end proved a stronger incentive than simplicity of use and led Cooke and Wheatstone to develop the two-needle telegraph.|$|E
5000|$|Twenty primers, with fuses {{and wires}} {{properly}} {{arranged in a}} box, with lead and <b>return</b> <b>wires</b> on reels, were carried to each party engaged in this work. The time consumed in placing 3,680 primers, unreeling the lead and <b>return</b> <b>wires,</b> and leading these out of the shaft, was two days and a fraction.|$|R

25|$|Double-pole / DP / two-pole - the RCD will {{disconnect}} {{both the}} energized and <b>return</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
2500|$|RCDs {{are usually}} {{testable}} and resettable devices. Commonly {{they include a}} button that when pressed, safely creates a small leakage condition, and a switch that reconnects the conductors when a fault condition has been cleared. Depending upon their design, some RCDs disconnect both the energized and return conductors upon a fault, while others only disconnect the energized conductor and rely upon the return conductor being at ground (earth) potential. [...] The former {{are commonly known as}} [...] "double-pole" [...] designs; the latter as [...] "single-pole" [...] designs. [...] If the fault has left the <b>return</b> <b>wire</b> [...] "floating" [...] or not at its expected ground potential for any reason, then a single-pole RCD will leave this conductor still connected to the circuit when it detects the fault.|$|E
2500|$|An {{experimental}} line, with a sixth <b>return</b> <b>wire,</b> was run {{between the}} Euston terminus and Camden Town station of the London and North Western Railway on 25 July 1837. The actual distance {{was only one}} and a half-mile (2.4km), but spare wire had been inserted in the circuit to increase its length. It {{was late in the}} evening before the trial took place. Mr Cooke was in charge at Camden Town, while Mr Robert Stephenson and other gentlemen looked on; and Wheatstone sat at his instrument in a dingy little room, lit by a tallow candle, near the booking-office at Euston. Wheatstone sent the first message, to which Cooke replied, and 'never' said Wheatstone, 'did I feel such a tumultuous sensation before, as when, all alone in the still room, I heard the needles click, and as I spelled the words, I felt all the magnitude of the invention pronounced to be practicable beyond cavil or dispute.' ...|$|E

Very good, we {{will send a}} second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: 'Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, please <b>return</b> <b>wire</b> to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.' That should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{lead and}} <b>return</b> <b>wires</b> were copper wires of No. 12 American gauge (.080808 inch), {{insulated}} with {{two coats of}} guttapercha; size of coating. No. 4 American gauge (.2043 inch). The total amount used was 147,703 feet, in lengths from 250 to 625 feet.|$|R
50|$|In certain situations, {{temperature}} rating can {{be higher than}} normal, such as for knob and tube wiring where two or more load-carrying wires are never {{likely to be in}} close proximity. A knob and tube installation uses wires suspended in air. This gives them a greater heat dissipation rating than standard three-wire NM-2 cable, which includes two tightly bundled load and <b>return</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
50|$|Basically a {{rotary switch}} {{construction}} set, the Geniac contained six perforated masonite disks, {{into the back}} of which brass jumpers could be inserted. The jumpers made electrical connections between slotted brass bolt heads sitting out from the similarly perforated masonite back panel. To the bolts were attached wires behind the panel. The circuit comprised a battery, such wires from it to, and between, switch positions, wires from the switches to indicator flashlight bulbs set along the panel's middle, and <b>return</b> <b>wires</b> to the battery to complete the circuit.|$|R

5000|$|The fuses, {{in groups}} of twenty, were {{connected}} in continuous series with connecting-wires. A lead and a <b>return</b> <b>wire</b> were attached to each group.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{consider}} {{the installation of}} a light, controlled by two switches in different locations. In modern practice, the supply and return wires both arrive at the first switch, where the supply is connected {{to one of the}} two switching wires (hot/red); the <b>return</b> <b>wire</b> is carried inside the same multi-conductor cable to the distant second switch. From there, a supply wire carries power to the light, and a <b>return</b> <b>wire</b> goes back to location of the second switch, and then retraces the path back to the fusebox.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of magnetic {{fields in the}} Orbiter Payload Bay resulting from the present grounding configuration (structure return) was presented {{and the amount of}} improvement that would result from installing <b>wire</b> <b>returns</b> for the three dc power buses was determined. Ac and dc magnetic fields at five points in a cross-section of the bay are calculated for both grounding configurations. Y and Z components of the field at each point are derived in terms of a constant coefficient and the current amplitude of each bus. The dc loads assumed are 100 Amperes for each bus. The ac noise current used is a spectrum 6 db higher than the Orbiter equipment limit for narrowband conducted emissions. It was concluded that installing <b>return</b> <b>wiring</b> to provide a single point ground for the dc Buses in the Payload Bay would reduce the ac and dc magnetic field intensity by approximately 30 db...|$|R
50|$|In {{many older}} K&T installations, the supply and <b>return</b> <b>wires</b> were routed {{separately}} from each other, {{rather than being}} located parallel to and near each other. This direct routing method {{has the advantage of}} reduced cost by allowing use of the shortest possible lengths of wire, but the major disadvantage is that a detailed building wiring diagram is needed for other electricians to understand multiple interwoven circuits, especially if the wiring is not fully visible throughout its length. By contrast, modern electrical codes now require that all residential wiring connections be made only inside protective enclosures, such as junction boxes, and that all connections must remain accessible for inspection, troubleshooting, repair, or modification.|$|R
50|$|The Zephyr 1100 had a Z1 restyle in {{its last}} year of sale {{including}} a <b>return</b> to <b>wire</b> wheels. Wire wheels also appeared on the 750. It was replaced in the Kawasaki UK range by the popular Z1100R styled ZRX1100 (later ZRX1200).|$|R

50|$|Figures 4-6 show {{different}} ways to neutralize the circumferential current. Figure 4 is the simplest and has the advantage that the <b>return</b> <b>wire</b> can be added after the inductor is bought or built.|$|E
5000|$|The mines of {{each group}} were {{connected}} in continuous series, and a lead and <b>return</b> <b>wire</b> to the battery closed the circuit. To insure the simultaneous discharge of the whole system, a [...] "circuit-closer" [...] was introduced.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the voltage}} between the DC source {{and the first}} {{resistor}} (67 ohms) is measured, the voltage potential at the first resistor will be slightly less than nine volts. The current passes through the conductor (wire) from the DC source to the first resistor; as this occurs, some of the supplied energy is [...] "lost" [...] (unavailable to the load), due to {{the resistance of the}} conductor. Voltage drop exists in both the supply and <b>return</b> <b>wires</b> of a circuit. If the voltage across each resistor is measured, the measurement will be a significant number. That represents the energy used by the resistor. The larger the resistor, the more energy used by that resistor, and the bigger the voltage drop across that resistor.|$|R

50|$|While pigeons can {{probably}} be safe, other collection techniques may enjoy a resurgence. One specialized technique, originally {{used in the}} First World War but again in the Korean War, was interception using ground <b>return</b> from <b>wired</b> telephones. In mountainous terrain, it might again have applications, such as Afghan caves where wire might be run without the danger of free-spaceinterception.|$|R

50|$|The {{system used}} the rails as {{conductors}} for electricity transmission; one rail carried the direct current, {{and the second}} rail functioned as a <b>return</b> <b>wire.</b> After establishing the necessary connections on the joints between the rails, the transmission of electricity was successfully carried out.|$|E
50|$|SWER is {{a viable}} choice for a {{distribution}} system when conventional <b>return</b> current <b>wiring</b> would cost more than SWER’s isolation transformers and small power losses. Power engineers experienced with both SWER and conventional power lines rate SWER as equally safe, more reliable, less costly, but with slightly lower efficiency than conventional lines. SWER can cause fires when maintenance is poor, and bushfire is a risk.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} twistor {{system used}} permalloy tape {{wrapped around a}} 3 mil copper wire. For any given length of wire, the tape was wound up over only the first half. The copper wire was then bent {{at the point where}} the tape ended, and ran back alongside the portion with the tape, forming a return conductor. This meant all the connections were at one end. Several such twistor lines were laid side-by-side and then laminated into a PET film plastic sheet, with the twistors and their <b>return</b> <b>wires</b> about 1/10th of an inch apart. A typical tape might have five twistor <b>wires</b> and their <b>returns,</b> so the sheet was just over an inch wide. The solenoid was similarly constructed, consisting of a number of 0.15 inch wide copper tapes laminated into a plastic tape of the same basic dimensions as the twistor. Unlike a traditional solenoid with many turns of wire around an open core, this system was essentially nothing more than single wires in a sheet of plastic.|$|R
50|$|On a {{two-wire}} {{system a}} transition on wire 0 signals a '0' bit, and a transition on wire 1 signals a '1' bit. A token is transmitted as {{a sequence of}} exactly 10 transitions, the first eight signal the eight data bits (MSB first) then one bit to signal {{whether this is a}} control token, and then finally a return-to-zero bit that <b>returns</b> the <b>wires</b> to zero (after nine transitions one wire will be high).|$|R

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Nikola Tesla {{demonstrated}} that by using an electrical network tuned to resonance it was possible to transmit electric power using only a single conductor, with no need for a <b>return</b> <b>wire.</b> This was spoken of as the [...] "transmission of electrical energy through one wire without return".|$|E
50|$|In 1891, 1892, and 1893 {{demonstration}} lectures with electrical oscillators {{before the}} AIEE at Columbia College, N.Y.C., the IEE, London, the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, and National Electric Light Association, St. Louis, {{it was shown}} that electric motors and single-terminal incandescent lamps can be operated through a single conductor without a <b>return</b> <b>wire.</b> Although apparently lacking a complete circuit, such a topology effectively obtains a return circuit {{by virtue of the}} load's self-capacitance and parasitic capacitance.|$|E
