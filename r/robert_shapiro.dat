500|$|Warner Bros. {{purchased}} the film rights, intending Harold Becker to direct and <b>Robert</b> <b>Shapiro</b> to produce. Tom Stoppard {{wrote the first}} draft of the screenplay, on which Ballard briefly collaborated. Becker dropped out, and David Lean came to direct with Spielberg as producer. Lean explained, [...] "I worked on it for about a year and in the end I gave it up because I thought it was too similar to a diary. It was well-written and interesting, but I gave it to Steve." [...] Spielberg felt [...] "from the moment I read J. G. Ballard's novel I secretly wanted to direct myself." [...] Spielberg found the project to be very personal. As a child, his favorite film was Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai, which similarly takes place in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Spielberg's fascination with World War II and the aircraft of that era was stimulated by his father's stories of his experience as a radio operator on North American B-25 Mitchell bombers in the China-Burma Theater. Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes to do an uncredited rewrite before Stoppard was brought back to write the shooting script.|$|E

2500|$|Louis J.

2500|$|This {{account of}} history {{has also been}} challenged.

He suggests that the avoidance of the word evolution was enough to satisfy anti-evolutionists, but the books were still largely implicitly evolution based. It has also been suggested that the notion that evolution was removed from textbooks due to religious pressure, only to be reinstated decades later, {{was an example of}} “whig history" [...] propagated by the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, and that the shift in the ways biology textbooks discussed evolution can be attributed to other race and class based factors.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Star Wars (1977), Ben Roberts {{contacted}} Ellison to develop a script based on Isaac Asimov's I, Robot short story collection for Warner Brothers. In a meeting with the Head of Production at Warners, <b>Robert</b> <b>Shapiro,</b> Ellison concluded that Shapiro was commenting on the script without having read it and accused him of having the [...] "intellectual and cranial capacity of an artichoke". Shortly afterwards, Ellison was dropped from the project. Without Ellison, the film came to a dead end, because subsequent scripts were unsatisfactory to potential directors. After a change in studio heads, Warner allowed Ellison's script to be serialized in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine and published in book form. The 2004 film I, Robot, starring Will Smith, has no connection to Ellison's script.|$|E
