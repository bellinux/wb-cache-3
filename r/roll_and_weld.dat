Thus a detailed study is required to evaluate the existing LTB equations for welded wide flange (WWF) shapes. This thesis evaluates the performance of current equations in providing LTB capacities of WWF shape beams. A nonlinear finite element (FE) model is developed to investigate the LTB capacity of WWF shape beams.

Flow forming is a process for manufacturing complex lightweight components which are increasing required in different industries. In free market economies, on the one hand it is necessary to meet the growing demand, on the other hand it is also necessary to reduce time factor to manufacture this type of high quality component. As this process is relatively new, only a few works have been carried out in this field. These works have been focused on steel and the determination of properties after flow forming such as mechanical properties, texturing, residual stress and etc. The studies on flow formability of other alloys are not yet fully started and there is a gap. Till yet, the flow forming has been carried out from a preform which was manufactured using classical machining. In this study, a test to perform the flow forming of a <b>roll</b> bended <b>and</b> laser <b>welded</b> preform is described. The influence of flow forming in geometrical properties is also tested. Since flow forming is a complex and sensitive process, the characteristics of deformation is not an easy task to complete.

The primary structural element for the RV1 chassis will be a large diameter tube that houses the main LOX tank, the nitrogen tanks, the cockpit, the kerosene tank, and the rocket motors. The tube will also provide the attachment points for the forward LOX tanks, the wheels, the braking ballutes, and the body shell.

FE simulations are powerful tools which allow a remarkable saving {{in time and}} money when developing a feasibility study or a prototype phase for a new THF operation. However the successful use of FE simulations depends on several factors such as interface friction or material properties. While in the past flow stress used as input in FE simulations was generally obtained from tensile test conducted on the sheet prior to rolling <b>and</b> <b>welding</b> operations in case of <b>rolled</b> <b>and</b> <b>welded</b> tubes, or tensile test conducted on the whole tube for extruded or seamless tubes, {{in the last years}} tube bulge test has been widely used. In this research test experiments, coupled with suitable analytical model of the process, are used to identify the flowstress of tubes (under biaxial stress state) by measuring geometrical features of the tube under study as the fluid pressure increases. In the present paper a new approach to tube bulge test is described. The innovative aspect is related {{to the fact that the}} tube ends are blocked and so the equilibrium expression in axial direction normally used to calculate stresses is no more valid. The stress state is therefore derived from the flow rule and the volume constancy. The new proposed analytical model was validated by means of FE simulations.

40|$|Used {{nuclear fuel}} dry storage {{canisters}} {{will likely be}} tasked with holding used nuclear fuel for a period longer than originally intended. Originally designed for 20 years, the storage time will likely approach 100 years. These canisters are fabricated from <b>rolled</b> <b>and</b> <b>welded</b> austenitic stainless steel plate. Most of the storage facilities are located on coastal or brackish water sites with environments containing moisture and chloride ions that can cause stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Residual stresses from the welding process provide the tensile stress for crack initiation and propagation which could eventually compromise canister integrity, allowing the release of radioactive material to the environment. If {{it is assumed that}} a tensile stress, predominantly from welding, is constant through the material thickness, this would suggest that failure will be initiation controlled. However, prior studies and practical experience indicate that residual stress varies as a function of depth into a <b>welded</b> material, <b>and</b> that stresses can decrease to zero or even go into compression. This would indicate that at some point, crack propagation could be slowed or even be stopped. In order to predict the time to failure of canister material by stress corrosion cracking, it is therefore necessary to know the actual residual stress distribution through the thickness of canister welds. This thesis investigates dry storage canister designs, canister <b>welds,</b> <b>and</b> contributing factors to residual stress, as well as prior studies of residual stress in welded stainless steel piping and chloride stress corrosion crack propagation rates. From this investigation, an estimate is made for the likely residual stress distribution in a typical canister <b>weld,</b> <b>and</b> the effect of residual stress on canister life prediction is examined. The analysis suggests that residual stress distribution has a tremendous impact on a canister's projected time to failure, and that residual tensile stresses in the heat-affected zone of canister welds could become low enough to result in crack arrest. by Bradley P.

40|$|Although Very High Strength Steels (VHSS) with nominal {{strengths}} up to 1100 MPa {{have been}} available {{on the market for}} many years, the use of these steels in the civil engineering industry is still uncommon. The main objective of the research is the determination of the fatigue strength of welded connections made of VHSS. The research comprised of a literature study, an experimental study and an analysis of the results. An effective application of VHSS is expected in truss-like structures, typically made of hollow sections. Truss structures enable full exploitation of the high material strength of VHSS, because in such stiff structures the deflection is not the governing the design criterion. Improved design of VHSS truss structures should incorporate the application of very high strength cast joints, as an appropriate design of cast joints limits the stress concentrations in the joint. The fatigue strength of cast joints will therefore be relatively high compared to that of regular steel welded joints, as the stress concentration of the connection is limited <b>and</b> <b>welds</b> are shifted out of critical zones. Three types of specimens were fatigue tested in the study: specimens of base material, of <b>welded</b> plates <b>and</b> of trusses made of circular hollow sections (CHS) and cast joints.

40|$|The {{cross-sectional}} {{capacity is}} limited by material yielding {{on one hand and}} local buckling on the other hand. Most current metallic structural design codes use the concept of section classification for determining the section capacity of hot-rolled profiles. In this system, there exists a discontinuity between the classes 2 and 3 under pure bending load condition, while for the class 4, the effective width method (EWM) must be used to account for local buckling phenomenon. With the appearance of the more complex cross-sections, especially for thin-walled steel structures, the calculation using EWM becomes more and more intolerable and complicated. In order to overcome these difficulties when evaluating the cross-section strength, the alternative Direct Strength Method (DSM) approach, developed only for cold-formed thin-walled members, has gained importance over the last few years, and has been adopted by the North American and Australian standards for the design of cold-formed steel structural members recently. This thesis investigates the possibility to extend the DSM method to hot-rolled <b>and</b> <b>welded</b> structural steel members, and the objective is to derive a new formulation that would cover the whole field of section slenderness without section classification system used in Eurocode 3, using the same procedure for the DSM developed for cold-formed thin-walled steel structural members. Hot-rolled <b>and</b> <b>welded</b> H sections are mainly considered in this thesis. The DSM is premised {{on the assumption that the}} strength can be predicted from the yield strength to the elastic critical load ratio used in conjunction with a strength curve; i. e. the same concept than the one used in Eurocode 3, in terms of member buckling phenomenon. In the DSM approach applied for cold-formed thin-walled sections, local buckling and distortional buckling modes should be considered. For common hot-rolled or welded sections, only local buckling needs to be considered since distortional buckling does not occur for these sections. All available test results in literature are collected and evaluated with the current methods for calculating the cross-section resistance such as EWM, DSM, and the recent Continuous Strength Method (CSM). A short comparison is made and their domains of applicability are commented. A consistent approach has been adopted to develop numerical models for hot-rolled <b>and</b> <b>welded</b> sections subjected to compression and bending respectively. The FE model was built in FineLg and verified against test results of the “Semi-comp: Plastic member capacity of semi-compact steel sections - a more economic design” project, which was carried out earlier with the objective of improving the utilization of plasticity in <b>rolled</b> <b>and</b> <b>welded</b> sections with medium cross-section slenderness. Measured material and geometric properties, initial geometrical imperfections and residual stresses distributions have been highlighted. Once verified against the test results, the FE models have been used to carry out a parametrical study aimed at providing more FE results and highlighting the local buckling interaction between the webs and the flanges. All the experimental and FE numerical results constitute data base for the derivation of the new DSM curves. On the basis of Winter Formula for plate buckling and the generic DSM strength curve, different formulas are proposed for hot-rolled <b>and</b> <b>welded</b> H cross-sections under axial and bending load respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{developments}} were oriented on {{the analysis}} of the mechanical performance at local (knit lines <b>and</b> <b>welds)</b> <b>and</b> bulk (molded part) areas, with the influence of molding <b>and</b> <b>welding</b> conditions. It has been found that for non-reinforced and reinforced nylon, the mechanical performance in the knit planes <b>and</b> <b>welded</b> areas are approximately equal to the mechanical performance of a base resin (matrix). The observations on similarities and differences in the formation of knit <b>and</b> <b>weld</b> lines are presented in Part I of this paper. Analysis of mechanical performance at weld at knit lines of various nylons is discussed in Part II...|$|R
