40|$|We {{report a}} {{pediatric}} case of Lyme neuroborreliosis-associated meningomyeloradiculitis with atypical manifestations and negative initial cerebrospinal fluid borrelial antibodies. Transverse myelitis and painful <b>radiculoneuritis</b> have rarely {{been described in}} pediatric neuroborreliosis. Clinical manifestations are wide ranging and nonspecific, and the serologic diagnosis is often delayed in the acute phase. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Neurologic {{involvement}} of Lyme disease typically consists of meningitis, cranial neuropathy, and <b>radiculoneuritis,</b> {{alone or in}} combination, lasting for months. From 1976 to 1983, we studied 38 patients with Lyme meningitis. Headache and mild neck stiffness, which fluctuated in intensity, and lymphocytic pleocytosis were the common findings. Half of the patients also had facial palsies, which were unilateral in 12 and bilateral in seven. In addition, 12 patients had motor and/or sensory radiculoneuropathies; asymmetric weakness of extremities {{was the most common}} finding. Although incomplete presentations of neurologic {{involvement of}} Lyme disease may be confused with other entities, the typical constellation of neurologic symptoms represents a unique clinical picture. Three major types of lesions comprise the neurological manifestations of Lyme disease: meningitis, cranial neuropathy, and <b>radiculoneuritis</b> [1]. These three may occur alone or in combination (Fig. 1). In this report, we describe thirty-eight patients who had meningitis sometimes accompanied by cranial neuropathy and/or peripheral radiculoneuropathy, as reported in depth elsewhere [2]. We believe that this constellation of symptoms is unique among neurological diseases...|$|E
40|$|Brucellosis is {{a common}} {{zoonosis}} in many regions throughout the world. Neurobrucellosis is an uncommon complication of brucellosis and can present as meningitis, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, <b>radiculoneuritis,</b> peripheral neuropathy, intracranial hypertension and cranial nevre palsy. The most common presentation of neurobrucellosis is acute meningitis. This aim of this report was to evaluate a child with neurobrucellosis. We present a 12 -year-old girl with epileptic seizure due to neurobrucellosis. The diagnosis was established by positive serology. Patient was treated medically and complete resolution was achieved. Neurobrucellosis {{should be considered in}} all patients who develop unexplained neurological symptoms, especially in those who live in endemic areas...|$|E
40|$|A 48 -year-old man {{presented}} with urinary retention followed by disturbance of con-sciousness, areflexia, ophthalmoplegia, muscle weakness, and atrophy. Epstein-Barr virus DNA by PCR was positive in his cerebrospinal fluid. The cerebrospinal fluid re-vealed elevated myelin basic protein and an oligoclonal band. Magnetic resonance imag-ing showed high signal intensity in the pons, basal ganglia, and cerebral white matter on T 2 -weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. His conscious-ness, ophthalmoplegia, and muscle weakness almost full recovered. In this patient, the inflammation {{is thought to}} have begun as sacral radiculitis, and then extended to en-cephalitis, and brachial and lumbar <b>radiculoneuritis.</b> Key words: acute disseminated encephalitis; Guillain-Barré syndrome; meningo-encephalo-radiculitis; urinary retention Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a monophasic inflammatory demyelinating disor-der of the central nervous system, typically occur-ring after infection or vaccination.

30|$|A {{recent study}} with {{inoculation}} of Bb {{infection in the}} central nervous system (CNS) of rhesus macaques resulted in lymphocytic neuritis and ganglionitis, and neuronal degeneration and demyelination in the peripheral nervous system. In brainstem and medulla there were lesions with focal malacia and nerve fibre degeneration, and some subjects had myelitis with necrosis and degeneration [16]. The experiment gave evidence that the nerve injuries are mainly due to immune mediated mechanisms. Human studies are limited, but have pointed mainly to axonal damage in LNB mononeuropathy and plexopathy [4, 17]. The myelitis seen in most LNB cases could be the inflammation of <b>radiculoneuritis</b> extending to the spinal cord, CNS parenchymal involvement is otherwise considered rare in LNB [4]. Bb invasion into the human brain has been reported in four cases with biopsy from MRI enhancing lesions [18 – 20].|$|E
40|$|Neurological {{involvement}} in Lyme disease {{has been reported}} to include meningitis, cranial neuropathy and <b>radiculoneuritis.</b> While it is known that in some cases of asceptic meningitis patients may develop hyperosmia, the association between hyperosmia and Lyme disease has not previously been studied. Objective To carry out the first systematic study to ascertain whether hyperosmia is also a feature of Lyme disease. Method A questionnaire regarding abnormal sensory sensitivity in respect of the sense of smell was administered to 16 serologically positive Lyme disease patients and to 18 control subjects. Results The two groups were matched in respect of age, sex and body mass. None of the 34 subjects was suffering from migraine. Eight (50 %) of the Lyme patients and none (0 %) of the controls suffered from hyperosmia (p= 0. 0007). Conclusion This first systematic controlled study showed that Lyme disease is associated with hyperosmia...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{results were}} {{obtained}} {{to illustrate the}} possibility of inducing the <b>radiculoneuritis</b> in experimental polio infections in mice. (1) No remarkable inflammatory changes in the spinal root, ganglia, nerve and the sciatic nerve in the adult mice paralysed by intrathecal infection with poliovirus (Mahoney & Lansing strain), and no histological difference between two strains. (2) The previous repeated administration of poliovirus (Mahoney & Lansing strain) intrathecally in the dosis of PD(50) (10 (- 4), 10 (- 5)) and 10 (- 7) or intraperitoneally in the dosis of 10 (- 1) {{and the challenge of}} same virus in the dosis of 10 (- 2). 10 (- 4 ~- 6) intrathecal route revealed the mice with paralysis and without visible paralysis. In both mice no detectable histological pictures of polyradiculoneuritis in the spinal root, ganglia, nerve and the sciatic nerve were seen. (3) The reproducible data would seem to indicate the discernible points that the polyradiculoneuritis with Guillain-Barre Syndrome is not affiliated in the major part to the primary affection or repeated inoculations of poliovirus of the neuroallergic basis of pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Brucellosis is a multisystem {{disease with}} diverse {{clinical}} presentations and {{involvement of the}} nervous system is considered to 5 to be 10 % in adult patients and 1 % in children. The presentations of neurobrucellosis includes meningoencephalitis, subarachnoid haemorrhage, myelitis, <b>radiculoneuritis,</b> intracerebral and epidural abscess, psychosis and vascular syndrome. Twenty-two patients with neurobrucellosis are described. Ten patients had meningoencephalitis, seven patients had meningitis, three patients had polyradiculopathy and one patient presented with spinal epidural abscess and one patient had brain abscess. Results of an agglutination test for Brucella in serum were positive for all patients (&gt; 1 : 160); eight of 15 patients had positive agglutination test in CSF. Five patients had positive blood cultures, 3 patients had positive bone marrow cultures and 2 of 15 patients had positive CSF cultures. All of cultures were Brucella Mellitensis. Antimicrobial treatment included concurrent administration of Doxycycline, Rifampin and Trimethoprim-Sulfametoxazole. Four patients received Dexamethason concurrently. In conclusion, nervous system involvement is a serious manifestation of brucellosis. As brucellosis is an endemic disease in Iran we suggest that brucellosis be investigated with neurological symptoms and signs...|$|E
40|$|Lyme {{disease was}} listed as an {{underlying}} or multiple cause of death on 114 death records during 1999 – 2003. Upon re-view, only 1 record was consistent with clinical manifes-tations of Lyme disease. This analysis indicates that Lyme disease is rare {{as a cause of}} death in the United States. Lyme disease is a tickborne disease caused by Borrelia burgdor-feri. In the United States, cases most commonly occur among persons aged 5 – 14 years and 45 – 54 years, and during the sum-mer months in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central states [1]. Clinically, early Lyme disease is characterized by fever, fatigue, headache, arthralgias, myalgias, and erythema migrans rash. Untreated, the infection may disseminate to cause various manifestations, including secondary skin lesions, cranial neuropathy, lymphocytic meningitis, <b>radiculoneuritis,</b> atrio-ventricular block, and oligoarthritis [2]. However, Lyme disease rarely has been reported as a cause of death in the United States [3 – 6]. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the international standard for categorizing health and vital records, including death certificates. When the ICD was updated to version 10, which became effective in the United States in 1999, Lyme disease was given a unique code and thus could be captured as a cause of death on death certificates. During 1999...|$|E
40|$|Lyme disease, a tick-borne {{infection}} {{caused by}} the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is a multisystem disease most commonly affecting the skin, joints, nervous system, or heart. Acute neurologic abnormalities occur in 15 to 20 % of the patients and neuropathy, particularly facial paralysis, lymphocytic meningitis and motor and sensory <b>radiculoneuritis</b> {{are the most common}} manifestations. However, facial paralysis is an objective manifestation of acute neuroborreliosis as it occurs during the early disseminated phase of the infection. The incidence of facial paralysis was reported as 4. 5 % but isolated facial paralysis with out other clinical manifestations such as headache, neck pain, stiff neck or throat pain due to borreliosis is extremely rare A previously healthy 46 -year-old male developed bilateral facial nerve paralysis. The neurological examination was normal except the bilateral facial nerve palsy. Serological investigation of CSF and serum revealed positive Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for Ig M and Ig G antibodies to B. burgdorferi antigens. An antibiotic regimen consisting of ceftriaxone 2 g/day for six weeks was initiated. The patient was fully recovered at the end of first month with full regression of serological and CSF laboratory findings. In this current case, we report a patient with sole bilateral facial nerve paralysis due to Lyme disease. </p...|$|E
30|$|The {{clinical}} presentation of LNB can vary widely, {{partly due to}} the genetic differences in spirochetal strains. Individual variations in immunological response and the possibility of co-infections may also explain the wide spectrum of symptoms that can be encountered. The skin is primarily affected, and erythema migrans can be observed. About one third to half of patients with LNB recall a tick bite or a rash [7, 8]. The most common neurological manifestation of LNB in adults is the Bannwarth syndrome with painful <b>radiculoneuritis</b> and aseptic meningitis, the former is most prominent in Europe and the latter in North America [1]. LNB with facial nerve palsy is commonly encountered in both continents. Rarer manifestations from the nervous system are meningoencephalitis, encephalomyelitis, cerebral vasculitis and peripheral neuropathy [6]. LNB may rarely present to the ophthalmologist with optic neuropathies and papilledema due to raised intracranial pressure [9]. The distinction between early and late LNB is made from duration of neurological symptoms of less or more than 6  months, and more than 95 % of cases are classified as early disease [10]. Most LNB patients respond well to antibiotic treatment, but some experience persistent complaints [11, 12]. A definition for post-Lyme disease syndrome has been suggested to include subjective symptoms of fatigue, cognitive symptoms and/or widespread musculoskeletal pain starting within 6  months after completed treatment [13]. Post-Lyme disease syndrome is not discussed in this article.|$|E
40|$|Neuroborreliosis (Lyme disease) {{is often}} called “The new great imitator. ” In the {{following}} we will present the different clinical aspects of neuroborreliosis, which can present itself {{with a wide range}} of symptoms and findings, often making it difficult to reach the correct diagnosis. We have tried to describe the variety of clinical manifestations presented in different cases, cases which have been reported in published articles. It is important to keep in mind neuroborreliosis as a differential diagnosis in clinical cases with unknown ethiology. Most often neuroborreliosis presents with meningitis, followed by meningoradiculitis. Frequently Bell`s palsy is seen, more seldom are paresis of the oculomotor nerve, trigeminal nerve, abduscens nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve. Peripheral <b>radiculoneuritis</b> with pain, paresthesia and a variety of paresis is also common. Encephalitis and myelitis is often seen at a later stage. Rarer clinical manifestations include: polyneuropathy, paresis of the phrenic nerve, ischias, acute abdominal pain, hydrocephalus, mental deficiency, sudden hearing loss and musical hallucinations, benign intracranial hypertension and internuclear ophthalmoplegia, cerebral ischemia, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and intracerebral hemorrhage. The diagnostic process include an examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with characteristic findings. Examination of antibodies in CSF and serum enables differentiation between active and earlier infection. ELISA is the most reliable method. We will in this text focus on the great variety of the clinical manifestations of neuroborreliosis. It is important for doctors to be aware of this disease, so that they can make the diagnosis at an early stage, in which antibiotic treatment is curative. Failing to make the diagnosis and implementing correct treatment, may lead to serious complications and remnant symptoms for the patients...|$|E
40|$|The serum of {{patients}} with Lyme neurologic disease contain antibodies that bind to human axonal antigens that cross-react with Borrelia burgdorferi. The sera also bind to SK-N-SH neuro-blastoma cells, especially the neuritic processes of these cells. H 9724, a murine IgG monoclonal antibody to B. burgdorferi flagellin, binds to an SK-N-SH cell protein of ""-' 64, 000 apparent molecular weight (Mr). H 9724 immunoprecipitates a protein of the same M, (p 64) from the cells and from a delipidated preparation of human peripheral nerve. The Lyme disease patient sera that bind to human axons and SK-N-SH cells also bind to the immunoprecipitated p 64. Immuno-logic cross-reactivity between borrelial and human axonal proteins {{may be involved in}} the im-munopathogenesis of Lyme neurologic disease. Lyme disease is a multisystem inflammatory disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Lyme disease often starts with erythema migrans, a distinct skin rash; weeks to months after the onset, neurologic complications may occur, including meningoencephalitis, <b>radiculoneuritis,</b> and cranial neuropa-thy [I]. Antibiotics usually cure early manifestations of Lyme disease but may not be as effective in later disease [I]. It is not clear that the live organism is present at the site of late inflammation or that persistence ofthe organism is neces-sary for ongoing disease [2]. Previously, sera {{of patients}} with neurologic manifestations of Lyme disease were shown to contain antibodies that bound to cross-reacting axonal and B. burgdorferi antigens. The sera {{of patients with}} other, non-Lyme disease-related neurologic diseases also bound to axon but not to the cross-reacting epitope recognized by the Lyme disease sera.
