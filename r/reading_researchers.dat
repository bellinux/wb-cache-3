This paper performs the first detailed quantitative comparison of several implementations of sequential consistency and release consistency optimized for aggressive ILP processors.

30|$|Over {{the past}} decade, a {{convergence}} {{of state and federal}} policies has emphasized and institutionalized the teaching of reading and reading skills and subskills (e.g., phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary; Pacheco 2010). Whereas some <b>reading</b> <b>researchers</b> argue that these skills and subskills are essential aspects of the reading processes (National Institute of Child and Health and Human Development [NICHD] 2000), others have strong concerns about teaching narrow skills-based reading approaches to ELLs (Olson 2007).

The authors review various conceptions of schema theory to consider how recent social and cultural perspectives might prompt reconsideration of schemas as transactional and embodied constructs.

40|$|Theorists have {{predicted}} that repetition blindness (RB) should be absent for nonwords {{because they do not}} activate preexisting mental types. The authors hypothesized that RB would be observed for nonwords because RB can occur at a sublexical level.

More RB was found for words than for nonwords. Prior researchers may have failed to find RB for nonwords because display conditions that allow 2 words to be reliably encoded are insufficient for nonwords, or because observers coped with low ability to encode nonwords by using guessing strategies that do not require creating a mental type or tokenizing it.
