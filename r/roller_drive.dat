50|$|The Mini-Cassette, often written minicassette, is a {{magnetic}} tape audio cassette format introduced by Philips in 1967. It is used primarily in dictation machines {{and was also}} employed as a data storage for the Philips P2000 home computer. Unlike the Compact Cassette, also designed by Philips, and the later Microcassette, introduced by Olympus, the Mini-Cassette does not use a capstan drive system; instead, the tape is propelled past the tape head by the reels. This is mechanically simple and allows the cassette to be made smaller and easier to use, but produces a system unsuited to any task other than voice recording, as the tape speed is not constant (averaging 2.4 cm/s) and prone to wow and flutter. However, {{the lack of a}} capstan and a pinch <b>roller</b> <b>drive</b> means that the tape is well-suited to being repeatedly shuttled forward and backward short distances as compared to microcassettes, leading to the Mini-Cassette's use in the first generations of telephone answering machines, and continuing use in the niche markets of dictation and transcription, where fidelity is not critical, but robustness of storage is, and where analog media are still widely preferred.|$|E

40|$|Two {{differential}} (dual input, single output) drives (a roller-gear and a pure roller), and {{a momentum}} balanced (single input, dual output) drive (pure roller) were designed, fabricated, and tested. The differential drives are each rated at 295 rad/sec (2800 rpm) input speed, 450 N-m (4, 000 in-lbf) output torque. The momentum balanced drive is rated at 302 rad/sec (2880 rpm) input speed, and dual output torques of 434 N-m (3840 in-lbf). The Dual Input Differential Roller-Gear Drive (DC- 700) has a planetary roller-gear {{system with a}} reduction ratio (one input driving the output with the second input fixed) of 29. 23 : 1. The Dual Input Differential <b>Roller</b> <b>Drive</b> (DC- 500) has a planetary roller system with a reduction ratio of approximately 24 : 1. Each of the differential drives features dual roller-gear or roller arrangements consisting of a sun, four first row planets, four second row planets, and a ring. The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive (DC- 400) has a planetary roller system with a reduction ratio of 24 : 1 with both outputs counterrotating at equal speed. Its single roller cluster consists of a sun, five first and five second row planets, a roller cage or spider and a ring. Outputs are taken from both the roller cage and the ring which counterrotate. Test results reported for all three drives include angular and torque ripple (linearity and cogging), viscous and Coulomb friction, and forward and reverse power efficiency. Of the two differential drives, the Differential <b>Roller</b> <b>Drive</b> had better linearity and less cogging than did the Differential Roller-Gear Drive, but it had higher friction and lower efficiency (particularly at low power throughput levels). Use of full preloading rather than a variable preload system in the Differential <b>Roller</b> <b>Drive</b> assessed a heavy penalty in part load efficiency. Maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 % for the Differential Roller-Gear Drive and 86 % for the Differential <b>Roller</b> <b>Drive.</b> The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive performed as expected kinematically. Reduction r-atios to the two counterrotating outputs (design nominal= 24 : 1) were measured to be 23. 98 : 1 and 24. 12 : 1 at zero load [...] At 25 ONm (2200 in-lbf) output torque the ratio changed 2 % due to roller creep. This drive was the smoothest of all three as determined from linearity and cogging tests, and maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 %. The disadvantages of full preloading as comvared to variable preload were apparent in this drive as in the Differential <b>Roller</b> <b>Drive.</b> Efficiencies at part load were low, but improved dramatically with increases in torque. These were consistent with friction measurements which indicated losses primarily from Coulomb friction. The initial preload level setting was low so roller slip was encountered at higher torques during testing...|$|E

40|$|Electrically <b>driven</b> <b>rollers</b> {{are used}} {{in many areas of}} industry, for {{applications}} ranging from the transportation of heavy objects to high accuracy printing.

Urenco (Capenhurst) Ltd has developed highly advanced carbon fibre composite technology. This technology has been advanced by imparting magnetic properties to the composite, to facilitate the realisation of self-powered rollers, having mechanical properties superior to those of steel rollers, but for only a fraction of the mass.

40|$|The most {{critical}} mechanism {{on board the}} proposed space station is the continously rotating joint which must accurately align the solar power units with the sun during earth orbit. The feasibility of a multiple, discrete bearing supported joint driven by a self-loading, pinch drive actuator was investigated for this application. This concept appears to offer greater protection against catastrophic jamming, less sensitivity to adverse thermal gradients, greater accessibility to inorbit servicing or replacement and greater adaptability to very large (5 m) truss members than to more conventional continuous support bearing/gear reducer joints. Analytical trade studies performed herein establish that a discrete cam roller bearing support system having eight hangers around a continuous ring would provide sufficient radial and bending stiffness to prevent any degradation in the fundamental frequencies of the solar wing structure. Furthermore, {{it appears that the}} pinch <b>roller</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism can be readily sized to meet or exceed system performance and service life requirements.
