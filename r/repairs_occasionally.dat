60|$|When the Nez Perces, Flatheads, and Pends Oreilles are encamped in a {{dangerous}} neighborhood, says Captain Bonneville, the greatest care is taken of their horses, those prime articles of Indian wealth, and objects of Indian depredation. Each warrior has his horse tied by one foot at night to a stake planted before his lodge. Here they remain until broad daylight; {{by that time the}} young men of the camp are already ranging over the surrounding hills. Each family then drives its horses to some eligible spot, where they are left to graze unattended. A young Indian <b>repairs</b> <b>occasionally</b> to the pasture to give them water, and to see that all is well. So accustomed are the horses to this management, that they keep together in the pasture where they have been left. As the sun sinks behind the hills, they may be seen moving from all points toward the camp, where they surrender themselves to be tied up for the night. Even in situations of danger, the Indians rarely set guards over their camp at night, intrusting that office entirely to their vigilant and well-trained dogs.|$|E

60|$|Captain Bonneville {{now made}} his {{arrangements}} for the autumn and the winter. The nature of the country through which {{he was about to}} travel rendered it impossible to proceed with wagons. He had more goods and supplies of various kinds, also, than were required for present purposes, or than could be conveniently transported on horseback; aided, therefore, by a few confidential men, he made caches, or secret pits, during the night, when {{all the rest of the}} camp were asleep, and in these deposited the superfluous effects, together with the wagons. All traces of the caches were then carefully obliterated. This is a common expedient with the traders and trappers of the mountains. Having no established posts and magazines, they make these caches or deposits at certain points, whither they <b>repair,</b> <b>occasionally,</b> for supplies. It is an expedient derived from the wandering tribes of Indians.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{complementary}} base pairing, {{integral to the}} double-helical structure of DNA, provides an effective and elegant mechanism for the faithful transmission of genetic information. Implicit in this model, however, {{is the potential for}} incorporating non-complementary base pairs (mismatches) during replication or subsequently, for example, during genetic recombination. As such errors are usually damaging to the organism, they are generally detected and <b>repaired.</b> <b>Occasionally,</b> however, the propagation of erroneous copies of the genome confers a selective advantage, leading to genetic variation and evolutionary change. An {{understanding of the nature of}} base-pair mismatches at a molecular level, and the effect of incorporation of such errors on the secondary structure of DNA is thus of fundamental importance. We now report the first single-crystal X-ray analysis of a DNA fragment, d(GGGGCTCC), which contains two non-complementary G X T base pairs, and discuss the implications of the results for the in vivo recognition of base-pair mismatches...|$|R

40|$|Xylem sap under {{high tension}} is in a {{metastable}} state {{and tends to}} cavitate, frequently leading to an interruption of the continuous water columns. Mechanisms of cavitation repair are controversially discussed. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides a noninvasive, high spatial and temporal resolution approach to monitor xylem cavitation, refilling, and functionality. Spin density maps of drought-stressed maize taproots were recorded to localize cavitation events and to visualize the refilling processes; c. 2 h after release of the nutrient solution from the homemade MR imaging cuvette that received the root, late metaxylem vessels started to cavitate randomly as identified by a loss of signal intensity. After c. 6 h plants were rewatered, leading to a repair of water columns in five out of eight roots. Sap ascent during refilling, monitored with multislice MR imaging sequences, varied between 0. 5 mm min(- 1) and 3. 3 mm min(- 1). Flow imaging of apparently refilled vessels was performed to test for functional <b>repair.</b> <b>Occasionally,</b> a collapse of xylem vessels under tension was observed; this collapse was reversible upon rewatering. Refilling was an all-or-none process only observed under low-light conditions. Absence of flow {{in some of the}} apparently refilled vessels indicates that functionality was not restored in these particular vessels, despite a recovery of the spin density signal...|$|R

It was only twelve miles from London, and admitted therefore of frequent intercourse with the metropolis. It was also near enough to the Roothing country for hunting purposes. No doubt the Shoreditch Station, by which it had to be reached, had its drawbacks. My average distance also to the Essex meets was twenty miles.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} have strongly {{suggested that the}} process of Somatic mutation is linked to transcription initiation. It was postulated that a mutator factor ~ loads onto the lLNA polymerase and, during elongation, causes transcriptional arrest that activates DNA <b>repair,</b> thus <b>occasionally</b> causing errors in the DNA sequence. We report the analysis of the role of one of the known DNA repair systems, nucleotide excision repair (NELL), in somatic mutation. Epstein-Barrvirus-transformed B cells from patients with defects in NELL (XP-B, XP-D, XP-V, and CS-A) were studied. Their heavy and light chain genes show a high frequency of point mutations in the variable (V), but not in the constant (C) regions. This suggests that these B cells can undergo somatic hypermutation despite significant defects in NEk.

40|$|Nearly {{one third}} of all conchs of Anthoceras buchi (Lesnikowa, 1949) from Baltoscandia display healed apertural breakages. Often {{multiple}} of these repair scars {{can be found in}} single conchs. Most of the scars are less than 2 mm deep, but deeper slit-like <b>repaired</b> breakages <b>occasionally</b> occur. Small injuries are usually around the entire apertural circumference, but the larger scars are concentrated at the ventral side of the conch, which is interpreted as result of a protection from a hood. The adult diameter of Anthoceras buchi is > 40 mm. Conch regions that exceed 30 mm in diameter rarely contain evidence of multiple repair scars. The relative frequency of deep healed breakages is highest at regions with diameters of 25 – 30 mm. This pattern is interpreted as evidence for a size limitation of the predator: large specimens with conch diameters above 30 mm had a considerably lower risk to get injured and the preserved injuries were less severe. This potentially explains the strong evolutionary trend of size increase in endocerids during the Lower to Middle Ordovician as escalation between them and shell breaking predators. Additionally, a specimen of Anthoceras buchi is described and figured, which displays colour marks with a mottled pattern. doi: 10. 1002 /mmng. 201100001 </a...|$|R
40|$|Homologous {{recombination}} (crossing {{over and}} gene conversion) is generally essential for heritage and DNA <b>repair,</b> and <b>occasionally</b> causes DNA aberrations, in nuclei of eukaryotes. However, {{little is known}} about the roles of homologous recombination in the inheritance and stability of mitochondrial DNA which is continuously damaged by reactive oxygen species, by-products of respiration. Here, we report the first example of a nuclear recessive mutation which suggests an essential role for homologous recombination in the stable inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. For the detection of this class of mutants, we devised a novel procedure, 'mitochondrial crossing in haploid', which has enabled us to examine many mutant clones. Using this procedure, we examined mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that showed an elevated UV induction of respiration-deficient mutations. We obtained a mutant that was defective in both the omega-intron homing and Endo. SceI-induced homologous gene conversion. We found that the mutant cells are temperature sensitive in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA. A tetrad analysis indicated that elevated UV induction of respiration-deficient mutations, recombination deficiency and temperature sensitivity are all caused by a single nuclear mutation (mhr 1) on chromosome XII. The pleiotropic characteristics of the mutant suggest an essential role for the MHR 1 gene in DNA repair, recombination and the maintenance of DNA in mitochondria...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Laparoscopic {{intraperitoneal}} onlay mesh (IPOM) <b>repair</b> is <b>occasionally</b> {{used for}} inguinal hernia repair. Here, we report {{a case of}} chronic neuropathic pain after laparoscopic IPOM repair for inguinal hernia, which was treated successfully with laparoscopic selective neurectomy. Presentation of case: A 59 -year-old man with bilateral inguinal hernia underwent laparoscopic repair. Transabdominal preperitoneal repair {{was performed on the}} left side, whereas IPOM repair was performed on the right side due to a peritoneal defect. At postoperative month 1, he presented with severe pain and numbness distributed from the right inguinal region to the inner thigh region. The symptoms had persisted for 1  year despite medical treatment. We diagnosed that the symptoms might be due to the entrapment of nerves in the contracted mesh, and performed a second surgery via laparoscopic approach 13 months after the first surgery. On laparoscopic exploration, the lateral side of the mesh was contracted and involved nerve branches. We ligated and cut off these nerve branches. His symptoms resolved immediately after the surgery. At postoperative month 12, he has passed without any pain, numbness, and hernia recurrence. Discussion: Laparoscopic exploration would be useful to figure out chronic neuropathic pain after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Conclusion: Laparoscopic IPOM repair for inguinal hernia should be avoided as much as possible because it may cause chronic neuropathic pain. Laparoscopic selective neurectomy is an option for patients with chronic neuropathic pain after laparoscopic hernia repair...|$|R
40|$|Double-stranded DNA breaks {{occur on}} a regular basis in the human genome as a {{consequence}} of genotoxic stress and errors during replication. Usually these breaks are rapidly and faithfully <b>repaired,</b> but <b>occasionally</b> different chromosomes, or different regions of the same chromosome, are fused to each other. Some of these aberrant chromosomal translocations yield functional recombinant genes, which have been implicated as the cause of a number of lymphomas, leukemias, sarcomas, and solid tumors. Reliable methods are needed for the in situ detection of the transcripts encoded by these recombinant genes. We have developed just such a method, utilizing single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (sm-FISH), in which approximately 50 short fluorescent probes bind to adjacent sites on the same mRNA molecule, rendering each target mRNA molecule visible as a diffraction-limited spot in a fluorescence microscope. Utilizing this method, gene fusion transcripts are detected with two differently colored probe sets, each specific for one of the two recombinant segments of a target mRNA; enabling the fusion transcripts to be seen in the microscope as distinct spots that fluoresce in both colors. We demonstrate this method by detecting the BCR-ABL fusion transcripts that occur in chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and by detecting the EWSR 1 -FLI 1 fusion transcripts that occur in Ewing’s sarcoma cells. This technology should pave the way for accurate in situ typing of many cancers that are associated with, or caused by, fusion transcripts...|$|R
