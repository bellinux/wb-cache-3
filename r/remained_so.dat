5|$|Settlement in {{the region}} of Gaza dates back to 3300–3000 BCE at Tell as-Sakan, a site located south of the present-day city, which began as an Ancient Egyptian {{fortress}} built in Canaanite territory. Tell as-Sakan prospered as Canaanite cities began to trade agricultural goods with the Egyptians. However, when Egypt's economic interests shifted to the cedar trade with Lebanon, Gaza's role was reduced to that of a port for ships carrying goods and it declined economically. The site was virtually abandoned and <b>remained</b> <b>so</b> throughout the Early Bronze Age II.|$|E

5|$|Andover's {{traditional}} {{strip of}} red and black stripes was worn {{for the vast majority}} of their history. This was changed to red and black quarters in 1950 and <b>remained</b> <b>so</b> until 1957 when the club reverted to the traditional stripes. When promotion to the Southern League was gained in 1972, the team's colours were changed, this time to red with a single white stripe. This kit was worn until 1988, when the familiar red and black stripes were re-introduced. For the 2008–09 season, a plain red kit was introduced to commemorate the club's 125th anniversary—this was worn for the first time in the pre-season friendly against Salisbury City. The last away kit worn by the team was yellow and black shirts with white shorts. However, various combinations have been worn in recent years, such as white shirts with blue sleeves and blue shorts, and tangerine shirts with white shorts.|$|E

However, Manning was not able to generate any offense and was pulled from the game. During the season's fourth game, against Mississippi State, starter Todd Helton got injured and Manning took over.

5|$|By 1911, Winnipeg was {{the third}} largest city in Canada, and <b>remained</b> <b>so</b> until {{overtaken}} by Vancouver in the 1920s. A boomtown, it grew quickly around {{the start of the}} 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth {{in the second half of}} the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.|$|E
