50|$|While {{the blade}} sizes are {{interchangeable}} with table saws, a miter blade is optimized for short cuts {{across the grain}} of the wood with little pull, where as table saws are optimized for long <b>rip</b> <b>cuts</b> with the grain and pulling the material into the blade.|$|E
50|$|In 1971 and 1972, Barr, {{along with}} partner Sandy Mullin designed, patented, {{and built the}} first {{computerized}} equipment to optimize the usage of lumber in the furniture industry. The device read marked flaws on a board, calculated the cross and <b>rip</b> <b>cuts</b> required for optimal board usage, and marked the cut lines on the board.|$|E
25|$|In solid timber, docking {{of members}} for a butt joint {{is usually a}} {{crosscut}}, so a crosscut saw is best for this job. When working with sheetgoods, there is no distinction between crosscut and <b>rip</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{boards are}} {{cut from a}} log they are usually <b>rip</b> <b>cut</b> along the length (axis) of the log. This {{can be done in}} three ways: plain-sawing (most common, also known as flat-sawn, bastard-sawn, through and through, and tangent-sawn), quarter-sawing (less common), or rift sawing (rare).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to making length cuts, a {{radial arm saw}} may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. In addition some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence, allowing a <b>rip</b> <b>cut</b> to be performed.|$|R
50|$|Rip cut {{comes from}} rip: to split or saw timber in the {{direction}} of the grain, and cut: to divide with a sharp-edged instrument.Wood may also be split along the grain (riven), but the split will follow the grain and usually not be flat. Knots also prevent riving thus the need for <b>rip</b> <b>cuts.</b> A kerf is the opening in the wood made by the saw.|$|E
50|$|Small mills use {{a single}} {{chainsaw}} {{and can be}} handled by a single operator. Larger mills use two chainsaw power heads, one {{on either side of}} the attachment and these require two operators. This larger style of mill requires a special bar which allows the two chainsaw heads to be attached at either end. The width of the plank that can be cut is determined by the length of the bar, up to 34 in so for logs having a large diameter, the longer bar is necessary. Also a special chain is designed to make <b>rip</b> <b>cuts</b> rather than the usual chainsaw chain which is for cross-cutting.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, the {{compound}} miter saw began to replace the radial arm saw, but only for crosscuts and miter cuts since miter saws are unable to perform <b>rip</b> <b>cuts.</b> The radial arm saw can be less safe when used by an inexperienced or untrained operator, but is not as dangerous when used properly. In {{the hands of an}} experienced operator, the radial arm saw can safely cut compound miters necessary for picture and door frames, rip lumber precisely to width, cut tongues and grooves, and make variable dadoes. Like the {{compound miter saw}}, the radial arm saw can make these cuts with absolute precision, but is capable of making a wider variety of cuts, including more complex ones.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} very {{specialised}} chain types have emerged over recent years. These include chains made of steel alloys optimised for cutting in extremely cold conditions, chains with tungsten carbide teeth for very dirty conditions and rescue work, ripping chains with altered blade geometry for making <b>ripping</b> <b>cuts,</b> and milling chains for chainsaw mills.|$|R

25|$|A {{radial arm}} saw has a {{circular}} saw mounted on a sliding horizontal arm. In addition to making length cuts a {{radial arm saw}} may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. Some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence allowing a <b>rip</b> <b>cut</b> to be performed. In 1922, Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey invented the radial arm saw. A patent was applied for in 1923 and awarded to De Walt in 1925.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rip</b> <b>cuts</b> are {{commonly}} {{made with a}} table saw, but other types of power saws can also be used, including a radial arm saw, band saw, and hand held circular saw. In sawmills the head saw is the first rip-saw a log goes through, which is sometimes a gang-saw, and then the cants may be resawn using other saws and then edged in a edger and sometimes cut to length by a crosscut saw. Also, smaller portable sawmills and chainsaw mills use rip-cuts to produce lumber. Each time {{a piece of wood}} is rip cut it takes time and the kerf material turns into sawdust and loses value so the number and width of each rip cut influence the economics of the operation: This gives band saws an advantage over circular saws and chainsaws.|$|E
2500|$|... : Table saws {{commonly}} have a fence (guide) {{running from}} the front of the table (the side nearest the operator) to the back, parallel to the cutting plane of the blade. The distance of the fence from the blade can be adjusted, which determines where on the workpiece the cut is made. The fence is commonly called a [...] "rip fence" [...] referring to its use in guiding the workpiece during the process of making a <b>rip</b> <b>cut.</b> Most table saws come standard with a rip fence, but some high end saws are available without a fence so a fence of the user's choice can be purchased separately.|$|R
50|$|In woodworking, a rip-cut is {{to sever}} or divide {{a piece of}} wood {{parallel}} to the grain. The other typical type of cut is a cross-cut, a cut perpendicular to the grain. Unlike cross-cutting, which shears the wood fibers, a rip saw works more like a series of chisels, lifting off small splinters of wood. The nature of the wood grain requires the shape of the saw teeth to be different thus the need for both rip saws and crosscut saws; however some circular saw blades are combination blades and can make both types of <b>cuts.</b> A <b>rip</b> <b>cut</b> is the fundamental type of cut made at a sawmill.|$|R

5000|$|A {{table saw}} is {{typically}} used for cross-cutting and ripping; cross-cutting slices a board across its grain width-wise, <b>ripping</b> <b>cuts</b> lengthwise along the grain. Various conditions experienced while cutting either way {{can cause a}} partially cut board to move, twist, or have the saw blade's [...] close up and bind the blade. Poor blade or fence alignment, operator error, or pre-existing stresses in the wood released by cutting may cause these different and dangerous conditions. A riving knife rides within the kerf, pivoting on the saw's arbor in relation to blade height, to maintain an even {{gap between the two}} cut sides of the board, preventing jamming which could cause the stock to be forcefully ejected rearward toward the saw's operator.|$|R
50|$|A {{collection}} of 775 portraits were {{donated to the}} Victoria and Albert Museum, London in 1939 by Hawarden's granddaughter, Clementina Tottenham. The photographs were <b>ripped,</b> or <b>cut,</b> from family albums {{for reasons that are}} still unclear. This accounts for the torn or trimmed corners now considered a hallmark of Hawarden's work.|$|R
5000|$|Cordwood saws, {{also called}} buzz saws in some locales, use blade {{of a similar}} size to sawmills. Where a sawmill <b>rips</b> (<b>cuts</b> with the grain) a {{cordwood}} saw crosscuts (cuts across the grain). Cordwood saws can have a blade from 20 in to more than 36 in diameter depending on the power source and intended purpose. Cordwood saws are used to cut logs and slabs (sawmill waste) into firewood. The Cord (unit) is the standard measurement of standing timber (by estimation) or rough logs. [...] "Cordwood" [...] means unsplit logs four feet long. In the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries, farmers would supply householders in town with cordwood, which would then be re-sawn and split to a length and circumference suitable for woodburning heaters and ranges. Almost all these devices were designed to accept 16-inch sticks, conveniently a piece of cordwood cut into three equal lengths. Once a piece of cordwood had been re-sawn to three 16-inch pieces, it could easily be split to stovewood size with an ax.|$|R

The first legging, {{referred to as the}} legging proper or stocking, consisted of woven fabric or leather. The second was simply a leather of fabric used to tie on the leggings or, if worn around the shin or foot, provided warmth and protection. The lower caste wore leggings made of <b>ripped</b> or <b>cut</b> cloth from old clothes, blankets, or bags whereas the upper caste had custom made leggings. The very rich people sometimes wore jewels.|$|R
50|$|This {{interest}} in the discussion about destruction in society is crucial to understanding the anger and violence implied {{by some of the}} artist's works. Destroying functional objects such as beds, sofas, and chairs or appropriating objects that refer to the human body, such as shoes, was the way in which Ortiz expressed the fragility of human life and his frustration with its senseless destruction. He burned, <b>cut,</b> <b>ripped,</b> gouged, and generally wreaked havoc on domestic objects to bring attention to humanity’s vulnerability. He continued to use destruction in his works and performances until around 1970.|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} portion of the hardwood lumber industry is devoted to the processing of lumber into secondary wood products (like furniture parts). Hardwood boards are typically remanufactured into smaller parts by a series of <b>rip</b> and cross <b>cuts</b> with no consideration of parts placement or the location of defective areas. These cuts yield pieces, in accordance with the manufacturers cutting bill, that are free of defective area. The entire process is labor intensive and results in a substantial loss of valuable lumber. With traditional gang/rip methods yields of 50 % are considered to be very good. These losses increase with operator fatigue and inexperience...|$|R
50|$|The main {{beach is}} 5.5 km long, running from Round Hill {{in the north}} down to Agnes Water. The beach is {{relatively}} straight and faces east-north-east. Most of the beach is backed by a low dune and natural vegetation. At the southern Agnes Water end there is an extensive foreshore reserve, including a camping reserve. The beach usually receives waves averaging about one metre, which combine with the medium sand to build a moderately steep high tide beach, with a continuous bar exposed at low tide. During and following higher swell, up to 30 <b>rip</b> channels are <b>cut</b> across the lower section of the bar and an outer bar forms along the central and northern sections of the beach. The rip channels will persist for some weeks during lower wave conditions. As well as the surf beach, Agnes Water is intersected by rocky headlands and has a stream behind the coastline. A relatively safe beach in the southern patrolled area.|$|R
40|$|The classic {{model of}} water and {{sediment}} flux in barred surf zones is a net flux landward across a nearshore bar, alongshore in a feeder channel, and offshore in narrow jet-like flows in a <b>rip</b> neck <b>cut</b> through the bar; this circulation is frequently modulated by the tide, even under micro-tidal conditions. Water levels, waves, currents and suspended sediment transport (SST) were recorded at elevations of z = 0. 13, 0. 26 and 0. 39 m in a rip neck on an intermediate bar-rip beach at a micro-tidal site, Bennett 2 ̆ 7 s Beach, NSW, Australia. Measurements revealed SST was driven by quasi-steady rip currents and by gravity and infragravity waves. The balance between these components determined the magnitude {{and direction of the}} overall net SST. Tentative conclusions are that: (i) the direction of the overall net SST rate in the rip neck was dominated, as expected, by offshore-directed mean cross-shore currents, especially around high tide; at this time the SST rates due to gravity and infragravity waves were relatively small and somewhat variable in direction. (ii) as the tide fell, relatively large SST rates were directed onshore by shoaling gravity waves propagating through the neck, which opposed and even exceeded the rip current transport. At mid-tide, the transport by infragravity waves complemented the gravity waves such that the overall net flux of suspended sediment was directed onshore into the rip cell at the two lowest elevations. (iii) whenever the SST by the rip current and by shoaling waves was close to a balance, it was the infragravity waves that controlled the rate and direction of the overall net suspended sediment flux...|$|R

5000|$|The Girl on the Train has its genesis on a {{real life}} case that made {{headlines}} in France.

50|$|Sometimes {{cultures}} developed {{two main}} types of saw teeth: the 'cross cut' saw teeth and the 'rip' saw teeth. These {{cut into the}} wood using different mechanisms. Wood is composed of many long cells running length-ways. Thus, crosscut saws have sawteeth that are usually shaped, often with a metal file, {{in such a way}} that they form a series of tiny knifelike edges.The wood cells are contacted by the knife-edge of the tooth and <b>cut.</b> <b>Rip</b> saws, on the other hand, are usually shaped so that they form a series of tiny chisel-like edges. The wood cells are contacted by the chisel and 'ripped' apart from the bundle of other cells. It is common that people do not recognize the difference and use saws both ways. However, a rip saw is much faster than a cross-cut saw when cutting with the grain but leaves a very rough cut, often with splinters on the surface, and has more difficulty maintaining a straight cut when cutting across the grain. The cross-cut saw can cut in any direction but is much slower than needs be when cutting with the grain.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 14) Clay {{lends itself}} to my concerns. The imagery is sensual, tactile and sumptuous. When it is soft and pliable, then rolled into a slab, the clay's coolness and texture reminds one of skin, perhaps because it is easily <b>ripped,</b> torn, or <b>cut</b> into. Beating the slab with brush bristles to pit the surface enhances this feeling of skin. However, {{there is a constant}} dichotomy in the work. Because it is fired and becomes stoneware, only the appearance of a soft sponge-like quality remains. The clay now has a hard, pumicy texture. The old argument whether art is the process or product is so evident when working in ceramics. Working with a combination of stoneware and porcelain, I tire from constantly washing my hands so as not to contaminate one with the other. In one way, keeping the purity of the white porcelain separate from the other colored clay represents the struggle between the metaphysical and the physical. In another way, binding them together represents the whole being. Because the porcelain's molecular structure causes it to shrink more and faster than the other clay, this binding becomes a reality to deal with. To compensate for the shrinkage, I build the porcelain substructure first so it dries faster and, therefore, gets much of the shrinkage done sooner. By using porcelain slip, scoring the joints and wedging clay into the seams, there can be a certain amount of play between the two clay bodies. Looking at it now could symbolize the compromise between flesh and spirit. The forms are often pyramided, reaching upward while others have fallen exposing their insides, just as a soul reaches for God and yet falls short. "Shell" (Illustration # 1) is an expression of hope. It has fallen, yet inside there is a struggle for growth. Small crystalline-like shards of porcelain seem to grow even in the shadowy darkness of the cave. These shards are representational of an inner light or energy. "Shell" is at the reaching inward stage before further outward growth can occur. When we find a sea shell in the sand, how are we to know if there is life inside? "Symbiosis" is a term that describes a relationship between two different organisms which cannot exist one without the other. This sculpture (Illustration # 2) cannot survive without the relationship of the one larger element leaning against the other for support; the other element would tumble without the pressure from the first. "Symbiosis's" very existence is tenuous, as if a wisp of air could destroy the balance. Nothing "is" without relating to something else. Growing is not a phenomenon that takes place in a vacuum; and loneliness doesn't need to be an isolated island. This growing stage is one of accepting help. (See more in text...|$|R
