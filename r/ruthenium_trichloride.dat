40|$|Pre-protein {{translocation}} into chloroplasts {{is accomplished}} by two distinct translocation machineries in the outer and inner envelope, respectively. We have isolated the translocon at the inner envelope membrane (Tic complex) by blue-native PAGE and describe a new Tic subunit, Tic 62. Tic 62, together with Tic 110 and Tic 55, forms a core translocation unit. The N-terminus of Tic 62 shows strong homologies to NAD(H) dehydrogenases in eukaryotes and to Ycf 39 -like proteins present in cyanobacteria and non-green algae. The stromal-facing C-terminus of Tic 62 contains a novel, repetitive module that interacts with a ferredoxin-NAD(P) + oxidoreductase. Ferredoxin-NAD(P) + oxidoreductase catalyses the final electron transfer of oxygenic photosynthesis from ferredoxin to NAD(P). Substrates that interfere with either NAD binding, such as deamino-NAD, or influence the ratio of NAD(P) /NAD(P) H, such as <b>ruthenium</b> hexamine <b>trichloride,</b> modulate the import characteristics of leaf-specific ferredoxin-NAD(P) + oxidoreductase isologues differently.

40|$|Abstract. Articular-epiphyseal {{cartilage}} complexes {{from the}} distal femur and humerus of five 3 -month-old pigs were collected and preserved using either a conventional or a <b>ruthenium</b> hexammine <b>trichloride</b> (RHT) -supplemented fixation technique. Lesions were similar {{regardless of the}} fixation technique. Areas of necrosis were in epiphyseal but not articular cartilage from both sites of all pigs. Cartilage canals were confined to epiphyseal cartilage and contained vessels which had endothelial cells in varying stages of degeneration and necrosis. Areas of necrotic cartilage often were adjacent to or surrounded degenerate cartilage canals. Lipid emboli (up to 40. 0 pm in diameter) were infrequently located in vessels within cartilage canals. Associated with the lipid emboli were leukocytes, erythrocytes, necrotic cell remnants, and flocculent material. Restriction of necrosis to epiphyseal cartilage and the association of these necrotic areas with degenerating vessels in cartilage canals strongly implicate a defect in cartilage canal blood supply in the pathogenesis of osteochondrosis. The RHT fixation technique resulted in excellent cellular detail at the light microscopic level, but ultrastructurally there was marked vacuolation of chondrocytes and matrix. The conventional technique caused shrinkage of all chondrocytes, resulting in a wide halo of pericellular matrix surrounding each cell. Osteochondrosis is a disease of epiphyseal cartilage {{in which there is}} failure of endochondral o~sification. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Growth plates {{from the}} {{proximal}} tibiotarsal bones of growing broiler chickens from lines exhibiting {{high and low}} incidences of tibial dyschon-droplasia (TD) were compared for ultrastructural differences. Samples of growth plates were collected from five chickens of each line at 2, 7, 14, and 21 d of age. Each sample was prepared for ultrastructural evaluation after initial fixation in 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde and secondary fixation in 1 % osmium tetroxide, each containing. 7 % <b>ruthenium</b> hexamine <b>trichloride.</b> No gross TD lesions were observed. The ultrastructure of growth plates of birds at 2, 7, and 14 d of age was similar between the groups. However, at 21 d of age, chondrocytes in the prehypertrophic zone of the high incidence group contained large lipid inclu-sions and vesiculated and disarranged stacks of rough endoplasmic reticulum with greatly dilated cisternae. Apoptotic and necrotic chondrocytes {{were present in the}} hypertrophic zone. Nuclei of apoptotic chondrocytes contained crescentic caps of condensed chromatin. The cytoplasm contained short seg-ments of dilated granular endoplasmic reticulum, lipid droplets, and vacuoles. Necrotic chondrocytes appeared as amorphous masses with pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei. These changes were not observed in chondrocytes of the low TD incidence group and have not been previously reported in nonthick-ened growth plate cartilage.

40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{increase in}} chondrocyte volume {{is a major}} determinant in the longitudinal growth of mammalian bones. To permit a detailed morphological study of hypertrophic chondrocytes using standard histological techniques, the preservation of normal chondrocyte morphology is essential. We noticed that during fixation of growth plates with conventional fixative solutions, there was a marked morphological (shrinkage) artifact, and we postulated that this arose from the hyper-osmotic nature of these solutions.  To test this, we fixed proximal tibia growth plates of 7 -day-old rat bones in either (a) paraformaldehyde (PFA; 4 %), (b) glutaraldehyde (GA; 2 %) with PFA (2 %) with <b>ruthenium</b> hexamine <b>trichloride</b> (RHT; 0. 7 %), (c) GA (2 %) with RHT (0. 7 %), or (d) GA (1. 3 %) with RHT (0. 5 %) and osmolarity adjusted to a ‘physiological’ level of ~ 280 mOsm. Using conventional histological methods, confocal microscopy, and image analysis on fluorescently-labelled fixed and living chondrocytes, we then quantified the extent of cell shrinkage and volume change. Our data showed that the high osmolarity of conventional fixatives caused a shrinkage artefact to chondrocytes. This was particularly evident when whole bones were fixed, but could be markedly reduced if bones were sagittally bisected prior to fixation. The shrinkage artefact could be avoided by adjusting the osmolarity of the fixatives to the osmotic pressure of normal extracellular fluids (~ 280 mOsm). These results {{emphasize the importance of}} fixative osmolarity, in order to accurately preserve the normal volume/morphology of cells within tissues...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} report we {{followed}} the distribution of hyaluronan during the phases of separation, migration, and colonization of the primordial germ cell migratory process. Hyaluronan was detected {{by the use of}} two cytochemical methods: (1) <b>ruthenium</b> hexammine <b>trichloride</b> (RHT) associated with enzymatic treatment with hyaluronate lyase and (2) a binding specific probe for hyaluronan. After RHT treatment the proteoglycans and/or glycosaminoglycans were observed as a mesh-work formed by electron-dense granules connected by thin filaments. After enzymatic digestion, no filaments could be detected in the migratory pathway. Quantitative analysis showed a close correlation between cell migration and the concentration of RHT-positive filaments. It was also shown that high amounts of hyaluronan were expressed in the separation phase and migration phases whereas during the colonization phase the amount of hyaluronan was clearly diminished. This study showed that the presence of primordial germ cells in each compartment of the migratory pathway was always accompanied by a high expression of hyaluronan. These results indicate that hyaluronan is an important molecule in the migratory process, providing the primordial germ cells with a hydrated environment that facilitates their movement toward the genital ridges.
