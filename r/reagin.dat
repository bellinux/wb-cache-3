500|$|Jezebel {{determined}} that Belle [...] "is often {{held up as}} the standard of the 'feminist' Disney princess." [...] According to Tales, Then and Now: More Folktales as Literary Fictions for Young Adults author Anna E. Altmann, Disney heavily promoted Beauty and the Beast as [...] "a feminist fairy tale" [...] due to Belle's characterization and role in the film. In his book Hearing a Film, Seeing a Sermon: Preaching and Popular Movies, author Timothy B. Cargal agreed that the character indicated [...] "Disney's ... continued efforts to reshape their heroines for a more feminist age." [...] According to Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia author Claudia Mitchell, Belle's feminism was influenced by third-wave feminism and the relatively new concept of girl power during the 1990s. Feminist critics have been generally mixed in their analyses of Belle, arguing {{over whether or not}} the character is in fact [...] "feminist enough." [...] Although Beauty and the Beast was initially lauded upon release for starring a [...] "forward thinking and feminist" [...] heroine, critics tend to agree that, in spite of Belle's independence and resentment towards Gaston, Beauty and the Beast essentially remains a romance about a girl who finally [...] "meets her ideal man." [...] Acknowledging that Belle [...] "represented significant change from [...] sweet, mop-wielding predecessors," [...] Twilight and History author Nancy <b>Reagin</b> observed that [...] "the end result of fulfillment through marriage has been maintained." [...] Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle cited Belle as an example of [...] "pseudo-feminism" [...] because she rejects one man, Gaston, in favor of another, a prince. While commending Belle for [...] "seeing past the beast's appearance," [...] Judith Welikala of The Independent in the end accused the character of [...] "melting back into the role of wife when he turns back into a handsome prince." [...] Fairy Tale author Andrew Teverson referred to Belle as Disney's attempt to address [...] "feminist criticism of its representation of women in earlier films," [...] but ultimately criticized the character's curiosity for [...] "extend only to romance," [...] additionally accusing her of being [...] "a zealous individualist with a pathological hostility to common men and women." [...] Meanwhile, Stylist ranked Belle among the most feminist Disney characters, describing her as an [...] "incredibly intelligent" [...] woman who [...] "doesn't stand for a man who considers her as just a piece of meat ... she wants someone who loves her for her mind too." [...] Acknowledging the character's [...] "feminist longings," [...] Daniel Eagen, author of America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, cited Belle as Disney's [...] "modern-day corrective to Snow White." [...] Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works author Phyllis Frus wrote that, initially, Beauty and the Beast does not seem [...] "remotely feminist." [...] However, the author did acknowledge Belle as [...] "an appealing character with a noticeable feminist streak," [...] but in the end criticized Disney's Consumer Products of reversing what the film had nearly accomplished by inducting the character into the Disney Princess franchise. In Refinery29's [...] "Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses As Feminist Role Models," [...] author Vanessa Golembewski ranked the character eighth but described her personality and ambitions as [...] "confusing." [...] Complex's Tara Aquino described Belle as [...] "a kinda feminist ... who's well-read, self-sufficient, and with standards high enough that she doesn't fall for the town's brain-dead pretty boy." ...|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{to suggest}} that <b>reagins</b> were not {{associated}} with IgG, IgA or IgM was obtained from observations of the different distributions of the highest concentration of these immunoglobulins and reaginic activity following fractionation of allergic sera. For their isolation and characterization, <b>reagins</b> were adsorbed specifically onto specially synthesized ragweed immunosorbents and eluted with glycine-HCl at pH 2. 5, or 2 M NaI at pH 9. l, or 6 M urea at pH 7. 4. The presence of human or rabbit serum protein was required for maximal recovery of reaginic activity. The specific elution of a portion of <b>reagins</b> was accomplished with hapten-like constituents of ragweed pollen. An identification of the antigenic determinants characteristic of <b>reagins</b> {{as those of the}} IgE class of immunoglobulins was made from antisera produced by the immunization of animals with the reaginic eluates. The heterogeneity and diversity of the allergen-reagin system was demonstrated with respect to (i) the antigenic and allergenic composition of ragweed pollen extracts, (ii) the specificities of <b>reagins,</b> and (iii) the skin-fixation property of <b>reagins.</b> A relationship of the reactivity of allergens with <b>reagins</b> was established {{on the basis of their}} electrical charges. Attempts to develop a method for the treatment of allergic individuals by inactivation of <b>reagins</b> in vivo with mercaptan were shown to be partially successful in a model system using monkeys sensitized intradermally with human reaginic serum...|$|R
50|$|As {{general manager}} of the Angels, <b>Reagins</b> was quick to make {{immediate}} changes to the Angels' roster. A little more than a month after taking over for Bill Stoneman as G.M., <b>Reagins</b> traded Gold Glove shortstop Orlando Cabrera to the Chicago White Sox for starting pitcher Jon Garland. Two days later, <b>Reagins</b> signed free agent outfielder Torii Hunter to a 5-year, $90 million contract. At the 2008 trading deadline, <b>Reagins</b> dealt first baseman Casey Kotchman to the Atlanta Braves for Mark Teixeira. Reagins' tenure with the Angels has been in contrast to that of Stoneman, whose time as general manager involved relatively few major trades or other transactions.|$|R

50|$|Nontreponemal test refers an {{indirect}} method of blood test for diagnosis of infection with syphilis. Nontreponemal tests detect biomarkers that are released during cellular damage that occurs from the syphilis spirochete. In contrast, treponemal tests look for antibodies {{that are a}} direct result of the infection thus, anti-treponeme IgG, IgM and to a lesser degree IgA. Nontreponemal tests are screening tests, very rapid and relatively simple, but need to be confirmed by treponemal tests. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-approved standard tests include the VDRL slide test, the rapid plasma <b>reagin</b> (RPR) card test, the unheated serum <b>reagin</b> (USR) test and the toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST).|$|E

Comparison of tissues stained with conjugated <b>reagins</b> and conjugated anti-human globulin antibodies demonstrates the close relationship of <b>reagins</b> and globulins. In antigen-challenged tissues the macrophages and pericytes become enlarged and stain more intensely with toluidine blue.

40|$|The {{first of}} these studies (I) {{described}} the conjugation of skin-sensitizing antibodies (<b>reagins)</b> with fluorescent dyes. Judged by the criteria recommended by Coons and Kaplan (2), the conjugated <b>reagins</b> specifically stained atopic human skin which had been challenged by antigen. When antigen was absent the atopic skin did not stain with conjugated <b>reagins.</b> Therefore, no staining occurred in atopic skin from unchallenged or histamine-tested skin sites. In the atopic skin challenged with specific antigen, all epithelial cells showed evidence of intracellular antigen-antibody reaction. After staining with conjugated anti-egg <b>reagins</b> the cells of hair follicles, of sebaceous and sweat glands had a narrow zone of fluorescence immediately inside the cell border. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine (a) whether reaginic antibody occurs in cells only in response to specific antigen or whether it is also present in unchallenged and histamine-tested tissues, and (b) whether the intracellular antibody is globulin.

50|$|The rapid plasma <b>reagin</b> (RPR), RPR titer, RPR test, or Nontreponemal {{refers to}} a type of rapid {{diagnostic}} test that looks for non-specific antibodies {{in the blood of}} the patient that may indicate a syphilis infection. The term <b>reagin</b> means that this test does not look for antibodies against the actual bacterium, Treponema pallidum, but rather for antibodies against substances released by cells when they are damaged by T. pallidum. Traditionally, syphilis serologic testing has been performed using a NTT such as the RPR or VDRL test, with positive results then confirmed using a specific TT such as TPPA or FTA-ABS (Fig. 1a). This algorithm is currently endorsed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In addition to screening for syphilis, a titer can be used to track the progress of the disease over time and its response to therapy.The traditional algorithm using a nontreponemal test (NTT) followed by a treponemal test (TT) remains the standard {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|E
