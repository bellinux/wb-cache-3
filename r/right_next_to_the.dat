As the South Tower neared completion, it generated controversy concerning view encroachment, high pricing, and architectural style.|$|E

5|$|Mervyn Cowie {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into {{the establishment of the}} parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live <b>right</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 1979, church {{president}} Spencer W. Kimball visited Jerusalem {{to dedicate}} the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens, {{located on the}} Mount of Olives. The church had donated money to beautify the Jerusalem area, and officials of the Jerusalem government were present at the occasion. It was at this dedication that Kimball announced the church's intent to build a center for BYU students in the city. Negotiations between {{the church and the}} Israeli government stretched from 1980-1984. The land the church wanted for the center, located at the northwestern margin of Mount Olivet, <b>right</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> valley which separates it from Mount Scopus, had been acquired by Israel during the Six Day War of 1967 and could not be sold under Israeli law. The church decided to obtain a lease on the land instead. Leasing the land also prevented the politically controversial problem of the church owning a piece of Jerusalem land. Israeli officials saw the building of the center on the land as a way of solidifying control over land whose ownership was ambiguous under international law. By August 1984, the church had the land on a 49-year lease, building permits had been obtained, and construction on the building began.|$|E
