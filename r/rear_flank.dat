5|$|Most tornadoes from supercells {{follow a}} {{recognizable}} life cycle. That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it {{an area of}} quickly descending air known as the <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 1 {{percent of}} tornadoes rotate in an {{anticyclonic}} {{direction in the}} northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, {{in the same manner as}} the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E
5000|$|T. p. schistaceus - (Baird, S.F., 1864): {{found in}} eastern Cuba. Has beige-orange color on <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> and vent area. Bill is dark red with dusky tip.|$|R
2500|$|Engine: Chevy 350 ZZ3 (off-road racing motor). Instead of {{a single}} jet exhaust, this Batmobile had a [...] "boattail" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>flanked</b> by {{separate}} fenders, each with three smaller exhaust nozzles.|$|R
50|$|In November 1941, Kardović {{participated in}} the Battle for Novi Pazar when the Chetniks tried to capture Novi Pazar. Together with forces of Koničanin and Biko Drešović, his forces {{attacked}} the <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> of the Chetniks and caused their dismay and retreat.|$|R
5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white {{on the head and}} neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E
5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E
25|$|Private First Class Luis F. Castro, born in Orocovis, Puerto Rico, was {{assigned}} to 47th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division. PFC. Castro's platoon {{was about to be}} overrun by enemy German forces, when he decided to stay in the <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> and cover his men's retreat by providing firepower killing 15 of the enemy in the process.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{dynamical}} processes leading to tornadogenesis in a supercell thunderstorm through numerical simulation of a full-physics idealized supercell, and supporting simulations of a downdraft plume, {{independent of the}} full supercell environment. Numerical simulations and observations of pre-tornadogenesis environments have shown vortex features arching over and forming a couplet of vorticity that straddles the <b>rear</b> <b>flanking</b> cold pool of supercell storms. Present-day paradigms that explain this kinematic field fail to explain the recognized importance of certain diagnostic tornadogenesis parameters, namely 0 - 1 km Storm Relative Helicity. The results of experiments performed in this thesis reveal the role that a barotropic vortex sheet roll-up process has in forming vortices that can become {{the core of a}} developing tornado vortex. The observed kinematic environment during this process resembles that of current vortex line arching paradigms since developing vortices along the <b>Rear</b> <b>Flanking</b> Gust Front are vertically erect and arch in a similar manner. It is therefore proposed that an alternative conceptual model for explaining the existence of arched vortex lines may include the elementary arguments of non-supercell tornadogenesis and vertical wind shear tilting by the storm’s <b>Rear</b> <b>Flanking</b> Downdraft. A discussion and graphical illustration of this conceptual model is provided in the conclusion. ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I must first thank the numerous mentors and peers in the University of Wisconsin...|$|R
50|$|The {{lesser swallow-tailed swift}} is {{a slender}} species, 12.7-13 cm long, and {{weighing}} 18 g. It has long narrow wings and a long forked tail, which is usually held tightly closed. It is mainly black with a white throat and upper breast and squarish white patches on the <b>rear</b> <b>flanks.</b> The sexes are similar.|$|R
50|$|In November 1941 Koničanin {{participated in}} battle against Chetniks {{who tried to}} capture Novi Pazar. Together with forces of Mulla Jakup and Biko Drešović, his forces {{attacked}} <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> of Chetniks and caused their dismay and retreat. Based on the Hadžiahmetovićs instructions he went to Sjenica to gather additional support in men, arms and ammunition for planned attack on Raška.|$|R
25|$|The tornado {{that struck}} {{the city of}} Xenia, Ohio stands as the deadliest {{individual}} tornado of the 1974 Super Outbreak, killing 32 people and destroying {{a significant portion of}} the town. The tornado formed near Bellbrook, Ohio, southwest of Xenia, at about 4:30pm EDT. It began as a moderate-sized tornado, then intensified while moving northeast at about 50mph (80km/h). The tornado exhibited a multiple-vortex structure and became very large as it approached town. Gil Whitney, the weather specialist for WHIO-TV in Dayton, alerted viewers in Montgomery and Greene Counties (where Xenia is located) about the possible tornado, broadcasting the radar image of the supercell with a pronounced hook echo on the <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> of the storm several minutes before it actually struck. The storm was visible on radar because of raindrops wrapping around the circulation.|$|E
25|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual {{manifestation of a}} mesocyclone. Barring a {{low-level}} boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters monitor all areas of a storm and their surroundings.|$|E
500|$|As {{the tornado}} enters the dissipating stage, its {{associated}} mesocyclone often weakens as well, as the <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it. Sometimes, in intense supercells, tornadoes can develop [...] As the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate, the storm's inflow may be concentrated {{into a new}} area closer {{to the center of}} the storm and possibly feed a new mesocyclone. If a new mesocyclone develops, the cycle may start again, producing one or more new tornadoes. Occasionally, the old (occluded) mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time.|$|E
50|$|They are 16 - 18 cm in length, and {{are similar}} to the only {{slightly}} larger little crake. Baillon's crake has a short straight bill, yellow or green without a red base. Adults have mainly brown upperparts with some white markings, and a blue-grey face and underparts. The <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> are barred black and white. They have green legs with long toes, and a short tail which is barred underneath.|$|R
50|$|Holden HT Belmont, Kingswood and Premier {{models were}} {{introduced}} in May 1969,replacing their Holden HK series equivalents which had been in production since 1968. HT Brougham and Monaro models followed in June 1969. Noticeable changes from the HK series included new grilles, new taillights, flatter <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> and a wider back window. Other changes included increased track width, revised suspension, a new instrument panel and synchromesh on all forward gears on manual gearbox models.|$|R
5000|$|The Puna teal is 19 in long, {{similar in}} size to a wood duck. They have a black cap that extends to below the eyes. Their lower face and neck are creamy white. Their upper tail coverts are gray, and their <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> are dark brown with thin stripes. Back, chest and lower flanks are light coffee with dark brown spots. Their bill is large, light blue with a black line down the middle ...|$|R
500|$|Evidence of a {{supercell}} {{comes from}} the storm's shape and structure, and cloud tower features such as a hard and vigorous updraft tower, a persistent, large overshooting top, a hard anvil (especially when backsheared against strong upper level winds), and a corkscrew look or striations. Under the storm and closer to where most tornadoes are found, evidence of a supercell and likelihood of a tornado includes inflow bands (particularly when curved) such as a [...] "beaver tail", and other clues such as strength of inflow, warmth and moistness of inflow air, how outflow- or inflow-dominant a storm appears, and how far is the front flank precipitation core from the wall cloud. Tornadogenesis is most likely at the interface of the updraft and <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> downdraft, and requires {{a balance between the}} outflow and inflow.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{thought in the}} past that tornadoes moved almost {{exclusively}} in a northeasterly direction. This is false, and a potentially deadly myth which can lead to a false sense of security, especially for unaware spotters or chasers. Although the majority of tornadoes move northeast, this is normally due to the motion of the storm, and tornadoes can arrive from any direction. The expectation of northeasterly travel may be accurate in many cases, but {{is no more than a}} statistical observation about tornadoes in general that any particular tornado may defy at any time. A deadly F5 tornado that hit the city of Jarrell, Texas in 1997 moved to the southwest - directly opposite of commonly expected storm motion. Additionally, tornadoes can shift without notice due to storm motion changes or effects on the tornado itself from factors such as its <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> downdraft. [...] This change of direction proved deadly in the 2013 El Reno, OK tornado in which a 2.6 mile wide tornado shifted from an east direction to a northeast direction killing at least 4 storm chasers.|$|E
2500|$|According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, {{barber pole}} is a slang term used by weather and storm {{spotters}} to describe [...] "a thunderstorm updraft {{with a visual}} appearance including cloud [...] that are curved {{in a manner similar}} to the stripes of a barber pole. The structure typically is most pronounced on the leading edge of the updraft, while drier air from the <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> downdraft often erodes the clouds on the trailing side of the updraft." [...] See Supercell.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} is {{strongly}} sexually dimorphic as {{male and female}} purple-throated cotingas have few similarities in their plumage. The male has black upperparts, including the head, wings, and tail. The feathers on the bird's back to its uppertail coverts, {{as well as its}} upperwing coverts, have white fringes. There is also a conspicuous white wingstripe and white edges to the tertial feathers. Additionally the male has a deeply purple throat and a white belly, with some black barring on its <b>rear</b> <b>flanks.</b>|$|R

50|$|Chetniks {{attacked}} the town on 4 November at 4 a.m. They managed to advance toward the town until 7 a.m. when the <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> of one Chetnik unit {{were attacked by}} Muslim forces under command of Biko Drešović, Džemail Koničanin and Mullah Jakup. This caused dismay of this Chetnik unit which retreated from already captured positions. Muslim forces regrouped and pushed back the Chetnik forces who advanced on another part of front (Petrova Crkva — Đurđevi Stupovi — Parničko brdo — Vidovo). The Chetnik casualties were 83 killed and 48 wounded, while defending forces had 60 killed and 23 wounded.|$|R
2500|$|The Spanish {{took over}} Fort Caroline, {{renaming}} it as San Matteo. In 1568 the French and Spanish confronted {{each other again}} here, when Dominique de Gourgues burned it to the ground. The Spanish rebuilt the fort, but abandoned it in 1569. The Spanish next built Fort San Nicolas further upriver to protect the <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> of St. Augustine. [...] "San Nicolas" [...] served as their name for the Jacksonville area, a placename which survives {{in the neighborhood of}} St. Nicholas. The fort was located {{on the east side of}} the St. Johns, where Bishop Kenny High School now stands. The fort was abandoned in the late 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|For nearly 60 years, {{the only}} known chaser deaths were driving-related. The first was Christopher Phillips, a University of Oklahoma {{undergraduate}} student, killed in a hydroplaning accident when swerving to miss a rabbit in 1984. Three other incidents occurred when [...] was driving home from a hurricane chase in 2005, when Fabian Guerra swerved to miss a deer while driving to a chase in 2009, and when a wrong-way driver resulted in a head-on collision that killed Andy Gabrielson returning from a chase in 2012. On 31 May 2013, an extreme event led to the first known chaser deaths inflicted directly by weather when the widest tornado ever recorded struck near El Reno, Oklahoma. Engineer Tim Samaras, his photographer son Paul, and meteorologist Carl Young were killed doing in situ probe and infrasonic field research by an exceptional combination of events in which an already large and rain-obscured tornado swelled within {{less than a minute}} to [...] wide simultaneously as it changed direction and accelerated. Several other chasers were also struck and some injured by this tornado and its parent supercell's <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> downdraft. Three chasers were killed, two in one vehicle and one in another, when their vehicles collided in West Texas in 2017, bringing the total number of known traffic related fatalities to 7. There are other incidents in which chasers were injured by automobile accidents, lightning strikes, and tornado impacts. While chasing a tornado outbreak on 13 March 1990, KWTV television photographer Bill Merickel was shot and injured near Lindsay, Oklahoma.|$|E
60|$|The leading {{companies}} {{moved up}} and formed in line, {{to the front}} and <b>rear</b> <b>flank.</b> Then came the inspiring notes of the charge and, with a cheer, the whole of the advance guard sprang forward into the bush. The dense undergrowth checked the impetus, as the soldiers had to cut their way with their knives but, as they did so, they maintained their deep-toned war song. As they got more into the open, they rushed round and clambered over the stockade; and the enemy, unable to stand the fury of their charge, fled in panic.|$|E
50|$|The Namaqua warbler is 12-13 cm long, {{with short}} rounded wings, a long tail, strong legs {{and a short}} {{straight}} black bill. The head has a whitish eyebrow and the upperparts are otherwise a rich russet brown. The throat and lower face are whitish with no streaking, and the breast is white with faint streaking. The <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> are buff. The long, brown tail is typically cocked up at an angle. The feet and legs are pinkish-brown, and the eye is brown. The sexes are identical, but juveniles are duller than the adults. The calls include a high-pitched treeep-treep-trrrrrr.|$|R
50|$|On 14 April 1943, Rudel {{was awarded}} the Oakleaves to his Knights Cross. SG 2 {{developed}} new tank-assault tactics, having found {{the best way to}} destroy tanks was to attack them from the <b>rear</b> or <b>flanks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nuthatches are compact {{birds with}} short legs, {{compressed}} wings, and square 12-feathered tails. They have long, sturdy, pointed bills and strong toes with long claws. Nuthatches have blue-grey backs (violet-blue in some Asian species, which also have red or yellow bills) and white underparts, which are variably tinted with buff, orange, rufous or lilac. Although head markings vary between species, {{a long black}} eye stripe, with contrasting white supercilium, dark forehead and blackish cap is common. The sexes look similar, but may differ in underpart colouration, especially on the <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> and under the tail. Juveniles and first-year birds can be almost indistinguishable from adults.|$|R

50|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> {{downdraft}} or RFD is {{a region}} of dry air wrapping {{around the back of}} a mesocyclone in a supercell thunderstorm. These areas of descending air are thought to be essential in the production of many supercellular tornadoes. Large hail within the <b>rear</b> <b>flank</b> downdraft often shows up brightly as a hook on weather radar images, producing the characteristic hook echo, which often indicates the presence of a tornado.|$|E
5|$|The {{face and}} {{surrounding}} areas, including the lores, supercilium, ear-coverts, cheeks and throat are a white buff-orange. Below, the belly and breast are a rich cinnamon, darkening to an orange-cinnamon {{at the sides}} of the breast. The <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> and undertail-covert feathers are rufous. In worn plumage, the color may be uneven in the lower parts and lighter in hue. The upper mandible of the bill is black, and the lower is gray with a black tip. The iris and legs are dark brown. Juveniles of the species resemble adults but for the base of their beaks being yellow, proportionately shorter, and their overall coloring being less vibrant.|$|R
2500|$|Major General Sterling Price, the {{commander}} of the Confederate district of Arkansas, had ordered General Dockery to harass the <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> of the Union troop movements and attack Union supply trains. General Dockery's forces consisted of his own brigade and elements of Colonel Crawford’s Arkansas Cavalry Brigade, including Poe’s and McMurtrey’s Cavalry Battalions. [...] "Unfortunately," [...] Price reported, [...] "before Brigadier-General Dockery could execute this order he was on March 29 attacked at Mount Elba by a party of the enemy from Pine Bluff and completely routed. They at the same time captured at Long View his entire train (twenty-six wagons) and about 200 prisoners." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} similar to 2+2 coupes {{produced}} by many Italian design houses, with simple, clean lines instead of the more pronounced lines of the 1961 X concept car. Even the front indicators were demurely placed within the front grill next {{to a pair of}} single headlights instead of the more usual place under the bumper. The swage line started midway along the door, continued to the <b>rear</b> <b>flanks</b> and then raised up before flowing around the rear corners to form the top rear edge of the boot. Unlike other Toyota models of the time, horizontal rear indicators were used as part of the emerging trend in car design.|$|R
