5|$|Developed {{over many}} centuries, Kraków {{provides}} a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture. As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. It {{is for this}} <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> variations in style and urban planning are so easily recognisable.|$|E
5|$|The <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> set of {{vitamins}} skips directly from E to K {{is that the}} vitamins corresponding to letters F–J were either reclassified over time, discarded as false leads, or renamed because of their relationship to vitaminB, which became a complex {{of vitamins}}.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E

5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which is the <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Filming for series 3 {{began in}} November 2012, with an airing date {{scheduled}} for May 2013. In November Jones and Sharp were photographed filming {{on location in}} Manchester for the series. As the fourth series had a different air date (its television broadcast began in September, unlike May for the three previous series) it became the first series not to be filmed in the winter months. A longer break in production between series 3 and 4 was the <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fourth series was instead filmed in summer.|$|E
5|$|Having now gained {{experience}} with the Super Famicom sound chip, Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series, Final Fantasy V (1992), was much better than that of IV. He named this as the primary <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack album was two CDs long, a first for the series. Like IV, the discography of Final Fantasy V included an arranged and a piano album {{in addition to the}} main soundtrack album.|$|E

5|$|The Circles of Sustainability {{assessment}} of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable {{impression of the}} ecological sustainability of the city only because {{it is based on}} a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution. Part of the <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city remains assessed at basic sustainability is because of the low resource-use and carbon emissions of its poorer neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|The {{day of the}} National Flag of Armenia {{is marked}} on 15 June every year. The day is chosen for the <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Armenian law on the National Flag of Armenia was passed on 15 June 2006. The day of the Armenian tricolour was celebrated {{for the first time}} on 15 June 2010 in Yerevan.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} {{contribution of}} the Morea scientific expedition was in effect its quasi-disinterest in pillage and treasure hunting. Blouet refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues {{with the intent of}} taking a piece separated {{from the rest of the}} statue without regard. It is perhaps for this <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were brought back in their entirety. In any case, this willingness to protect the integrity of monuments undoubtedly represented an epistemological progress.|$|E

5|$|With Justice Scalia {{breathing}} {{down the}} necks {{of anyone who}} peeks into the Congressional Record or Senate reports, {{the other members of}} the Court may have concluded that the benefit of citing legislative history does not outweigh its costs. It is likely for this <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> percentage of cases citing it has decreased dramatically. No one likes an unnecessary fight, especially not one with as formidable an opponent as Justice Scalia.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected {{and that was the}} primary <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, notwithstanding {{the fact that there was}} a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by {{the beginning}} of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree that}} Hexxus is imprisoned in is cut down by Tony and Ralph, Zak's superiors. Hexxus quickly begins {{to regain his}} powers by feeding on pollution. He manipulates the humans to drive to FernGully. In FernGully, Zak meets Pips, a fairy envious of Zak's {{relationship}} with Crysta. Zak begins {{to fall in love}} with Crysta, but hides the true <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> humans had returned. When the signs of Hexxus's resurrection begin to manifest themselves in poisoned trees and rivers, he finally admits that humans are destroying the forest. The fairies mount an attempt to defend their homes, but knowing their fight is hopeless, Zak convinces Batty to aid him in stopping the machine before it destroys them. When Zak makes his presence known to Tony and Ralph, Hexxus takes over the machine and begins to wildly destroy the forest.|$|E

5|$|With the {{inclined}} plane, {{the problems}} {{stemmed from a}} mis-calculation. Power was provided by a large tank, filled with water, which descended in a shaft, raising one boat on a trolley and allowing another to descend as it did so. When the tank reached {{the bottom of the}} shaft, the water discharged, and the second tank was used to reverse the process. Green had been the engineer on the Bude Canal, where this design had been used successfully, but the size of the tanks at Wellisford were much too small. On the Bude Canal, a tank holding 15tons of water was required to raise a boat weighing six tons. The Grand Western Canal used boats holding eight tons, but the tanks only held ten tons of water, whereas tests indicated that about 25tons was needed. It was for this <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> steam engine was obtained to supply the power.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever <b>reason,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was intended}} to stay true to the Dragon Quest formula within the design necessities and limitations of an MMORPG. During an earlier development phase, the UI featured {{a large amount of}} information showing the various player statuses, but seeking to streamline and simplify the game, they removed most of the display. A different gameplay challenge was presented by the move from turn-based to real-time battles, which went against the traditions of the Dragon Quest series. Fujisawa wanted to implement the classic battle system, but was opposed by Horii and other staff members, who successfully pushed for a real-time combat system. Elements of that battle system, such as the ability to halt enemy momentum as a battle mechanic, proved extremely challenging for the developers. Speaking about the difference between Dragon Quest X and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Yoshida said that they needed to preserve the atmosphere of a normal Dragon Quest title despite MMORPGs not being designed for solo playing. It was for this <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> loaning of player characters as NPC party members was incorporated. During later development, and following the game's release, the main focus was on balancing the various elements, items and weapons so as to create a level playing field, in addition to keeping the in-game economy balanced. Several features featured in earlier entries, such as the Casino and Coliseum, needed to be kept back for a later time.|$|E

5|$|The {{tour was}} subject to minor criticisms, at both the events {{surrounding}} the opening concerts in Barcelona, and the concerts in Dublin. When rehearsing for the tour in Barcelona, residents of the city complained about the band's noise after 10pm, which was the time until which the city allowed the band to rehearse. The setup of the band's stage for the Croke Park concerts in Dublin was criticised by fans for only allowing seating around part of the circular-shaped stage, taking away from the 360° seating configuration that was used at other venues. One fan claimed that only 270° of seating around the stage was being utilised for the three Dublin concerts, {{and that there was}} no <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stage could not be placed in the middle of the venue. Additional criticisms about the Croke Park shows arose from about 80 Dublin citizens, who protested against the Dublin City Council for allowing the band's crew to dismantle the stage in the middle of the night following the three concerts, due to the loud noises caused by the crew. The protest blocked several crew trucks from exiting the venue, putting the tour behind schedule, and tour promoter MCD Productions delivered a letter to the protesters informing them that they could be sued for any of the tour's financial losses due to the protest. In addition to the loudness of the band's crew, the Dublin City Council decided to withhold the band's €80,000 ($104,000) bond, after breaking the 75 decibel maximum volume at all three of the Dublin concerts.|$|E
