40|$|In this paper, a {{mechanism}} is presented for reducing priority inversion in multi-programmed computing systems. Contrarily to well-known approaches from the literature, this paper tackles {{cases where the}} dependency relationships among tasks cannot be known in advance to the operating system (OS).

We present the prototype implementation of the concept within the Linux kernel, in the form of modifications to the standard POSIX condition variables code, along with an extensive evaluation including a quantitative assessment of the benefits for applications making use of the technique, as well as comprehensive overhead measurements.

Compare and contrast the approaches. We argue that the second approach makes for simpler representation of defaults and their interactions. 2. Describe a syntax and semantics for the second, less well-known approach; we introduce the notion of ordered theory presentation (OTP) to represent theories with defaults. 3. Show how ordered theory presentations can represent familiar examples of interacting defaults in an intuitively clear and simple way; we give the Tweety example and the Yale Shooting example.

30|$|Irrespective of {{maternal}} size or maternal nutrition, twin fetuses had lower ST muscle mass compared to singletons, {{in agreement with}} a previous study (McCoard et al. 2001). In the present study, the effect {{of maternal}} nutrition on muscle mass was influenced by maternal size. Twin fetuses from HM-ewes had disproportionately smaller ST muscle compared to their single counterparts. This indicates that heavy twin-bearing ewes fed a maintenance plane of nutrition were unable to meet the nutritional requirements to maintain not only fetal weight (Blair et al. 2011), but also muscle growth, when compared to their counterparts carrying singletons. Competition for limited nutrients between twins (McCoard et al. 2000) or the <b>reduced</b> <b>priority</b> of nutrient partitioning to fetal skeletal muscle development compared with other organs during maternal nutrient restriction (Du et al. 2010) could explain the lower muscle mass in twins from ewes at a restricted feeding level. In contrast, the lower ST muscle weight observed in singles and twins from LM-ewes, in comparison with their single and twin counterpart from LA-ewes, could indicate that lighter ewes fed a maintenance level of nutrition are unable to provide the nutrient requirements either for a single or twin pregnancy. These results {{support the notion that}} skeletal muscle growth in twins is more sensitive to maternal nutritional constraint than in singles, which is in agreement with a previous study (Gootwine et al. 2007). However, our results also suggest muscle growth can be compromised in singleton pregnancies under maternal nutrient restriction, as reported previously (Quigley et al. 2008).|$|E

Sparrows exposed to a cat had a significant reduction of, on average, 18 % and 36 % in T-cell response in two different experiments compared with sparrows that were exposed to a rabbit. In a field experiment with a barn owl, Tyto alba, or a rock dove, Columba livia, placed next to a nest-box during laying, we found a mean reduction in T-cell [...] mediated immune response of 20 %. In males, the reduction in cell-mediated immune response owing to cat exposure increased with increasing size of the badge, which is a secondary sexual character, but only during the breeding season. In a third experiment, house sparrows were either exposed to a barn own, T. alba, or a rock dove, C. livia, and development of malarial infections was recorded during the following 6 weeks. Individual sparrows exposed to a predator had a higher prevalence and intensity of Haemoproteus malarial infection than did control individuals. Therefore, exposure to predators reduced their ability of hosts to cope with parasitism mediated through effects on immune function.

40|$|Abstract—In {{multihop}} networks, packet schedulers at downstream nodes have {{an opportunity}} to make up for excessive latencies due to congestion at upstream nodes. Similarly, when packets incur low delays at upstream nodes, downstream nodes can <b>reduce</b> <b>priority</b> and schedule other packets first. The goal {{of this paper is to}} define a framework for design and analysis of coordinated multihop scheduling (CMS) which exploit such internode coordination. We first provide a general CMS definition which enables us to classify a number of schedulers from the literature, including G-EDF, FIFO+, CEDF, and work-conserving CJVC as examples of CMS schedulers. We then develop a distributed theory of traffic envelopes which enables us to derive end-to-end statistical admission control conditions for CMS schedulers. We show that CMS schedulers are able to limit traffic distortion to within a narrow range resulting in improved end-to-end performance and more efficient resource utilization. Consequently, our technique exploits statistical resource sharing among flows, classes, and nodes, and our results provide the first statistical multinode multiclass admission control algorithm for networks of work conserving servers.
