40|$|The present paper {{describes}} a Matlab toolbox for automatic analysis of histological arterial sections, for both morphometric investigations and 3 D reconstructions. The {{aim of this}} program is to simplify and improve the processing of histological images, which is usually carried out by means of specific or standard image editing software, where measuring is mainly mouse-based, therefore manual and affected by subjective errors. A user-friendly interface has been also developed, to help a non Matlab-expert through {{the steps of the}} elaboration. The main phases in the image processing are: unwarping, <b>registration,</b> <b>identification</b> of the three layers in the arterial thickness, stacking and smoothing of each cross section, definition of surfaces and volumes for 3 D reconstruction. The most delicate step is the edge detection for the identification of the layers, that requires the validation of three algorithms, one for each edge. A medical application is reported that investigates the effects of balloon angioplasty on the biological tissues. Several porcine arteries, healthy or treated with balloon, have been observed for evaluating lumen area and the layers’ thicknesses. It is worth noting also that Finite Element models of arterial segments can be conveniently developed using 3 D reconstruction, carried out with this toolbox, exploiting the high level of morphometric information of histological images...|$|E

Since 2007, however, there has been {{increasing}} concern for horse health and welfare standards, and links between these concerns and the structures, governance and funding of the Irish equine industries have been reported. This paper addresses two central issues: firstly the local governance of, trade in and disposal of unwanted horses; and secondly mechanisms employed to improve standards of care given to horses owned by certain communities. Method Primary information was gathered through visits to horse pounds run by and on behalf of Local Authorities, to social horse projects, to horse dealer yards, ferry ports, horse slaughter plants and knackeries.

40|$|Methylphenidate and 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') {{are widely}} misused psychoactive drugs. Methylphenidate {{increases}} brain dopamine and norepinephrine levels by blocking the presynaptic reuptake transporters. MDMA releases serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine {{through the same}} transporters. Pharmacodynamic interactions of methylphenidate and MDMA are likely. This study compared the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of methylphenidate and MDMA administered alone or in combination in healthy subjects using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Methylphenidate did not enhance the psychotropic effects of MDMA, although it produced psychostimulant effects on its own. The haemodynamic and adverse effects of co-administration of methylphenidate and MDMA were significantly higher compared with MDMA or methylphenidate alone. Methylphenidate did not change the pharmacokinetics of MDMA and vice versa. Methylphenidate and MDMA shared some subjective amphetamine-type effects; however, 125 mg of MDMA increased positive mood more than 60 mg of methylphenidate, and methylphenidate enhanced activity and concentration more than MDMA. Methylphenidate and MDMA differentially altered facial emotion recognition. Methylphenidate enhanced the recognition of sad and fearful faces, whereas MDMA reduced the recognition of negative emotions. Additionally, the present study found acute pharmacodynamic tolerance to MDMA but not methylphenidate. In conclusion, the combined use of methylphenidate and MDMA does not produce more psychoactive effects compared with either drug alone, but potentially enhances cardiovascular and adverse effects. The findings may be of clinical importance for assessing the risks of combined psychostimulant misuse. Trial <b>registration</b> <b>identification</b> number: NCT 01465685 ([URL]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) {{represents a}} learning process leading to symptom relief and resulting in long-term changes in behavior. CBT for panic disorder {{is based on}} exposure and exposure-based processes can be studied in the laboratory as extinction of experimentally acquired fear responses. We have recently demonstrated {{that the ability to}} extinguish learned fear responses is associated with a functional genetic polymorphism (COMTval 158 met) in the COMT gene and this study was aimed at transferring the experimental results on the COMTval 158 met polymorphism on extinction into a clinical setting. Methods We tested a possible effect of the COMTval 158 met polymorphism on the efficacy of CBT, in particular exposure-based treatment modules, in a sample of 69 panic disorder patients. Results We present evidence that panic patients with the COMTval 158 met met/met genotype may profit less from (exposure-based) CBT treatment methods as compared to patients carrying at least one val-allele. No association was found with the 5 -HTTLPR/rs 25531 genotypes which is presented as additional material. Conclusions We were thus able to transfer findings on the effect of the COMTval 158 met polymorphism from an experimental extinction study obtained using healthy subjects to a clinical setting. Furthermore patients carrying a COMT val-allele tend to report more anxiety and more depression symptoms as compared to those with the met/met genotype. Limitations of the study as well as possible clinical implications are discussed.

40|$|Themental chronometry of {{the human}} brain’s {{processing}} of sounds to be categorized as targets has intensively been studied in cognitive neuroscience. According to current theories, a series of successive stages consisting of the <b>registration,</b> <b>identification,</b> and categorization of the sound has to be completed before participants are able to report the sound as a target by button press after! 300 – 500 ms. Here we use miniature eye movements {{as a tool to}} study the categorization of a sound as a target or nontarget, indicating that an initial categori-zation is present already after 80 – 100 ms. During visual fixation, the rate of microsaccades, the fastest components of miniature eye movements, is transientlymodulated after auditory stimulation. In two experiments, wemeasuredmicrosaccade rates in human partic-ipants in an auditory three-tone oddball paradigm (including rare nontarget sounds) andobserved adifference in themicrosaccade rates between targets and nontargets as early as 142 ms after sound onset. This finding was replicated in a third experiment with directed saccades measured in a paradigm in which tones had to be matched to score-like visual symbols. Considering the delays introduced by (motor) signal transmission and data analysis constraints, the brain must have differentiated target from nontarget sounds as fast as 80 – 100 ms after sound onset in both paradigms. We suggest that predictive information processing for expected input makes higher cognitive attributes, such as a sound’s identity and category, available already during early sensory processing. Themeasurement of eye movements is thus a promising approach to investigate hearing. Key words: audition; categorization; mental chronometry; microsaccad...|$|E

Activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are associated with enhanced response to EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. We studied patients with advanced NSCLC for whom treatment was customized based on EGFR mutation status. Methods We screened 57 chemotherapy-naïve patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC, stage IIIB or IV, aged 70 [*]years or older, and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, for EGFR exon 19 codon 746 – 750 deletion and exon 21 L 858 R mutation. Twenty-two patients with EGFR mutations received gefitinib; 32 patients without mutations received vinorelbine or gemcitabine. The primary endpoint was the response rate. Results The response rate was 45. 5 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 24. 4 %, 67. 8 %) in patients with EGFR mutations and 18. 8 % (95 % CI: 7. 2 %, 36. 4 %) in patients without EGFR mutations. The median overall survival was 27. 9 [*]months (95 %CI: 24. 4 [*]months, undeterminable months) in patients with EGFR mutations and 14. 9 [*]months (95 %CI: 11. 0 [*]months, 22. 4 [*]months) in patients without EGFR mutations. In the gefitinib group, grade 3 / 4 hepatic dysfunction and dermatitis occurred in 23 % and 5 % of patients, respectively. In patients treated with vinorelbine or gemcitabine, the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (47 %; four had febrile neutropenia), anemia (13 %), and anorexia (9 %). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Conclusions Treatment customization based on EGFR mutation status deserves consideration, particularly for elderly patients who often cannot receive second-line chemotherapy due to poor organ function or comorbidities.
