30|$|On NS 2 simulator, the CR node and the {{required}} layers for network functionality were developed. Cognitive radio cognitive network (CRCN) patch of NS 2 is used. The CRCN patch has three building blocks that support cognitive radio functionalities in NS 2. These blocks are cognitive <b>radio</b> physical <b>layer,</b> cognitive <b>radio</b> MAC <b>layer,</b> and cognitive <b>radio</b> network <b>layer</b> [42]. The CR network layer is accountable for keeping {{and maintaining the}} neighbor list. It also decides on the channel selection. This decision is passed to the MAC layer which then handles switching to the selected channel. The CR physical layer is responsible for sensing some information like all the available spectrum bands, transmission power, propagation model, and SINR/SNR physical model. This CRCN patch of NS- 2 does not model {{the activity of the}} PU nodes. Here, the CRCN patch of NS- 2 is modified to include the used PU activity model. The PU activity block is responsible for generating and keeping track of PU activities in each spectrum band (spectrum utilization), that is, the sequence of ON and OFF periods by primary nodes over the simulation time. These ON and OFF periods can be modeled as continuous time, alternating ON/OFF Markov Renewal Process (MRP) [42]. The ON (busy) state indicates that the primary node occupies the channel. While, the OFF (idle) state means that the channel is unoccupied by the primary node. The channels ON and OFF periods are considered exponentially distributed. The rate parameters of exponential distribution λx,λy listed in Table  2 which was measured in [36] are provided as inputs in simulation.|$|R

Comments can be posted through CCR Online. Advances in networking have been accelerated {{by the use of}} ab-stractions, such as “layering”, and the ability to apply those ab-stractions across multiple communication media. Wireless commu-nication provides the greatest challenge to these clean abstractions because of the lossy communication media. For many network-ing researchers, wireless communications hardware starts and ends with WiFi, or 802. 11 compliant hardware. However, there has been a recent growth in software defined ra-dio, which allows the basic radio medium to be manipulated by programs. This mutable <b>radio</b> <b>layer</b> has allowed researchers to ex-ploit the physical properties of radio communication to overcome some of the challenges of the radio media; in certain cases, re-searchers have been able to develop mechanisms that are difficult to implement in electrical or optical media.

40|$|Wireless {{local area}} {{networks}} (WLANs) {{based on the}} IEEE 802. 11 standard are now widespread. Most are used to provide access for mobile devices to a conventional wired infrastructure, and some are used where wires are not possible, forming an ad hoc network of their own. There are several varieties at the physical or <b>radio</b> <b>layer</b> (802. 11, 802. 11 a, 802. 11 b, 802. 11 g), with each featuring different data rates, modulation schemes and transmission frequencies.

As this is largely based on a contention approach, it does not allow prioritising of traffic or stations, so it cannot easily provide the quality of service (QoS) required by time-sensitive applications, such as voice or video transmission. In order to address this shortfall of the technology, the IEEE set up a task group that is aiming to enhance the MAC layer protocol {{so that it can}} provide QoS.

40|$|Wireless {{multihop}} {{networks are}} gaining popularity in {{applications such as}} mesh networks, wireless backbones, and sensor networks. Typically, communication protocols designed for such networks have explicitly or implicitly assumed an omnidirectional antenna at the <b>radio</b> <b>layer.</b> With recent progress in signal processing and antenna technologies, smart beamforming antennas have become feasible at cheaper prices, making them an attractive replacement to omnidirectional antennas. With beamforming antennas, the ability to guide RF energy in desired directions can lead to higher spatial reuse of the channel. Also, the higher communication range of beamforming antennas can be exploited to achieve stronger network connectivity, and to obtain fewer hop routes. However, existing protocols considered suitable for omnidirectional antennas are incapable of achieving these benefits. We have identified several weaknesses in these protocols, that together degrade overall network performance. We have addressed these weaknesses, and developed {{a better understanding of}} the improvements achievable with beamforming antennas.
