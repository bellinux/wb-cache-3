40|$|Background: The European Food Information Resource (EuroFIR) {{network has}} {{established}} the eBASIS (Bioactive Substances in Food Information System) online food composition and biological effects database for plant-derived bioactive compounds (phytochemicals). On {{the basis of}} submitted evidence, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) expert panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies assesses whether claims made under articles 13. 1, 13. 5 or 14 of the Regulation (EC) 1924 / 2006, which governs the use of nutrition and health claims on foods, are scientifically justified. This report evaluates the eBASIS biological effects database in the preparation and evaluation of health claims dossiers. Methods: The eBASIS biological effects database is a compilation of expert-evaluated data extracted from the literature, prioritising human intervention studies to investigate health effects of phytochemicals. Currently included are > 750 records from 445 studies providing data on 56 validated biomarkers, mainly relating to cardio-metabolic and bone health outcomes. The data cover 144 bioactive compounds from 17 compound classes. Using the EFSA <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>Questions</b> and the database of general function health claims, we identified claims relating to phytochemicals made under articles 13. 1, 13. 5 and 14 and compared them with the eBASIS database to identify overlap between them. Results: The EFSA online health claims database contains 4240 submissions under article 13. 1, of which 2157 pertain to plants or plant-based bioactive compounds; 496 of these relate to plants or bioactive compounds included in the eBASIS biological effects database. Out of the 18 current 13. 5 ‘new function’ claims on EFSA's <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions,</b> 7 are for plants or plant-based bioactive compounds, of which 6 are included in eBASIS. Of the 222 defined article 14 claims, 21 pertain to plants or plant-based bioactive compounds, of which 19 are in eBASIS. Conclusions: There is extensive overlap between eBASIS and the submitted health claims that relate to plant-based bioactive compounds. EuroFIR eBASIS is {{a useful tool for}} regulators to independently check completeness of health claims applications relating to phytochemicals and is a potentially valuable resource to assist claimants in the compilation of dossiers on functional foods and health claims...|$|E
40|$|This volume {{takes up}} the {{controversial}} problems of the early agrarian stage of „pastoral cultures”. It contains the contribution of authors who are united in their conviction {{of the need to}} analyze the „classical” interpretation, which is of a monolinear, very dynamic development of the East European pastoralism and its Central European (or — to use a wider term — West European) manifestations. All articles were created under the Editor’s authorization and they concern a special <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions.</b> The questions addressed are: genesis and changes of the given phenomena, functional requalification of economic and social systems, traditionally considered to be „pastoral” ones; as well as the reconstruction of fields of culture, considered to be particularly useful in analyzing the development of the civilizational trend (metallurgy, weapons), in which we are interested. The volume does not exhaust all the necessary aspects of the discussion. I hope that we will be able, in the near future, to present its continuation within the Baltic-Pontic Studies. 1. 	All dates in the B-PS are calibrated [see: Radiocarbon vol. 28, 1986, and the next volumes]. Deviations from this rule will be point out in notes. 2. 	The names of the archaeological cultures (especially from the territory of the Ukraine) are standarized according to the English literature on the subject [e. g. Mallory 1989]. In the case of a new term, the author’s original name has been retained. 3. 	The place names located in the Ukraine have been transliterat from the ver¬sions suggested by the author (i. e. from the Ukrainian, Polish or Russian originals). The publication is carried out within the research project No 1 P 108 067 04 financed in the years 1993 - 1995 by Committee for Scientific Research and supplied with funds of Ministry of National Education...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to survey the {{labelling}} of drinks with pronounced health benefits found on the Swedish market today and to evaluate whether they are in accordance to EU and national regulations or not. Especially the nutrition and health claims were looked into. This study shows that there are several drinks with claimed health effects being sold today. The process of approaching full functioning regulations in the EU on nutrition and health claims is proceeding slowly. A snapshot of today�’s market of drinks with pronounced health effects shows that there are multiple cases of misleading statements and interfering labelling on the products. Often it concerns nutritional labelling or health claims. In this study a total of 60 health claims were found on the products. The health claims were made on 10 different vitamins, seven different minerals, five other substances, dietary fibre (one claim) and lactic acid bacteria (three claims). One health claim had reached a final decision from the European Commission and is no longer allowed. For 44 health claims found in this study similar claims were found in EFSA�’s (European Food Safety Authority) <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> database and the evaluations of these were used to estimate the outcome for those claims found in the study. The estimation reveals that 38 health claims might be approved though 13 of these might be considered to be misleading since the EU population does not have an inadequate intake of the subject of the claim. Six of the health claims might not be permitted to use. The 15 remaining health claims were not possible to estimate, as EFSA had not evaluated health claims similar to these yet. The nutrition claims found on the investigated products in most cases were in accordance to regulations, however a few need to be clarified. A considerable amount of unclear expressions were found and many ingredients were pointed out in the labelling and many of them need to be clarified or explained as well. When the harmonized EU regulation on the use of nutrition and health claims is of full coverage it will surely be easier for companies to label their products in a truthful and lawful way compared to today...|$|E
