In reality, the CCDI {{was established to}} check all party organisations except the central leadership.|$|E

5|$|Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also {{state that}} accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations {{stem from a}} {{clerical}} paradigm which expects Opus Dei members to behave as monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen, Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei {{can be found in}} influential clerical circles.|$|E

5|$|Dalton {{taught for}} sixty years. She taught her pupils energetically {{in spite of}} having crude {{educational}} resources. In 1891, Dalton encouraged other women teachers {{to ask for a}} raise.

5|$|In {{classical}} Athenian marriages, {{husband or}} wife could legally initiate a divorce. The woman's closest male relative (who {{would be her}} kyrios if she were not married) could also do so, apparently even against the couple's wishes. After divorce, the husband was required to return the dowry or pay 18 percent interest annually so the woman's livelihood would continue and she could remarry. If there were children {{at the time of}} the divorce, they remained in their father's house and he remained <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> upbringing. If a woman committed adultery, her husband was legally required to divorce her. A married epikleros would be divorced so she could marry her nearest relative.|$|E

He {{has been described as a}} beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the mind control device turns people's fears into paranoid delusions. Mulder tries to contact Dr. Stroman with no success. He traces Dr. Stroman's location to an empty hotel room where he finds cigarettes in the ash tray.

However, by the time Mulder enters, shots ring out, and Mulder finds both men dead, with X (Steven Williams) <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> murders.

5|$|Shein's army {{retreated to}} its main camp, {{which was in}} turn {{surrounded}} by Commonwealth forces in mid-October. The besieged Russians waited for relief, but none arrived, as Commonwealth and Cossack cavalry {{had been sent to}} disrupt the Russian rear. Some historians also cite dissent and internal divisions in the Russian camp as <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> inaction and ineffectiveness (Jasienica blames the Russian warlords, and Parker the foreign mercenaries). The Tatar invasion threatening the south Russian borderlands was a contributory factor, with many soldiers and boyars from those regions deserting the Russian camp to return to protect their homes. Some foreign mercenaries also deserted to the Commonwealth side.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{receive a}} warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The {{visitors}} are allowed to stay the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young Maharaja, Zalim Singh.
