In particular, the magnetic fields can be the dominant component of the plasma, with energy-density exceeding the particle rest-mass energy density. Magnetic fields then determine the plasma dynamical evolution, energy dissipation and acceleration of non-thermal particles. Recent data coming from astrophysical high energy missions, like magnetar bursts and Crab nebula flares, point {{to the importance of}} magnetic reconnection in these objects. In this review we outline a broad spectrum of problems related to the astrophysical relevant processes in magnetically dominated <b>relativistic</b> <b>plasmas.</b> We discuss the problems of large scale dynamics of <b>relativistic</b> <b>plasmas,</b> <b>relativistic</b> reconnection and particle acceleration at reconnect-ing layers, turbulent cascade in force-fee plasmas.

5000|$|Massive {{particles}} are relativistic when their kinetic energy {{is comparable to}} or greater than the energy [...] corresponding to their rest mass. In other words, a massive particle is relativistic when its total mass-energy (rest mass + kinetic energy) is at least twice its rest mass. This condition implies that the particle's speed is close to the speed of light. According to the Lorentz factor formula, this requires the particle to move at 86.6025% or more of the speed of light. Such relativistic {{particles are}} generated in particle accelerators, as well as naturally occurring in cosmic radiation. In astrophysics, jets of <b>relativistic</b> <b>plasma</b> are produced by the centers of active galaxies and quasars.|$|E

50|$|Kapahi's {{work was}} mainly focused on {{observational}} cosmology {{and his work}} covered the studies of radio galaxies and quasars. During his doctoral studies {{under the guidance of}} Govind Swarup, together they developed an imaging technique for capturing rapid images of solar radio bursts and the details were published by way of an article, A simple image forming technique suitable for multifrequency observations of solar radio bursts in Solar Physics journal in 1970. Through his studies with the help of Ooty Radio Telescope, he discovered {{for the first time in}} 1975 that radio galaxies were smaller in linear sizes during earlier cosmic epochs. He was one of the first astronomers to study Compact Steep‐Spectrum radio sources and he published a series of articles on the subject during 1981-98. These studies assisted in the later-day development of a paradigm known as unifying scheme of radio galaxies and quasers which explained the relativistic beaming in nuclear jets of quasars and in integrating the properties of lobe-dominated and core-dominated types of quasars. His work with Very-long-baseline interferometry telescopes helped discover hot spots on the twin-lobes of extragalactic radio sources as well as distant radio galaxies. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and ResearchGate, an online article repository of scientific articles, has listed 101 of them. Besides, he edited five books including Quasars: proceedings of the 119th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union, Lectures on Observational Cosmology, Proceedings of the Workshop Diffuse Thermal and <b>Relativistic</b> <b>Plasma</b> in Galaxy Clusters and Asian-Pacific Astronomy: Proceedings of the 6th Asian- Pacific Regional Meeting on Astronomy of the International Astronomical Union.

40|$|The {{possibility}} is investigated that the reported excess low energy antiproton {{component of the}} cosmic radiation results from proton-proton (p-p) interactions in <b>relativistic</b> <b>plasmas.</b> Because of both target and projectile motion in such plasmas, the antiproton production threshold {{in the frame of}} the plasma is much lower than the threshold of antiproton production in cosmic ray interactions with ambient matter.

The antiproton spectrum is calculated for <b>relativistic</b> thermal <b>plasmas</b> and the spectrum is estimated for <b>relativistic</b> nonthermal <b>plasmas.</b> As possible production sites, matter accreting onto compact objects located in the galaxy is considered. Possible overproduction of gamma rays from associated neutral pion production can be avoided if the site is optically thick to the photons but not to the antiprotons.
