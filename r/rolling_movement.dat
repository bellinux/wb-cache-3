25|$|The face-down {{swimming}} position {{allows for}} a good range of motion of the arm in the water, {{as compared to the}} backstroke, where the hands cannot be moved easily along the back of the spine. The above-water recovery of the stroke reduces drag, compared to the underwater recovery of breaststroke. The alternating arms also allow some <b>rolling</b> <b>movement</b> of the body for an easier recovery compared to, for example, butterfly. Finally, the alternating arm stroke makes for a relatively constant speed throughout the cycle.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{asymmetrical}} thrust {{has been}} used for directional control: if the left engine is idled and power is increased on the right side this will result in a yaw to the left, and vice versa. If throttle settings allow the throttles to be shifted without affecting the total amount of power, then yaw control can be combined with pitch control. If the aircraft is yawing, then the wing on the outside of this yaw movement will go faster than the inner wing. This creates higher lift on the faster wing, resulting in a <b>rolling</b> <b>movement,</b> which helps to make a turn.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1968, {{the port}} flap {{operating}} rod of G-AMAD, an Airspeed Ambassador operated by BKS Air Transport failed due to fatigue thereby allowing the port flaps to retract. This {{resulted in a}} <b>rolling</b> <b>movement</b> to port {{which could not be}} controlled during the approach, causing the aircraft to contact the grass and swerve towards the terminal building. It hit two parked British European Airways Hawker Siddeley Trident aircraft, burst into flames and came to rest against the ground floor of the terminal building. Six of the eight crew died, as did eight horses on board. Trident G-ARPT was written off, and Trident G-ARPI was badly damaged, but subsequently repaired, only to be lost in the Staines crash in 1972.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{sequence}} is in beat two: the grounded hind and foreleg are not diagonal pairs, but {{are on the same}} side of the horse (in this case, the outside). This means that the horse is balancing on only one side of its body, which is very difficult for the horse, making it hard to keep the animal balanced, rhythmical, and keeping impulsion. A horse that is cross-firing cannot perform to the best of its ability, and can even be dangerous (such as an unbalanced, cross-firing horse who must jump a huge, solid cross-country obstacle). Additionally, it makes for a very uncomfortable, awkward ride, producing a <b>rolling</b> <b>movement</b> often described as riding an eggbeater, which makes it difficult for the rider to perform to the best of his or her abilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the man-carrying machine known as a Rotachute, {{also known as a}} Hafner H.8, evolved from November 1940 and {{throughout}} 1941. In September 1941, the Central Landing Establishment was renamed the Airborne Forces Establishment. The Rotachute Mark I design initially comprised a tubular steel framework with a single seat, rubber-mounted rotor hub, hanging control column, skid undercarriage, and a self-inflating rear fairing made of rubberised fabric with integral tailplane. The two rotor blades, of wooden construction, could achieve flapping and coning characteristics via hinges on the rotor hub. Fixed footrests were provided, plus fittings below the seat to accommodate a soldier's weapon, such as a Bren gun. The control column offered two-axis control, rolling and pitching, with turns made via controlled <b>rolling</b> <b>movement.</b> Air Ministry Specification No. 11/42 was issued retrospectively to describe the outline requirements. The Ministry of Aircraft Production sub-contracted construction of parts to specialist firms including F. Hills and Sons, Airwork General Trading, Dynaflex, Dunlop, and H. Morris & Co. Some full size rotor trials were carried out using a pivoting rig mounted on a Ford flatbed truck, and full-size unmanned airframes were used in ground-based and inflight trials.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of sufferers have symptoms that involve the head, {{and the most}} common symptom is head banging. Usually, the head strikes a pillow or mattress near the frontal-parietal region. There is little cause for alarm at the movements as injury or brain damage {{as a result of}} the movements is rare. Some infants with diagnosed Costello Syndrome have been observed to have unique RMD episodes affecting the tongue and other facial muscles, which is an uncommonly affected area. Episodes usually last less than fifteen minutes and produce movements that vary from 0.5 to 2Hz. Muscle movements during REM sleep are often twitches and occur simultaneously with normal sleep. The position of the body during sleep may determine which motor symptom is displayed. For example, Anderson et al. reported that one individual showed entire body <b>rolling</b> <b>movements</b> while sleeping on his side while displaying head <b>rolling</b> <b>movements</b> when sleeping supine.|$|R

While the short-necked [...] "pliosauromorphs" [...] (e.g. Liopleurodon) may have been fast swimmers, the long-necked [...] "plesiosauromorphs" [...] were built more for manoeuvrability than for speed, slowed by a strong skin friction, yet capable of a fast <b>rolling</b> <b>movement.</b> Some long-necked forms, such as the Elasmosauridae, also have relatively short stubby flippers with a low aspect ratio, further reducing speed but improving roll.|$|E
60|$|At first I {{regarded}} {{little but}} the road before me, and then abruptly my attention {{was arrested by}} something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill. At first I took it for the wet roof of a house, but one flash following another showed it to be in swift <b>rolling</b> <b>movement.</b> It was an elusive vision--a moment of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red masses of the Orphanage near {{the crest of the}} hill, the green tops of the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright.|$|E
60|$|When {{an insect}} alights {{on the central}} disc, it is {{instantly}} entangled by the viscid secretion, and the surrounding tentacles after a time begin to bend, and ultimately clasp it on all sides. Insects are generally killed, according to Dr. Nitschke, in {{about a quarter of}} an hour, owing to their tracheae being closed by the secretion. If an insect adheres to {{only a few of the}} glands of the exterior tentacles, these soon become inflected and carry their prey to the tentacles next succeeding them inwards; these then bend inwards, and so onwards; until the insect is ultimately carried by a curious sort of <b>rolling</b> <b>movement</b> to the centre of the leaf. Then, after an interval, the tentacles on all sides become inflected and bathe their prey with their secretion, in the same manner as if the insect had first alighted on the central disc. It is surprising how minute an insect suffices to cause this action: for instance, I have seen one of the smallest species of gnats (Culex), which had just settled with its excessively delicate feet on the glands of the outermost tentacles, and these were already beginning to curve inwards, though not a single gland had as yet touched the body of the insect. Had I not interfered, this minute gnat would [page 17] assuredly have been carried to the centre of the leaf and been securely clasped on all sides. We shall hereafter see what excessively small doses of certain organic fluids and saline solutions cause strongly marked inflection.|$|E

50|$|Latibulus argiolus is a {{parasitoid}} {{which lies}} in {{wait in the}} near proximity of a Polistes paper wasp nest waiting for an opportunity for penetration and then, within a few seconds, lays an egg into a nest cell. The biology of the larva is unknown. There are two generations per year. The first emerges in the summer after pupation {{takes place in a}} yellowish cocoon within the cell; the second generation winters in a brown, resistant cocoon. The pupa of the second generation is able to break through the cell cover by making jerky movements.

5000|$|Because {{of their}} lack of limbs and other adjuncts, snakes are {{unlikely}} a group of vertebrates to develop. Although, in Peninsular Malaysia, there are three, closely related species of snakes with ability to glide for significant distances. These are the Tree Snakes (genus Chrysopelea). The flat, open body works like a parasail and its <b>rolling</b> <b>movements</b> in flight, similar to a spinning frisbee, prevents it from overturning. Before leaping, Tree Snakes hang the uncoiled forepart of their body off the branch in a [...] "like a J". Next, by shaking the body upward in tandem reaching outward by rapidly smoothing its coils and releasing, they’ll hold on the branch, the snakes take flight. They also enlarge their rib cage as a defense device to expose brightly colored markings on their scales.|$|R

60|$|And {{they are}} the prettiest attitudes and {{movements}} into which a pretty girl is thrown in making up butter--tossing movements that give a charming curve to the arm, and a sideward inclination of the round white neck; little patting and <b>rolling</b> <b>movements</b> {{with the palm of}} the hand, and nice adaptations and finishings which cannot at all be effected without a great play of the pouting mouth and the dark eyes. And then the butter itself seems to communicate a fresh charm--it is so pure, so sweet-scented; it is turned off the mould with such a beautiful firm surface, like marble in a pale yellow light! Moreover, Hetty was particularly clever at making up the butter; it was the one performance of hers that her aunt allowed to pass without severe criticism; so she handled it with all the grace that belongs to mastery.|$|R

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the FAA and other U.S. {{government}} agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), began studying the 757's wake turbulence characteristics.

Smaller airliners had also suffered unexpected <b>rolling</b> <b>movements</b> when flying behind 757s. Investigators focused on the aircraft's aft-loaded wing design, which at certain points during takeoff or landing could produce wingtip vortices that were stronger than those emanating from larger 767s and 747s. Other tests were inconclusive, leading to debate among government agencies, and in 1994 and 1996 the FAA updated air traffic control regulations to require greater separation behind the 757 than other large-category jets. The 757 became the only sub- airliner to be classified as a [...] "heavy" [...] jet, alongside wide-body aircraft, under FAA separation rules.|$|R
