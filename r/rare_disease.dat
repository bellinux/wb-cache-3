5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a <b>rare</b> <b>disease</b> among domesticated {{rats and}} {{is most often}} found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E

Many <b>rare</b> <b>diseases</b> appear early in life, and about 30 percent of children with <b>rare</b> <b>diseases</b> will die before reaching their fifth birthday.

5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of hypopituitarism vary, depending on which hormones are undersecreted and on the underlying cause of the abnormality. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is made by blood tests, but often specific scans and other investigations are needed to find the underlying cause, such as tumors of the pituitary, and the ideal treatment. Most hormones controlled by the secretions of the pituitary can be replaced by tablets or injections. Hypopituitarism is a <b>rare</b> <b>disease,</b> but may be significantly underdiagnosed in people with previous traumatic brain injury. The first description of the condition was made in 1914 by the German physician Dr Morris Simmonds.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Rare</b> <b>diseases</b> present unique {{challenges}} {{to meet the}} numerous and varied needs of the <b>rare</b> <b>diseases</b> community and it is required to identify and address these needs. Significant financial and personnel resources are required to address these needs identified. The Office of <b>Rare</b> <b>Diseases</b> Research (ORDR) at the USA National Institutes of Health (NIH) has attempted to meet many of these needs in collaborative efforts with the research Institutes and Centers of NIH and other partners in {{the private and public}} sectors in the USA and around the world. Several of the activities of the NIH and the ORDR are presented as possible collaborative efforts available to research investigators and include the <b>Rare</b> <b>Diseases</b> Clinical Research Network, the Bench-to-Bedside research program at NIH, the Genetic and <b>Rare</b> <b>Diseases</b> Information center, the genetic test development program, and the information on clinical research studies made available through Clinical trials. gov. The value of an appropriate family medical history is discussed as are the provisions of the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act of 2008 (GINA). Definitions of <b>rare</b> or orphan <b>diseases</b> vary from country to country and may cause some confusion to the <b>rare</b> <b>diseases</b> community. Conclusions: <b>Rare</b> <b>diseases</b> are not limited by geographical or historical boundaries and global partnerships of the <b>rare</b> <b>diseases</b> community are experiencing rapid expansion to assist in the development of orphan products for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of <b>rare</b> <b>diseases</b> and conditions.

25|$|TSC {{occurs in}} all races and ethnic groups, {{and in both}} genders. The live-birth {{prevalence}} {{is estimated to be}} between 10 and 16 cases per 100,000. A 1998 study estimated total population prevalence between about 7 and 12 cases per 100,000, with more than half of these cases undetected. These estimates are significantly higher than those produced by older studies, when TSC was regarded as an extremely <b>rare</b> <b>disease.</b> This is due to the invention of CT and ultrasound scanning having enabled the diagnosis of many nonsymptomatic cases. Prior to this, the diagnosis of TSC was largely restricted to severely affected individuals with Vogt's triad of learning disability, seizures, and facial angiofibroma. The total population prevalence estimates have steadily increased from 1:150,000 in 1956, to 1:100,000 in 1968, to 1:70,000 in 1971, to 1:34,200 in 1984, to the present figure of 1:12,500 in 1998.

MethodsSystematic literature searches without meta-analyses and internal European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network (ECRIN) communications during face-to-face meetings and telephone conferences from 2013 to 2017 {{within the context of the}} ECRIN Integrating Activity (ECRIN-IA) project.
