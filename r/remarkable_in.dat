5|$|An unusual ion {{containing}} xenon is the tetraxenonogold(II) cation, , {{which contains}} Xe–Au bonds. This ion {{occurs in the}} compound , and is <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> having direct chemical bonds between two notoriously unreactive atoms, xenon and gold, with xenon acting as a transition metal ligand.|$|E
5|$|E. rabborum was <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> {{that the}} males {{appeared}} to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled {{water of the}} tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, rasping small pieces of skin from their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it {{was similar to the}} way some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E
5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E

5|$|The 1897–8 {{season at}} Newport saw the {{beginning}} of a 'historic' partnership at half-back between Phillips and Llewellyn Lloyd that lasted till 1901. Phillips and Lloyd were thought of as a pair, both playing along similar lines and sharing the work of scrum-half and outside-half. While Lloyd was a smarter runner, Phillips was a better kick, but both of them could drop goals, and were <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> their kicks to touch.|$|E

Schmeichel stated his wish to activate a contract option of a further year at Sporting in January 2001, but eventually decided to leave the club when his contract expired in June 2001.|$|E

25|$|Larger scale works {{included}} his orchestral piece Iberia (1907), a triptych {{medley of}} Spanish allusions and fleeting impressions which was begun {{as a work}} for two pianos, and also the music for Gabriele D'Annunzio's mystery play Le Martyre de saint Sébastien (1911). A lush and dramatic work, written in only two months, it is <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> sustaining a late antique modal atmosphere that was otherwise touched only in relatively short piano pieces.|$|E
25|$|In the British Raj in 1880, the façades of the 1777 Writers' {{building}} in Kolkata were redesigned in the Renaissance Revival style then popular in colonial India, though this version was <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> its unique design. Loggias of Serlian arches deceptively form an almost Indian appearance, yet they sit beneath a Mansard roof. In what {{at first glance}} appears an Indian building, on closer examination shows a Historicist example of Classical Palladianism combined with the French Renaissance, a uniquely distinctive interpretation of the Renaissance Revival style.|$|E
25|$|Though George's 4:12¾ was impressive, he ran {{some time}} trials in 1885 which were truly <b>remarkable.</b> <b>In</b> the first, {{two weeks before}} his {{professional}} debut against Cummings, he ran a 4:14½. Then, in Surbiton several days before the big race, he ran against some local runners with handicaps. His splits were 58, 1:58 and 3:07. He finished in a startling 4:10. Not believing their watches, the track was immediately measured. He had run six yards too far. No man would run the mile faster until 1931.|$|E

25|$|Despite Burney's criticism, fellow music {{historian}} Sir John Hawkins {{thought they}} 'succeeded so well … {{as to make}} from it a book of lessons which few could play but himself, and which has long been deservedly celebrated.' Babell's transcription of arias from Handel's opera Rinaldo includes 'Vo' far guerra', which Handel intended as a showpiece for his harpsichord playing and is quite <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> its virtuosity; Babell's transcription was made from his memory of how Handel improvised in performances. In 1894, Friedrich Chrysander published Babell's piano reduction of Rinaldo in the Händel-Gesellschaft volume 48.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time since the Renaissance, urban {{planning}} was designed to renew the city in its entirety. There was a clear break with earlier developments which had produced works of great artistic value but which were separated from each other and often built on the initiative of private individuals. The city's development was now rationally planned on the basis of strict criteria, always under the supervision of the Ornato Committee. Some of the works are <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> their own right for their high artistic or cultural value.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} natural {{geologic}} barriers to isolate radioactive waste {{is demonstrated by}} the natural nuclear fission reactors at Oklo, Africa. During their long reaction period about 5.4 tonnes of fission products as well as 1.5 tonnes of plutonium together with other transuranic elements were generated in the uranium ore body. This plutonium and the other transuranics remained immobile until the present day, a span of almost 2 billion years. This is quite <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> {{view of the fact}} that ground water had ready access to the deposits and they were not in a chemically inert form, such as glass.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} retail sales {{enterprises}} also expanded {{rapidly in the}} 1980s. In 1985 there were 10.7 million retail, catering, and service establishments, a rise of 850 percent over 1976. Most <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> the expansion of retail sales was the rapid rise of collective and individually owned retail establishments. Individuals engaged in businesses numbered 12.2 million in 1985, more than 40 times the 1976 figure. Furthermore, as state-owned businesses either were leased or turned over to collective ownership or were leased to individuals, the share of state-owned commerce in total retail sales dropped from 90.3 percent in 1976 to 40.5 percent in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Then, after a 6 years break, {{which only}} saw the {{publication}} of L'accélérateur atomique, a Spirou spoof by Lewis Trondheim {{not included in the}} official series (but which received Dupuis' approval), the series went back to a more classical storytelling mode with seasoned cartoonists Jean-David Morvan (writing) and José-Luis Munuera (art). The latter kept close to the spirit of Franquin's graphical style, while bringing its own touch of manga-inspired modernism. Morvan and Munuera's Spirou is partly <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> that it uses background elements and secondary characters from the whole history of the title, and not just from Franquin's period.|$|E
25|$|Around 2000 BC, the Magyar tribes {{moved along}} the {{recently}} established trade routes of the steppes, gradually {{leading them to}} the Carpathian Basin in Hungary which they conquered in 896 A.D. With them came Kuvasz-type dogs, which primarily served as livestock guardians. In 1978, the fossilized skeleton of a 9th Century Kuvasz-type dog was discovered in Fenékpuszta near Keszthely, a discovery which was <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> that the morphology of the skeleton was almost identical to a modern Kuvasz. If accurate, such a discovery would mark the Kuvasz as among the oldest identifiable dog breeds as only a few breeds can be dated beyond the 9th Century.|$|E

25|$|Bas-reliefs {{created from}} {{perforated}} stone slabs are another hallmark of Early Dynastic sculpture. They also served a votive purpose, but their exact function is unknown. Examples include the votive relief of king Ur-Nanshe of Lagash and his family, found at Girsu, {{and that of}} Dudu, a priest of Ningirsu. The latter showed mythological creatures like a lion-headed eagle. The Stele of the Vultures, created by Eannatum of Lagash, is <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> that it represents different scenes that together tell the narrative of the victory of Lagash over its rival Umma. Reliefs like these {{have been found in}} Lower Mesopotamia and the Diyala region, but not in Upper Mesopotamia or Syria.|$|E
25|$|Making his {{comeback}} to Romania in October 1894, Iorga {{settled in the}} capital city of Bucharest. He changed residence several times, until eventually settling in Grădina Icoanei area. He agreed to compete in a sort of debating society, with lectures which only saw print in 1944. He applied for the Medieval History Chair at the University of Bucharest, submitting a dissertation in front of an examination commission comprising historians and philosophers (Caragiani, Odobescu, Xenopol, alongside Aron Densușianu, Constantin Leonardescu and Petre Râșcanu), but totaled a 7 average which only entitled him to a substitute professor's position. The achievement, at age 23, was still <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> its context.|$|E
25|$|The more settled {{land-based}} West Coast Bajau are expert equestrians – {{which makes}} them <b>remarkable</b> <b>in</b> Malaysia, where horse riding has never been widespread anywhere else. The traditional costume of Sama-Bajau horsemen consists of a black or white long-sleeved shirt (badu sampit) with gold buttons (betawi) {{on the front and}} decorated with silver floral designs (intiras), black or white trousers (seluar sampit) with gold lace trimmings, and a headpiece (podong). They carry a spear (bujak), a riding crop (pasut), and a silver-hilted keris dagger. The horse is also caparisoned with a colourful outfit called kain kuda that also have brass bells (seriau) attached. The saddle (sila sila) is made from water buffalo hide, and padded with cloth (lapik) underneath.|$|E
