40|$|Purpose. Inspection and {{observation}} of the technical level of rail locomotive repair productions are conducted by the management team of the Department and the Locomotive division, audit sectors, expert groups within the production certification procedure. The faults revealed are fixed as linguistic expert reports which cannot assess their significance and identify priorities in terms of elimination. The paper aimed the development of methods for the conformance rating for locomotive repair production to legal requirements with conformance level determination. Methodology. Formalization of linguistic reports on the locomotive repair facility conformance {{takes into account the}} influence of a whole number of factors, their significance being determined by the expert assessment, formalized models of events when designing and analyzing the fault tree. In order to calculate the conformance, index the triple additive convolution with the weight coefficient is proposed. Investigation into interrelation between the integral index and the locomotive maintenance costs was conducted by methods of the correlation and regression analysis. Findings. The analysis of <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> {{and observation}} of the technical level of locomotive repair productions demonstrated a similar structure of expert reports on faults, which made it possible to present them as a vector. While transforming a multi-criterion problem into a single-criterion one of the most objective method, the weighted sum method, was applied. The conformance indices were calculated according to the results of observations on several locomotive repair productions. The correlation and regression analysis proved the influence of the conformance index of locomotive repair productions on locomotive maintenance overconsumption. Originality. The conformance rating methods for a technical level of locomotive repair productions based on linguistic expert reports which consider type of the fault detected, type of the technological process, type of the locomotive unit and type of the technical level of production have been designed. Practical value. Implementation of the methods designed will help undertake assessment of the faults detected, eliminate them according to the priority and invest more effectively in locomotive repair productions. The regressive equations obtained allow standardizing the conformance index and forecasting possible locomotive maintenance overconsumption by the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> at repair productions...|$|E

The technique found successful applications for surface crack detection in various industrial branches, with the general aim of searching for alternatives to magnetic particle or liquid penetrant testing. Due to its fast and contactless operation this nondestructive thermographic testing technique shows a high potential for the fully automated testing of steel components. This contribution presents a prototype application of induction thermography in surface crack inspection of railway wheels. The flexibility of camera based solutions and the proven sensitivity of induction thermography to surface defects are {{the basis for a}} demonstrator for thermographic testing developed in Fraunhofer IZFP. In connection with the infrared camera and the inductor moved by a robot, fully automated testing of complex shapes is performed. A proper combination of signal and image processing algorithms allows automated and robust defect detection.

40|$|This {{project is}} based on Artificial Intelligence (A. I) and Digital Image {{processing}} (I. P) for automatic condition monitoring of sleepers in the railway track. Rail inspection {{is a very important}} task in railway maintenance for traffic safety issues and in preventing dangerous situations. Monitoring railway track infrastructure is an important aspect in which the periodical inspection of rail rolling plane is required. Up to the present days the inspection of the railroad is operated manually by trained personnel. A human operator walks along the railway track searching for sleeper anomalies. This monitoring way is not more acceptable for its slowness and subjectivity. Hence, it is desired to automate such intuitive human skills for the development of more robust and reliable testing methods. Images of wooden sleepers have been used as data for my project.

Materials and methods: Observational, cross-sectional method; using a validated survey. It was self-supplied via web. Per­spective practice, knowledge degree, comfort level, perspective relevance and appropriateness of the respondents (doctors) in palliative care were assessed. General characteristics, reliability and scores per item and domain were described. Results: 145 physicians, mostly males, were surveyed, most of them with 0 - 5 years of professional practice and working in the emergency department (51. 03 %). Appropriate reliability coefficients were found; overall level of attitudes and knowledge of palliative care was 59. 09 points out of 100; lowest score domains were the prospects suitabil­ity (40. 73 points) and practice (47. 04 points).
