40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for {{detecting}} <b>rounds</b> <b>and</b> fillets in engineering sketches and drawings, and automatically generating a 3 D model of the corresponding object, with <b>rounds</b> <b>and</b> fillets applied. This method is useful both {{as a component of}} computer-aided sketching tools and in determining de- sign intent—although <b>rounds</b> <b>and</b> fillets are common in engineering parts, they often conceal design intent, which is more easily determined from the object’s underlying polyhedral skeleton...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to evaluate the performance of <b>rounded</b> <b>and</b> backed books against books left square backed. The variables which are introduced into the study will enable the results to provide needed information on the performance of the many different binding constructions librarians and library binders are confronted with. <b>Rounding</b> <b>and</b> backing is an optional operation when binding a book, an operation which is sometimes by-passed on smaller books. A book that is not <b>rounded</b> <b>and</b> backed is square backed. It is suspected that <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> backing a book will indeed enhance its performance and durability, therefore guaranteeing more circulations and a longer life. The books were tested in the Dudley A. Weiss Book Testing Laboratory at Rochester Institute of Technology. The testing procedures used, the Tumble Tester and the Universal Book Tester, were designed to accelerate simulated book usage. During the destructive testing, visual observations were made at progressive time intervals {{to determine the effects of}} <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> backing versus square backed, thus answering all the questions stated in the objectives section in Chapter 2. Upon the completion of all testing, the observations were summarized to determine what effect <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> backing had on the performance of the books. Many very interesting observations were made. When <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> backing a book, the ridge that is formed when bending the pages or signatures over one-another, does indeed provide added support to the joint strength and the binding. However; to assure the best possible performance of a <b>rounded</b> <b>and</b> backed book, it is important that a uniform layer of joint adhesive is applied. A book lacking good joint adhesion will destruct much faster than a book guaranteed to have optimum joint adhesion, whether <b>rounded</b> <b>and</b> backed or square backed...|$|R

Liverpool's matches were mainly all close affairs; they beat defending champions Barcelona on the away goals rule in the first knockout <b>round</b> <b>and</b> beat Chelsea in a penalty shootout in the semi-finals, although they did record a 4–0 aggregate win over PSV Eindhoven in the quarter-finals.|$|E
