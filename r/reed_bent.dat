60|$|A mist {{came before}} Caleb's eyes {{and in it}} across the years he saw himself a boy again. There he stood, his rod of <b>reed</b> <b>bent</b> double and the thin line {{strained}} almost to breaking, while on the waters of Jordan a great fish splashed and rolled.|$|E
60|$|Clatter, clatter, thud, thud,--the {{man with}} the silver bridle rode, heedless of his direction, with his fearful face looking up now right, now left, and his sword arm ready to slash. And {{a few hundred yards}} ahead of him, with a tail of torn cobweb {{trailing}} behind him, rode the little man on the white horse, still but imperfectly in the saddle. The <b>reeds</b> <b>bent</b> before them, the wind blew fresh and strong, over his shoulder the master could see the webs hurrying to overtake...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{insulation}} materials produced from local renewable resources are increasingly used {{for two reasons}} – they are environmentally friendly and their manufacture requires less amount of energy. The most renewable resources include {{a wide variety of}} crop straw – barley, rye, wheat, triticale, etc. the thermal conductivity of which depends on their orientation to the product and structure of the same straw. For specimen composition, the straw stems of bulrush, <b>reeds,</b> <b>bent</b> and triticales were used, producing composites with the mass ratio of 1 : 1. The paper analyses the results of thermal conductivity tests on different stem composites of herbaceous plants. Thermal conductivity was investigated considering composition specimens such as bulrush-reeds, bulrush-bent, bulrush-straw, reed-straw, reed-bent. The use of composites in all cases reduced thermal conductivity compared with the thermal conductivity of materials used alone. The greatest reduction in thermal conductivity compared with the thermal conductivity of the single straws of herbaceous plants has been observed in bulrush-straw composites.

50|$|The true corset, {{called a}} vasquine in Spanish, {{arose in the}} first half of the 16th century in Spain. The fashion spread from there to Italy, and then to France and (eventually) England, where it was called a pair of bodies, being made in two parts which laced back and front. The corset was {{restricted}} to aristocratic fashion, and was a fitted bodice stiffened with <b>reeds</b> called <b>bents,</b> wood, or whalebone.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was running}} on a {{somewhat}} libertarian, self-described [...] "Reagan Conservative" [...] platform. Tingle is pro-life, in favor of gun rights, in favor of decriminalizing marijuana, in favor of abolishing the federal income tax, against amnesty for illegal immigrants, in favor of lowering the drinking age, opposed to the death penalty, and opposed to spending on the United Nations and international aid. Tingle has criticized Reed's liberal voting record in the Senate as being {{out of touch with}} blue-collar Rhode Islanders, taking particular issue with <b>Reed's</b> pro-choice <b>bent.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{dominant}} plant of {{the waters}} edge is reed canary grass running from the East round to the South and into the West side. Creeping <b>bent,</b> <b>reed</b> sweet grass and iris are abundant. Common water-crowfoot, chara species, Canadian waterweed, slender spike-rush, perfoliate pondweed and spiked water milfoil are the other main species present.|$|R
50|$|Valved diatonics {{are made}} by fitting windsavers on draw holes 1-6 and blow holes 7-10; this way, all <b>reeds</b> can be <b>bent</b> down a semitone at least, {{although}} most players can easily bend down a whole tone. Alternatively, one can simply buy a factory-made valved diatonic such as the Suzuki Promaster Valved.|$|R
6000|$|Footnote: 1. From this Epilogue we learn, what is {{confirmed}} by many proofs [...] elsewhere, that the attribute for which James desired to be [...] distinguished and praised, was that of openness of purpose, and [...] stern undeviating inflexibility of conduct. He scorned to disguise [...] his designs, either upon the religion or the constitution of his [...] country. He forgot {{that it was only}} the temporising concessions of [...] his brother which secured his way to the throne, when his [...] exclusion, or a civil war, seemed the only alternatives. His [...] brother was the <b>reed,</b> which <b>bent</b> before the whirlwind, and [...] recovered its erect posture when it had passed away; and James, the [...] inflexible oak, which the first tempest rooted up for ever.|$|R
6000|$|And {{at another}} time she said: [...] "My poor lord, Sir Launcelot! Him do I pity indeed, for God is like to chasten him before long, and to bend him and to bruise him {{as though he were}} a <b>reed</b> that was <b>bent</b> and bruised so that it may never be able to stand fully erect again. Yet even this mattereth but little; for the span of life is but very short, and all {{is in the hands of}} God." ...|$|R
50|$|Randle Cotgrave, in his Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues (1611), {{defined the}} French farthingale as “the kind of roll used by such women as weare no Vardingales.” Several {{wardrobe}} accounts and tailors' bills {{of the late}} 16th century {{give us an idea}} of what these rolls were made of: they were stuffed with cotton and rags, and stiffened with hoops of whalebone, wire or ropes made of <b>bent</b> <b>reeds.</b> Buckram (stiff canvas) is the most commonly mentioned material. Other references describe the rolls being starched.|$|R
60|$|They {{let it go}} {{and talked}} about Jim's plans as they crossed the short grass where the silver-weed spread its carpet of yellow flowers. They trampled through belts of {{withered}} thrift and skirted winding creeks where tall <b>reeds</b> shook their <b>bent</b> leaves in the searching wind. Light and shadow sped across the marsh, and a flock of plover, shining white and black, circled above the sands. Jake {{got a sense of}} space and loneliness he had not expected to feel in England, but he smiled as he noted Jim's brisk step and the sparkle in his eyes. He knew his comrade and saw he was happy. The marsh was something to conquer and the struggle would absorb his energies.|$|R
50|$|Discussing UFO {{sightings}} {{and crop}} circles that appeared near Riolândia, São Paulo in January 2000, {{he said that}} the <b>bent</b> <b>reeds</b> were not evidence. What counted was the appearance of discoidal objects.In 2002, Gevaerd investigated crop circles in the fields of Alton Barnes in southern England, 30 km from the resort of Avebury. He speculated that the circles and other designs in the British fields represented some kind of coded message.In November 2008, crop circles were found in the west of Santa Catarina. Gevaerd investigated the circles, which he said were similar to crop circles he had investigated in Europe, starting with fields located some 150 miles from London.Later he found that they were fraudulent. He said they differed in significant respects from genuine crop circles, and there was evidence of fabrication.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new thermal insulation materials needs to evaluate properties and structure of raw material, technological factors that make influence on the thermal conductivity of material. One {{of the most promising}} raw materials for production of insulation material is straw. The use of natural fibres in insulation is closely linked to the ecological building sector, where selection of materials is based on factors including recyclable, renewable raw materials and low resource production techniques In current work results of research on structure and thermal conductivity of renewable resources for production thermal insulating materials are presented. Due to the high abundance of renewable resources and a good its structure as raw material for thermal insulation materials barley straw, <b>reeds,</b> cattails and <b>bent</b> grass stalks are used. Macro- and micro structure analysis of these substances is performed. Straw bales of these materials are used for determining thermal conductivity. It was found that the macrostructure has the greatest effect on thermal conductivity of materials. Thermal conductivity of material is determined by the formation of a bale due to the large amount of pores among the stalks of the plant, inside the stalk and inside the stalk wall.
