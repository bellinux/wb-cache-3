40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to test the {{received}} explanations of the determinants of bid/ask spreads for common equity securities. This thesis employs trade-to-trade data for twenty-four securities listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) over the period from August, 1988 through December, 1992. The literature is extended by simultaneously modelling the cost components (inventory, asymmetric information, fixed, and search costs) and volatility of realized bid/ask spreads using an exponential autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (EARCH) framework. Because certain small trades on the TSE are auto-filled, <b>registered</b> <b>traders</b> do not always {{make a decision on}} trade involvement [...] some trades are non-discretionary. The theoretical model of spreads used in this thesis extends Glosten and Harris 2 ̆ 7 (52) (GH) model by distinguishing between non-discretionary (auto-filled) and discretionary trades to allow testing for differences in cost structures. Determination of the relative contribution of the various cost components is also based on GH.;The contributions of this thesis are threefold: (1) the costs of trading are dependent on the trade type [...] auto-filled versus discretionary; (2) the volatility of realized spreads is modelled as an exponential autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic (EARCH) process which is a function of information flow; and (3) richer, more exact intra-daily data is used to eliminate problems currently recognized in the literature. The primary conclusions are: (1) for non-discretionary trades, the average cost per share per trade is dollar 0. 0683 of which 96 % is due to fixed costs and 4 % is an asymmetric information cost; (2) for discretionary trades, the average cost is {dollar 0. 0273 of which 76...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project examines {{the link between}} social media {{and its effect on}} stock exchanges and movement of stocks. The study uses Twitter as its primary social media platform and focuses on its effect on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The study examines various forms of social media and micro-blogging sites in its attempt to provide a thorough understanding of the role of social media within the market. In line with its exploration of social media, the study analyses User-Generated Content, Sentiment Analysis and the impact of Word-of-Mouth. A brief explanation of Algorithmic Trading, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, and the Adaptive Market Hypothesis is also provided. The information used to show the relationship between Twitter and the JSE was extracted using a quantitative survey answered by <b>registered</b> <b>traders</b> on the JSE. The survey aimed to ascertain the level of information pertaining to stock movement posted to the platform by these traders, and how these traders used that same information to make trading decisions. The results of the study show that Twitter and other micro-blogging sites have a level of determination in stock exchanges. This study shows that traders make some use of online information to inform their trading decisions on the Stock Market. The validity of this online information {{stems from the fact that}} traders place trust in other people and other users’ experience, as proven by Word of Mouth. The findings of this study were contrary to the researchers’ expectation that Twitter was widely used as an informant for trade decisions. What is deduced from the available findings is that while Twitter and other social media platforms do to some extent provide information for traders on the JSE in making trade decisions, it is not a wide-spread basis for movement of shares.

40|$|Department of Geography, 94 p. HF 5459. 6. K 4 N 4 2009 The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine socio-economic characteristics of street trading activities and determine their sustainable management practices by local authority and other stakeholders. Urban planning and its associated paradigms, and state intervention measures directly affect sustainability of street trading. Street trading activities are further shaped by sociodemographic attributes of street traders, political, economic and geographic variables in urban environment. Studies have only managed to exaggerate the uncertainties involved in using the institutional, fiscal and legal framework in explaining crises of street trading management in urban centres. This study was accomplished by pursuing the following specific objectives: examining the profiles of street trading activity, assessing the mode of street trading governance and response of other stakeholders, determining the perception and attitudes of stakeholders towards street trading activities and analysing how stakeholders' concern and government regulations impact on the viability of street trading activities. The hypotheses were tested using both chi-square and descriptive analysis. Apart from the second hypothesis, the other three were rejected based on the significant differences observed on the findings. Both primary and secondary data were collected using questionnaires, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. A sample size of 120 respondents was considered and the respondents were drawn from; street traders, local government officials, and other stakeholders in street trading business. Descriptive and inferential techniques were used to analyse data and it involved calculation of means, frequencies, percentages and chi-square test. Qualitative analysis based on study themes was done to determine mode of governance and various institutional responses to street trading. The study established that education level, gender and starting capital were crucial factors in determining profitability of street trading activities. Although most of the street traders (37. 1 %) sell foodstuffs, it was found that monthly returns from food selling activities were very low compared to other street trading activities. Investigations on governance mode of street trading activities revealed that dealing with street traders is a difficult task and this was attributed to the ever-increasing number of street traders, hostility between traders and local authority, and inability to <b>register</b> <b>traders</b> by local authority. The greatest setback to good governance of street trading activities was lack of collaboration between stakeholders, and inability to solicit divergent views. Qualitative analysis showed that policies on street trading are not clearly barked by action to improve the profitability of street trading activities. Absence of an organized institutional body was noted as a major drawback in addressing the plight of street traders. Most stakeholders (67. 8 %) believed that street trading activities are viable and lucrative in providing jobs and social safety nets to many urban households. They identified sanitation, garbage generation, obstruction, and undignified behaviour of street traders as major challenges. The study recommends intervention measures that can enhance the profitability of street trading activities. They include policies on livelihood options for low-income urban residents and dialogue between various stakeholders on sustainable management of street trading activities. The study, further, recommends need to foster working partnership between street traders, other stakeholders and the officials of local authorities as one way of sustainable management of street trading activities.

40|$|Thesis (M. T. R. P.) -University of Natal, 2003. The {{deterioration}} of the Central Business Distict (CBD) cities worldwide is a problem which has been extensively documented. As upmarket shops and offices have located to more attractive shopping centres and office parks in decentralised locations, the economic turnover of central city areas has decreased. This has resulted in impaired maintenance and a subsequent {{deterioration of}} the visual quality of these areas. Various approaches towards improving the public infrastructure, pedestrian environment, visual appeal and economic value of Central Business Districts (CBD's) have been taken in different countries. They include full pedestrianisation of CBD streets, traffic calming measures, general physical improvements to the public realm such as new street furniture and street surfacing, new public transportation systems and new municipal by-laws, to regulate the behaviour of CBD users. The CBD's of cities in South Africa have suffered a similar fate {{to a greater or}} lesser extent. Of particular significance in the South African context, is the increasing presence of informal traders along street sidewalks in the CBD. The CBD is also used by an increasing number of pedestrians. In the case of Durban, a combination of uncontrolled street trading and increased pedestrian movement has lead to a situation of congestion on many CBD street sidewalks. In addition, ill-disciplined taxi and bus drivers have contributed to traffic congestion. This is detrimental for <b>registered</b> street <b>traders,</b> formal retailers, pedestrians, motorists and future investors in the CBD. The aim of this dissertation is to examine and evaluate the West Street Pilot Project in Durban, as a means of revitalising a section of its CBD, and solving the above mentioned problems. The West Street Pilot Project (WSPP) has attempted to ease pedestrian flow by widening the sidewalks and creating nibs or "nodes" for the purpose of street trading. Certain of these nodes have been formed at pedestrian crossings, shortening the crossing distance. It has attempted to improve the aesthetic appeal of the street, by introducing new planting and street furniture and making this part of the CBD hard core more "user-friendly"...|$|R

40|$|In the London of August 1914, {{there was}} no {{statutory}} regulation of share trading. By the beginning of 1946, only <b>traders</b> <b>registered</b> {{in accordance with the}} Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1939 were permitted to engage in share trading between members of the public. This study examines the stages by which share trading in the United Kingdom came to be a statutorily regulated activity and by which the London Stock Exchange moved from being antagonistic towards public regulation in 1914 to lobbying in 1944 for the new scheme to be implemented. A number of challenges were posed by changes in the character of the demand for and supply of securities which were evident before 1914 but hastened by the 1914 - 1918 war. There {{is no evidence that the}} Exchange, its members or outside observers understood how these changes would affect the overall character of the market or its sensitivity to risk. Almost all regulatory interventions between 1914 and 1945 responded to crises which exposed the failure of existing arrangements to cope with the consequences of market changes. Whilst these interventions show that self-regulatory arrangements could be effective, they also demonstrate the limitations of reliance on self-regulation alone. Although the Exchange’s members supported severe action after the crashes of 1929, the criminal justice system again proved inadequate to deal with abusive share trading generally. The 1939 legislation responded to the criminal justice system’s failure and, for the Exchange, was made palatable by protecting its formal independence. Each successive regulatory intervention in part responded to compromises in previous interventions occasioned by the need to secure acceptance by market operators. ...|$|R
40|$|I present three {{essays in}} this thesis. The first essay investigates the {{decision}} of small businesses with respect to an optional Flat Rate Scheme (FRS) in the UK. FRS replaces VAT with a turnover tax providing some traders with a tax saving opportunity. Using the universe of VAT returns between 2004 - 05 and 2010 - 11, I find 26 percent of eligible traders have non-negative tax gains from FRS. I show gains are highly persistent and not so small, yet only 3 percent of gainers join the scheme after one year. Temporal and spatial correlations point to information frictions and learning as potential explanatory factors. Results show <b>traders</b> <b>registering</b> after introduction of FRS and those registering in high FRS density areas {{are more likely to}} join the scheme. The second essay estimates stimulus effect of the temporary reduction in the standard VAT rate in the UK. From 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009, the standard-rate was reduced from 17. 5 to 15 percent. I use the universe of VAT returns submitted to HMRC between 2002 and 2010 q 1 q 4 and compare changes in sales growth of standard-rated traders during the cut to that of zero-rated traders (difference-in-differences). To control for heterogeneous recession effects, I first rely solely on post-recession observations and utilize the fact that the cut and the recession don't fully overlap. Second, I allow for sector specific recession impacts. Both strategies show a small insignificant impact on gross sales and purchases which suggest a proportionate increase in quantity demanded in response to the tax induced price cut. The third essay estimates the impact of Iran Iraq war on educational attainment of children. I use a two percent sample of 2006 Iran Population Census, and compare exposed cohorts in war provinces to unexposed cohorts (difference-indifferences). The estimates suggest probability of finishing high school is respectively reduced by 4. 8 and 1. 9 percentage points for cohorts exposed to war in early childhood and those exposed during schooling (former significant at 10 percent, latter insignificant). Interestingly, the war impact on early childhood cohorts is robust to controlling for differential linear trends while the impact on school cohorts is not...|$|R
