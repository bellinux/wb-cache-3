The steel yard is equipped with 8 Goliath cranes and 2 mobiles cranes with vacuum lift attachments, 6 forklifts with multiple attachments to handle steel coils, slabs and plates, 1 <b>reach</b> <b>stacker</b> and 60 trailers for internal transportation.|$|E
25|$|Containers are {{transferred}} between rail, truck, and ship by container cranes at container terminals. Forklifts, <b>reach</b> <b>stackers,</b> straddle carriers, and cranes {{may be used}} to load and unload trucks or trains outside of container terminals. Swap bodys, sidelifters, tilt deck trucks, and hook trucks allow transfer to and from trucks with no extra equipment.|$|R
50|$|The yard has 3 rail-mounted {{quayside}} cranes (RMQCs) (arrived {{at the port}} in December 2011 from China), 15 rubber-tyred gantry cranes (RTGCs), two <b>reach</b> <b>stackers</b> and 420 reefer plug points. On 12 April 2012, the yard received Zhen Hua 20, a heavy lift vessel, with three more RMQCs to be installed at the second berth.|$|R
5000|$|The Port manages and {{operates}} a marine terminal complex where {{domestic and international}} ships and barges arrive and depart, and bulk, break bulk and project cargos are loaded or unloaded by local labor union workers. Union workers operate lifting and moving equipment including cranes, forklifts and <b>reach</b> <b>stackers.</b> These workers belong to the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 21.|$|R
50|$|As the Sidelifter is {{suitable}} for travelling on general roads for large distances and able to quickly load and unload without additional equipment, it is often used for delivering and picking up shipping containers from within a commercial district. Although these can self load, they are more often loaded or unloaded at the port with a straddle carrier or <b>reach</b> <b>stacker.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chennai International Terminal Pvt Ltd (CITPL) is {{the second}} {{container}} terminal that started operations from 22 June 2009 with berths SCB1, SCB2 and SCB3. The build-operate-transfer facility, built {{at a cost of}} about US$110 million, is a joint venture between PSA International and Chennai-based Sical Logistics Ltd. With 35 ha of yard space and three berths with a total quay length of 832 m, the terminal offers an annual capacity of 1.5 million TEUs. With the addition of 4 post-Panamax quay cranes, capable of lifting two 20-ft containers per move, and 8 RTGs, it now has 7 rail-mounted quay crane (RMQC), 18 RTGs, 6 <b>reach</b> <b>stacker</b> and 120 reefer plugs. Once fully commissioned, CITPL would be able to accommodate 8,000-TEU vessels with drafts up to 15.5 m.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 Konecranes {{launched}} the world's first hybrid <b>reach</b> <b>stacker</b> for container handling. Its lifting capacity is 45 tons {{and it will}} cut fuel consumption by around 10 litres per hour. In March 2013 Konecranes launched a Remote Monitoring and Reporting tool, TRUCONNECT. It allows lift truck operators to track the usage, efficiency and productivity of their lift trucks through a remote connection. The data is transmitted wirelessly to the Konecranes Remote Data Center, where it is analysed and compiled in online views and reports, accessible 24/7 through a password-protected customer portal. In June 2013, Konecranes launched a new Automated RTG (ARTG) system. It copes with wide range of surface variations in RTG container yards. In November 2013, Konecranes developed an auto start-stop feature that turns off the lift truck engine when it idles {{for a period of}} time. This function helps reduce fuel consumption by 5-15% along with CO2 emissions. In 2013 Konecranes got a contract to deliver the first automated container yard for Indonesia state owned terminal operator, Indonesia Port Corporations, PT Pelabuhan Indonesia III (Pelindo III). The value of the order, which consists of 10 ship-to-shore (STS) cranes, 20 automated stacking cranes (ASC) and five straddle carriers (SC), is thought to be more than €100M.|$|E
50|$|Kuantan Port has {{containers}} {{handling equipment}} and machineries such as container gantry cranes, rubber tyred gantry cranes, <b>reach</b> <b>stackers,</b> container trailers and forklifts. It provides a container freight station of 9,600 square metres for the stuffing and unstuffing of containers and a container yard with 1,500 ground slots and 168 reefer points. Kuantan Port container yard offers {{one of the}} longest free storage period in Malaysia.|$|R

Complete range of cranes (crawler, telescopic, truck lattice and all-terrain), hydraulic axles and self-propelled modular transporters (SPMTs), strand jacks, trailers (low bed, semi low bed and high bed), fork-lifts and <b>reach</b> <b>stackers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2002, KCI Konecranes {{made history}} in China: {{it was the}} first foreign crane company to receive a {{complete}} range of business licensees (including import and export). Also in Japan a milestone was achieved by establishing a joint venture agreement with Meidensha Corporation. After an acquisition of Swedish SMV Lifttrucks AB in 2004 <b>reach</b> <b>stackers</b> and lift trucks were added to the product range. A year later, KCI Konecranes acquired German R.STAHL AG's material handling division, R.Stahl Fördertechnik and the following year MMH Holdings, Inc.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{focuses on}} the global energy flow {{analysis}} along the three main energy lines of an off-highway vehicle used on port areas called a <b>reach</b> <b>stacker.</b> In order to characterize the energy consumption of the power train and the actuation system, {{a model of the}} machine has been established using the bond graph methodology. This language is suitable for representing multi domains energy transfers and allows the determination of the needed energy for an actuator to perform a given task. The simulation results are then compared with measurements carried out on a real <b>reach</b> <b>stacker.</b> Those data help to identify several parameters like friction coefficients and efficiencies. The energy flow analysis also gives detailed information on the main energy losses sources which prefigures coming evolutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{report is}} about {{reducing}} the Eigen {{weight of a}} <b>reach</b> <b>stacker</b> {{in order to obtain}} decreased fuel consumption. The detail the product development treats is the telescopic boom. By using steel of higher strength the dimension can be decreased, which in turn results in a reduced weight. Suitable steel for the application might be the high strength structural steel of designation S 690 QL. With support of calculations and CAD simulations the possible weight reduction is assumed to amount to 28 %...|$|E
30|$|The {{efficiency}} {{and effectiveness of}} rail freight services is largely dependent on the {{efficiency and}} effectiveness of terminals, marshalling yards along the transport chain, and feeder transports. Transhipment in terminals is traditionally performed vertically, {{using a variety of}} equipment, such as Transtainer (gantry crane), <b>Reach</b> <b>Stacker,</b> Straddle carrier, or Fork lift. With this type of equipment, a container is lifted from a train and moved to a stack yard, either for storage, or loading onto a truck, etc. Comparatively speaking, this vertical transhipment is costly, time consuming and incurs a higher risk of loss/damage to cargo. Moreover, 80  % of European trailers cannot be lifted, restricting market share.|$|E
50|$|Total {{container}} handling {{capacity of the}} five container terminals is 1,700 vessels a year. Operations are carried out by 4 quayside gantry cranes of 40 tons' capacity, 18 rubber-tired transtainers (40 tons' capacity), 9 <b>reach</b> <b>stackers</b> (25 to 42 tons) and 8 empty container forklifts (8 to 10 tons). Nine shore and yard cranes (3 to 35 tons), 6 mobile cranes (5 to 25 tons), 8 standard and 30 small-masted forklifts are also available. Another facility available at the terminal is the provision of reefer facilities for refrigerated containers.|$|R
50|$|The berths will be {{developed}} {{at a cost of}} $85 million over the course of 18 months. Under the agreement, India Ports Global will refurbish a 640 meter long container handling facility, and reconstruct a 600 meter long container handling facility at the port. India Ports Global will modernize ancillary infrastructure by installing four rail-mounted gantry cranes, sixteen rubber-tire gantry cranes, two <b>reach</b> <b>stackers,</b> two empty handlers, and six mobile harbor cranes. Upon completion of upgrade works agreed to in the May 2016 agreements, Chabahar's capacity will be increased to 8 million tons from the current 2.5 million ton capacity.|$|R
40|$|In many {{logistics}} processes, industrial trucks, e. g., forklifts and <b>reach</b> <b>stackers,</b> {{are used}} to move heavy load. Their usage often causes serious accidents, e. g., collisions of two trucks or trucks and persons. To {{reduce the risk of}} collisions, tracking systems can be integrated into a monitoring of logistics processes. Dynamically changing environments of logistics processes introduce special challenges including changing weather conditions and limited visibilities. In this paper, we describe our approach of a collision detection system based on an industrial radio-based real-time location system (RTLS) and evaluate its accuracy and usability in an application scenario including an outdoor storage of metallic objects...|$|R
