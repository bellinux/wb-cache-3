5|$|More than 11,000 years ago, prehistoric Native Americans lived {{along the}} Snake. Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned by the {{millions}} in the river. These fish were central {{to the lives of}} the people along the Snake below Shoshone Falls. By the time Lewis and Clark crossed the <b>Rockies</b> <b>and</b> sighted the valley of a Snake tributary, the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the most powerful peoples in the region. Some tribes adopted use of horses after contact with Europeans, which reshaped their hunting and cultures for the next few hundred years before outside settlement. Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin. At one point, a hand sign made by the Shoshones representing fish was misinterpreted to represent a snake, giving the Snake River its name.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez {{was signed}} by the Texas Rangers in 1996, as an infielder. After one season in their minor leagues, he was released.

He spent 2.5 years in their minor leagues before getting traded to the Colorado Rockies {{in the middle of the}} 2005 season. Shortly after the 2006 season started, Ramírez was called up by the <b>Rockies,</b> <b>and</b> he went on to have a successful rookie season for them. In 2007, he had an 8.31 ERA with the <b>Rockies</b> <b>and</b> spent time on the disabled list and in the minor leagues. Before the 2008 season, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals.

5|$|During El Niño events, {{increased}} precipitation {{is expected}} in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. During the Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern <b>Rockies</b> <b>and</b> Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is normal, and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its normal position, which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.|$|E

5|$|Even before non-aboriginal {{people came}} to the region, the Kootenay River valley was an {{important}} path of trade and transport between the tribes of the Canadian <b>Rockies</b> <b>and</b> the Idaho Panhandle, mostly between the Ktunaxa (who practiced agriculture and aquaculture) and the Salish, Blackfeet and Pend d'Oreilles {{of the south and}} east, and with the Shuswap in the north. The physiographic continuation of the Kootenai Valley southwards from present-day Bonners Ferry, Idaho into the Pend Oreille basin via the Purcell Trench formed a natural corridor through which natives of the area could interact. The barrier formed by the Rocky Mountains to the east, however, meant that tribes of the area, especially the Ktunaxa, were economically and linguistically isolated from the Great Plains tribes (with the exception of the Shoshone, whose territory spanned both sides of the Rockies).|$|E
5|$|From February 10 to 11, a low {{pressure}} system developed near the <b>Rockies</b> <b>and</b> moved towards the Great Plains of the United States.

It dumped over six inches (15cm) of snow across numerous areas from Iowa to New Brunswick, including major cities such as Akron, Detroit, Champaign-Urbana, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Springfield, Peoria, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Dayton, Toledo, Cincinnati, London, Hamilton, the Niagara Region, Toronto, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Trois-Rivières, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Rochester, Windsor, Syracuse and Albany. This also includes areas such as Northern Oswego County, New York, which received historic lake effect snowfall amounts in the week prior to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} fourth {{straight}} opening day {{start for the}} Dodgers in 2014, only the fourth Dodger ever to do so.

On June 18, he pitched a complete game no-hitter against the Colorado <b>Rockies</b> <b>and</b> struck out a career-high 15 batters. The only batter to reach base was due to an error in the top of the seventh inning, costing Kershaw a perfect game.

Kershaw was 6-0 with an 0.82 ERA in June and was awarded his third career Pitcher of the Month award.
