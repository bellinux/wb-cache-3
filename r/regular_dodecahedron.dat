5|$|The use of polyhedra {{to model}} heavenly bodies {{can be traced}} back to Plato, who in the Timaeus {{identified}} the <b>regular</b> <b>dodecahedron</b> with the shape of the heavens and its twelve faces with the constellations of the zodiac. Later, Johannes Kepler theorized that the distribution of distances of the planets from the sun could be explained by the shapes of the five Platonic solids, nested within each other. Escher kept a model of this system of nested polyhedra, and regularly depicted polyhedra in his artworks relating to astronomy and other worlds.|$|E

25|$|The tetrahedron, cube, and {{octahedron}} all occur {{naturally in}} crystal structures. These {{by no means}} exhaust the numbers of possible forms of crystals. However, neither the regular icosahedron nor the <b>regular</b> <b>dodecahedron</b> are amongst them. One of the forms, called the pyritohedron (named for the group of minerals {{of which it is}} typical) has twelve pentagonal faces, arranged in the same pattern as the faces of the <b>regular</b> <b>dodecahedron.</b> The faces of the pyritohedron are, however, not regular, so the pyritohedron is also not regular.|$|E

25|$|They can {{be further}} {{classified}} according to symmetry.

All phages known to that point had the form of <b>regular</b> <b>dodecahedrons</b> at 48 meters to a side.

25|$|An {{interesting}} polyhedron can {{be constructed}} from five intersecting tetrahedra. This compound of five tetrahedra {{has been known for}} hundreds of years. It comes up regularly in the world of origami. Joining the twenty vertices would form a <b>regular</b> <b>dodecahedron.</b> There are both left-handed and right-handed forms, which are mirror images of each other.|$|E
25|$|The tetrahedron, cube, and {{octahedron}} all {{occur as}} crystals. These {{by no means}} exhaust the numbers of possible forms of crystals (Smith, 1982, p212), {{of which there are}} 48. Neither the regular icosahedron nor the <b>regular</b> <b>dodecahedron</b> are amongst them, but crystals can have the shape of a pyritohedron, which is visually almost indistinguishable from a regular icosahedron. Truly icosahedral crystals may be formed by quasicrystalline materials which are very rare in nature but can be produced in a laboratory..|$|E
25|$|If {{a regular}} map {{is used to}} {{generate}} a clean dessin, and the resulting dessin is used to generate a triangulated Riemann surface, then {{the edges of the}} triangles lie along lines of symmetry of the surface, and the reflections across those lines generate a symmetry group called a triangle group, for which the triangles form the fundamental domains. For example, the figure shows the set of triangles generated in this way starting from a <b>regular</b> <b>dodecahedron.</b> When the regular map lies in a surface whose genus is greater than one, the universal cover of the surface is the hyperbolic plane, and the triangle group in the hyperbolic plane formed from the lifted triangulation is a (cocompact) Fuchsian group representing a discrete set of isometries of the hyperbolic plane. In this case, the starting surface is the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by a finite index subgroup Γ in this group.|$|E
50|$|The three {{dodecahedra}} are all stellations of the <b>regular</b> convex <b>dodecahedron,</b> and {{the great}} icosahedron is a stellation of the regular convex icosahedron. The small stellated dodecahedron {{and the great}} icosahedron are facettings of the convex dodecahedron, while the two great dodecahedra are facettings of the regular convex icosahedron.|$|R
3000|$|Another {{family of}} 3 D object {{retrieval}} approaches {{belongs to the}} frontier between 2 D and 3 D querying paradigms. For instance, the method in [32] is based on extracting and combining spherical 3 D harmonics with [...] " 2.5 D" [...] depth informations and the one in [15, 26] is based on selecting characteristic views and encoding them using the curvature scale space descriptor. Other [...] " 2.5 D" [...] approaches [11] are based on extracting rendered depth lines (as in [10, 30, 39]), resulting from vertices of <b>regular</b> <b>dodecahedrons</b> and matching them using dynamic programming. Authors in [12 – 14] proposed a 2 D method based on Zernike's moments that provides the best results on the Princeton Shape Benchmark [34]. In this method, rotation invariance is obtained using the light-field technique where all the possible permutations of several dodecahedrons are used in order to cover the space of viewpoints around an object.|$|R

2500|$|The {{exceptional}} regular polytopes in dimensions two, three, and four, {{correspond to}} other Coxeter groups. In two dimensions, the dihedral groups, {{which are the}} symmetry groups of regular polygons, form the series I2(p). In three dimensions, the symmetry group of the <b>regular</b> <b>dodecahedron</b> and its dual, the regular icosahedron, is H3, known as the full icosahedral group. [...] In four dimensions, there are three special regular polytopes, the 24-cell, the 120-cell, and the 600-cell.

Minerals with pentagonal faces do not have this element of symmetry, as the pyrite (FeS 2) which shows a ridge that is different from the other ones, in any face of the crystal. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate conceptual differences between pyritohedron and <b>regular</b> pentagonal <b>dodecahedron</b> symmetries, discussing students' difficulties to identify them.

50|$|A twelve-sided polygon is a dodecagon. A twelve-faced {{polyhedron}} is a <b>dodecahedron.</b> <b>Regular</b> {{cubes and}} octahedrons both have 12 edges, while regular icosahedrons have 12 vertices. Twelve is a pentagonal number. The densest three-dimensional lattice sphere packing has each sphere touching 12 others, {{and this is}} almost certainly true for any arrangement of spheres (the Kepler conjecture). Twelve is also the kissing number in three dimensions.|$|R
50|$|A cube can be {{embedded}} within a <b>regular</b> <b>dodecahedron,</b> affixed to eight of its equidistant vertices, in five different positions. In fact, five cubes may overlap and interlock inside the <b>regular</b> <b>dodecahedron</b> to result in the compound of five cubes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{small and}} great stellated dodecahedra, {{sometimes}} called the Kepler polyhedra, were first recognized as regular by Johannes Kepler in 1619. He obtained them by stellating the <b>regular</b> convex <b>dodecahedron,</b> {{for the first time}} treating it as a surface rather than a solid. He noticed that by extending the edges or faces of the convex dodecahedron until they met again, he could obtain star pentagons. Further, he recognized that these star pentagons are also regular. In this way he constructed the two stellated dodecahedra. Each has the central convex region of each face [...] "hidden" [...] within the interior, with only the triangular arms visible. Kepler's final step was to recognize that these polyhedra fit the definition of regularity, even though they were not convex, as the traditional Platonic solids were.|$|R

After the cube, the octahedron, and {{the various forms of}} pyramid and prism have been mastered, may come the more complex <b>regular</b> bodies--the <b>dodecahedron</b> and icosahedron--to construct which out of single pieces of cardboard, requires considerable ingenuity. From these, the transition may naturally be made to such modified forms of the regular bodies as are met with in crystals--the truncated cube, the cube with its dihedral as well as its solid angles truncated, the octahedron and the various prisms as similarly modified: in imitating which numerous forms assumed by different metals and salts, an acquaintance with the leading facts of mineralogy will be incidentally gained.[1] ...|$|R

50|$|For example, the <b>regular</b> small stellated <b>dodecahedron</b> has {{a sphere}} tangent to all faces, while a larger sphere {{can still be}} fitted inside the polyhedron.

Again, such authorities agree that the Archimedean polyhedra (having regular faces and equivalent vertices) have no inspheres while the Archimedean dual or Catalan polyhedra do have inspheres. But many authors fail to respect such distinctions and assume other definitions for the 'inspheres' of their polyhedra.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of chromium on the microstructure and impact toughness of high-pressure die-cast AlSi 9 Cu 3 (Fe) alloy was investigated systematically as {{the content of}} Cr was varied. The results indicate that, {{with the increase of}} Cr content, the area fraction of primary (sludge) and secondary (proeutectic) α-Alx(Fe,Mn,Cr) ySiz intermetallic compounds increase. Moreover, the sludge morphology evolves from polyhedral to branched or star-like shapes while the secondary Fe-rich particles seem to not be morphologically affected. The polyhedral sludge particles are associated to a <b>regular</b> rhombic <b>dodecahedron,</b> while the star-like and branched morphologies originate from hollowed rhombic dodecahedron.
