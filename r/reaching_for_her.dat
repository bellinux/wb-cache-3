[...] She is led and protected by a representation of France, and guided by illustrations of Night and Aurora. They are used literally to portray the actual time of the event and shield the queen from spectators as they illuminate her path. [...] Rubens painted a scene of the event in a more heroic nature rather than showing the accuracy of realistic elements. According to historical records of the Queen's escape, this painting is not truthfully reflecting {{the moment of the}} occurrence. Rubens did not include many of the negative aspects of the event, fearing that he would offend the Queen, which resulted in the paintings non-realistic nature. [...] The Queen Marie is depicted in a humble way, yet the illustration implies her power over the military. [...] She does not express any hardships she had gone through by the escape. [...] The male figures in foreground <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> are unknown. [...] The larger figures in the background represent the military, who were added to have a symbolic meaning of the Queen's belief in the command over military.|$|E

6000|$|... "A most {{necessary}} precaution, I should think," [...] Lady Caroom exclaimed, <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> vinaigrette, [...] "but do go {{and change}} your things {{as quickly as}} you can.|$|E
6000|$|... "So--help--me--God!" [...] he whispered, {{with blood}} thick in his voice. Then darkly, as one groping, he <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> with shaking hands. [...] "Y'u--y'u white-throated hussy!... I'll ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|The mother, {{reading the}} {{disappointment}} and suffering in Helen's white face, <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> tremulously and drew {{her to her}} bosom. [...] "Never mind what they say, Nellie; it was beautiful and it was true." ...|$|R

6000|$|Robina was {{quartered}} upon Geraldine in {{the holiday}} crowding of the house; and somewhere about four o'clock on the summer morning, Cherry, wakening as usual, and <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> book, heard {{a voice from the}} corner asking if she wanted anything. 'No, thank you, Bobbie. Go to sleep again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but I knew!" [...] murmured Lenore, {{lifting her}} head. His right hand, brown, bare, and rough, lay outside the coverlet upon his breast. It was weakly <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> Lenore {{took it in}} both hers, while she gazed {{steadily}} down into his eyes. She seemed to see then how he was comparing the image he had limned upon his memory with her face.|$|E
6000|$|At {{sight of}} her mother's hotel Virginia forgot every other building, every other object, and when the driver asked, respectfully, [...] "Where will {{you want to get}} off, miss?" [...] she did not reply, but rose unsteadily in her seat, blindly <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> bag and her wraps. Her slim, gray-robed figure, graceful even in her dismay, appealed to every onlooker, but Gregg was the one to offer a hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't walk any. Oh, I {{guess it}} will be all right when I get going again." [...] She tried to smile at him, and with the {{slowness}} of pain she <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> bundle.|$|R

60|$|With heroic {{and violent}} spirit Helen sat {{up to find}} that in the act her aches and pains {{appeared}} beyond number. <b>Reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> boots, she found them cold and stiff. Helen unlaced one and, opening it wide, essayed to get her sore foot down into it. But her foot appeared swollen and the boot appeared shrunken. She could not get it half on, though she expended what little strength seemed left in her aching arms. She groaned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Lucy, I told you," [...] he said, <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "He {{forced her}} to marry him. They had Lucy's father in jail. Dick got him out. Oh, {{it was all a}} scheme to work on the poor girl. She thought it was to save her father.... Why, Dick paid her father. I made him tell me... yes, Dick Hardman in his frock coat and high hat! But when I drove him out to get his gun, he forgot that high hat." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was in bed}} now, and lay {{looking around}} the room with {{speculative}} gaze. Beside her stood her wheeled chair, with its cushion of dark Spanish leather. The girl smiled and, <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> work-basket, which was on a stand {{at the head of the}} bed, she drew out a pair of scissors and cut some of the stitches of the leathern cushion. Then she tucked the letter carefully inside and with a needle and some black linen thread sewed up the place she had ripped open.|$|E
6000|$|MOTHER. [...] "Any life." [...] Even so! And then we {{can write}} to him quickly that we have taken our revenge quickly. [She <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> husband's rifle which she passes over to her son, who {{stretches}} his hand towards it with a glance at his father.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He ain't here," [...] replied Hanson. [...] "Leastwise I don't see him, do you? But I'm here, and I'm {{a damned}} sight better man than that thing ever was. You don't need him no more--you got me," [...] {{and he laughed}} uproariously and <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Carol <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> blouse, {{which hung}} on a chair by the bed. She draped it about her shoulders, and sat up {{studying}} Kennicott, her chin in her hands. In the gray light from the small electric bulb down the hall {{she could see that}} he was frowning.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it's late," [...] she said, <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> bag; [...] "but {{you know}} how you want a smoke when you want one. Ain't Rooney's all right? I never saw {{anything}} wrong here. This is twice I've been in. I work in a bookbindery on Third Avenue. A lot of us girls have been working overtime three nights a week. They won't let you smoke there, of course. I just dropped in here on my way home for a puff. Ain't it all right in here? If it ain't, I won't come any more." ...|$|E

5000|$|Virginia went to Hollywood at a {{young age}} to pursue a career in acting after winning a beauty pageant.

5000|$|... #Caption: Veronica <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> {{car keys}} as the Hearst serial rapist approaches. Director Harry Winer created the {{sequence}} with fast cutting and quick dissolves {{in order to}} give the episode a visually complex scene, an aspect of production which series creator Rob Thomasthought was often neglected on the show.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the slight}} sharp twing was repeated. It {{seemed to come}} from outside her flesh. She shivered a little, {{thinking}} it might be a centipede. When she <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> shoulder her hand came in contact with a slender stick that had been thrust through a crack between the boards. Jim was trying to rouse her. This had been his method on several occasions when she had fallen asleep after waiting long for him.|$|R

Ysabelle races up the Hallowed Oak to face Morwenna, who still has the silver acorn. But as she approaches her, the amulet around Morwenna's neck becomes extremely hot, burning her fur. It is then that Ysabelle realises that Hobb has begun {{to break through the}} ground. Ysabelle stares in horror while Morwenna is jubilant—that is, until she sees the claws of the rat god <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> The high priest merely cursed the wearer of the silver acorn, not Ysabelle in particular. Hobb blows fire onto Morwenna and she is killed.|$|E
5000|$|In a statement, Wells {{admitted}} swerving, {{saying she}} was <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> car heater controls. Wells lost a speaking engagement because of the incident. Later, Wells said, [...] "I think it is so hysterical that people went nuts over it. I am what, now, 102 years old? I get booked {{for the first time}} in my life and suddenly I am a drug-using bum? I have told people the facts, but facts don't interest people or the media. They only trust headlines. The only reason I even cared was because it negatively affected my film festival and film school, and my sponsors were concerned. If I did not own a not-for-profit school, I would be on Saturday Night Live making fun of it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> jacket; and {{the waiter}} sprang forward {{and helped her}} on with it, prolonging the {{business}} needlessly.

50|$|Mertilla Jones {{was held}} {{overnight}} and released. She said she <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> granddaughter when the grenade {{came through the}} window, not for the officer's gun. She said she made no contact with them. Geoffrey Fieger, the family's lawyer, said the police fired the shot that struck Aiyana from outside the home, possibly through the open front door.|$|R
5000|$|Ripley {{finds herself}} in a trophy room filled with dozens of Alien corpses and body parts, and understands that the Predators' lives revolve around the Aliens and that they know that both the super soldier and she are part Alien, which leads her to wonder if they are merely adding her to their trophy collection. A Predator moves up behind her, <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> causing her to recoil in anger, {{punching}} the Predator to little effect before he throws her {{over his shoulder and}} carries her away. She is taken to a circular operating table and tied down whilst a breathing apparatus is attached to her face, followed by a thin needle drill moving towards her. She resists throughout, comparing them to the military who created her, commenting [...] "I guess I haven't fallen past terror after all...".|$|E
5000|$|One 1996 Media Graffiti titled Thank You Calvin, Thank You Kate {{garnered}} {{media attention}} {{at the time of}} its exhibition for Mace's playful [...] "manipulation."The title refers to fashion designer Calvin Klein and model Kate Moss.The target of the artist's embellishment, in this case, was a risqué magazine ad for Calvin Klein's Obsession perfume.

60|$|He <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> arm and at {{the same}} instant {{something}} clashed against the bars of one of the windows, crashing them inward to the floor, to be followed almost simultaneously by a human figure which dove headforemost into the room, its head enveloped in the skin window hangings which it carried with it in its impetuous entry.|$|R
