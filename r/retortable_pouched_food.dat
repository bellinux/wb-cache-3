40|$|ABSTRACT Peeled hard cooked {{eggs were}} held in. 1 N citric acid containing. 2 % sodium ben-zoate at 4 C for 4 days. The eggs were then packed in sealed metal cans and in <b>retortable</b> <b>pouches</b> in a dilute organic acid. They were {{retorted}} for 15 min at 121 C. Other eggs in <b>retortable</b> <b>pouches</b> were immersed {{in boiling water}} for 15 min. The previously hard cooked eggs endured the stresses of retorting or immersion in boiling water with no detectable changes in sensory characteristics. Microbiological examination of thermally processed eggs after 1 week, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 5 months storage at 4 C or 21 C gave no evidence of growth of microorganisms. Hard cooked eggs can be packaged and thermally processed without harm to sensory qualities. Such eggs could be merchandised with or without refrigeration.

50|$|Heat or {{ionizing}} irradiation {{can be used}} to {{kill the}} bacteria that cause decomposition. Heat is applied by cooking, blanching or microwave heating in a manner that pasteurizes or sterilizes fish products. Cooking or pasteurizing does not completely inactivate microorganisms and may need to be followed with refrigeration to preserve fish products and increase their shelf life. Sterilised products are stable at ambient temperatures up to 40 °C, but to ensure they remain sterilized they need packaging in metal cans or <b>retortable</b> <b>pouches</b> before the heat treatment.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 69 - 77) Effect {{of processing}} and storage on folacin content of green beans canned in tinplated cans and <b>retortable</b> <b>pouches,</b> under home canning conditions were studied. Blanching resulted in retentions of 51. 5 percent of free folacin (FFA) and 81. 4 {{percent of total}} folacin (TFA). Due to leaching, 0. 9 percent FFA and 15. 3 percent TFA were detected in the blanching water. The heat processing itself and leaching caused no significant reduction in FFA in either type of package. The TFA retention following sterilization was 75 percent in cans and 73. 9 percent in pouches. As {{a result of a}} higher liquid to solid ratio, leaching of TFA was higher in cans than in pouches. During 12 weeks of storage, the FFA content of canned green beans decreased significantly (p< 0. 5), whereas the corresponding reduction in pouched green beans was not significant. The concentration of FFA in the brine portion of both types of packages increased initially, then reduced slightly and finally stabilized after the third week of storage. (See more in text. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} texture of Okara, a by- product of tofu manufacturing, the effects of heating in a {{pressure}} cooker and retort on the maceration of Okara were examined.

40|$|Optimal {{sterilization}} {{temperature was}} defined as the temperature resulting in a minimum surface cook-value product together with the desired degree of sterility. Sterilization of conduction heated foods, with simple shapes as infinite slab, infinite cylinder and sphere, was modelled. The model assumed first order inactivation kinetics for microorganisms and quality. The temperature distribution was solved by an explicit finite difference numerical method with a non-capacitance surface node. Optimal temperatures were calculated as a function of : i) Food Properties - thermal diffusivity, Z-value for the quality factor, Processing Conditions - dimensions and geometry of the food or container, surface heat transfer coefficient, initial product temperature, heating medium come-up-time and Processing Criteria - target Fovalue. Initial food temperature and heating medium come-up-time have a minor influence on the optimal conditions. Generalized (semi) -empirical formulas relating quantitatively optimal temperatures and all relevant variables were developed. The generalized equations are a valuable tool to calculate or estimate processing sterilization conditions for regularly and irregularly shaped products. They were successfully applied to predict the optimal sterilization temperatures for conduction heated foods, packaged in typical cylindrical cans and <b>retortable</b> <b>pouches,</b> with different surface resistances to hea, transfer...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop and evaluate a low-cholesterol egg salad product capable of being thermally processed in a <b>retortable</b> <b>pouch.</b> Formulations containing 12 % dried egg white solids (EWS) with water binding solutes (modified corn starch or iota-carrageenan), raw yolk, and a heat-stable salad dressing mixture were packaged, processed, and evaluated by a 9 - to 10 -member taste panel for appearance, color, texture, flavor, and overall acceptability. The formula-tions were also objectively evaluated for color and for texture using the Instron machine. Results indicated that the formulated egg salad products were significantly better in all parame-ters than the control egg salad after processing. Color measurements showed the use of glucose-free albumen prevented browning after heat treatment. Rheological measurements indicated that the breaking force and modulus of rigidity of processed EWS gels containing. 375 or. 625 % iota-carrageenan were similar to that of fresh albumen gels while those of processed EWS containing 2 % modified corn starch were much higher than fresh albumen gels. Cholesterol content per 100 g of formulated egg salad product was calculated to be 85 mg as compared with 368 mg for control egg salad. (Key words- egg salad, low cholesterol, retort pouch...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Deboned, {{skinless}} {{white and}} dark meat from fowl was pretreated by overnight soaking at 3 C in either deionized water, 2 % sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, 3 % Kena solution (sodium polyphosphate), or 2 % NaCl plus 3 % Kena solution. Meat was subsequently water cooked 90 min at 92 C: then diced and batched with ground cooked skin, fat, and broth. Ingredients were packaged and sealed in flexible <b>retortable</b> <b>pouches</b> and retorted at 121 C (250 F). Finished prod-ucts were evaluated for proximate composition, mineral content, and sensory properties. Presoaking the meat in water or 2 % NaCl {{had little effect}} on product composition or sensory properties after retorting. Soaking in Kena, with or without NaCl, increased moisture, decreased percentage protein, and increased ash. Kena plus NaCl had significantly higher Na and CI contents than all other treatments. Finished products made from meat presoaked in Kena, with or without NaCl, were lighter in color, more tender, and less off-flavored than products presoaked in water or 2 % NaCl only. Product made from Kena plus NaCl differed significantly from product made from Kena alone in higher initial juiciness, increased perception of seasoning, and higher Na and CI contents; however, {{there were no significant differences}} in other parameters. The value of increased juiciness and seasoning perceived versus the value of increased Na content would need to be con-sidered in making a recommendation on the use of polyphosphates with or without NaCl to improve fowl meat products. If dietary sodium content is a concern, small differences in quality may be negated by increased sodium content resulting from treatment with polyphosphates plu...|$|R

50|$|The Cerebral Palsy {{patients}} have many common oral health conditions. One {{of the common}} conditions is periodontal disease.

The people with Cerebral Palsy also experience malocclusion and the most common is open bite with protruding anterior teeth related with tongue thrust. The open bite and inability to close the lips cause drooling of saliva. These patients also have difficulty in swallowing which is called dysphagia.
