However, this technique has met with frequent failures in cases of MIH or deep lesions of traumatic origin or those associated with fluorosis. For this reason a new deep infiltration technique is proposed: thanks to its global treatment concept, this enables all white spots to be treated. The place of whitening in these treatment options is discussed, with explanations of the main <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>failures...</b>|$|E
40|$|Simple first-order closure {{remains an}} {{attractive}} way of formulating equations for complex canopy flows when {{the aim is}} to find analytic or simple numerical solutions to illustrate fundamental physical processes. Nevertheless, the limitations of such closures must be understood if the resulting models are to illuminate rather than mislead. We propose five conditions that first-order closures must satisfy then test two widely used closures against them. The first is the eddy diffusivity based on a mixing length. We discuss the origins of this approach, its use in simple canopy flows and extensions to more complex flows. We find that it satisfies most of the conditions and, because the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>failures</b> are well understood, it is a reliable methodology. The second is the velocity-squared closure that relates shear stress to the square of mean velocity. Again we discuss the origins of this closure and show that it is based on incorrect physical principles and fails to satisfy any of the five conditions in complex canopy flows; consequently its use can lead to actively misleading conclusions...|$|E

5000|$|For {{a number}} of reasons, the project did not succeed. According to Orthodox Rabbi Bernstein, the major <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>failure</b> was that the Orthodox rabbis insisted that the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly expel some Conservative rabbis for actions they took before the new Beit Din was formed, and the RA refused to do so (Bernstein, 1977). According to Orthodox Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, former {{president}} of the RCA, the major <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>failure</b> was pressure from right-wing Orthodox rabbis, who held that any cooperation between Orthodoxy and Conservatism was forbidden. In an account prepared in 1956, Rabbi Harry Halpern of the Rabbinical Assembly's Joint Conference wrote that negotiations between the Orthodox and Conservative were completed and agreed upon, but then a new requirement was demanded by the RCA: that the RA [...] "impose severe sanctions" [...] upon Conservative rabbis for actions they took before the new beth din was formed. The RA [...] "could not assent to rigorously disciplining our members at the behest of an outside group". Per Halpern, subsequent efforts were made to cooperate with the Orthodox, but a letter from eleven Rosh Yeshivas was circulated declaring that Orthodox rabbis were forbidden to cooperate with Conservative rabbis (Proceedings of the CJLS of the Conservative Movement 1927-1970 Vol. II, pp. 850-852).|$|R
