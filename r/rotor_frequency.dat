50|$|The {{principle}} of the DFIG is that rotor windings {{are connected to the}} grid via slip rings and back-to-back voltage source converter that controls both the rotor and the grid currents. Thus <b>rotor</b> <b>frequency</b> can freely differ from the grid frequency (50 or 60 Hz). By using the converter to control the rotor currents, it is possible to adjust the active and reactive power fed to the grid from the stator independently of the generator's turning speed. The control principle used is either the two-axis current vector control or direct torque control (DTC). DTC has turned out to have better stability than current vector control especially when high reactive currents are required from the generator.|$|E

40|$|Rub-impact {{fault model}} for dual-rotor system was further developed, in which rubbing board is {{regarded}} as elastic sheet. Sheet elastic deformation, contact penetration, and elastic damping support during rubbing of sheet and wheel disk were considered. Collision force and friction were calculated by utilizing Hertz contact theory and Coulomb model and introducing nonlinear spring damping model and friction coefficient. Then kinetic differential equations of rub-impact under dry rubbing condition were established. Based on one-dimensional finite element model of dual-rotor system, dynamic transient response of overall structure under rub-impact existing between rotor wheel and sheet was obtained.

The results show that, {{during the process of}} rub-impact, the spectrums of rotor vibration are complicated and multiple combined frequency components of inner and outer <b>rotor</b> fundamental <b>frequencies</b> are typical characteristic of rub-impact fault for dual-rotor system.

40|$|The {{influence}} of several system design parameters on tiltrotor aeroelastic stability is examined for the high-speed (axial) flight mode. Coupling of the rotor flapping modes with the wing elastic modes produces a whirl motion, typical of tiltrotors, that can become unstable at high speeds.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of {{disturbance}} models {{in the design of}} wind turbine individual pitch controllers. Previous work has used individual pitch control and disturbance models with the Multiblade Coordinate Transfor-mation to design controllers that reduce the blade loads at the frequencies associated with the rotor speed. This paper takes a similar approach of using a disturbance model within the H 1 design framework to account for peri-odic loading effects. The controller is compared with a baseline design that does not include the periodic disturbance model. In constant wind speeds, the disturbance model design is significantly better than the baseline de-sign at canceling blade loads at the rotor frequencies. However, these load reduction improvements become negligible even under low turbulent wind conditions. The two controllers perform similarly in turbulent wind condi-tions because disturbance augmentation improves load reduction only at the multiples of the <b>rotor</b> <b>frequency</b> in the yaw and tilt moment channels whereas turbulence creates strong collective bending moments. In addition, turbulent wind contains energy across a broad frequency spectrum and improvements at multiples of the <b>rotor</b> <b>frequency</b> are less important in these conditions. Therefore inclusion of periodic disturbance models in the control design may not lead to the expected load reduction in fielded wind turbines...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} and detect the multiple faults in machines using broken rotor bar and eccentricity fault frequencies techniques. It is proposed that using both current and instantaneous power signals simultaneously, will detect the multiple faults reliably, specifically using broken <b>rotor</b> bar fault <b>frequencies</b> and eccentricity fault frequencies under various load conditions. The analyses carried out in this paper show that the current spectra is able to detect multiple faults i. e. a combination of broken rotor bars and eccentricity faults either by using broken <b>rotor</b> bars fault <b>frequency</b> components (1 ± 2 s) f 1 or using eccentricity fault frequency components (f 1 ±fr) at any levels of loading. The results from the instantaneous power spectra using modified broken <b>rotor</b> bar fault <b>frequency</b> components (fp± 4 f 2) show that it is preferable for estimating either the machines having multiple faults.

40|$|In an {{electric}} power grid {{that has a}} high penetration level of wind, the power fluctuation of a large-scale wind power plant (WPP) caused by varying wind speeds deteriorates the system frequency regulation. This paper proposes a power-smoothing scheme of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) that significantly mitigates the system frequency fluctuation while preventing over-deceleration of the rotor speed. The proposed scheme employs an additional control loop relying on the system frequency deviation that operates {{in combination with the}} maximum power point tracking control loop. To improve the power-smoothing capability while preventing over-deceleration of the rotor speed, the gain of the additional loop is modified with the <b>rotor</b> speed and <b>frequency</b> deviation. The gain is set to be high if the <b>rotor</b> speed and/or <b>frequency</b> deviation is large.

40|$|Fluid-induced {{instability}} of a rotor-bearing system occurs frequently in rotating machinery. This involves {{two types of}} instability, i. e., fluid whirl and whip. Whirl is a predominately rigid-body mode and tracks at around one-half shaft running speed. Its threshold speed can be arbitrarily raised by using externally-pressurized fluid bearings, which allow for adjustable pressure for high stiffness. Whip is mainly a rotor-bending mode and locks into the <b>rotor</b> natural <b>frequency.</b> It appears when increases in bearing stiffness no longer influence the instability threshold. As demonstrated both analytically and experimentally in this paper, however, use of an externally-pressurized gas seal in the mid-span of the rotor can successfully eliminate whip.

An experimental rig was operated at speed up to 10, 000 rpm, far above the <b>rotor</b> natural <b>frequency</b> of less than 2000 rpm without the seal.
