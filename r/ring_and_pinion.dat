5000|$|There is an 8.9" [...] {{diameter}} Dana 44 <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> that is {{very different}} from the standard Dana 44. This <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> is significantly stronger with a better pinion to ring gear tooth contact patch and angle. It was typically used in the back of jeep JKs, Isuzus and Nissan pickups. This <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> does share some components and can be adapted into an earlier Dana 44 but requires some work, different bearings and spacers. The benefit is the larger ring gear, better angle cut on the teeth and Dana 60 diameter pinion shaft.|$|E

40|$|QuesTek Innovations LLC is {{applying}} its Materials by Design computational {{design technology}} {{to develop a}} new class of high-strength, secondary hardening gear steels that are optimized for high-temperature, low-pressure (i. e., vacuum) carburization. The new alloys offer three different levels of case hardness (with the ability to “dial-in ” hard-ness profiles, including exceptionally high case hardness), and their high core strength, toughness and other properties offer the potential to reduce drivetrain weight or increase power density relative to incumbent alloys such as AISI 9310 or Pyrowear Alloy 53. This new class of alloys utilizes an efficient nanoscale M 2 C carbide strengthening disper-sion; their key benefits include: high fatigue resistance (in contact, bending and scoring); high hardenability achieved via low-pressure carburization (thus reducing quench distortion and associated manufacturing steps); a tempering tem-perature of 900 °F or higher (providing up to a 500 °F increase in thermal stability relative to incumbent alloys); and core tensile strengths in excess of 225 ksi. Ferrium C 61 is one alloy in this family and is currently used in transaxle <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinions</b> for SCORE 1600 class off-road racing cars as well as process equipment applications. C 61 is also being examined in an Army SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) program as a potential replacement for 9310 in CH- 47 Chinook helicopter main rotor mast applications, yielding a projected potential weight savings of 15 – 25 %. Secondly, Ferrium C 64 is being developed under a Navy STTR (Small Business Technology Transfer) program aimed at rotorcraft gear transmission applications in order to reduce weight, improve fatigue performance and improve high...|$|R

He had nearly completed a jet-engine powered ultralight dragster in 1963 when the NHRA outlawed all aircraft engines. He built two more Top Fuel Hemi-powered dragsters before he had an engine fire at Green Valley Race City in 1966. [...] "It {{was one of those}} fireballs that you couldn't see through," [...] Hill said. [...] "I locked up the brakes, and it felt like I needed to turn the wheel to the left, but for some reason, I didn't. I had to do something that was counterintuitive, and it spooked me." [...] Hill had managed to steer straight down a course that was lined with trees. Hill had been using the Double Dragon to win matches, which were used to finance his Top Fuel dragster. The Double Dragon had been destroyed in a wreck two months before this fire. The fire tapped his finances and his resolve to drag race.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the resistance to rolling contact fatigue of a-C:H:W and MoS 2 /Ti coated gears. The investigation of rolling contact fatigue was realised by means of a gear test rig using FZG PT C/ 10 / 90 pitting test. Four material combinations of gears were tested: wheel <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> uncoated, wheel <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> coated, wheel coated <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> uncoated as well as wheel uncoated <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> coated. The tests were performed using for lubrication mineral gear oil of API GL- 5 performance level and 80 W/ 90 viscosity grade. The results indicate that for the coated/coated pair (wheel <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> coated) <b>and</b> uncoated/coated pair (uncoated wheel <b>and</b> coated <b>pinion)</b> a significant decrease in the fatigue life compared to the uncoated gears was obtained. The best results were obtained in the case of the coated/uncoated pair (a-C:H:W coated wheel <b>and</b> uncoated <b>pinion)</b> – even fourfold increase in the fatigue life was observed. This shows a very high potential of application of PVD coatings for gears...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In general, the {{strength}} of gears is calculated using the formula of AGMA or JGMA. But these formula can not be applied directly to {{the strength}} calculation of the rack <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering gear assay, because of complex tooth and contact shapes. So Lewis bending stress and Hertzian contact stress formula are generally used {{for the design of}} rack <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering gear assay. But these formula do not also give the exact stress of rack <b>and</b> <b>pinion.</b> In this paper, comparing the finite element analysis results and the experimentally measured values, it is shown that the finite element modeling technique of the rack <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering assay is reasonable.

50|$|A {{variation}} of the Dana 60 known as a Dana 61 was made to accommodate gear ratios that allowed for better fuel mileage. This was done {{as a direct result}} of the 1973 oil crisis. A 3.07:1 gear ratio was common for these axles and unachievable in a regular Dana 60. To allow for the different gearing, the Dana 61 had a greater pinion offset. This offset meant that a different carrier and a different <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> had to be used.|$|E
50|$|Honda also {{increased}} the {{final drive ratio}} to a 4.235:1 <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> gear {{in place of the}} 4.06:1 stock unit, which moved the NSX-R's shift point speeds closer together. This change improved acceleration at the expense of top speed, and a higher (percentage) locking limited-slip differential was installed. Also, the NSX-R 3.0 liter DOHC VTEC V-6 engine had a blueprinted and balanced crankshaft assembly which is exactly the same labour-intensive high precision process done for Honda racing car engines built by highly qualified engine technicians.|$|E
50|$|In {{this new}} {{front-wheel-drive}} design, the first for Toyota, {{the engine is}} mounted longitudinally.

The engine, transmission and differential are located a little to the side from the centre line of the car, but still roughly in the centre.

50|$|A lunchbox locker, {{also known}} as a pocket locker, is a form of {{automatic}} locking differential that is installed by replacing some components of the differential carrier with the components provided by the lunchbox locker. The cost of the lunchbox locker is reduced because it reuses the existing carrier in the differential. It is easier to install because by reusing the carrier, {{there is no need to}} replace the shims and bearings, or to re-measure the preload on the <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion.</b> Often, the lunchbox locker can be installed without removing the carrier from the differential, depending on whether the carrier pin can slide past the ring gear.|$|E

50|$|Model AA Ford has a four-speed manual gearbox. The {{transmission}} is geared {{lower than the}} Model A Ford to provide more torque to move a loaded truck. This lower gearing reduced the top speed of the truck {{when compared to the}} Model A Ford. The transmission also featured a lock-out on the shift knob for reverse that required a lever to be activated with the thumb so reverse could be engaged. This was done to prevent accidental engagement of reverse while the truck was in motion. Early trucks had a worm gear rear-end that limited the top speed of the truck. That rear-end was replaced by a <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> differential to improve the speed of the truck. Later models were fitted with braces on the outer casing of the rear-end to provide additional support to the rear-end housing.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of the Kelmark Conversion is increased power and good engine placement in terms of weight distribution. The setup has a 40/60 front to rear weight distribution ratio. The main dis{{advantage of}} the Kelmark Conversion is that it requires the turning of the trans-axle 180 degrees, flat, and connecting it to the engine with a bell housing adapter. A stronger shaft is needed to withstand the torque of the V8 engine. Also, since the ring gear turns backwards it requires a free flow oil system or a reverse cut <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> gear set. They also required a heavy duty differential or differential modifications. The Corvair differential was not designed to handle more than [...] When you put the power and torque of even a mild V8 to the stock differential, it tries to split the case from the pinion gear being forced against the ring gear.|$|E
