50|$|The CDR/UDR datatypes hold data such as NPX, NPA, Call Duration, {{peak time}} flag and call length. Data may be <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>ascii</b> or binary formats. The billing {{mediation}} platform typically reads this data and converts it into common normalized format.|$|E
50|$|FIELDATA is the {{original}} character set used internally in UNIVAC computers of the 1100 series, represented by the sixth of the 36-bit word of that computer. The direct successor to the UNIVAC 1100 is the Unisys 2200 series computers, which use FIELDATA to this day (although ASCII is now also common with each character encoded in 1/4 of a word, or 9 bits). Because some of the FIELDATA characters are not <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>ASCII,</b> the Unisys 2200 uses '^', '"' and '_' characters for codes 004oct, 076oct and 077oct respectively.|$|E

5000|$|First, an encoder {{must decide}} which {{characters}} to <b>represent</b> directly <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> form, which [...] {{has to be}} escaped as , and which to place in blocks of Unicode characters. A simple encoder may encode all characters it considers safe for direct encoding directly. However the cost of ending a Unicode sequence, outputing a single character directly <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> and then starting another Unicode sequence is 3 to 3⅔ bytes. This {{is more than the}} 2⅔ bytes needed to represent the character {{as a part of a}} Unicode sequence. Each Unicode sequence must be encoded using the following procedure, then surrounded by the appropriate delimiters.|$|R
5000|$|Creator {{codes are}} four-byte OSTypes. They allow {{applications}} to launch and open a file whenever {{any of their}} associated files is double-clicked. Creator codes could be any four-byte value, but were usually chosen so that their ASCII representation formed a word or acronym. For example, the creator code of the HyperCard application and its associated [...] "stacks" [...] is <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> as WILD. Occasionally they represented inside jokes. For instance, the Marathon computer game had a creator code of 26.2 (the approximate length, in miles, of a marathon) and Marathon 2: Durandal had a creator code of 52.4.|$|E
50|$|In Rogue, players {{control a}} {{character}} as they explore several levels of a dungeon {{as they seek}} the Amulet of Yendor located in the dungeon's lowest level. The player-character must fend off an array of monsters that roam the dungeons. Along the way, they can collect treasures that can help them offensively or defensively, such as weapons, armor, potions, scrolls, and other magical items. Rogue is turn-based taking place on a square grid <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> or other fixed character sets, allowing players {{to have time to}} determine the best move to survive. Rogue implements permadeath as a design choice to make each action by the player meaningful: should the player-character lose all their health from combat or other means, the character is dead, and the player must restart a brand new character and cannot reload from a saved state. The dungeon levels, monster encounters, and treasures are procedurally generated on each playthrough, so that no game is the same as a previous one.|$|E
40|$|A complex {{manifold}} X is said {{to satisfy}} the Oka-Grauert property if the inclusion [Multiple line equation(s) cannot be <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> text] is a weak equivalence for every Stein manifold S, where the spaces of holomorphic and continuous maps from S to X are given the compact-open topology. Gromov's Oka principle states that if X has a spray, then it has the Oka-Grauert property. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the Oka-Grauert property using homotopical algebra. We embed the category of complex manifolds into the model category of simplicial sheaves on the site of Stein manifolds. Our main result is that the Oka-Grauert property is equivalent to X representing a finite homotopy sheaf on the Stein site. This expresses the Oka-Grauert property in purely holomorphic terms, without reference to continuous maps...|$|E
50|$|SAMPA was devised as a hack to {{work around}} the {{inability}} of text encodings to represent IPA symbols.

However, X-SAMPA is still useful {{as the basis for}} an input method for true IPA.|$|R

25|$|However, the Unicode hyphen is {{awkward to}} enter on most keyboards, so the hyphen-minus {{character}} remains very common. They {{are often used}} instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the preferred characters are unavailable (such as ASCII-only text), where the preferred characters take effort to enter (via dialog boxes or multi-key, unmemorable keyboard shortcuts), or when the writer is unaware of the distinction. Some writers use two hyphen-minuses (--) to <b>represent</b> a dash <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> text.|$|R

5000|$|WX {{notation}} is a transliteration {{scheme for}} <b>representing</b> Indian languages <b>in</b> <b>ASCII.</b> This scheme originated at IIT Kanpur for computational processing of Indian languages, and {{is widely used}} among the natural language processing (NLP) community in India. The notation (though unidentified) is used, for example, in a textbook on NLP from IIT Kanpur. The salient features of this transliteration scheme are: Every consonant and every vowel has a single mapping into Roman. Hence it is a prefix code, advantageous from computation point of view. Typically the small case letters are used for un-aspirated consonants and short vowels while the capital case letters are used for aspirated consonants and long vowels. While the retroflexed voiceless and voiced consonants are mapped to 't, T, d and D', the dentals are mapped to 'w, W, x and X'. Hence {{the name of the}} scheme [...] "WX", referring to the idiosyncratic mapping. Ubuntu Linux provides a keyboard support for WX notation.|$|R
