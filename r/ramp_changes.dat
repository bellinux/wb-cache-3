The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if <b>Ramp</b> <b>changes</b> during a graded exercise test (GXT) would differentiate between middle-aged hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Subjects included 15 hypertensives (HT), 11 trained normotensives (TR), and 9 untrained normotensives (UT). All subjects underwent a maximal GXT to volitional exhaustion, using the Bruce protocol. HT exhibited higher SBP and DBP at rest and each stage of the GXT (p. 05). Ramp decreased from rest to peak exercise in all groups (p. 05). Ramp in HT 1 decreased from 13. 9 mm at rest to 12. 4 mm at peak exercise, whereas Ramp in HT 2 decreased from 11. 9 mm to 10. 9 mm. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that exercise- induced <b>Ramp</b> <b>changes</b> are sensitive indicators of ventricular function.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Functional {{residual}} capacity (FRC) measurement {{is now available}} on new ventilators as an automated procedure. We compared FRC, static thoracopulmonary compliance (Crs) and PaO 2 evolution in an experimental model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during a reversed, sequential ramp procedure of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) changes to investigate the potential interest of combined FRC and Crs measurement in such a pathologic state. METHODS: ARDS was induced by oleic acid injection in six anesthetised pigs. FRC and Crs were measured, and arterial blood samples were taken after induction of ARDS during a sequential <b>ramp</b> <b>change</b> of PEEP from 20 cm H 2 O to 0 cm H 2 O by steps of 5 cm H 2 O. RESULTS: ARDS was responsible for significant decreases in FRC, Crs and PaO 2 values. During ARDS, 20 cm H 2 O of PEEP was associated with FRC values that increased from 6. 2 +/- 1. 3 to 19. 7 +/- 2. 9 ml/kg and a significant improvement in PaO 2. The maximal value of Crs was reached at a PEEP of 15 cm H 2 O, and the maximal value of FRC at a PEEP of 20 cm H 2 O. From a PEEP value of 15 to 0 cm H 2 O, FRC and Crs decreased progressively. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that combined FRC and Crs measurements may help to identify the optimal level of PEEP. Indeed, by {{taking into account the}} value of both parameters during a sequential <b>ramp</b> <b>change</b> of PEEP from 20 cm H 2 O to 0 cm H 2 O by steps of 5 cm H 2 O, the end of overdistension may be identified by an increase in Crs and the start of derecruitment by an abrupt decrease in FRC.

Renal sympathetic nerve activity was recorded during brief perivascular balloon-induced <b>ramp</b> <b>changes</b> in mean arterial pressure before and during 40 -minute elevations in resting pressure. Methoxamine infusion was adjusted to increase pressure by + 30 and + 45 mm Hg in the presence of autonomic blockade of the heart with atenolol and methscopolamine. Experiments were repeated in other rabbits after blocking cardiac afferents with 5 % intraperi-cardial procaine or during intravenous naloxone (4 - 6 mg/kg, then 0. 12 mg/kg/min). We found a progressively severe attenuation of the renal sympathetic baroreceptor reflex during increasing elevations in resting pressure. The upper plateau and range of the reflex curve were both reduced by one third and two thirds during moderate and severe hypertension, respec-tively.

40|$|SUMMARY. Curves {{relating}} renal {{sympathetic nerve}} activity and {{mean arterial pressure}} were derived in conscious rabbits during <b>ramp</b> <b>changes</b> in mean arterial pressure, elicited by perivascular balloon inflation. The renal sympathetic nerve activity-mean arterial pressure relationship con-sisted of a high-gain sigmoidal region about resting, where renal sympathetic nerve activity rose or fell in response to moderate falls and rises of mean arterial pressure. With larger pressure rises, renal sympathetic nerve activity first fell to a lower plateau and then reversed at even higher mean arterial pressure. When mean arterial pressure was lowered below resting, renal sympathetic nerve activity rose to an upper plateau and then reversed abruptly toward resting at low mean arterial pressure. Both arterial and cardiac baroreceptors exerted substantial inhibitory influences on renal sympathetic nerve activity at all pressure levels. These effects appeared additive over the central high gain region of the curve, but beyond this region there were non-additive interactions. The latter were affected considerably by alfathesin anesthesia. In other experiments, we studied the effects of sustained alterations in resting mean arterial pressure induced by infusing nitroprusside and phenylephrine, which produced rapid resetting of the renal baroreflex. The latter could be accounted for, in part, by resetting of {{the threshold of the}} arterial baroreceptor...|$|E

Unlike the {{wind turbines}} with synchronous generators considered in the past, modern doubly-fed induction generators offer the advantage of allowing the turbine to operate at variable rotational speeds which provides for optimal energy capture in low wind regimes. Moreover, the inertia in the blades and connected generator offers a place to temporarily store energy {{that can be used to}} help filter electric power fluctuations due to wind turbulence. A thorough understanding of the control and dynamic behavior of these machines is necessary to accurately predict their dynamic performance.

40|$|Amplitude {{decay and}} phase delay of {{oscillating}} temperature records measured at two vertical locations in near-surface sediments {{can be used}} to infer water fluxes, thermal diffusivity, and sediment scour/deposition. While methods that rely on the harmonics-based analytical heat transport solution assume a steady state water flux, many applications have reported transient fluxes but ignored the possible violation of this assumption in the method. Here we use natural heat tracing as an example to investigate the extent to which changes in the water flux, and associated temperature signal nonstationarity, can be separated from other influences. We systematically scrutinize the assumption of steady state flow in analytical heat tracing and test the capabilities of the method to detect the timing and magnitude of flux transients. A numerical model was used to synthesize the temperature response to different step and <b>ramp</b> <b>changes</b> in advective thermal velocity magnitude and direction for both a single-frequency and multifrequency temperature boundary. Time-variable temperature amplitude and phase information were extracted from the model output with different signal-processing methods. We show that a worst-case transient flux induces a temperature nonstationarity, the duration of which is less than 1 cycle for realistic sediment thermal diffusivities between 0. 02 and 0. 13 [*]m 2 /d. However, common signal-processing methods introduce erroneous temporal spreading of advective thermal velocities and significant anomalies in thermal diffusivities or sensor spacing, which is used as an analogue for streambed scour/deposition. The most time-variant spectral filter can introduce errors of up to 57 % in velocity and 33 % in thermal diffusivity values with artifacts spanning ± 2 [*]days around the occurrence of rapid changes in flux. Further, our results show that analytical heat tracing is unable to accurately resolve highly time-variant fluxes and thermal diffusivities and does not allow for the inference of scour/depositional processes due to the limitations of signal processing in disentangling flux-related signal nonstationarities from those stemming from other sources. To prevent erroneous interpretations, hydrometric data should always be acquired in combination with temperature records...|$|E
40|$|In both anaesthetized and {{conscious}} rabbits, perivascular balloon inflations slowly raised or lowered mean {{arterial pressure}} (M. A. P.), at 1 - 2 mmHg/s, from resting to various plateau pressures. Deflations then returned the M. A. P. to resting. 'Steady-state' curves relating M. A. P. to unitary aortic baroreceptor firing, integrated aortic nerve activity and heart rate were derived during the primary and return pressure changes and they formed typical hysteresis loops. In single units, return M. A. P. -frequency curves were shifted {{in the same direction}} as the primary pressure changes by an average 0. 37 mmHg per mmHg change in M. A. P. Shifts were linearly related to the changes in M. A. P. between resting and plateau levels for all pressure rises and for falls less than 30 mmHg. They were established within 30 s and were quantitatively similar to the rapid resetting of baroreceptor function curves found 15 min- 2 h after a change in resting M. A. P. (Dorward, Andresen, Burke, Oliver & Korner, 1982). Unit threshold pressures were shifted within 20 s to the same extent as the over-all curve shift to which they contributed. In the whole aortic nerve, return M. A. P. -integrated activity curves were shifted to same degree as unit function curves in both anaesthetized and conscious rabbits. Simultaneous shifts of return reflex M. A. P. -heart rate curves were also seen in conscious rabbits within 30 s. During M. A. P. falls, receptor and reflex hysteresis was similar, but during M. A. P. rises, reflex shifts were double baroreceptor shifts, suggesting the involvement of other pressure-sensitive receptors. We conclude that hysteresis shifts in baroreceptor function curves, which follow the reversal of slow <b>ramp</b> <b>changes</b> in blood pressure are a form of rapid resetting.

This paper presents a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation of SU & SD power trajectories of thermal units where the computational burden is considerably decreased in comparison to formulations commonly found in the literature. This is because the proposed formulation is i) tighter, i. e. the relaxed solution is nearer to the optimal integer solution; and ii) more compact, i. e. it needs fewer constraints, variables and nonzero elements in the constraint matrix.

40|$|Under {{transient}} conditions, {{a helicopter}} rotor generates a complex, time-dependent pattern of shed and trailed vorticity {{in its wake}} that has profound eects on its loading. To examine these eects, the response of a two-bladed hovering rotor to a ramp change in collective pitch is investigated using three dierent computational approaches. Solutions obtained using a Compressible Reynolds Averaged NavierStokes ap- proach are compared to results obtained from lifting-line theory coupled to an Eulerian Vorticity Transport Model, and from a simple single-state dynamic in ow model. The dierent numerical approaches yield very similar predictions of the thrust response of the rotor to <b>ramp</b> <b>changes</b> in collective pitch, {{as long as the}} ramp rates are small. This suggests that the basic underlying ow physics is properly represented by all the approaches. For more rapid ramp rates, an additional delay in the aerodynamic response of the rotor, that is related to the nite extent of the wake during its early history, is predicted by the NavierStokes and Vorticity Transport approaches. Even though the evolution of the wake of the rotor is strongly three dimensional and highly unsteady, the predictions of the NavierStokes and lifting-line models agree very closely as long as the blades of the rotor do not stall. In the pre-stall regime, a quasi two-dimensional representation of the blade aerodynamics thus appears adequate for predicting the performance of such systems even under highly transient conditions. When ow separation occurs, the resulting three dimen- sionality of the blade aerodynamics forces the predictions of the NavierStokes and lifting-line approaches to diverge, however. The characterization of the wake interactions and stall propagation mechanisms that are presented in this study oers some insight into the fundamental uid dynamic mechanisms that govern the transient aerodynamic response of a rotor to control inputs, and provides some quantication of the limits of applicability of some popular current approaches to rotor aerodynamic analysis...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Front-end power {{converters}} for nanosatellite applications demand better performance in accurate reference tracking {{because of the}} wide-range input voltage of the solar panels. The very tight output voltage requirements demand a robust, reliable, and high-efficiency converter. The control of such a converter is very complex and time consuming to design. Two commonly used control modes are current and voltage control. The design and implementation of a voltage controller for DC–DC power converter is simpler but compared to current mode controller, does not do provide for overcurrent protection. A single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) was selected for this research work because {{of its ability to}} buck or boost the input voltage coupled with the ability to provide noninverting polarity with respect to the input voltage. Parameter values for the converter studied are used to analyse and design both the voltage and the current mode controllers for the nanosatellite front-end power converter. Output voltage reference tracking with step and <b>ramp</b> <b>changes</b> in the input voltage is evaluated in terms of the time taken to reach steady-state after the induced disturbances and either the overshoot or undershoot of the output voltage reference. The design of analogue pulse width modulation (PWM) study was carried out in order to drive the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) switch. For the two controllers, changes in the reference output voltage in response to load changes are also studied. An examination of the effects of solar radiation on the MOSFET switch was conducted; this switch is the main component of the front-end DC–DC power converter for a nanosatellite. At the more general level the examination also provided information on the response of the semiconductor technology in space application. The overall purpose of studying the MOSFET switch was to investigate the mechanisms that will facilitate its ability of switching ‘on’ and ‘off’ without failure as a result of solar radiation.

40|$|Chemical {{process design}} {{is still an}} active area of {{research}} since it largely determines the optimal and safe operation of a new process under various conditions. The design process involves {{a series of steps}} that aims to identify the most economically attractive design typically using steady-state optimization. However, optimal steady-state designs may fail to comply with the process constraints when the system under analysis is subject to process disturbances (e. g. the composition of a reactant in a feed stream) or parameter uncertainty (e. g. the activation energy in a chemical reaction). Moreover, the practice of overdesigning a process to ensure feasibility under process disturbances and parameter uncertainty has been proven to be costly. Therefore, a new methodology for simultaneous design and control for dynamic systems under uncertainty has been proposed. The proposed methodology uses Power Series Expansions (PSE) to obtain analytical expressions for the process constrains and cost function. The key idea is to use the back off approach from the optimal steady state design to address the simultaneous process and design problem in an efficient systematic manner using PSE approximations. The challenge in this method is to determine the magnitude of the back-off needed to accommodate the transient and feasible operation of the process in presence of disturbances and parameter uncertainty. In this approach, PSE functions are used to obtain analytical expressions of the actual process constraints and are explicitly defined in terms of system’s uncertain parameter and the largest variability in a constraint function due to time-varying changes in the disturbances. Also, the PSE approximation for each constraint is developed around a nominal point in the optimization variables and for each realization considered for the uncertain parameters. The PSE-based constraint represents the actual process constraint and can be evaluated faster since it is explicitly defined in the terms of the optimization variables. The work focuses on calculating various optimal design and control parameters by solving various sets of optimization problems using mathematical expressions obtained from power series expansions. These approximations are used to determine the direction in the search of optimal design parameters and operating conditions required for an economically attractive, dynamically feasible process. The proposed methodology was tested on an isothermal storage tank and a step by step procedure to develop the methodology has been presented. The methodology was also tested on a non-isothermal CSTR and the results were compared with the formal integration process. Effect of tuning parameter, which is a key parameter in the methodology, have been studied and the results show that the quality of the results improves when smaller values of tuning parameter are used but at the expense of higher computational costs. The effect of the order of the PSE approximation used in the calculations has also been studied and it shows that the quality in the results is improved when higher orders in the PSE approximations are used at the expense of higher computational costs. The methodology was also tested on a large-scale Waste Water treatment plant. A comparison was made for different values of tuning parameters and the most feasible value was chosen for the case study. Effects of different disturbances profiles such as step and <b>ramp</b> <b>changes</b> were also studied. The studies concluded that a lower cost value is obtained when ramps are used as disturbance profile when compared with step changes. The methodology was also tested when parameter uncertainty was introduced and the results show a higher cost is required when uncertainty is present in the system when compared with no uncertainty. The results show that this method has the potential to address the integration of design and control of dynamic systems under uncertainty at low computational costs...|$|E

At the I-565 interchange, it is possible for Parkway traffic to make a U-turn by executing a sequence of <b>ramp</b> lane <b>changes,</b> although no signage indicates this.|$|R

In order to remove 87 % of CO 2 from the flue gas stream generated from a 750 MW supercritical {{coal-fired power plant}} and produce a CO 2 concentration of 95 % in the CO 2 product stream, a post-combustion CO 2 capture plant with three absorbers and two strippers are needed,. A decentralized control structure composed of 11 proportional- integral (PI) controllers was proposed to maintain the dynamic operability of this commercial-scale CO 2 capture plant. The evaluation of the plant's performance in closed-loop were conducted using multiple scenarios, i. e., the loss of CO 2 recovery (%CC) control loop during variation of flue gas flow rate, a positive <b>ramp</b> <b>change</b> in the flue gas flow rate under a maximum withdrawal constraint on the reboilers’ heat duty, and the disturbance in the flue gas composition resulting from the variation in coal composition and air flow rate. The controllability analysis performed on the proposed industrial-scale MEA absorption plant using the control system designed in this study shows that the plant is able to recover fast {{from most of the}} disturbances considered in the analysis. The insight provided from the present study can then be used to address the integration of the present CO 2 capture plant to a coal-based power plant and evaluate the dynamic feasibility of this integration under various scenarios...|$|R

Hoop (circumferential, and longitudinal strains are time-wise measured on axially loaded pressurized cylinders. Pre-programmed <b>ramped</b> loading <b>changes</b> as well as precise long term pressure control are achieved through cascaded proportional, integral derivative (PID) flow control loops {{that are part of}} an integrated data acquisition and process control system. Real time data reduction and analysis allow monitoring of unattended tests that have durations of up to a month. Measured and controlled parameters and variables are discussed; date analysis techniques are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Seven healthy {{volunteer}} men {{participated in an}} experiment involving lower body positive pressure (LBPP) of 30 Torr and acute volume expansions of 5 - 6 % (VE-I) and 9 - 10 % (VE-II) of their total blood volume (TBV) to differentiate the effect of increased intramuscular pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) on the maximal gain (Gmax) of the carotid baroreflex. During each experimental condition, the heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP; intraradial artery or Finapres), and CVP (at the 3 rd- 4 th intercostal space) were monitored continuously. Gmax {{was derived from the}} logistic modeling of the HR and MAP responses to <b>ramped</b> <b>changes</b> in carotid sinus transmural pressure using a protocol of pulsatile changes in neck chamber pressure from + 40 to - 65 Torr. The increase in CVP during + 30 -Torr LBPP was 1. 5 mmHg (P 0. 05). The Gmax of the carotid baroreflex of HR and MAP was significantly decreased during LBPP by - 0. 145 +/- 0. 039 beats x min(- 1) x mmHg(- 1) (38 %) and - 0. 071 +/- 0. 013 mmHg/mmHg (25 %), respectively; however, VE-I did not affect Gmax. During VE-II, CVP was significantly greater than that elicited by LBPP, and the Gmax of the carotid baroreflex of the HR and MAP responses was significantly reduced. We conclude that carotid baroreflex responsiveness was selectively inhibited by increasing intramuscular pressure, possibly resulting in an activation of the intramuscular mechanoreceptors during LBPP. Furthermore, {{it would appear that the}} inhibition of the carotid baroreflex, via cardiopulmonary baroreceptor loading (increased CVP), occurred when a threshold pressure (CVP) was achieved...|$|R

Fish were subjected to a ramp of temperature decrease and after 2 weeks, a further recovery of temperature. The temperature <b>ramp</b> produced <b>changes</b> on most immune indicators and feed intake was affected more severely than predicted by feeding tables. However, no generalised signs of the syndrome were detected. The experimental diet tested showed some degree of immune protection related to complement and phagocytosis activity and slight changes in the levels of leucocytic infiltration of the intestinal mucosa and submucosa...|$|R
50|$|The {{game had}} several {{features}} which created a classic and innovative computer game. First, the game allowed the player to create different race tracks {{using a variety}} of templates. The player could create <b>ramps</b> and elevation <b>changes</b> in the layout of the track as well. The builder also had the options to change the type of terrain - laying slippery ice stretches of track, normal track, or difficult sandy sections of track.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} the stimulus-response relationships of the arterial, aortic, and carotid baroreflexes in mediating cardiac chronotropic function, we measured heart rate (HR) responses elicited by acute changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and carotid sinus pressure (CSP) in 11 healthy individuals. Arterial (aortic + carotid) baroreflex control of HR was quantified using <b>ramped</b> <b>changes</b> in MAP induced by bolus injection of phenylephrine (PE) and sodium nitroprusside (SN). To assess aortic-cardiac responses, neck pressure (NP) and suction (NS) were applied during PE and SN administration, respectively, to counter alterations in CSP thereby isolating the aortic baroreflex. Graded levels of NP and NS were delivered to the carotid sinus using a customized neck collar device to assess the carotid-cardiac baroreflex, independent of drug infusion. The operating characteristics of each reflex were determined from the logistic function of the elicited HR response to the induced change in MAP. The arterial pressures at which the threshold was located on the stimulus-response curves determined for the arterial, aortic and carotid baroreflexes {{were not significantly different}} (72 +/- 4, 67 +/- 3, and 72 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively, P > 0. 05). Similarly, the MAP at which the saturation of the reflex responses were elicited did not differ among the baroreflex arcs examined (98 +/- 3, 99 +/- 2, and 102 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively). These data suggest that the baroreceptor populations studied operate over the same range of arterial pressures. This finding indicates each baroreflex functions as both an important anti-hypotensive and anti-hypertensive mechanism. In addition, this investigation describes a model of aortic baroreflex function in normal healthy humans, which may prove useful in identifying the origin of baroreflex dysfunction in disease- and training-induced conditions...|$|R
