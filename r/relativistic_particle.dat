2500|$|B. Hiley and R. E. Callaghan re-interpret {{the role}} of the Bohm model and its notion of quantum {{potential}} in the framework of Clifford algebra, taking account of recent advances that include the work of David Hestenes on spacetime algebra. They show how, within a nested hierarchy of Clifford algebras , for each Clifford algebra an element of a minimal left ideal [...] and an element of a right ideal representing its Clifford conjugation [...] can be constructed, and from it the Clifford density element (CDE) , an element of the Clifford algebra which is isomorphic to the standard density matrix but independent of any specific representation. On this basis, bilinear invariants can be formed which represent properties of the system. Hiley and Callaghan distinguish bilinear invariants of a first kind, of which each stands for the expectation value of an element [...] of the algebra which can be formed as , and bilinear invariants of a second kind which are constructed with derivatives and represent momentum and energy. Using these terms, they reconstruct the results of quantum mechanics without depending on a particular representation in terms of a wave function nor requiring reference to an external Hilbert space. Consistent with earlier results, the quantum potential of a non-relativistic particle with spin (Pauli particle) is shown to have an additional spin-dependent term, and the momentum of a <b>relativistic</b> <b>particle</b> with spin (Dirac particle) is shown to consist in a linear motion and a rotational part. The two dynamical equations governing the time evolution are re-interpreted as conservation equations. One of them stands for the conservation of energy; the other stands for the conservation of probability and of spin. The quantum potential plays {{the role of}} an internal energy which ensures the conservation of total energy.|$|E

5000|$|Using this {{approach}} to describe <b>relativistic</b> <b>particle</b> quantum mechanics, Hiley and R. E. Callaghan presented a complete relativistic version of the Bohm model for the Dirac particle in analogy to Bohm's approach to the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation, thereby refuting the long-standing misconception that the Bohm model could not be applied in the relativistic domain. Hiley {{pointed out that the}} Dirac particle has a ‘quantum potential’ which is the exact relativistic generalisation of the quantum potential found originally by de Broglie and Bohm. Within the same hierarchy, the twistor of Roger Penrose links to the conformal Clifford algebra C&#x2113;4,2 over the reals, and what Hiley calls the Bohm energy and the Bohm momentum arises directly from the standard energy-momentum tensor.

The two bands touch at the zone corners (the K point in the Brillouin zone), {{where there is a}} zero density of states but no band gap. The graphene sheet thus displays a semimetallic (or zero-gap semiconductor) character, although not if rolled into a carbon nanotube, due to its curvature. Two of the six Dirac points are independent, while the rest are equivalent by symmetry. In the vicinity of the K-points the energy depends linearly on the wave vector, similar to a <b>relativistic</b> <b>particle.</b> Since an elementary cell of the lattice has a basis of two atoms, the wave function has an effective 2-spinor structure.|$|E
