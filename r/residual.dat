5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} can be visualized {{in terms}} of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor. Assume that we wish to cover an a-by-b rectangle with square tiles exactly, where a is the larger of the two numbers. We first attempt to tile the rectangle using b-by-b square tiles; however, this leaves an r0-by-b <b>residual</b> rectangle untiled, where r0 < b. We then attempt to tile the <b>residual</b> rectangle with r0-by-r0 square tiles. This leaves a second <b>residual</b> rectangle r1-by-r0, which we attempt to tile using r1-by-r1 square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no <b>residual</b> rectangle, i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous <b>residual</b> rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle. For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 (shown in red), and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the dimensions of the original rectangle (shown in green).|$|E

For spatial point processes, the concept of <b>residuals</b> has been recently proposed by Baddeley et al.

The present paper focuses on stationary marked Gibbs point processes and deals with asymptotic properties of <b>residuals</b> for such processes. In particular, the consistency and the asymptotic normality are obtained for a wide class of <b>residuals</b> including the classical ones (raw <b>residuals,</b> inverse <b>residuals,</b> Pearson <b>residuals).</b> Based on these asymptotic results, we define goodness-of-fit tests with Type-I error theoretically controlled.
