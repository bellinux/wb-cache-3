This case reflects {{a situation where}} resources are not specialised and can be substituted for each other with no added cost.

More specifically, with constant <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>scale,</b> there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve.

30|$|The {{contribution}} of <b>scale</b> economy <b>to</b> productivity depends on two factors: {{the index of}} <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> and the composite index of inputs growth. If the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> (RTS) is constant, RTS equal to one, change of the scale {{has no effect on}} productivity. However, the variation of scale may have an effect on productivity; no matter the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> is more than one or less than one.

When the RTS is larger than one, the expansion of scale will increase the productivity and the reduction of scale will decrease the productivity; when the RTS is less than one, the results are the opposite.|$|R

The study employed annual secondary data on maize production in Nigeria from 1971 to 2010. Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) were used to estimate the technical efficiency of maize production. The results revealed that, the mean technical efficiency scores were 64. 1 %, 77. 8 % and 87. 7 % for technical efficiency under stochastic frontier analysis, technical efficiency of DEA constant <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> and technical efficiency of DEA variable <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>scale</b> assumptions, respectively.
