40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the topic of basic {{registers}} and specific agendas' activity <b>roles</b> that <b>are</b> analyzed based on a questionnaire survey. It gives the basic overview of e-Government and the basic registers of public administration as part of e-Government. Based on the questionnaire survey conducted on particular Land Register and Register offices the structure and definition of the agenda activity <b>roles</b> <b>are</b> evaluated and the thesis identifies the intensity of various activity roles use in practice. It is concluded that the activity roles of A 124 agenda are defined {{in the way that}} approximately corresponds to the actual execution of the agenda and that all the <b>roles</b> <b>are</b> actually more or less in use. On the contrary, when it comes to A 414 agenda, the number of reported <b>roles</b> <b>is</b> quite maximalist. The thesis reveals that some of the activity <b>roles</b> <b>are</b> not being executed in practice at all, or they are in use only at certain offices. 67 % of both A 124 and A 414 agenda activity <b>roles</b> <b>were</b> proved to be defined the way that fully corresponds to the actual use of these agendas. These activity <b>roles</b> <b>are</b> being used quite often...|$|R

5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only <b>role</b> <b>is</b> that of a surrogate audience.|$|E
5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's <b>role</b> <b>is</b> often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E
