60|$|What {{was honest}} in Enckworth Court was {{that portion of}} the {{original}} edifice which still remained, now degraded to subservient uses. Where the untitled Mountclere of the White Rose faction had spread his knees over the brands, when the place was a castle and not a court, the still- <b>room</b> <b>maid</b> now simmered her preserves; and where Elizabethan mothers and daughters of that sturdy line had tapestried the love-scenes of Isaac and Jacob, boots and shoes were now cleaned and coals stowed away.|$|E

40|$|In the 1930 's, with {{vacancies}} on {{the rise}} and no cash to build anew, many Manhattan landlords chose to revamp their residential housing stock to both make it seem more modern [...] no more dining <b>rooms,</b> <b>maids</b> <b>rooms,</b> and twisting and turning hallways [...] {{and at the same}} time, creating smaller units, which could rent for less and therefore increase the building's rent roll...|$|R

50|$|In later years, as {{physicians}} and apothecaries became more widely spread and {{the products of}} the still room became commercially available, the still room increasingly became an adjunct of the kitchen. The use of the still room devolved to making only jams, jellies, and home-brewed beverages, and it became a store room for perishables such as cakes. The still room was staffed by the housekeeper or cook, then later by the still <b>room</b> <b>maid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The parents {{spend their}} holiday a little {{differently}} than planned. Walter Düwel does not bother with {{going to the beach}} or even playing any sport. He is at loggerheads with Dr. Klotz, the female doctor, and Lorchen, the <b>room</b> <b>maid,</b> who rail against his constant escapades and especially his heavy smoking. Whilst his wife is busy playing sport, Düwel works on his new symphony. As it soon turns out, not without success.|$|E

40|$|Rates of pay in {{the hotel}} and {{catering}} industry are a contentious issue. The industry is traditionally labour intensive and labour costs form a significant proportion of the total running costs of an organisation. On the other hand, the industry has a reputation for low pay, and evidence suggests that pay in the industry consistently falls behind many other industries. Information about pay in the industry is however limited. Existing sources do not provide detailed data on the rates of pay for a range of employees {{in the hotel}} and catering industry. The aim of this research therefore, is to develop a comprehensive study of pay in the industry for particular grades of staff, and also to examine the factors that influence pay in the industry. A survey was conducted throughout Great Britain into rates of pay in the hotel sector, the restaurant sector, the industrial catering sector and the contract catering sector. Rates were found to be generally higher in the industrial catering sector, while the hotel and restaurant sectors tended to have very similar rates of pay. The traditionally female occupations in the industry, such as the <b>room</b> <b>maid</b> and the housekeeper are shown to have some of the lowest rates of pay, and some average rates of pay were below the legal minimum laid down by the Wages Council, The examination of determinants of pay in the industry demonstrates that pay for the unskilled grades of staff is influenced by factors such as the regional and locational situation of the hotel restaurant or unit. As there are variations of demand for labour and alternative job opportunities in different regions and locations around Great Britain, the average rate of pay for unskilled workers fluctuates. The pay of the skilled grades of staff was affected to a greater extent by factors such as the size or the price level of a unit. These factors are mainly indicative of the style of the operation and perhaps the level of skill demanded...|$|E

60|$|Stella {{closed the}} door and looked at her cousin thoughtfully. She had evidently been busy packing. Dresses and hats lay about on the bed, and in the next <b>room</b> the <b>maid</b> was busy {{emptying}} the cupboards. Stella closed the communicating door.|$|R
60|$|She nodded, without glancing in his direction, {{and left}} the <b>room.</b> The <b>maid</b> {{arranged}} the tea-tray and departed. Hester {{showed no signs of}} being aware that anything unusual had happened. She made a little desultory conversation. Mannering answered in monosyllables.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} was originally {{conceived as a}} high-profile residential complex for the Soviet elite and arranged for 100 well-appointed apartments (hence the name).

60|$|At {{the hotel}} {{entrance}} the head porter {{was waiting to}} help her out, and the chauffeur, without a word or look of reminder, puffed away, secure in the reputation Lucius had given to Haney.

60|$|Mr. George and Rollo {{were both}} of them tired and hungry. They first called for <b>rooms.</b> The <b>maid</b> took them up stairs and gave them two small rooms next each other.
