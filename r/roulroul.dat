The Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus) has been observed digging in the rotting wood of deadfall in a similar manner to woodpeckers to extract invertebrates, even bracing itself with aid of its squared tail. The cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichi), crested argus (Rheinardia ocellata), the crested partridge (Rollulus <b>roulroul)</b> and the crested guineafowl (Guttera pucherani) are similar ecologically to the Himalayan monal in that they too forage in rotting wood for termites, ant and beetle larvae, molluscs, crustaceans and young rodents.|$|E

Herein I present an overview of so called cleaner birds based on literature records, field observations, and photo surveys. I found that 101 bird species in 32 families practice cleaning even if some of them do so very occasionally. Cleaner birds range from the renowned Red-billed Oxpecker Buphagus erythrorhynchus from Africa to the little known Crested Partridge Rollulus <b>roulroul</b> from Malaysia. Clients are mostly medium-sized to large herbivores such as iguanas, tortoises, capybaras, and wild and domestic ungulates, but also include carnivores such as seals and seabirds. Some clients adopt particular, posing postures while being cleaned, whereas others are indifferent or even disturbed by the activity of some cleaner species. Capybaras, giant tortoises and iguanas are among the posing clients, whereas most ungulates remain oblivious to cleaners. Features such as omnivorous diet and/or opportunistic behaviour, and the habit of associating in other ways with larger vertebrates are related to cleaning behaviour. Most cleaner birds inhabit open areas, and forestdwelling cleaners seemingly are few...|$|E
