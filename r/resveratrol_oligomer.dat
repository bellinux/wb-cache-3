Recent {{synthetic}} approaches {{towards the}} resveratrol family of oligomeric natural products This chapter outlines {{some of the}} past and present efforts in the field of resveratrol-based oligomeric natural product synthesis. Both biosynthetic approaches and stepwise synthetic approaches are discussed to present the current level of understanding regarding the controlled synthesis of these molecules in order to place the studies described in chapter 2 and 3 in better context.

40|$|Numerous {{reports of}} therapeutically {{relevant}} biological activities of resveratrol (3, 4 ʹ, 5 -trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) and oligomers derived therefrom have stimulated widespread {{interest in these}} natural products. In spite of this, their chemical synthesis has only recently been targeted. This is largely {{a symptom of the}} historically enigmatic mechanisms of action of polyphenols, which has precluded their clinical development. If the therapeutic potential of polyphenolic natural products such as the <b>resveratrol</b> <b>oligomers</b> is to be realized, synthetic advances must be made in order to confirm/refute the biological activities ascribed to oligomers obtained from isolates, to determine which scaffolds hold promise as small molecule chemopreventives and/or chemotherapeutics, and to enable structural modification for both structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies and the development of more potent congeners. The work described herein seeks to address the above issues through collaborative research, combining novel methods for chemical synthesis, physical chemistry and chemical biology in an effort to elucidate the mechanism(s) of biological activity of resveratrol and its derivatives and shed light on potential of plant-derived antioxidants in pathophysiology wherein oxidative stress has been implicated. Chapter 1 summarizes the biosynthesis and biological activities of resveratrol derived natural products in order to contextualize our biomimetic synthetic strategy and provide justification for our research objectives. Chapter 2 describes the development of a highly efficient and scalable oxidative dimerization of tert-butylated resveratrol derivatives, which for the first time has rendered biomimetic synthesis a viable approach for the controlled preparation of useful quantities of <b>resveratrol</b> <b>oligomers.</b> This method was showcased in the synthesis of dimeric natural products pallidol (6 steps/ 26 % yield) and quadrangularin A (5 steps/ 54 % yield), each representing the most efficient synthesis (either biomimetic or de novo) to date.

This study presents a detailed and thorough examination of REVs, including chemical structures, natural resources, and biological activities, during the period of 2010 – 2017. Ninety-two new REVs compounds, including 39 dimers, 23 trimers, 13 tetramers, six resveratrol monomers, six hexamers, four pentamers, and one octamer, have been reported from the families of Dipterocarpaceae, Paeoniaceae, Vitaceae, Leguminosae, Gnetaceae, Cyperaceae, Polygonaceae Gramineae, and Poaceae. Amongst these families, Dipterocarpaceae, with 50 REVs, accounts for the majority, and seven genera of Dipterocarpaceae are involved, including Vatica, Vateria, Shorea, Hopea, Neobalanocarpus, Dipterocarpus, and Dryobalanops.

40|$|Inhibitors of cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) {{have been widely}} used for characterizing CFTR function in epithelial fluid transport and in diseases such as secretory diarrhea, polycystic kidney disease and {{cystic fibrosis}}. Few small molecule CFTR inhibitors have been discovered so far from combinatorial compound library. In the present study, we used a high throughput screening (HTS) -based natural product discovery strategy to identify new CFTR inhibitors from Chinese medicinal herbs. By screening 40, 000 small molecule fractions from 500 herbal plants, we identified 42 positive fractions from 5 herbs and isolated two compounds that inhibited CFTR conductance from Chinese wild grapevine (Vitis amurensis Rupr). Mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies determined the two active compounds as trans-e-viniferin (TV) and r- 2 -viniferin (RV), respectively. Both compounds dose-dependently blocked CFTR-mediated iodide influx with IC 50 around 20 mM. Further analysis by excised inside-out patch-clamp indicated strong inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) -activated CFTR chloride currents by TV and RV. In ex vivo studies, TV and RV inhibited CFTR-mediated short-circuit Cl 2 currents in isolated rat colonic mucosa in a dose-dependent manner. In a closed-loop mouse model, intraluminal applications of TV (2. 5 mg) and RV (4. 5 mg) significantly reduced cholera toxin–induced intestinal fluid secretion.

40|$|The {{intake of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} is associated with beneficial effects on human health. Polyphenols are discussed to {{play a key role in}} this process. Several in vitro studies suggest an anti-inflammatory effect of polyphenols mediated by a modulation of the cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) activity. However, the low bioavailability of polyphenols is a limiting factor for their effects in vivo. Therefore, the first part of this thesis aims to investigate the bioavailability of the <b>resveratrol</b> <b>oligomers</b> ?-viniferin and hopeaphenol. Microsomal incubations were applied to study the metabolic stability of both oligomers. The intestinal absorption was investigated in the Caco- 2 cellular transwell system. The second part of the thesis aims to comprehensively characterize the effects of polyphenols on COX- 2 activity in a tiered approach. For this purpose a fast online-solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography method with mass spectrometric detection was developed for the quantification of the COX products thromboxane B 2, prostaglandin E 2, and prostaglandin D 2. Applying this method, the effects of selected polyphenols on COX- 2 were investigated in three different in vitro test systems: (i) enzyme assay, (ii) a cancer cell line, and (iii) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated primary human monocytes. In the next step, a suitable in vivo model for the characterization of COX- 2 inhibitory effects was identified based on targeted metabolomics of the arachidonic acid cascade. With this approach changes in oxylipin pattern in different animal models of inflammation were characterized. Finally, the in vivo relevance of the COX- 2 activity modulation by polyphenols was investigated in LPS induced murine sepsis. The results of the experiments showed that despite a moderate in vitro activity the selected polyphenols were not able to reduce COX- 2 activity in vivo. Extrapolating from the animal model to humans, the results suggest that an effect of food polyphenols on COX- 2 activity in acute inflammation is unlikely...|$|R

40|$|Research {{interest}} in resveratrol, a structurally simple plant metabolite, has increased exponentially {{in the last}} two decades. Since its isolation from red wine it has been hypothesized that this structure may account for the so-called "French Paradox," the notion that despite a diet high in cholesterol one can enjoy a relatively healthy lifestyle through moderate red wine consumption. The biological implications of these claims are presented. Concurrently isolated along with resveratrol are hundreds of oligomeric natural products with structures varying in both size and complexity. The discovery, biosynthesis, and previous synthetic studies towards these natural products will be presented to frame the landscape of the field and its current limitations. Heimiol A and hopeahainol D are oxidized, resveratrol dimers characterized by their [3. 2. 2] bicyclic framework with a bridging ether. The total synthesis of these epimeric natural products was accomplished by the development of a halolactonization/Friedel-Crafts cascade to construct the bicyclic core. Subsequently, a steric bias inherent in the molecule was doubly exploited to synthesize both targets with complete selectivity. During the course of these studies, a number of unexpected results were observed which have led, or may potentially lead, to alternate courses of investigation. These results and their potential impact are also presented. Well-established in the synthetic community are the challenges associated with medium-sized ring construction. Of particularly rarity are solutions addressing all carbon 9 -membered rings. Seeing this motif present in a subclass of <b>resveratrol</b> <b>oligomers,</b> we sought to investigate this challenging substructure. Our efforts to achieve this end are detailed with the successful development of two unique methods to construct the requisite 9 -membered ring core. One succeeded in the first ever reported 9 -exo-dig cyclization while the other enabled the robust total synthesis of caraphenol A. [1. 1. 1]-orthocyclophanes have received considerable attention of late due to their numerous applications in the field of supramolecular chemistry. Owing to their rigid, bowl shape, these scaffolds are capable of engaging in numerous guest-host complexes. The previous syntheses of [1. 1. 1]-orthocyclophanes as well as a survey of their applications are presented. In the course of our synthetic studies toward caraphenol A, we accomplished the synthesis of a unique [1. 1. 1]-orthocyclophane as well as the successful oxidation to its corresponding triketone. These results are presented noting that despite many efforts, no other [1. 1. 1]-orthocyclophane triketone has ever been successfully synthesized with our work constituting the first such report...|$|R
40|$|Stilbenes are {{secondary}} metabolites {{produced by}} grapevine {{in response to}} stress, which {{play the role of}} phytoalexins in the plant (1). Recently, stilbenes have received {{a great deal of attention}} both for their biological role in the plant and for their well-proven biological activities on human health (1). Plant cell cultures have been investigated for their potential as valuable system for stilbene production (2). Among different elicitors, methyl jasmonate (MeJa) was shown to be the most effective in stimulating stilbene biosynthesis in cell suspension cultures of cultivar Italia (2). In the plant, the accumulation of stilbenes is induced by the presence of phytopathogenic fungi (3) or by abiotic stimuli as UV radiation (4). Different stilbenes produced by grapevine show a synergistic activity, furthermore the quali-quantitative composition of stilbene content determines the resistance against specific pathogens. The species Vitis vinifera includes several cultivars quite different from the genetic point of view, since they are exclusively agamic propagated. Consequently, each of these shows different levels of susceptibility to pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea, Aspergillus spp. and Plasmopara viticola in relation to the different stilbene profile. Recently, great interest has been also addressed for species of Vitis popularly known as “american grapes”, introduced in Europe as rootstocks due to their resistance against some important pathogens of V. vinifera. At present, resistance mechanisms of the american grapes are still unknown. The few avaiable data has been obtained from samples cultivated in field, where the conditions are not fully under control. Our study is focused on the biosynthesis of stilbenes, firstly resveratrol (the main exponent) and viniferins (<b>resveratrol</b> <b>oligomers),</b> in response to biotic stress in cell cultures of several Vitis species. Stilbene content was compared in cell extracts obtained from Vitis spp. cell lines subjected to elicitation with MeJa, grown under continuous darkness or 16 / 8 h (light/dark) photoperiod. The main stilbenes involved in resistance against phytopathogenic fungi were identified and quantified by means of HPLC. Unexpectedly, the obtained results indicate that cultivars of V. vinifera have a higher stilbene content than the american grapes. For instance, V. vinifera cv. Malvasia, in response to MeJa, increases the production of total stilbenes from 2. 58 to 15. 58 mg/g DW while Vitis rupestris cv. du Lot increases from 2. 80 to 8. 97 mg/g DW.

Different stilbenes produced by grape show a synergistic activity, furthermore the quali-quantitative composition of the stilbenic content determines the resistance against specific pathogens. The species Vitis vinifera includes several cultivars quite different from the genetic point of view, since they are exclusively agamic propagated.

The role of light on stilbene production in the same cell cultures will also be investigated. Unespectedly, the obtained results indicate that cultivars of V. vinifera have a richer stilbenic content than the american grapes.

Mitochondria are both a source of and target for ONOO−. Our aim was to identify specific mitochondrial proteins that display enhanced tyr-N after cardiac IR injury, and to explore whether inhibiting O 2 −/ONOO− during IR decreases mitochondrial protein tyr-N and consequently improves cardiac function. We show here that IR increased tyr-N of 35 and 15 kDa mitochondrial proteins using Western blot analysis with 3 -nitrotyrosine antibody. Immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by LC–MS/MS identified 13 protein candidates for tyr-N. IP and Western blot identified and confirmed that the 35 kDa tyr-N protein is the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). Tyr-N of native cardiac VDAC with IR was verified on recombinant (r) VDAC with exogenous ONOO−. We also found that ONOO− directly enhanced rVDAC channel activity, and rVDAC tyr-N induced by ONOO− formed <b>oligomers.</b> <b>Resveratrol</b> (RES), a scavenger of O 2 −/ONOO−, reduced the tyr-N levels of both native and recombinant VDAC, while L-NAME, which inhibits NO generation, only reduced tyr-N levels of native VDAC.

40|$|Grape is qualitatively and quantitatively {{very rich}} in polyphenols. In particular, anthocyanins, flavonols and {{stilbene}} derivatives play very {{important roles in}} plant metabolism, thanks to their peculiar characteristics. Anthocyanins {{are responsible for the}} color of red grapes and wines and confer organoleptic characteristics on the wine. They are used for chemotaxonomic studies and to evaluate the polyphenolic ripening stage of grape. They are natural colorants, have antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic activity, exert protective effects on the human cardiovascular system, and are used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Stilbenes are vine phytoalexins present in grape berries and associated with the beneficial effects of drinking wine. The principal stilbene, resveratrol, is characterized by anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective activity. <b>Resveratrol</b> dimers and <b>oligomers</b> also occur in grape, and are synthetized by the vine as active defenses against exogenous attack, or produced by extracellular enzymes released from pathogens in an attempt to eliminate undesirable toxic compounds. Flavonols are a ubiquitous class of flavonoids with photo-protection and copigmentation (together with anthocyanins) functions. The lack of expression of the enzyme flavonoid 3 &# 039;, 5 &# 039;-hydroxylase in white grapes restricts the presence of these compounds to quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin derivatives, whereas red grapes usually also contain myricetin, laricitrin and syringetin derivatives.

The obtained formulations can also be used in other fields where there is an increase in oxidative stress in the h uman body, such as exposure to ionizing radiation at radiodiagnostic purpose or radiotherapy (3). This study is part of the project PAPARD (2014 - 034 R. 0 financed by ASI).
