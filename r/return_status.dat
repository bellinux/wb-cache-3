A few primitives {{were added to the}} runtime to support sending with a boolean <b>return</b> <b>status,</b> calling close with an optional error argument, and retrieving the error status for a channel. Also, the implementation for send, receive, and select had to change to disregard sends and receives on closed channels, without panicking, and returning an error in the case of sends.|$|E

The beam diagnostic system for HIRFL had been developed and used for years, and the system is being improved continuously to satisfy the requirements of the operation and beam tuning of HIRFL. This paper describes the present status and development of the beam diagnostic system at HIRFL. 1 Introduction The beam diagnostic system for HIRFL is a distributed microcomputer system, which can be divided into three layers. In the top layer, the microcomputer control station manages the diagnostic system of HIRFL and offers manmachine interfaces and operation functions used by operators. In the middle layer, the CAMAC system with serial highway and function modules receive commands from the computer and <b>return</b> <b>status</b> and measurements information.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{an emerging}} technology which promises to bring with it great benefits to {{all types of}} computing activities including business support. However, the full commitment to Cloud computing necessary to gain the full benefit is a major project for any organisation, since it necessitates adoption of new business processes and attitudes to computing services {{in addition to the}} immediately obvious systems changes. Hence the evaluation of a Cloud computing project needs to consider the balance of benefits and risks to the organisation in the full context of the environment in which it operates; it is not sufficient or appropriate to examine technical considerations alone. In this paper we consider the application of CAPM, a well established approach used for the analysis of risks and benefits of commercial projects to Cloud adoption projects and propose a revised and improved technique, OSM. To support the validity of OSM, two full case studies are presented. In the first we describe an application of the approach to the iSolutions Group at University of Southampton, which focuses on evaluations of Cloud Computing service improvement. We then illustrate the use of OSM for measuring learning satisfaction of two cohort groups at the University of Greenwich. The results confirm the advantages of using OSM. We conclude that OSM can analyse the risk and <b>return</b> <b>status</b> of Cloud Computing services and help organisations that adopt Cloud Computing to evaluate and review their Cloud Computing projects and services. OSM is an emerging service and analytics model supported by several case studies. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Throughout North America, {{many species}} of aerial insectivorous birds – birds that capture flying insects – have {{exhibited}} sharp declines, with tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) experiencing a 2. 8 % annual decline in Canada since 1989. The timing of these declines coincides with major changes in agriculture, perhaps signaling a potential causal link. Declines may be influenced indirectly by agriculturally-driven reductions in the abundance of the swallow’s main diet of aerial insects through increased agrochemical use, wetland drainage and cropping intensity. My objectives were to determine how aerial insect abundance and biomass vary across an agricultural landscape in the Canadian Prairies, and determine how breeding tree swallows respond in terms of (i) foraging behaviours and return rates, (ii) body condition, and (iii) selected physiological responses (i. e. oxidative stress and feather corticosterone). Artificial nest-boxes were erected at each of 5 sites with varying levels of agricultural intensification in south-central Saskatchewan, 2012 - 2014. Insect abundance and biomass were monitored daily using passive aerial samplers {{at each of the}} sites throughout the breeding season. Tree swallows adults (n = 596) and nestlings (n = 1107) from each nest were captured, banded, measured and blood and feather sampled to determine condition and physiological status. In 2014, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology was employed at a subset of nest-boxes to determine adult foraging rates and durations. Despite strong differences in land use characteristics among sites, insect abundance and biomass varied by year but were similar between heavily cropped and grassland references sites. Regardless, birds responded to temporal changes in prey abundance and differences were found in measurements of foraging behavior and physiological measures of oxidative stress. Adult foraging rate (number of nest visits/hour) was primarily influenced by wind and nestling age, but was also positively related to daily insect biomass. Foraging intervals (i. e., length of time spent on each trip) differed between agricultural intensities; birds on agricultural sites spent more time away from the nest box, presumably foraging, suggesting reduced nest attentiveness. Return rates were primarily predicted by body condition and brood size from the previous breeding season, but were also higher on grassland sites, suggesting that agricultural sites may be less favorable. Older adults (based on banding records) and females displayed a higher body condition than did younger individuals and males, respectively. Measures of physiology (i. e. total antioxidant counts and oxidative damage) in both adult and nestling swallows were primarily driven by temporal changes in insect biomass and abundance. Similarly, adult body mass and physiology were related to local insect availability, but not land use (agriculture/grassland). Measures of nestling feather corticosterone were unrelated to any of the explanatory variables. These results provide valuable information pertaining to components of individual quality, foraging behaviour, and <b>return</b> <b>status</b> in response to prey availability under differing agricultural land use regimes, which may help to inform conservation strategies for a variety of insectivorous bird species of conservation concern...|$|E
