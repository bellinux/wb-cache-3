5|$|The Platanistidae were {{originally}} thought to hold only one species (the South Asian river dolphin), {{but based on}} differences in skull structure, vertebrae and lipid composition, scientists declared the two populations as separate species in the early 1970s.

5|$|Borax, its mineral form {{then known}} as tincal, glazes were used in China from AD 300, and some crude borax reached the West, where the Persian alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān {{apparently}} mentioned it in AD 700. Marco Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was <b>recognized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hot springs (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, and became known as sal sedativum, with primarily medical uses. The rare mineral is called sassolite, which is found at Sasso, Italy. Sasso was {{the main source of}} European borax from 1827 to 1872, when American sources replaced it. Boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus {{and his son}} Diadumenianus were {{declared}} hostes, {{enemies of}} the state, by the Senate immediately after news had arrived of their deaths {{and as part of}} an official declaration of support for the usurper Elagabalus, who was <b>recognized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate as the new Emperor. The declaration of hostes led to two actions being taken against the images of the former Emperors. First, their portraits were destroyed and their names were stricken from inscriptions and papyrii. The second action, taken by the Roman soldiers who had rebelled against Macrinus in favour of Elagabalus, was to destroy all of the works and possessions of Macrinus. The damnatio memoriae against Macrinus is among the earliest of such sanctions enacted by the Senate. Many of the marble busts of Macrinus that exist were defaced and mutilated {{as a response to the}} damnatio memoriae and many of the coins depicting Macrinus and Diadumenianus were also destroyed. These actions against Macrinus are evidence of his unpopularity in Rome.|$|E

5|$|Magnapop {{established}} their fan {{base in the}} early 1990s through touring and the festival circuit—particularly in central Europe, where they first broke through to the mainstream. It was only after they had established a fan base in Europe and received positive press in the United Kingdom that the band first became <b>recognized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, including their native Atlanta. By the end of 1992, they were getting positive write-ups in American press such as The New York Times and supported Juliana Hatfield on tour. The group made appearances at Rocking Kolonia Festival in Maastricht in 1992, Pukkelpop in 1992, Transmusicales in 1992, A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise in 1993, and the Reading Festival in 1993. They also recorded a John Peel session on September 2, 1993 and a Black Session on February 25, 1994.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1980s crimes {{involving}} {{computers were}} dealt with using existing laws.

Over {{the next few years}} the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright, privacy/harassment (e.g., cyber bullying, cyber stalking, and online predators) and child pornography. It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences. Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983. This was followed by the US Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and the British Computer Misuse Act in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Several suborders of stegocephalians were <b>recognized</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries. Animals now {{regarded}} as temnospondyls were primarily labyrinthodonts, but some were {{classified in the}} Branchiosauria. Branchiosaurs were small-bodied and had simple conical teeth, while labyrinthodonts were larger and had complex, folded dentin and enamel in their teeth. Branchiosauria included only a few forms, such as Branchiosaurus from Europe and Amphibamus from North America, that had poorly developed bones, external gills, and no ribs. Some skeletons of Amphibamus were later found with long ribs, prompting its reassignment to Microsauria (although more detailed studies {{found it to be}} a temnospondyl). Soft tissue, such as scales and external gills, were found in many well-preserved branchiosaur fossils from Germany. In the early 20th century, branchiosaurs would be recognized as larval forms of temnospondyls lacking many of the typical features that define the group, and is no longer recognized as a distinct group.|$|E
