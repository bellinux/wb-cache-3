5|$|Before {{setting off}} for Paris, Carrouges first visited Argentan {{to meet with}} Count Pierre and there announcing his {{intention}} of continuing to the capital. What followed was a sequence of events which will forever remain unclear but which would have a dramatic effect {{on the lives of}} all concerned. What is certain is that Carrouges encountered his rival Jacques Le Gris at the court of Count Pierre and words were exchanged, although what was said is unknown. In contrast to his bankrupt rival, Le Gris had not been on the Scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in Carrouges' absence. Le Gris also had a reputation as a fierce and strong soldier in addition to that of a notorious womaniser, a <b>reputation</b> <b>that</b> may have played a part in the allegations which followed.|$|E

Julia Bray, the current holder , was appointed in 2012. She is the 15th Laudian Professor, and the first woman to hold the position.

5|$|Edgar Allan Poe, whose poetry {{had been}} {{included}} in Griswold's anthology, published a critical response that questioned which poets were included. This began a rivalry which grew when Griswold succeeded Poe as editor of Graham's Magazine at a higher salary than Poe's. Later, the two competed {{for the attention of}} poet Frances Sargent Osgood. They never reconciled their differences and, after Poe's mysterious death in 1849, Griswold wrote an unsympathetic obituary. Claiming to be Poe's chosen literary executor, he began a campaign to harm Poe's <b>reputation</b> <b>that</b> lasted until his own death eight years later.|$|E

These included lectures on the diseases spread by flies, and how good hygiene and the prevention of flies breeding could stop typhoid.

After another disappointing loss, Manning had developed a reputation of being unable to make it to a championship, a <b>reputation</b> <b>that</b> followed him from college after he was unable to win an NCAA title with the Tennessee Volunteers (who won a title the year after he graduated).
