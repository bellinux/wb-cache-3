2500|$|M.mexicanus <b>repletes</b> also vary in {{the content}} of their [...] "honey" [...] or food they carry. They can be {{classified}} according to the colors of their distended abdomens: dark amber, amber, milky and clear. Each color is thought to correspond with a particular food source. Dark amber and amber <b>repletes</b> contain sugars such as glucose and fructose, mostly likely from the nectar of flowers. Milky <b>repletes</b> contain large amounts of protein and oils, believed to be from insect prey. Clear <b>repletes</b> contain mostly water and sucrose (sugar), so they are thought to act as water storage for the arid climate. Burgett & Young (1974) found that a small percentage of <b>repletes</b> had two visible layers of liquid in their crops– one consisting of sugars, and the other of lipids, glycerol and cholesterol esters.|$|R

40|$|Mouse {{forebrain}} minces were incubated in a Krebs or a lithium high K+ (L. K.) Krebs medium, cytoplasmic (S 3) {{and crude}} vesicular (P 3) fractions prepared and {{the levels of}} choline and acetylcholine (ACh) in each, determined. ACh levels were depleted by 70 % in the P 3 fraction of L. K. Krebs as compared to Krebs, incubated minces; while, s 3 ACh levels were not significantly altered by the lithium incubation. Lithium treatment lowered the s 3 choline content by 29 %, with no significant effect upon P 3 choline levels, when compared to s 3 and P 3 fractions of contralateral minces incubated in Krebs media. Minces, depleted of P 3 ACh, were subsequently incubated in Krebs containing paraoxon (0. luM) and 0. lmN concentrations of either 14 c choline or 14 c homocholine. Depletion of P 3 ACh resulted in an enhanced transport of extracellular 14 c choline (84 %) and 14 c homocholine (76 %), into this fraction but not into the s 3 fraction. Furthermore, the depleted P 3 fraction was <b>repleted</b> with newly synthesized 14 c ACh or 14 c acetylhomocholine (14 c AHc). The ratio of 14 c ACh to the total ACh in the <b>repleted</b> P 3 fraction (0. 63), exceeded that attained in the s 3 fraction, (0. 35). Additionally, the ratio of 14 c AHc to ACh in the <b>repleted</b> P 3 fraction (7. 26), was greater than that attained in the s 3 fraction (0. 44). Similar results were obtained when mouse brain hippocampal minces were depleted of P 3 ACh and subsequently incubated in Krebs containing 14 c homocholine (0. lmM). The ratio of 14 c AHc to ACh in the <b>repleted</b> P 3 fraction (1. 50), exceeded that ratio attained in the s 3 fraction. Incubation of depleted forebrain minces in Krebs containing the preformed products 14 c ACh or 14 c AHc, in 0. lmM concentrations, {{did not result in}} an increased transport, or the repletion of the P 3 fraction with labeled product. However, depletion of P 3 ACh in hippocampal minces, did result in a greater accumulation of preformed 14 c AHc into the <b>repleted</b> fraction, resulting in a higher ratio of 14 c AHc to ACh in the <b>repleted</b> P 3 fraction (0. 17), as compared to the P 3 fraction of nondepleted minces, (0. 11). The amount of preformed 14 c AHc transported into the <b>repleted</b> P 3 fraction was insufficient, however, to replace lost transmitter. These results indicate that depletion of P 3 transmitter stores, occurs independently of the cytoplasm with newly synthesized product formed from extracellular precursor...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Treatment with {{anti-resorptive}} agents over 13 {{months was}} associated with for three to fivefold lower bone mineral density changes and 1. 5 -fold increased risk of incidence fracture in vitamin D insufficient as compared to vitamin D <b>repleted</b> postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Introduction: Several drugs were registered {{for the treatment of}} osteoporosis on the basis of clinical trials in which vitamin D repletion was a pre-requisite inclusion criteria and vitamin D supplements were used as adjunctive therapy. However, in routine clinical practice these supplements are not consistently recommended. Methods: We studied 1515 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis under treatment with anti-resorbing agents (alendronate, risedronate, raloxifene) for 13. 1 months with an adherence > 75 %. The patients were classified as vitamin D deficient (N = 514) or vitamin D <b>repleted</b> (N = 1001) according to risk factors (N = 1062) or the level of 25 (OH) vitamin D [25 (OH) D] above or below 50 nmol/l (N = 453). Results: Vitamin D deficient and vitamin D <b>repleted</b> subjects differed significantly for annualized spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) changes adjusted for all available confounding factors (type of treatment, age, global calcium intake, baseline BMD values). One hundred fifty one patients suffered from a new incident clinical fracture. The adjusted odds ratio for incident fractures in vitamin D deficient as compared to vitamin D <b>repleted</b> women was 1. 77 (1. 20 - 2. 59, 95 % CI; p = 0. 004). Conclusions: Optimal vitamin D repletion seems to be necessary to maximize the response to anti-resorbers in terms of both BMD changes and anti-fracture efficacy. © 2008 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation...|$|R

The characters frequently travel through time to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year ∞), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the Wings of Time, nicknamed the Epoch. The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.|$|E
5|$|The James Bay {{hydroelectric}} dam complex contains several {{relatively short}} 735kV power lines that send electricity to three principal substations, ordered from west to east: Radisson, Chissibi, and Lemoyne.

5|$|In his foreword, Kwee {{wrote that}} Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang was {{intended}} to lead readers to consider how fate is often {{at odds with the}} wants of those involved. Critical readings have, however, been diverse. The sinologist Myra Sidharta notes that the book is <b>replete</b> with mysticism common at the time, as does another sinologist, John Kwee. The latter cites four examples: a dream of Marsiti's, later shown to be prophetic, in which she is forcibly separated from Aij Tjeng despite his previous promise that they would never part; a discussion of reuniting with loved ones after death; Marsiti's spirit attending her daughter's wedding; and a scene {{towards the end of the}} novel in which Marsiti's spirit guides Roosminah's daughter to pick flowers for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Nio Joe Lan, in his history of Chinese Malay literature, notes that Kwee was the only Chinese writer of romances to also write on Eastern (particularly Chinese) philosophy. He finds mysticism to be a common theme in Kwee's works, noting it as particularly well-developed in the later novel Soemangetnja Boenga Tjempaka (The Joy of the Cempaka Flowers).|$|E

Also renovated was Saltwell Dene, a picturesque wooded area with a stream, bridges, cascades and a lily pond which inspired local artist Thomas Miles Richardson to paint a watercolour of it in the 19thcentury. Saltwell Dene was the final part of the 21stcentury restoration project to be completed, reopening to the public in March 2005. At either end of the Broadwalk there are two wooden shelters whilst the centre of the Broadwalk is marked by the Almond Pavilion. The pavilion was opened in 1881 and was a refreshment pavilion for decades before it fell into disrepair; by the 1980s it was derelict and it was then completely destroyed by fire. It has been fully reconstructed, including a replica of the original clock tower, and is once more a refreshment kiosk with new toilet facilities. It offers panoramic views into the northern fields and across the boating lake. An oriental garden was opened in 2011 to mark the twenty-year anniversary of the twinning arrangement between Gateshead and Komatsu. This includes a gravel pond, waterfalls and stone lanterns.
