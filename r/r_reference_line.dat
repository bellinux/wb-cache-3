40|$|Objective To {{localize}} {{the site}} of motor points within human biceps brachii muscles through surface mapping using electrophysiological method. Method We recorded the compound muscle action potentials of each lattice of the biceps brachii in 40 healthy subjects. Standardized <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> were made as the following: 1) a horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> (elbow crease) and 2) a vertical <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> connecting coracoid process and mid-point of the horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>line.</b> Th e Compound muscle action potentials were mapped {{in reference to the}} standardized <b>reference</b> <b>lines.</b> Th e locations of motor points were mapped to the skin surface, in the ratio to the length of the vertical and the half of the horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>lines.</b> Results The motor point of the short head of biceps was located at 69. 0 ± 4. 9 % distal and 19. 1 ± 9. 5 % medial to the mid-point of horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>line.</b> The location of the motor point of the long head of the biceps was 67. 3 ± 4. 3 % distal and 21. 4 ± 8. 7 % lateral. Th e motor point of the short head of the biceps was located more medially and distally in the male subjects compared to that in the female (p< 0. 05). Conclusion Th is study showed electrophysiological motor points of the biceps brachii muscles through surface mapping.

40|$|Traditional intra {{prediction}} usually utilizes {{the nearest}} <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> {{to generate the}} predicted block when considering strong spatial correlation. However, this kind of single line-based method does not always work well due to at least two issues. One is the incoherence caused by the signal noise or the texture of other object, where this texture deviates from the inherent texture of the current block. The other {{reason is that the}} nearest <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> usually has worse reconstruction quality in block-based video coding. Due to these two issues, this paper proposes an efficient multiple line-based intra prediction scheme to improve coding efficiency. Besides the nearest <b>reference</b> <b>line,</b> further <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> are also utilized. The further <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> with relatively higher quality can provide potential better prediction. At the same time, the residue compensation is introduced to calibrate the prediction of boundary regions in a block when we utilize further <b>reference</b> <b>lines.</b> To speed up the encoding process, this paper designs several fast algorithms. Experimental results show that, compared with HM- 16. 9, the proposed fast search method achieves 2. 0 % bit saving on average and up to 3. 7 %, with increasing the encoding time by 112 %.

In addition, this paper conducted experiments to characterize the behavior of fixing full-scale photogrammetric models in construction applications. In this experiment, factors including relative position of the <b>reference</b> <b>lines,</b> number of <b>reference</b> <b>lines,</b> and spatial relationships of the <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> were considered. The surveying results were then compared with ground truth data, which allows for accuracy determination and aids in determining the best strategy in selecting <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> for scale fixing. The review and the experimental findings may help construction professionals better understand the performance of the photogrammetry technology and apply it in their real-world projects.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{applicability}} {{of a newly}} introduced non-anatomical soft and hard tissue cephalometric centroid line (S&H centroid) was investigated. The “S&H centroid” line established from 12 ″× 14 ″ lateral cephalometric radiographs of 57 selected adults {{was used as a}} base to create a new cephalometric <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> “Centroid-Nasion”. The reliability {{and the use of the}} newly created “Centroid-Nasion” as a <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> was tested against the conventional “Sella-Nasion” cephalometric <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> to evaluate the sagittal and vertical maxillary and mandibular relationship. Pearson’s correlation coefficient, one way ANOVA, and Tukey multiple comparison post Hoc statistical tests were used. The digitization technique was reliable. The “Centroid-Nasion” cephalometric <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> created by utilizing the “S&H centroid” line, was found to be as useful as the conventional “Sella-Nasion” cephalometric plane in establishing and differentiating between sagittal and vertical intermaxillary relationships...|$|R

40|$|Five midsagittal pelvic <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> {{have been}} {{employed}} to quantify prolapse using MRI. However, {{the lack of}} standardization makes study results difficult to compare. Using MRI scans from 149 women, we demonstrate how use of existing <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> can systematically affect measurements in three distinct ways: in oblique line systems, distances measured to the <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> vary with antero-posterior location; soft issue-based <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> can underestimate organ movement relative to the pelvic bones; and systems defined relative to the MR scanner are affected by intra- and interindividual differences in the pelvic inclination angle at rest and strain. Thus, we propose a standardized approach called the Pelvic Inclination Correction System (PICS). Based on bony structures and the body axis, the PICS system corrects for variation in pelvic inclination, at rest of straining, and allows for the standardized measurement of organ displacement {{in the direction of}} prolapse...|$|R
40|$|Perineal {{ultrasound}} {{is facing}} {{the development of a}} standardization process. One important aspect in this process is the choice of an appropriate <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> for the evaluation of the urogenital anatomy. For this purpose, two major <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> have been proposed in international literature: a horizontal line by Dietz and a central pubic line by Schaer. Inspired by the advantages and being aware of the disadvantages of these two lines, we created a new <b>reference</b> <b>line,</b> which can be drawn between the hyperechoic contours of os pubis and ligamentum arcuatum. The image orientation is set as usual in Germany. As a first step towards the implementation of the new method, we chose to compare the reliability of the three <b>reference</b> <b>lines.</b> Before this could be done, however, the central pubic line had to be excluded from the analysis because of a very low rate of possible assessment. This problem is already known in literature. Especially inexperienced examiners should therefore avoid the use of this <b>reference</b> <b>line.</b> Concerning the resulting values, there is a marked difference between the two remaining reference lines: The new line produces much greater values, which is why the two lines should not be in parallel use. In literature, there is evidence that the new line produced more realistic values than the horizontal line. This, however, has to be verified by validation studies. The reliability analysis revealed – despite of some major outliers – a trend towards a better reproducibility with the horizontal line by Dietz. Nevertheless, both <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> definitely showed very good repeatability. Probably, minor differences may be neglected, which depends on the result of validation studies. Furthermore, it was observed that for the measurement of parameters during rest, any rest can be chosen, no matter if right at the beginning or after Valsalva, pelvic floor contraction or coughing. This does not influence the result. It could also be shown that there is no significant difference between resulting values during coughing and Valsalva. Concerning this issue, literature presents diverging opinions. To sum up, the newly generated <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> attains similar reliability parameters compared to the horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> by Dietz, which is already established. The new line is compatible with the standard image orientation of Germany. Particularly for inexperienced examiners, both <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> are more suitable than the central pubic line by Schaer. Before using the new <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> in routine, validation studies should be performed. As mentioned earlier, a parallel use cannot be recommended...|$|R

30|$|It {{is still}} {{controversial}} which <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> is suitable to estimate pelvic floor disorders. For grading POP, we usually utilize horizontal line (HL) running the vaginal introitus horizontally. In order to grade pelvic organ prolapse, {{the distance from}} HL to the inferior margin of each pelvic organ is measured because we presume that it may correspond with the clinical examination. But seen {{the fact that this}} line can be moved with patient’s strain, we had to choose another line fixed by bony landmarks seen on MRI to evaluate the vaginal axis. The pubococcygeal line (PCL) was adapted as a <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> for this purpose. In fact, PCL is the most commonly used <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> in the assessment of pelvic organ prolapse [10, 23]. We detected some differences in the results between the two <b>reference</b> <b>lines.</b> Since the HL could move with maximal strain and the change of vaginal axis may be masked, we suppose that the data of PCL are more reliable than those of HL.|$|R

30|$|This paper reviews photogrammetric error {{sources and}} their impacts on {{modeling}} and surveying for construction quantity takeoff, quality control, and site safety monitoring applications. These error sources include camera internal parameters (i.e., type, principal point, principal distance, and camera lens distortion coefficients), imaging settings (i.e., shooting distances, baselines, percentage of photo overlaps, number of overlapping photos, camera intersection angles, and angles of incidence), and processing software programs. To augment {{the body of}} knowledge on photogrammetric modeling errors, this paper further conducts experiment, which concerns characterization {{of the behavior of}} different strategies in selecting <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> for fixing absolute scale of photogrammetric models. In construction photogrammetric surveying, it is imperative to convert the relative scale of a 3 D model into absolute measurements so geometric measurements can be taken. Previous work suggests this can be done through the determination of a <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> in absolute units; however, the position and quantity of <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> has not been investigated. This experiment attempts to tackle this issue. The result shows that one horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> {{in the middle of the}} object performed with consistent accuracy, but if a specific area on the object needs more accurate measurements, it is best to select a <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> in that area. The review and the experimental findings may help construction professionals better understand the performance of the photogrammetric surveying and apply it in their real-world projects.|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} procedure for correcting self-absorption effect was proposed in calibration-free {{laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy}} (CF-LIBS). In typical LIBS measurement conditions, the plasma produced is often optically thick, especially for the strong lines of major elements. The selection of self-absorption lines destroys the performance of CF-LIBS, and the familiar correction method based on the curve of growth is complex in implementation. The procedure we proposed, named internal reference for self-absorption correction (IRSAC), first chose an internal <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> for each species, then compared other spectral line intensity {{of the same species}} with the <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> to estimate the self-absorption degrees of other spectral lines, and finally achieved an optimal correction by a regressive algorithm. The self-absorption effect of the selected <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> can be ignored, since the <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> with high excitation energy of the upper level is slightly affected by the self-absorption. Through the IRSAC method, the points on the Boltzmann plot become more regular, and the evaluations of the plasma temperature and material composition are more accurate than the basic CF-LIBS...|$|R
