Profiles of the emissions are presented and discussed on both <b>rocket</b> <b>ascent</b> and descent an enhancement of the OH emission monitored by the OH radiometer was observed above 90 km. The glow was not defected by the O 2 radiometer and was significantly reduced on rocket descent. Using these data and a mechanistic analysis, a profile proportional to atomic oxygen is obtained. This profile is compared to one from the ATOX probe on the rocket. A one-dimensional (1 -D) photochemical model that solves the time-dependent continuity equations is used with the rocket data to investigate the odd-oxygen concentration in the near equatorial mesosphere...|$|E

40|$|Results of {{measurements}} of the outgassing rates of samples of materials and surface finishes used on the outer skins of rocket-borne experiment packages in simulated <b>rocket</b> <b>ascents.</b> The results showed outgassing rates for anodized aluminum in the second minute of flight which are two to three orders of magnitude higher than those given in typical tables of outgassing rates. The measured rates for aluminum with chromate conversion surface coatings were also abnormally high. These abnormally high initial rates fell quickly after about five to ten minutes to values comparable {{with those in the}} published literature.

By employing {{a description of}} the dynamical system in terms of its attainable sets in favor of using differential equations, the controls are completely eliminated from the system model. Besides reducing the dimensionality of the discretized problem compared to state-of-the-art collocation methods, this approach also alleviates the search for initial guesses from where standard gradient search methods are able to converge.

Since the rocket apogee was 89 km, the rocket was in the height range 88. 5 +/- 0. 5 km for 30 seconds giving an unusual measurement of horizontal structure over a distance of 5. 5 km.

40|$|High-fidelity {{numerical}} {{experiments and}} theoretical modelling {{are used to}} study the dynamics of a sounding-rocket-scale rocket, subject to altitude-dependent random wind and nozzle side loads and deterministic aerodynamic loading. This paper completes {{a series of studies}} that showed that Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) rotational dynamics arise when random nozzle side loads dominate wind and aerodynamic loading. In contrast to the earlier work, this paper elucidates that under conditions where aerodynamic, wind and nozzle side loads are comparable, the rocket behaves as stochastic Brownian oscillator. The Brownian oscillator model allows straightforward interpretation of the complex rotational dynamics observed: three dynamical regimes— each characterized by differing balances between nozzle-side-load-induced torques, spring-like aerodynamic torques and mass flux damping torques—characterize <b>rocket</b> <b>ascent.</b> Further, the paper illuminates that in the limit where wind and aerodynamic loads are small, random mass flux variations exponentially amplify side-load-induced rotational stochasticity. In this practical limit, pitch/yaw dynamics are described by a randomly damped OU process; an exact solution of the associated Fokker–Planck equation can be obtained and used to compute, e. g. time-dependent pitch/yaw rate means and variances...|$|E
5000|$|If {{the rocket}} is a {{multi-stage}} system where stages fire sequentially, the <b>rocket's</b> <b>ascent</b> burn {{may not be}} continuous. Obviously, some time must be allowed for stage separation and engine ignition between each successive stage, but some rocket designs call for extra free-flight time between stages. This is particularly useful in very high thrust rockets, where if the engines were fired continuously, the rocket would run out of fuel before leveling off and reaching a stable orbit above the atmosphere. [...] The technique is also useful when launching from a planet with a thick atmosphere, such as the Earth. Because gravity turns the flight path during free flight, the rocket can use a smaller initial pitchover angle, giving it higher vertical velocity, and taking {{it out of the}} atmosphere more quickly. This reduces both aerodynamic drag as well as aerodynamic stress during launch. Then later during the flight the rocket coasts between stage firings, allowing it to level off above the atmosphere, so when the engine fires again, at zero angle of attack, the thrust accelerates the ship horizontally, inserting it into orbit.|$|R

40|$|For a {{long time}} space {{engineers}} {{have been interested in}} the possibility of enabling single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicles. Many studies have been performed for such spacecraft, but so far the feasibility has not been proven and accordingly no vehicles have ever been built. The largest bottlenecks {{are to be found in}} the high mass of the vehicle, which needs to be accelerated to a high orbital velocity, and the propulsion systems that are available. For a SSTO concept to be successful the mass needs to be lowered significantly, combined with the use of an efficient propulsion system. With this in mind the LEO Fracht Transporter (LFT) study was started; a study to develop a SSTO or at least “quasi” SSTO launcher within the SART department of DLR Bremen. The scope of this study is to implement new technological improvements within an otherwise non-feasible SSTO design, in order to make it feasible. The goal of the internship, which this report summarizes, is to define a starting point for the LFT, from where the improvements with the new techniques can be applied. As with the technology of today a SSTO launcher is not possible yet, the starting point solution of this work is not expected to be feasible as well. To support the definition of the starting point solution several tools were used that are available at DLR. Amongst others, these tools generated a mass estimation for the vehicle, as well as an estimation of the aerodynamic coefficients. Furthermore, the trajectory of the air-breathing and the <b>rocket</b> <b>ascent</b> phase were simulated. A first tool chain was composed to generate a vehicle configuration. With the use of this tool chain a sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate which parameters have a high influence on the performance of the space vehicle, and what values are desired for the parameters under investigation. Three parameters concerning the fuselage geometry, and three concerning the wing geometry were evaluated. It was found that the aspect ratio as well as the wing thickness have the highest impact on the launcher performance, with preferred values of 0. 75 and 0. 03, respectively. The slenderness of the fuselage and the fuselage slope were found to have a medium sensitivity value. For both of these parameters a balance needs to be found between a longer heavier vehicle with advantageous aerodynamic coefficients, and a shorter and blunter vehicle with higher drag but lower structural mass. The sweep angle was found to have an insignificant influence. The nose radius was also investigated; however it was found that the results for this parameter from the corresponding tool were unreliable. The tool chain was later expanded to include additional tools, which increased the fidelity to which the vehicle geometry could be designed. Furthermore the precision of the aerodynamic coefficient estimation was increased by adding a tool specifically designed to evaluate these coefficients in hypersonic flight. With the improved chain a baseline design for the LFT vehicle was generated. This vehicle is assumed to have 2 SABRE engines as the propulsion system which are both used in the air-breathing and the <b>rocket</b> <b>ascent</b> phase. The engines rely on liquid hydrogen propellant in the air-breathing phase, and a mixture of liquid oxygen and hydrogen in the <b>rocket</b> <b>ascent.</b> The vehicle carries a total propellant mass of 260, 000 kg, and has a length of 75 m. As expected the design is not able to achieve orbital velocity and altitude, instead it reaches a final velocity of 4. 96 km/s at an altitude of 72. 72 km. Several additional investigations were performed to evaluate the impact of selected vehicle parameter variations on the performance, such as the use of different engines, and the effect of a reduction in mass. First the impact of a theoretical reduction of the structural mass due to advanced materials was evaluated. It was found that such a mass reduction does have a significant positive effect on the LFT performance, but this is not sufficient to enable the feasibility of the vehicle. For a decrease in structural mass of 50...|$|E
40|$|A Super Arcas rocket, MISTI B, was {{launched}} {{as part of}} the Polar Mesospheric Summer Echoes (PMSE) salvo to measure electron density irregularities using rf and dc probes. Large and small scale structures in the electron density were measured on <b>rocket</b> <b>ascent</b> and descent at the altitudes of 86. 5 and 88. 5 +/-. 5 km. Since the rocket apogee was 89 km, the rocket was in the height range 88. 5 +/-. 5 km for 30 seconds giving us an unusual measurement of horizontal structure over a distance of 5. 5 km. A power spectrum of the fluctuations for the upper layer gives further evidence that turbulent mixing is an important process in PMSE. The power spectrum of the lower layer, however, gives evidence that this layer is characterized by a form of partial or Fresnel scattering. Both spectra are in excellent agreement with similar analysis of electron fluctuation spectra measured in the same layers on the TURBO-B rocket flown 12 minutes later and the analysis of Cornell University Portable Radar Interferometer (CUPRI) data by Cho et al., 1993 A. Thus two different structuring and scattering mechanisms exist at altitudes only 1 km apart.

40|$|DLR-SART has {{performed}} a {{critical analysis of}} the Reaction Engines Ltd. single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) re-usable space plane concept, the SKYLON D 1 vehicle, and its innovative dual-mode engine, the Synergistic Air Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE). This analysis focused on the validation of the SKYLON mass budget, system performance and characteristics. A preliminary mass breakdown of the SKYLON D 1 vehicle was determined using parametric methods, based on vehicle performance parameters and geometric data provided by REL. The margin philosophy provided by REL {{was found to be}} insufficient, and it should be re-iterated. A mass breakdown of the SKYLON Upper Stage (SUS) was also generated using empirical methods based on performance and geometric data provided by REL. Subsystem masses were scaled from the Ariane 6 PPH studies. The ascent trajectory of the SKYLON vehicle was modelled in three parts; the air-breathing ascent, using a comparable turbo/ram engine; the <b>rocket</b> <b>ascent</b> using the SABRE engine; and the SUS flight. It was determined that the SKYLON vehicle with the DLR-SART mass estimates could not achieve orbit, however an optimized trajectory was found for the vehicle using REL mass assumptions. Finally, the performance of the SABRE engine was determined. The conventional rocket-mode performance of the SABRE was found to be highly consistent with REL-provided data, however due to convergence issues related to the control of the innovative pre-cooler used in the air-breathing mode, the full air-breathing cycle could not be modelled. An assessment of the development cost, production cost and launch service cost has been performed using a parametric method and considering different scenarios. Both the SKYLON and SABRE are highly non-conventional, and the need has been highlighted to create analytical models and tools that are compatible with the dual-mode mission profile, space-frame structure and innovative propulsion system for future analyses. It was also seen that the DLR-SART methods for determining sub-system and component masses are based on existing aircraft and launch vehicles and studies, and therefore do not always consider new solutions or technologies. The structure and thermal protection systems are key enabling technologies, not just the propulsion system. New solutions will need to be developed and implemented for these systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a problem of}} {{determining}} the optimal pacing strategy to minimize travel time is considered. The problem is restricted to a straight race track with constant slope and rolling resistance, and no headwind. It is expressed as an optimal control problem that can be solved using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The control variable is the cyclist's power, which is modelled according to a hyperbolic power-time relationship, where a maximum power level is assumed. The Hamiltonian is linear {{with respect to this}} control variable. The minimum time problem is redefined as a maximum excursion problem, which is related to Goddard’s problem of a <b>rocket's</b> <b>ascent</b> through the atmosphere. It turns out that the optimal pacing problem is a singular control problem. Such problems are difficult to solve, both numerically and analytically, and they only occur sporadically in control theory. It is proven that the singular control only accurs during a single interval; optimal pacing starts with maximum power and decays through a singular control to minimum power. The singular arc may be degenerate; a bang-bang control might be optimal, depending on the length of the race track and the amount of available energy. The solution of the pacing problem has been obtained partly numerical and partly analytical. It applies to a straight course without bends, but it can be extended to an arbitrary course by dividing it into straight segments between bends and optimize over all distributions of energy over the segments.

40|$|A report {{discusses}} the methane and carbon monoxide/LOX (McLOx) <b>rocket</b> for <b>ascent</b> from Mars {{as well as}} other critical space propulsion tasks. The system offers a specific impulse over 370 s roughly 50 s higher than existing space-storable bio-propellants. Current Mars in-situ propellant production (ISPP) technologies produce impure methane and carbon monoxide in various combinations. While separation and purification of methane fuel is possible, it adds complexity to the propellant production process and discards an otherwise useful fuel product. The McLOx makes such complex and wasteful processes unnecessary by burning the methane/CO mixtures produced by the Mars ISPP systems without the need for further refinement. Despite the decrease in rocket-specific impulse caused by the CO admixture, the improvement offered by concomitant increased propellant density can provide a net improvement in stage performance. One advantage is the increase of the total amount of propellant produced, but with a decrease in mass and complexity of the required ISPP plant. Methane/CO fuel mixtures also may be produced by reprocessing the organic wastes of a Moon base or a space station, making McLOx engines key for a human Lunar initiative or the International Space Station (ISS) program.

50|$|Fireworks have {{remained}} popular in today's age {{due to the}} spectacle of colors and sounds they are so renowned for. The component of a rocket that produces these stars, reports ("bangs"), and colors is typically located just below the nosecone section of a rocket. After the rocket engine has consumed all of its fuel an internal fuse is lit that delays {{the release of the}} stars, or other effect. This delay allows for coasting time where the <b>rocket</b> continues its <b>ascent.</b> As gravity will eventually pull the firework back to earth, it slows and eventually reaches an apex (highest point: where velocity of the rocket is zero) and begins its descent. The delay usually lasts just before this apex, at an optimum velocity, where a small explosion shoots the firework's stars in desired directions and thus producing a brilliant effect. The colors, reports, flashes, and, stars are analogous to flavor one adds with spices (chemicals with special pyrotechnic properties) to a soup of otherwise bland gunpowder.|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of the base heating problem for <b>rockets</b> during <b>ascent</b> {{is due to the}} complex interaction between the rocket nozzle plumes and the external-flow which can change the flow characteristics in the base region dramatically. At lower altitudes the external-flow merges with the plume-flow, without the formation of a large separated flow region, and the cooler external-flow promotes convective cooling of the base wall. Under these conditions the majority of the base heating is due to radiative heating from the shock heated plume gases. At higher altitudes, however, the process of base heating is not so straightforward. The plume and the base flow expands dramatically and separated flow regions occur in the base area. Hot exhaust gases from the rocket nozzle will be entrained into the separated flow regions and produce a convective component to the base wall heating. Further, if the rocket exhaust-gas contains soot, the soot can increase the emission from the gas and dramatically increase the wall absorption coefficient for radiative heating if it is deposited on the walls. In addition, if the rocket exhaust gas is fuel rich, the fuel can bum in the separated flow regions and further increase the base heating. The base burning phenomenon, and the increased base heating caused by it at higher altitudes, have been observed for the Space Shuttle and Saturn Rocket. Under these conditions, the total heating is significantly higher than the heating without separated flow in the base region, and the increase in heating is directly attributable to the fluid dynamic complexity of the base region. Realistic simulation of the base heating requires that the calculated flow environment reproduce the fluid dynamic flow features accurately. Thus, {{it will be necessary to}} introduce into the CFD codes the capability for the flow to respond to the complex vehicle geometry, the effect of turbulence, the ability to accurately reproduce the plume shock/shear layer structures and capture such phenomenon as shock induced base separation and base-burning phenomenon. A survey of experimental, theoretical and computational work that details the fluid dynamics of the base flow environment will be presented in the proposed paper. CFD simulations of rocket base flows using standard CFD codes such as OVERFLOW or GASP will be explored to capture these phenomenon accurately. Merits and limitations of these codes for base flow environment predictions will be explored...|$|R
40|$|Apollo landing videos {{shot from}} inside the right LEM window, provide a {{quantitative}} measure of the characteristics and dynamics of the ejecta spray of lunar regolith particles beneath the Lander during the final 10 [m] or so of descent. Photogrammetry analysis gives {{an estimate of the}} thickness of the dust layer and angle of trajectory. In addition, Apollo landing video analysis divulges valuable information on the regolith ejecta interactions with lunar surface topography. For example, dense dust streaks are seen to originate at the outer rims of craters within a critical radius of the Lander during descent. The primary intent of this work was to develop a mathematical model and software implementation for the trajectory simulation of lunar dust particles acted on by gas jets originating from the nozzle of a lunar Lander, where the particle sizes typically range from 10 micron to 500 micron. The high temperature, supersonic jet of gas that is exhausted from a rocket engine can propel dust, soil, gravel, as well as small rocks to high velocities. The lunar vacuum allows ejected particles to travel great distances unimpeded, {{and in the case of}} smaller particles, escape velocities may be reached. The particle size distributions and kinetic energies of ejected particles can lead to damage to the landing spacecraft or to other hardware that has previously been deployed in the vicinity. Thus the primary motivation behind this work is to seek a better understanding for the purpose of modeling and predicting the behavior of regolith dust particle trajectories during powered <b>rocket</b> descent and <b>ascent...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} the NASA / Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Advanced Reusable Technologies (ART) project is to advance and develop Rocket-Based Combined-Cycle (RBCC) technologies. The ART project began in 1996 {{as part of the}} Advanced Space Transportation Program (ASTP). The project is {{composed}} of several activities including RBCC engine ground testing, tool development, vehicle / mission studies, and component testing / development. The major contractors involved in the ART project are Aerojet and Rocketdyne. A large database of RBCC ground test data was generated for the air-augmented rocket (AAR), ramjet, scramjet, and <b>ascent</b> <b>rocket</b> modes of operation for both the Aerojet and Rocketdyne concepts. Transition between consecutive modes was also demonstrated as well as trajectory simulation. The Rocketdyne freejet tests were conducted at GASL in the Flight Acceleration Simulation Test (FAST) facility. During a single test, the FAST facility is capable of simulating both the enthalpy and aerodynamic conditions over a range of Mach numbers in a flight trajectory. Aerojet performed freejet testing in the Pebble Bed facility at GASL as well as direct-connect testing at GASL. Aerojet also performed sea-level static (SLS) testing at the Aerojet A-Zone facility in Sacramento, CA. Several flight-type flowpath components were developed under the ART project. Aerojet designed and fabricated ceramic scramjet injectors. The structural design of the injectors will be tested in a simulated scramjet environment where thermal effects and performance will be assessed. Rocketdyne will be replacing the cooled combustor in the A 5 rig with a flight-weight combustor that is near completion. Aerojet's formed duct panel is currently being fabricated and will be tested in the SLS rig in Aerojet's A-Zone facility. Aerojet has already successfully tested a cooled cowl panel in the same facility. In addition to MSFC, other NASA centers have contributed to the ART project as well. Inlet testing and parametrics were performed at NASA / Glenn Research Center (GRC) and NASA / Langley Research Center (LaRC) for both the Aerojet and Rocketdyne concepts. LaRC conducted an Air-Breathing Launch Vehicle (ABLV) study for several vehicle concepts with RBCC propulsion systems. LaRC is also performing a CFD analysis of the ramjet mode for both flowpaths based on GASL test conditions. A study was performed in 1999 to investigate the feasibility of performing an RBCC flight test on the NASA / Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) SR- 71 aircraft. Academia involvement in the ART project includes parametric RBCC flowpath testing by Pennsylvania State University (PSU). In addition to thrust and wall static pressure measurements, PSU is also using laser diagnostics to analyze the flowfield in the test rig. MSFC is performing CFD analysis of the PSU rig at select test conditions for model baseline and validation. Also, Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) conducted a vision vehicle study using the Aerojet RBCC concept. Overall, the ART project has been very successful in advancing RBCC technology. Along the way, several major milestones were achieved and "firsts" accomplished. For example, under the ART project, the first dynamic trajectory simulation testing was performed and the Rocketdyne engine A 5 logged over one hour of accumulated test time. The next logical step is to develop and demonstrate a flight-weight RBCC engine system...|$|R
