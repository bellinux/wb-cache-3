TCT core drills are more expensive then HSS core drills but are faster and easy to make bigger holes. There are also different types in TCT core drills. TCT core drills are cheaper for bigger diameter i.e. above 41 mm. They are very efficient for cutting hard material. The chances of tip breakage in TCT core drill is more compared to HSS Core drills. TCT core drills has a disadvantage that it can not be reground. Once the TCT core drill is damaged it has to be thrown away, it can not be re used like the HSS core drills. It is always recommended by manufacturers to use TCT core drills only for larger diameter and for very hard material, while giving priority to HSS core drills because of its price and <b>re-sharpening</b> advantages.|$|E

50|$|Sitio Sierra {{contains}} some gold artifacts {{that are considered}} some of {{the oldest of the}} region. The gold pieces have been described as probably being cut from molded flat sheets, and then spiraled into ornaments. Spondylus (shellfish) found at the site are considered especially important because of the nutritional benefits that they probably provided for the inhabitants. Evidence in the middens and around the site also suggest the transformation of shells into tools and goods. A large amount of red beads made from the shells are found throughout the site according to a study done by Sanchez and Herrera in 1995. Sitio Sierra is the only site in Panama that contains prismatic blade production while lacking any access to chert projections. This causes scientists to infer a system of trade with other local cities that have produced evidence for these resources. Based on chipped rocks found in association with other stone tools in the area, archaeologists hypothesize that these people probably were accustomed to sharpening and <b>re-sharpening</b> axes, but no artifacts have been found in association with axe manufacturing. This was hypothesized by Richard Cooke in 1979. His articles also support the possibility of stone-tool trade between ancient Panamanian cities.|$|E
50|$|The {{blades of}} both planes and chisels are {{distinguished}} by the hollow, ura in their flat side. This hollow portion {{has a number}} of functions. The primary function is that it ensures a high degree of flatness when sharpening, in that when the flat side is polished it cannot rock or develop a curve because it is only contacting the stone on either side of its width. This then improves the precision with which cuts can be made by the chisel, {{and in the case of}} planes ensures smooth contact with the wedge and therefore even support across the full width of its blade. The hollow also greatly reduces the amount of metal needed to be removed to achieve flatness on the back of the blade, which shortens initial set-up and subsequent <b>re-sharpening</b> considerably. Secondly, in the case of chisels, it reduces the frictional resistance as the chisel is driven into or extracted from the wood. Thirdly, the interaction of the leading edge of the hollow with the edge of the blade is a changing relationship as the tool is re-sharpened. With plane blades, as the edge is sharpened down to the rim of the hollow, the edge can then be 'tapped-out' (ura-dashi), a process where a pointed hammer is used to depress the ha-gane downward slightly along the bevel of the blade. When the blade's back is re-flattened after ura-dashi, the hollow is re-established; thus the hollow acts as a sort of gauge for sharpening as a means of prolonging the life of the thin piece of cutting steel as long as possible. This in turn tends to keep the geometry of the blade consistent over time,which keeps it fitting the dai over time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Plunge shaving is {{the most}} {{advanced}} gear finishing technique which only needs radial infeed. Its advantages include increased productivity, accuracy, long tool life, and a simple machine structure. For the plunge shaving method, the gear tooth modification only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter. The analytical description of the gear with tooth modifications is firstly constructed by B-spline surface fitting. Then, the grinding wheel profile is parameterized and optimized for minimizing the surface deviations of theoretical and ground (from <b>re-sharpening</b> machine) tooth surfaces of the plunge shaving cutter, in which the topographic error has been reduced. The cutting trace of plunge shaving cutter has also been analyzed so that the shaving efficiency can be improved. Index Terms—Gear plunge shaving, Cone grinding wheel, Topographic error, Shaving cutter serration. et al. [9] proposed a method for shaving gears with double crowning by CNC shaving machine. For shaving methods other than plunge shaving, the gear tooth modification is accomplished by tooth modifications of the shaving cutter and the coordinated motions between cutter and gear. For the plunge shaving method, however, it only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter. Focusing on the surface geometry of shaving cutter, what’s really significant is precision of the region between SAP. (start of active profile) and EAP. (end of active profile) as shown in Fig. 1. In gear shaving, SAP. of cutter tooth shaves the gear tooth tip while EAP. shaves the gear tooth root.

40|$|AbstractCrack-tip {{blunting}} under tensile {{loads and}} <b>re-sharpening</b> of the crack-tip during unloading {{is one of}} the basic mechanisms for fatigue crack growth in ductile metals. Based on an elastic–perfectly plastic material model, crack growth computations have been continued up to 700 full cycles by using remeshing at several stages of the plastic deformation, with studies of the effect of overloads or compressive underloads. Recent published analyses for the first two cycles have shown folding of the crack surface in compression, leading to something that looks like striations. The influence of mesh refinement is used to study the possibility of this type of behaviour within the present method. Even with much refined meshes no indication of crack surface folding is found here...|$|E

Results from experiments, including fatigue testing in air and sodium chloride, fatigue under potential control, and static load testing in sodium chloride, suggest that quite distinct mechanisms of fatigue-crack propagation are active in air and sodium chloride solution. Specifically, the fatigue-crack growth rates observed under static and cyclic loading in sodium chloride likely depend on an anodic process, which results in a brittle mode of failure. Conversely in air, fatigue-crack propagation is associated with alternating blunting and <b>re-sharpening</b> of the crack tip, as evidenced by the presence of classic fatigue striations...|$|E

40|$|At Huizui, a {{major centre}} of ground stone tool manufac-ture, five main lithologies were used, each for a particu-lar purpose: oolitic {{dolomite}} for spades; diabase for axes, adzes and chisels; fine micaceous sandstone for knives and sickles; other sandstone for grinding slabs; and fine limestone for lime. This reflects the functional properties of these lithologies. Diabase, oolitic dolomite and fine micaceous sandstone are tough and take sharp edges, which for diabase are particularly sharp and easily <b>re-sharpened.</b> All five rock types are probably available within 8 km of the site. Ground stone tool production {{may have been}} located at Huizui because of its proximity to the adjacent sandstone hills, which provided abundant abrasive material.

Dia-base was sourced from river cobbles, and micaceous sandstone was quarried. All three of these lithologies were extracted as raw material that required minimal shaping to make tools.

5000|$|Much of {{what was}} dug up in has not survived. There {{was a lot of}} fatty material, {{probably}} from degraded body tissues, in the watery coffin which had dried out. The bones were discoloured by the reaction of iron in the water with the tannin in the bark of the coffin and the skeleton was originally preserved by boiling it in glue in a laundry copper. This ruined any chance by present-day archaeologists to do a DNA study but collagen was able to be used from the skeleton for both dating and dietary isotope purposes. Several radiocarbon dates from the tree rings of the oak coffin and the composition of a ceremonial bronze dagger helped confirm the dating making this burial one of the best dated Early Bronze Age burials in Britain. Dendrochronological dating was attempted but the sequence remains floating until further finds from the period can be dated. Metallurgical and lead isotope analyses of the bronze dagger blade indicate that Ireland {{is likely to be the}} ultimate source of the copper ore used, but that it had been recycled with other ores being introduced.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the formation of}} tough surface zones, depleted of cubic carbo-nitrides, in cemented carbides. Several materials with varied phase compositions, binder phase volume fraction, and carbon content have been investigated. The main experimental techniques {{that have been used}} are scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atom probe field ion microscopy (APFIM). Some of the experimental results have been compared to computer simulations based on thermodynamics and diffusion. Good agreement between computer simulations and experimental results of the distribution of elements and phases was found. It was therefore concluded that the formation of surface zones is a process controlled by thermodynamics and diffusion. It was investigated how the gradient surface zone formation depends on cubic phase composition. Addition of Ta to the cubic phase was found to decrease the elemental variations in the gradient profile and to give a thinner surface zone. Addition of Nb gave the opposite effect, with larger elemental variations and a wider surface zone. The effect of the binder phase volume fraction on gradient zone formation was studied. It was found that the zone width is directly proportional to the binder content. It was also found that the diffusivity is reduced with a factor equal to the binder volume fraction due to the presence of dispersed phases, i. e. carbides and carbo-nitrides. Study of materials with varied carbon content showed that with a high C content the driving force for gradient formation becomes stronger, and wider surface zones are formed. The effect of high C content was found to be reduced if Ta or Nb was added to the cubic phase. Methods to prepare APFIM specimens of near surface regions were developed. The methods are based on dimple grinding, electropolishing, and focused ion beam milling (FIB). The methods allow for positioning of APFIM specimens with high accuracy in the material, and to <b>re-sharpen</b> analysed specimens. Analysis was performed of the cubic phase just inside the zone border and the results could be related to the sintering process...|$|R

They had a total of just over 3 weeks to build it, due to their filming schedule. 12 quarrymen carved 186 stones in 22 days. They were able to erect it using 44 men. They used iron hammers, chisels and levers (this is a modern short-cut, the ancient Egyptians were limited to using copper and later bronze and wood). But they did experiments with copper tools, noting that they were adequate for the job in hand, only provided that additional manpower was available to constantly <b>re-sharpen</b> the ancient tools. They estimated they would have needed around 20 extra men for this maintenance. Another short-cut taken was the use of a front end loader or fork lift truck. However, modern machinery was not and could not be used to finish the construction. They used levers to lift the capstone to a height of 20 ft. Four or five men were able to use levers on stones less than 1 ton to flip them over and transport them by rolling them. For the larger stones, they had to tow them. They found that by putting the stones on wooden sledges and sliding the sledges on wooden tracks, they were able to tow a 2-ton stone with 12 to 20 men. The wood for these sledges and tracks would have to have been imported from Lebanon at great cost since there was little, if any, wood in ancient Egypt. While the builders failed to duplicate the precise jointing created by the ancient Egyptians, Hopkins was confident this could have been achieved with more practice.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a fluid dynamics {{model of a}} continuous caster mould region, including the transient behaviour of the steel/slag interface. The research {{was carried out in}} collaboration with ArcelorMittal Research (AMR), based in Maizieres-les-Metz in France. The industrial objective of the thesis was to understand the factors affecting the transient behaviour of the liquid slag layer covering the steel and its interaction with the Submerged Entry Nozzle (SEN) jet supplying the steel from the tundish to the Continuous Casting (CC) mould. The study includes the very complex phenomenon of argon bubble transport which also affects the behaviour of the slag layer and SEN jet. The model developed in this study is based on the finite volume method with the liquid regions (steel, slag) solved in an Eulerian scheme on a fixed unstructured mesh. The interface behaviour is modelled using a number of VOF type schemes, including the time-efficient Counter Diffusion Method (CDM). A coupled Lagrangian particle tracking scheme is used to represent the presence of argon bubbles and their influence on the flowfield (mainly due to buoyancy) in conjunction with the fluctuating surface dynamics. The bulk of the research concerns comparisons against flowfield and interface data obtained from an experimental water/oil study of the process. However, the model is extended to include predictions of heat transfer and phase change in the steel and flux powder regions in an industrial CC unit and validation against available data. The three-phase model is developed making use of the unstructured mesh multi-physics finite volume code PHYSICA [1]. As stated, the main goal of this particular work {{has to do with the}} study of the dynamic behaviour of the steel/slag interface, including the effects of casting speed and injected gas. Because of the great difficulty in physical experiments with a real caster, the research is supported with water model experiments and mathematical simulation. Comparisons of observed interface profiles, measured and predicted mean and fluctuating velocities, gave an insight to the degree of coupling between interface behaviour and the fluid dynamics within the mould region. In particular, a spectral analysis of the dominant fluctuation frequencies in the water/oil experiment suggests a strong link between the upper and lower recirculation loops generated by the SEN jet as it splits after contact with the narrow face for the mould. The presence of gas bubbles alters the spectral picture, since the buoyancy induced in the flow affects the behaviour of the jet, leading to the one/two loop behaviour known from experiments. Good qualitative and quantitative agreement was achieved between the numerical results and water-model experimental data. The main observations drawn from the water model simulation and experiment are as follows: - An increase in casting speed, which is equivalent to an increase in SEN velocity leads to an increase in the amplitude of interfacial fluctuations. - At the highest SEN velocities, the oil layer is pushed away from the narrow ends of the mould, exposing the water surface to air. - When there is no oil on top of the water surface, the surface remains for all practical purpose flat. - Air entering through the SEN influences the flowfield in the mould and also disturbs the oil/water interface when it passes through it. - The ratio of water to air flow rate seems to be the most important parameter, with high air/water flow ratios leading to a change in flowfield at the top of the mould as the gas buoyancy lifts the SEN jet towards the surface. To achieve a good correlation between the experiments and the simulations a number of factors in the numerics were found to be important. These are: - The quality of the mesh used, especially in the complex transition from the SEN geometry – essentially a cylinder with two outlets set at a specific angle of 20 o to the vertical, to the thin rectangular geometry of the mould which is designed to cast flat products. - The turbulence model, which was initially found to suppress interface oscillations whenever an oil layer was introduced. Various approaches were followed to overcome this problem, (a) removing the turbulence model from the oil layer, (b) using a low frequency filter to remove resolved turbulence kinetic energy from the k-ε model, (c) opting for the high order SMART numerical scheme in preference to the default Hybrid. - The interface tracking algorithm used as a default in the code PHYSICA is essentially a VOF technique with options for a Van-Leer (TVD) scheme [2] or alternative the popular Donor Acceptor scheme [3, 4], both options work well but they are explicit and therefore extremely expensive computationally. Due to the size of the mesh and the CFL limit for stability, timesteps as small as 10 - 3 s become necessary, meaning a 600 s simulation could take up to 8 weeks! To overcome this, the implicit CDM scheme [5] was used, which allows the interface to spread by diffusion but then pushed back against the gradient to <b>re-sharpen</b> at the end of each timestep. With this scheme, timesteps up to 2 orders of magnitude larger become possible, the limit then governed by the frequency range to be resolved. A non-standard approach to the Lagrangian particle tracking scheme was adopted in the simulation with the following characteristics: - The amount of gas entering was divided into packets of equal bubble diameter and then each packet was further divided into individual tracks. The transport of 1000 and more particles tracks was used to ensure a realistic dispersion. - Tracks were updated at regular time intervals (but not necessarily at each Eulerian timestep) and then followed until they exited the calculation domain. - The residence time of particles in each cell provided information for the gas content of the cell and therefore its density. With this approach, the Navier-Stokes equations then solve for mixture (gas and liquid) and lighter cells are influenced by buoyancy. - The bubble tracks are affected by the mean velocity of the surrounding fluid and also by a stochastic component derived from the turbulence model. However, there is no direct feedback to fluid turbulence from the bubbles. To extend simulations to a real caster, heat transfer and phase change were introduced in the model, in addition to the property changes (water to steel, oil to slag, air to argon). Of importance here was the development of a solidified skin of steel on the water-cooled mould walls and also the melting of flux powder into a liquid layer on the top surface. This last component of the research was introduced to enable comparisons against plant data obtained by AMR. Of particular interest in this study was the transition from a double to a single roll recirculation in the top section of the mould, as a function of the relative quality of argon entering the SEN. The model was able to reproduce this behaviour for the cases studied. Although much has been done in developing this model of the continuous casting process it is evident that much more research is needed, especially in the case of a real caster. For example, the thermophysical property variations in the slag due to temperature, composition and mass transfer were ignored. A very simple approach was used for the phase change in steel and flux powder, although since the PHYSICA framework is modular, more sophisticated alternatives can be easily introduced. The boundary conditions for heat transfer remain uncertain and the values used in this study were obtained from the industrial partner from earlier experiments. In spite the aforementioned limitations, the model is very useful, especially in understanding the dynamic interactions between the SEN jets, and the slag/steel interface and in this respect in advance of other models used by industry...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{propagation}} of fatigue cracks has been recognized as a problem of clinical significance in dentin, {{there have been few}} fracture mechanics-based studies that have investigated this issue. In the present study, in vitro cyclic fatigue experiments were conducted over a range of cyclic frequencies (1 – 50 Hz) on elephant dentin in order to quantify fatigue-crack growth behavior from the perspective of understanding the mechanism of fatigue in dentin. Specifically, results obtained for crack extension rates along a direction parallel to the dentinal tubules were found to be well described by the stress-intensity range, DK, using a simple Paris power-law approach with exponents ranging from 12 to 32. Furthermore, a frequency dependence was observed for the crackgrowth rates, with higher growth rates associated with lower frequencies. By using crack-growth experiments involving alternate cyclic and static loading, such fatigue-crack propagation was mechanistically determined {{to be the result of}} a ‘‘true’ ’ cyclic fatigue mechanism, and not simply a succession of static fracture events. Furthermore, based on the observed frequency dependence of fatigue-crack growth in dentin and observations of time-dependent crack blunting, a cyclic fatigue mechanism involving crack-tip blunting and <b>re-sharpening</b> is proposed. These results are deemed to be of importance for an improved understanding of fatiguerelated failures in teeth...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{premature}} contact {{of crack}} surfaces {{attributable to the}} near-tip plastic deformations under cyclic loading, which is {{commonly referred to as}} plasticity induced crack closure (PICC), has long been focused as supposedly controlling factor of fatigue crack growth (FCG). Nevertheless, when the plane-strain near-tip constraint is approached, PICC lacks of straightforward evidence, so that its significance in FCG, and even the very existence, remain debatable. To add insights into this matter, large-deformation elastoplastic simulations of plane-strain crack under constant amplitude load cycling at different load ranges and ratios, as well as with an overload, have been performed. Modeling visualizes the Laird-Smith conceptual mechanism of FCG by plastic blunting and <b>re-sharpening.</b> Simulation reproduces the experimental trends of FCG concerning the roles of stress intensity factor range and overload, but PICC has never been detected. Near-tip deformation patterns discard the filling-in a crack with material stretched out of the crack plane in the wake behind the tip as supposed PICC origin. Despite the absence of closure, load-deformation curves appear bent, which raises doubts about the trustworthiness of closure assessment from the compliance variation. This demonstrates ambiguities of PICC as a supposedly intrinsic factor of FCG and, by implication, favors the stresses and strains in front of the crack tip as genuine fatigue drivers...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{crack growth}} is {{dependent}} on material properties and loading parameters. Critical areas of industrial components are often subjected to complex stresses, either because multiaxial loads are applied or because residual stresses {{are present in the}} material. In plane stresses are taken into account through mode I, II and III stress intensity factors. Out of plane stresses are usually not included in fatigue crack growth models. However, experimental evidences of the influence of out-of plane stresses on fatigue crack growth are reported in the literature. This paper is centered {{on the role of the}} T-stress during mode I fatigue crack growth. The effect of a T-stress on fatigue crack growth is studied through its effect on crack tip blunting. As a matter of fact, fatigue crack growth is characterized by the presence of striations on the fracture surface, which implies that the crack grows by a mechanism of blunting and <b>re-sharpening.</b> From a mechanical point of view, this means that forward and reverse plasticity occurs within the crack tip plastic zone. The presence of a T-stress modifies significantly the evolution of plastic deformation at crack tip and thus plastic blunting.

Experimental results show that the LC CPM- 9 V has excellent mechanical properties. Its average tensile and yield strengths are about 1315 MPa and 821 MPa, respectively. Pin-on disk wear tests demonstrate that the wear loss of the LC CPM- 9 V material is only about 1 / 3 compared to that of the heat treated D 2 tool steel currently being used for making rotary cutting dies. In production test, the LC CPM- 9 V die has successfully cut more than 180, 000 m of labels without the need of <b>re-sharpening</b> so far. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Predictions of {{punching}} {{life span}} for stamping process is critical since affect {{the quality of}} product, the production rate and cause waste in time and cost. The punch need to be sharpened correctly after a number of punches since its dimensional accuracy will deteriorate and cause inaccuracy in the dimensions of the product and thus do not satisfy the quality requirements. One of the method that are normally used to determine the point where <b>re-sharpening</b> should be carried out is through estimating the number of shots or unit kshots that will produce products that are dimensionally inaccurate and the occurrence of burr on the product. The research was carried out to overcome this problem. The punch that was used is made of Cementite Tungsten Carbide and the work piece is Phosphor Bronze Strip. The relative hardness is about 6. 3. The stamping process is a progressive stamping process carried out in a well known electronic factory. The profile of the wear of the punch is measured and the error in product dimension is identified. The increase presence of burr is also studied and identified for every 4000 product. The end of punch life span is determined when there is a dimensional inaccuracy on the product and the product is rejected. This research found that at this point punch is rounded, wear is present and cracks occurred {{at the cutting edge of}} the tool. As a result of this research, relation between the punch wear and kshots are found to be proportionate and this enable an algorithm to be formulated. Simulation model is built to enable more accurate algorithm is developed. The simulation model used 'Constraint Cubic Spline algorithm'. The researcher is able to forecast a more accurately the kshots that relates to punch wear and thus save products dimensional inaccuracy and product rejects. An improved sharpening process is also possible and this provide accurate rcsharpening work. The accuracy of the sharpening prediction also reduce burr and have enhance the efficiency of the resharpening process. In conclusion, the algorithm has improved productivity and save cost to the company...|$|E
40|$|The {{global market}} {{competition}} {{has put a}} pressure on the industry to reduce lead time and increase quality of parts. In particular, the area of gear cutting tool design requires capability to rapidly produce tool designs with increased tool geometry precision. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore the field of gear shaper cutter design and produce a model and software that would enable creation of more precise cutter designs, faster. A literature survey of involute cylindrical gearing geometry highlights deficiencies in addressing industry requirements of tool manufacturing, as most of the research in the area is focused on problems of gear design, but not tool design. This research, therefore, focuses on the process of gear manufacturing using the gear shaper cutters. It attempts to develop an analytical model and a set of tools that are able to aid the design process of gear shaper cutter. With cylindrical gear being essentially " at" and therefore easier to express an- alytically, the focus of recent papers has shifted to non-cylindrical and non-involute gear trains. Yet the geometry of the tools used to produce cylindrical gears remains largely untapped area, in particular the geometry of gear shaper cutters. The knowl- edge about the profile of the cutter teeth and the profile cut by the cutter in the gear blank are essential for high precision gear manufacturing. The gear shaper cutter is a metal cutting tool and therefore should be re-sharpened on a regular basis. These <b>re-sharpening</b> operations change the profile of the tool and, consequently, the profile of the gear it cuts. The changes in the cutter and gear geometry are analysed in this thesis and a way to calculate the life span of the tool is suggested. Gear shaper cutter profiles usually have one or more modifications to the theoret- ical ideal involute profile applied. Some of these modifications are used to produce a better cutter profile, while other should in turn produce modifications to the gear profile, and, finally, some are used to overcome generated gear profile constraints. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for gear shaper cutter design should be able to show the profile of the cutter and the profile cut by the cutter with arbitrary modifications applied. The analysis and visualisation of gear shaper cutters profiles cut by these cutters is impossible without a clear understanding of the principles of operation of gear generation hardware, generating motion and different machine geometry, all being covered in this thesis. In order to verify the analytical model and the CAD software case studies of the real-life gear shaper cutter designs were performed...|$|E
