5000|$|Flicker is {{a visible}} fading between cycles {{displayed}} on video displays, especially the <b>refresh</b> interval on <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> (CRT) {{as well as}} Plasma based computer screens and/or [...] TVs. Flicker occurs on CRTs when they are driven at a low refresh rate, allowing the brightness to drop for time intervals sufficiently long to be noticed by a human eye - see persistence of vision and flicker fusion threshold. For most devices, the screen's phosphors quickly lose their excitation between sweeps of the electron gun, and the afterglow is unable to fill such gaps - see phosphor persistence. A similar effect occurs in PDPs during their refresh cycles.|$|R
40|$|Entrainment {{of neural}} {{activity}} to luminance impulses during the <b>refresh</b> of <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> monitor displays {{has been observed}} in the primary visual cortex (V 1) of humans and macaque monkeys. This entrainment is of interest because it tends to temporally align and thus synchronize neural responses at the millisecond timescale. Here we show that, in tree shrew V 1, both spiking and local field potential activity are also entrained at <b>cathode</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tube</b> <b>refresh</b> rates of 120, 90, and 60 Hz, with weakest but still significant entrainment even at 120 Hz, and strongest entrainment occurring in cortical input layer IV. For both luminance increments (“white” stimuli) and decrements (“black” stimuli), refresh rate had a strong impact on the temporal dynamics of the neural response for subsequent luminance impulses. Whereas there was rapid, strong attenuation of spikes and local field potential to prolonged visual stimuli composed of luminance impulses presented at 120 Hz, attenuation was nearly absent at 60 -Hz refresh rate. In addition, neural onset latencies were shortest at 120 Hz and substantially increased, by ∼ 15 ms, at 60 Hz. In terms of neural response amplitude, black responses dominated white responses at all three refresh rates. However, black/white differences were much larger at 60 Hz than at higher refresh rates, suggesting a mechanism that is sensitive to stimulus timing. Taken together, our findings reveal many similarities between V 1 of macaque and tree shrew, while underscoring a greater temporal sensitivity of the tree shrew visual system...|$|R
