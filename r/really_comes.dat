500|$|Former show runner of The Simpsons David Mirkin {{thought the}} episode was [...] "really fun" [...] {{because there were}} [...] "lots of characters" [...] in it and it {{featured}} [...] "lots of terrific animation". Mirkin liked that viewers could see the different characters [...] "team up" [...] and how they pair off. [...] "It's kind of cool to see them hang around like this. Particularly Homer's group which has some nice emotion and they <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> together as a group", Mirkin commented.|$|E
500|$|... "Provenance" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Chris Carter and {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Kim Manners. Manners was very pleased with Anderson's performance in the episode. He later noted, [...] "There was something about Gillian that was very sexual." [...] He further elaborated, [...] "There's some burning within her that <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> across on screen. She really is brilliant, and she brings so much; the camera loves her." [...] A {{large portion of the}} episode was based on the ancient astronaut theory; a theory that proposes intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans. The themes had previously been visited in the [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"" [...] story arc.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of release, both Record Mirror and NME gave the album four stars out of five. Record Mirror commented that [...] "he {{psychedelic}} image of the group <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> to life, record wise, on this LP which is a fine showcase for both their talent and the recording technique. Plenty of mind blowing sound, both blatant and subtle here, {{and the whole thing}} is extremely well performed." [...] Cash Box called it [...] "a particularly striking collection of driving, up-to-date rock ventures". Paul McCartney and Pink Floyd's past producer Joe Boyd both rated the album highly. Some voiced the opinion of the underground fans, by suggesting that the album did not reflect the band's live performances.|$|E

500|$|The {{visual effects}} and slow-motion {{sequences}} induced by Slo-Mo received broad praise. Berkshire {{said that they}} are notable and eye-catching with [...] "impressively utilised 3d." [...] Hewitt said the visuals were [...] "genuinely surreal splashes of heightened colour that...don't outstay their welcome. The film's use of 3D is often excellent (including the credits) and it <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> {{to life in the}} Slo-mo scenes". Dalton said the film [...] "constantly impresses on a visual level, with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like District 9 or 28 Days Later than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters." [...] Dalton said, [...] " [...] first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours, gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences." [...] Dredd won The Art of 3D award at the 2013 Empire Awards, and was nominated for Best British Film and Best Science-fiction/Fantasy.|$|E
500|$|While {{acknowledging}} that Labyrinth {{was made with}} [...] "infinite care and pains", Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four as {{he felt that the}} film [...] "never <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> alive". Ebert said that as the film was set in an [...] "arbitrary world" [...] none of the events in it had any consequences, robbing the film of any dramatic tension. Gene Siskel's review of Labyrinth for the Chicago Tribune was highly negative, and he referred to it as an [...] "awful" [...] film with a [...] "pathetic story", [...] "much too complicated plot" [...] and a [...] "visually ugly style". Siskel objected to the film's [...] "violent" [...] plot, writing, [...] "the sight of a baby in peril is one of sleaziest gimmicks a film can employ to gain our attention, but Henson does it." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was mainly positive. Based on 37 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 84% {{of the critics}} enjoyed the film with an average score of 7.2/10. By comparison Metacritic calculated an average score of 74/100, based on 13 reviews. Richard Schickel of Time magazine praised the film for its exaggerated kitsch style. He also believed the role of Preston Tucker to be Jeff Bridges' best performance. Janet Maslin from The New York Times agreed, writing that Coppola, known for his dark approach on his previous films, [...] "found the directorial range to actually make a feel-good movie." [...] In addition, Desson Thomson, writing in The Washington Post, called the film a [...] "satisfying commercial breakthrough for Coppola," [...] and praised the cinematography of Vittorio Storaro, {{as well as the}} ubiquitous approach for Dean Stockwell's cameo appearance as Howard Hughes. Roger Ebert gave a mixed review. [...] "Preston Tucker lacks an ounce of common sense or any notion of the real odds against him. And since the movie never really deals with that - never <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> to grips with Tucker's character - it begins as a saga but ends in whimsy." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the first season of Orange is the New Black, Doggett {{received}} some criticism from different media. Writing for The American Conservative, B. D. McClay claimed that Doggett was a poor and inaccurate representation of American Christians; [...] "Pennsatucky is such an aggressively terrible character" [...] and [...] "her faith is neither well-understood nor well-drawn". Laura Leonard of Christianity Today, supports Clay's view and goes further to say [...] "it was frustrating to see this one painful narrative represent Christian faith on OITNB, a show that masters other aspects of the melting pot so well", speaking about Doggett's background story and conflict with Chapman. Two critics for The A.V. Club also gave negative reviews of Doggett; Todd VanDerWerff says that [...] "Pennsatucky never <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> together as a character {{in the same way as}} some of the others on the show" [...] and Myles McNutt opted to criticize the storyline of the final episode of the first season specifically, saying that it [...] " [...] her like a cartoon villain instead of a real character". Betsy Leondar-Wright accused the series' creators of classism and said that Doggett was an [...] "outrageous Redneck stereotype".|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of [...] "She Wolf", [...] "Did It Again" [...] was {{serviced}} as the next single from the album She Wolf, (2009), and is the second single overall. [...] "Did It Again" [...] was written by Shakira and Pharrell Williams, {{and is one of}} the four tracks on the album Shakira co-produced with The Neptunes, the others being [...] "Long Time", [...] "Why Wait", and [...] "Good Stuff". About her collaboration with Williams, Shakira commented, [...] "he comes up with ideas, and he executes them immediately. It's really cool, because I'm a little bit slower, and he's the man with the big strokes, and he <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> with great ideas. It was a great synergy". A Spanish version of the song, titled [...] "Lo Hecho Está Hecho" [...] was also released and features additional songwriting by Jorge Drexler. Musically, [...] "Did It Again" [...] is a midtempo electropop song that contains elements of samba. The lyrics of the song are confessional in nature and express Shakira's growing guilt over the fact that she is in a sexual affair with a married man, and her inability to end it, hence the title [...] "Did It Again".|$|E
500|$|Boyd van Hoeij of Variety {{magazine}} was more critical, writing [...] "Though {{a lot of}} it is well written and directed and, quite often, funny or poignant, the individual scenes rarely become part of a larger whole." [...] He praises Leto's acting, stating [...] "The closest the film comes to having a gravitational center are in the scenes set in 2092. What makes them soar is not the imaginative staging of the future, but Leto's performance. His acting talent <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> into full view in his scenes as the last dying man on Earth." [...] He also praised Regbo and Temple, saying [...] "Regbo, as the teenage Nemo, and Juno Temple, as the teenage Anna, are impressive, bringing the hormonal battles of adolescence vividly to life." [...] Film critic Eric Lavallée listed Regbo as one of his [...] "Top 10 New Faces & Voices" [...] of 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. He notes that [...] "newbie Toby Regbo might easily be Mr. Nobody's most [...] "alive" [...] character. Playing Nemo at age 16, the actor is mostly paired with Juno Temple – their unique love story is the film's heart pumping portions and plays a lot better than the artery clogging other brushes of romance." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the repeal}} of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama {{included}} openly gay service members in her national military families initiative. On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the video}} broke the Vevo record {{for having the}} most views in a 24-hour period with 8.24 million views, besting the {{previous}} record which had been set by Justin Bieber's [...] "Boyfriend" [...] (8.00 million). Bieber regained the record {{with the release of}} the music video for [...] "Beauty and a Beat" [...] (10.6 million) on 12 October 2012. It received positive reviews from music critics, who generally complimented its carefree, jubilant nature. Smith quipped that it has [...] "notable moments," [...] which he cited, [...] "glowstick campfire dances, inflatable pool splashing, four wheeler racing, and an unfortunate blonde streak in Zayn 's hair." [...] The Hollywood Reporter writer Sophie A. Schillaci called it [...] "fun-filled", and concluded that the video perfectly accompanies the track's lyricism. Lansky called the [...] "high quality" [...] clip [...] "fairly standard 1D fare", elaborating: [...] "the boys get up to some teenage shenanigans and, well, live while they’re young. When their festivities culminate in a pool party that reads more like a wet t-shirt contest than anything else, it's abundantly clear that 1D knows their audience." [...] The Huffington Post characterised it as an [...] "epic summer adventure", assessing: [...] "from a camping trip to the ultimate beach party, complete with a shirtless Niall [...] and inflatable banana." [...] Collins described it as featuring the group [...] "doing what they do best — scampering, singing, scampering some more." [...] ITN's Lindsay Brown viewed the video as [...] "wholesome", showing them [...] "having some good old fashioned fun." [...] Fuse editor Nicole James praised the apparent recurring trend of [...] "how the group isn't afraid to make fun of themselves." [...] James elaborated: [...] "If it were any other boy band acting out the Monkees-inspired hijinks in 1D's new video [...] "Live While We're Young," [...] it would likely come off as super cheesy. But for these five guys, their sense of comfortable self-awareness <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> through." [...] As of October 2017, the video has over 550 million views.The music video also looks like similar to Big Time Rush's song [...] "Windows Down" [...] music video ...|$|E

When the group from his ward finally escapes they end up travelling to and staying in the doctor and his wife's apartment.

2500|$|Terry Jones – who co-directed the {{original}} film with Gilliam – expressed his opinions forthrightly in May 2005: [...] "Spamalot is utterly pointless. It's full of air…Regurgitating Python is not high {{on my list}} of priorities." [...] However, when asked whether he liked Spamalot during an interview with Dennis Daniel on 98.5 WBON-FM The Bone shortly after the musical's opening on Broadway, Jones said, [...] "Well, I thought it was terrific good fun. [...] It's great to see the audience loving it. I suppose I had reservations as far as…well…the idea of doing scenes from a film on stage. I just don’t get the point of it. They do them terribly well…I mean, they really are good…but I just quite don’t understand what that's about. [...] It isn’t really 'Python.' It is very much Eric." [...] Jones went on to say, [...] "...I think {{the best parts of}} the musical are the new things. For instance, when they do the Andrew Lloyd Webber take-off and this girl comes in and sings 'Whatever Happened to My Part' since she hasn’t appeared since the opening number and she's really furious! That {{is one of the great}} moments where the show <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> alive for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|James Leach of Your Sinclair {{gave the}} ZX Spectrum game a 92/100 rating, writing that [...] "I'm really into this game. As far as I can see, it's got {{everything}} it should have. It's fast, it's easy in places and dead wicked in others and it's got a {{massive amount of}} variety. What more could you want? ... The graphics are very cartoony, as you'd expect, and there's pots of colour." [...] Leach {{also noted that the}} idea of including minigames in Bart vs. the Space Mutants [...] "is pretty inspired, and makes the game even more fun." [...] A reviewer for Crash also gave the ZX Spectrum version a positive review, with a 91/100 rating. He praised the variety and gameplay of the game, and noted that [...] "while it may sound pretty basic [...] it’s when you start discovering things, making use of objects, finding hidden treasures that it <b>really</b> <b>comes</b> alive. And achieving an objective is satisfying because the route to completion can be pretty tough (especially some of the platform elements)." [...] The reviewer also noted that [...] "if you’re a Simpsons fan the game’s incredibly appealing, the graphics all reflect Matt Groening’s cartoon very well. And how much of a fan you are dictates how much you’re really going to enjoy this [...] Non-fans can still get loads of entertainment, but some parts may be frustrating if you’re not into the characters." ...|$|E
