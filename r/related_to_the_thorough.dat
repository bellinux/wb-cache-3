The main objective of the project presented n this book was to build capacities of Human Resources in charge, or potentially linked with, the conservation, the development and the enhancement of tangible cultural heritage in Lebanon, while the main subject of the action is to establish accurate high definition 3 D digital data and documentation for Heritage Sites through pilot on-site operation for Baalbek World Heritage Site. The project was developed in a two-phase framework, where Phase I was completed in collaboration with Lebanon’s Directorate General of Antiquities and consultants from the Raymond Lemaire International Centre for Conservation (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven) who guided the 3 D recording of the property, using a time-of-flight laser scanning device, which produced a reliable and accurate set of 3 D point clouds. Furthermore, Phase II focused on providing the methodological framework for “Risk Preparedness” in order to evaluate the rate of decay affecting the integrity of the traces in the fabric and the significance of the property. A designated pilot area’s state of conservation was studied in detail and the methodology was also tested here. This can serve as an example for future works <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>thorough</b> assessment of the entire property. This work represents the effort of a multidisciplinary and international team of experts from Lebanon, Belgium, Portugal and Venezuela with the support of UNESCO Beirut Office. Additionally, the team has produced a number of guidelines for the preparation of measured drawings of the entire property, using 3 D Laser Scanning data and panoramic photography, acquired during Phase I. nrpages: 74 status: publishe...|$|E

Such acceptance and support, i.e., the defining characteristics of investiture, {{may have been}} <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more <b>thorough</b> exposure that Americans generally had {{in their daily lives}} to Japanese people and culture than the Japanese subjects had to Americans, as well as American subjects’ deeper outgroup acculturation (in terms of prevalently adopting Integration or Assimilation strategies).|$|R
40|$|Evaluation {{of climate}} change impacts upon the natural {{processes}} {{is one of the}} possible methods for verifying hypotheses about the increase of extremes in the observed climatic and hydrologic data series. It <b>relates,</b> of course, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>thorough</b> and detailed analysis of data from the historical observation sets. Trying such evaluations of the statistical characteristics change of the observed data series, we are often confronted with several problems like: short data series, non-homogeneity of the observation series, observation gaps, etc. In the presented study, statistical methods are used for evaluation of changes in the maximum volumes of runoff of the Danube River within two time periods: 1876 – 1940 and 1941 – 2005. For calculation of these yearly peak runoff volumes of particular durations, a reconstructed 130 -year series of the mean daily discharge of the Danube at Bratislava gauging station was used...|$|R

Vladimir Fyodorovich Gening, a {{prominent}} Soviet archaeologist, was <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> start research on this culture and offer its theoretical substantiation. As a result of surveys and excavations conducted in Udmurtia and Bashkiria starting 1954, he accumulated a vast archaeological material <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> culture. A <b>thorough</b> analysis of V. F. Gening’s publications and essays on the Mazunino culture sites is provided. The evolution of the scholar’s views regarding the culture basic elements (territory, implements, burial rite, dating, origin, cultural ties and further fate) are traced in the article.

40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} in acoustics, structure–acoustics, and structure–hydroacoustic engineering applications leads to large systems of equations, {{and is still}} a challenge to current high-performance computer systems. The demands for extremely large models are due to large physical domains or <b>the</b> desire <b>to</b> resolve high-frequency levels, at least {{as long as the}} different modes are separated, say to 500 Hz. This obviously calls for small elements. It is therefore of great interest to have procedures for domain splitting, fluid–structure and fluid–fluid, thus splitting the analysis procedure into smaller problems. Use of multiple processing also lies down the road. Furthermore changes in design often affect only part of the geometry, thus, only that particular domain needs to be recalculated, for instance in the case of sound quality engineering. The interest and efforts put into numerical methods <b>related</b> <b>to</b> fluid–structure interaction are still spreading. This applies both to engineering application studies and applied mathematical issues <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> topic. <b>Thorough</b> investigations of issues of basic nature {{can be found in the}} literature [Harari et al., Arch. Comput. Meth. Eng. 3 (2 – 3) (1996) 131 – 309; H. Morand, R. Ohayon, Fluid Structure Interaction, Wiley, 1995]. A reduction procedure of the structure and multiple fluid domains is exercised. The coupled problem is formulated as a symmetric standard problem. A subsequent {{analysis in}} the time domain can be performed on a subset of the eigenmodes.
