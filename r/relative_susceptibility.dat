40|$|Given {{a network}} and a {{partition}} in n communities, we {{address the issues}} ``how communities influence each other'' and ``when two given communities do communicate''. We prove that, for a small-world network, among communities, a simple superposition principle applies and each community {{plays the role of}} a microscopic spin governed by a sort of effective TAP (Thouless, Anderson and Palmer) equations. The <b>relative</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> derived from these equations calculated at finite or zero temperature (where the method provides an effective percolation theory) give us the answers to the above issues. As for the already studied case n= 1, these equations are exact in the paramagnetic regions (at T= 0 this means below the percolation threshold) and provide effective approximations in the other regions. However, unlike the case n= 1, asymmetries among the communities may lead, via the TAP-like structure of the equations, to many metastable states whose number, in the case of negative short-cuts among the communities, may grow exponentially fast with n and glassy scenarios with a remarkable presence of abrupt jumps take place. Furthermore, as a byproduct, from the <b>relative</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> a natural and efficient method to detect the community structure of a generic network emerges.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} upward {{spectral}} radiances are analyzed, which were sampled above subtropical trade wind cumuli near Barbados. Data {{were collected by}} a new measurement setup consisting of two payloads attached to a helicopter. This unique approach allows for collocated measurements of high–resolution microphysical cloud data, aerosol particle number size dis- tributions and the radiation reflected from cloud top, yielding a quantification of the first indirect aerosol effect of shallow water clouds. With {{the help of the}} spectral radiation data methods are introduced which help to identify cloud data that are influenced by the albedo of the water surface, as well as three–dimensional radiative effects. A statistical measure of cloud inhomogeneity is introduced, characterizing the observed trade wind cumuli to exhibit medium to high inhomogeneity with respect to upward radiances in the visible wavelength range. The influence of the substantial cloud inhomogeneity on the remote sensing of the cloud optical thickness and the effective droplet radius is quantified. It is shown, that misrep- resentation of the often observed overlying thin cirrus layers in the usual retrieval approaches yields an overestimation in retrieved effective droplet radius of up to 50 % and and underestimation in retrieved cloud optical thickness of up to 6 %. A new retrieval algorithm is introduced which minimizes the effects of the overlying cirrus without a priori knowledge of its properties. The results from the new algorithm are compared to in situ observations of the effective droplet radius, yielding a high agreement of ± 1 μm. <b>Relative</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> of the retrieved microphysical and optical cloud parameters, as well as cloud top reflectivities, are derived to quantify the first indirect aerosol effect for subtropical trade wind cumuli. These <b>relative</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> are in the range of the maximum possible susceptibility following the theory for homogeneous clouds. Parameterizations of the cloud optical thickness and the effective droplet radius {{as a function of the}} derived <b>relative</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> and the liquid water path are introduced.

40|$|Given {{a network}} and a {{partition}} in communities, {{we consider the}} issues "how communities influence each other" and "when two given communities do communicate". Specifically, we address these questions {{in the context of}} small-world networks, where an arbitrary quenched graph is given and long range connections are randomly added. We prove that, among the communities, a superposition principle applies and gives rise to a natural generalization of the effective field theory already presented in [Phys. Rev. E 78, 031102] (n= 1), which here (n> 1) consists in a sort of effective TAP (Thouless, Anderson and Palmer) equations in which each community plays the role of a microscopic spin. The <b>relative</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> derived from these equations calculated at finite or zero temperature, where the method provides an effective percolation theory, give us the answers to the above issues. Unlike the case n= 1, asymmetries among the communities may lead, via the TAP-like structure of the equations, to many metastable states whose number, in the case of negative short-cuts among the communities, may grow exponentially fast with n. As examples we consider the n Viana-Bray communities model and the n one-dimensional small-world communities model. Despite being the simplest ones, the relevance of these models in network theory, as e. g. in social networks, is crucial and no analytic solution were known until now. Connections between percolation and the fractal dimension of a network are also discussed. Finally, as an inverse problem, we show how, from the <b>relative</b> <b>susceptibilities,</b> a natural and efficient method to detect the community structure of a generic network arises.

40|$|We have {{developed}} and optimized a 96 -well microtiter plate assay, {{based on the}} reduction of alamarBlue, to assess the efficacies of much needed new antimicrobials against Acanthamoeba species. This assay has been optimized for determination of drug efficacy against two potentially pathogenic species, Acanthamoeba castellanii and Acanthamoeba polyphaga, and has been validated by comparison of their <b>relative</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> to chlorhexidine, a drug widely used to treat Acanthamoeba keratitis. The results demonstrate that the assay is comparable to a manual counting assay and that A. polyphaga is more resistant to chlorhexidine than A. castellanii. Thus, by use of the manual counting assay, 3. 125 muM chlorohexidine was almost completely effective against A. castellanii, whereas this concentration was less than 20 % effective against A. polyphaga. Similar results were obtained by the alamarBlue assay. The new assay {{was used to determine}} the <b>relative</b> <b>susceptibilities</b> of A. castellanii and A. polyphaga to the alkylphosphocholines (APCs) hexadecylphosphocholine (hexadecyl-PC; miltefosine) and octadecylphosphocholine (octadecyl-PC) as well as an alkylgycerolphosphocholine, edelfosine. Both APCs studied were equally effective against A. castellanii, but octadecyl-PC was less effective than hexadecyl-PC against A. polyphaga. Both APCs were more effective than edelfosine against both Acanthamoeba species. A. polyphaga was found to be significantly less susceptible to each of the phosphocholine analogues. The newly described assay offers a number of advantages over those described previously. It is less labor-intensive than previously described assays and is sensitive and rapid, and the results can be read in a nonsubjective manner. As it is based on a standard 96 -well, microtiter plate, it is amenable to automation and high throughput...|$|R
