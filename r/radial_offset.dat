While the plane of the ellipse is near the other feature's shared reflection symmetry plane, it is definitely offset. This structure's kinematics are the only such ones known among studied PN. Unlike all the other Mz 3 structures, there is no increase of velocity as the <b>radial</b> <b>offset</b> from the nucleus increases. Consequently, this must not be a simple equatorial flow despite the fact that its motion appears to be strictly radial (that is, there is no indication of rotation which would suggest that this feature is dynamically stable). All the kinematic properties of the ellipse are symmetric and very ordered relative to the nucleus, consistent with all the other Mz 3 features. Therefore, the ellipse must be historically linked to the evolution of the central star.|$|E

Plunge milling is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the <b>radial</b> <b>offset</b> has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated.The cutting parameters {{play a key role in}} plunge milling. The cutting force and machine stability both are influenced by machining parameters. Frequency domain model can be used to estimate the machining stability.|$|E

The characterization of the scatter component in small animal PET imaging has received little attention owing to the small scatter fraction (SF) when imaging rodents. The {{purpose of this study}} is first to design and fabricate a cone-shaped phantom which can be used for measurement of object size-dependent SF and noise equivalent count rates (NECR), and second, to assess these parameters for two small animal PET scanners as function of <b>radial</b> <b>offset,</b> object size and lower energy threshold (LET). The X-PET (TM) and LabPET- 8 (TM) scanners were modeled as realistically as possible using GATE Monte Carlo simulation platform. The simulation models were validated against experimental measurements in terms of sensitivity, SF and NECR. The dedicated phantom was fabricated in-house using high-density polyethylene. The optimized dimensions of the cone-shaped phantom are 158 mm (length), 20 mm (minimum diameter), 70 mm (maximum diameter) and taper angle of 9 A degrees. The relative difference between simulated and experimental results for the LabPET- 8 (TM) scanner varied between 0. 7 % and 10 % except for a few results where it was below 16 %. Depending on the <b>radial</b> <b>offset</b> from the center of the central axial field-of-view (3 - 6 cm diameter), the SF for the cone-shaped phantom varied from 26. 3 % to 18. 2 %, 18. 6 to 13. 1 % and 10. 1 to 7. 6 % for the X-PET (TM), whereas it varied from 34. 4 % to 26. 9 %, 19. 1 to 17. 0 % and 9. 1 to 7. 3 % for the LabPET- 8 (TM), for LETs of 250, 350 and 425 keV, respectively. The SF increases as the <b>radial</b> <b>offset</b> decreases, LET decreases and object size increases. The SF is higher for the LabPET- 8 (TM) compared with the X-PET (TM) scanner. The NECR increases as the <b>radial</b> <b>offset</b> increases and object size decreases. The maximum NECR was obtained at a LET of 350 keV for the LabPET- 8 (TM) and 250 keV for the X-PET (TM). High correlation coefficients for SF and NECR were observed between the cone-shaped phantom and an equivalent volume cylindrical phantom for the three considered axial fields of view. A single cone-shaped phantom enables the assessment of the impact of three factors, namely <b>radial</b> <b>offset,</b> LET and object size on PET SF and count rate estimates.

In this paper, we study how LRGs occupy massive haloes via counts in clusters and reveal several unexpected trends. Using the red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation (redMaPPer) cluster catalogue, we derive the central occupation of LRGs as a function richness. We show that clusters contain a significantly lower fraction of central LRGs than predicted from the two-point correlation function. At halo masses of 1014. 5 [*]M⊙, we find Ncen = 0. 73 compared toNcen = 0. 89 from correlation studies. Our central occupation function for LRGs converges to 0. 95 at large halo masses. A strong anticorrelation between central luminosity and cluster mass at fixed richness is required to reconcile our results with those based on clustering studies. We derive the probability that the brightest cluster member is not the central galaxy. We find PBNC ≈ 20 – 30 per cent which is a factor of ∼ 2 lower than the value found by Skibba et al.

40|$|Demands on {{improved}} efficiency, reduced {{emissions and}} lowered noise levels cause a strive towards high by-pass ratios of commercial turbofan engines. This {{results in an}} increased <b>radial</b> <b>offset</b> between the high- and low-pressure turbines. Thus {{the design of the}} intermediate turbine duct connecting the two turbines becomes more challenging. In this thesis the main focus is to explore techniques that enable design of turbine ducts with reduced length, larger <b>radial</b> <b>offset</b> or increased diffusion, so-called aggressive ducts. Response surface methodology and design of experiments techniques have been adopted to perform duct shape optimization based on CFD. A novel geometry parameterization suitable for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric endwalls, based on axial orthogonal polynomials and circumferential harmonics, has been introduced. Results show that shape optimization has the potential to reduce duct loss significantly. Flow control could be applied to avoid separation in highly aggressive ducts. Vortex generators are well-known, reliable and cost-effective passive flow control devices and have therefore been used in this work. Resolving the small scales of vortex generators requires fine grids and time consuming computations. Therefore a computational body-force model was developed and validated. The baseline separation in a very aggressive turbine duct was suppressed by an optimized vortex generator installation, defined using the body-force model.

AIMS. In this contribution we highlight the importance to account for the orbital eccentricity and longitude of periastron of the planetary orbit to accurately interpret the measured planetary radial velocity during the transit. Methods: We calculate the radial velocity of a transiting planet in an eccentric orbit. Given the larger orbital speed of planets with respect to their stellar companions even small eccentricities can result in detectable blue or redshift <b>radial</b> velocity <b>offsets</b> during the transit with respect to the systemic velocity, the exact value depending also on the longitude of the periastron of the planetary orbit. For an hot-jupiter planet, an eccentricity of only e= 0. 01 can produce a <b>radial</b> velocity <b>offset</b> of the order of the km/s. Conclusions: We propose an alternative interpretation of the recently claimed radial velocity blueshift (~ 2 km/s) of the planetary spectral lines of HD 209458 b which implies that the orbit of this system is not exactly circular. In this case, the longitude of the periastron of the stellar orbit is most likely confined in the first quadrant (and that one of the planet in the third quadrant). We highlight that transmission spectroscopy allows not only to study the compositional properties of planetary atmospheres, but also to refine their orbital parameters and that any conclusion regarding the presence of windflows on planetary surfaces coming from transmission spectroscopy measurements requires precise known orbital parameters from RV.

We present a quantitative derivation of the angular momentum and energy distribution of escaping stars from a star cluster in the tidal field of the Milky Way and derive the connection to the position and width of the clumps. For the numerical realization we use star-by-star $N$-body simulations. We find a very good agreement of theory and models.

The mean <b>radial</b> <b>offset</b> is 2. 77 times the tidal radius in the outer disc. Near the Galactic centre the circumstances are more complicated, but to lowest order the theory still applies. We have also measured the Jacobi energy distribution of bound stars and showed that there is a large fraction of stars (about 35 %) above the critical Jacobi energy at all times, which can potentially leave the cluster. This is a hint that the mass loss is dominated by a self-regulating process of increasing Jacobi energy due to the weakening of the potential well of the star cluster, which is induced by the mass loss itself.

40|$|The {{designation}} of the customary restricted three-body disturbing potential Φ as the perturbation Hamiltonian {{is believed to}} be the cause of Neptune ring arcs ’ <b>radial</b> <b>offset</b> between theories and observations. To identify the appropriate perturbation Hamiltonian, the energy integral in the fixed frame of a restricted three-body system, consisting of the central, primary, and test bodies, is reconsidered. It is shown that the perturbation energy includes the disturbing potential Φ and the potential arising from the angular momentum terms of the test body. Both potentials happen to be singular as the test body goes to infinity contradicting to the perturbation nature. These two potentials can be combined to an energy relevant disturbing potential Φ ∗ = βΦ which is regular at infinity because of the cancellation of the singularities. For circular orbits of the primary, the energy equation is conservative, and Φ ∗ is identified as the perturbation Hamiltonian. Applying this result to evaluate the backgrund effect of Triton to the arc-Galatea system of Neptune, it is shown that there is a small difference ∆Φ = (Φ ∗ − Φ) which amounts to an outward <b>radial</b> <b>offset</b> of the corotation location of Galatea by 0. 3 Km.

The need for proper consideration of antenna offsets is highlighted and block/constellation specific <b>radial</b> antenna <b>offset</b> values for the center-of-mass correction of broadcast orbits are derived. Likewise, the need for application of differential code biases in the comparison of broadcast and precise clock products is emphasized. For GPS, {{the analysis of the}} legacy navigation message is complemented by a discussion of the CNAV message performance based on the first CNAV test campaign in June 2013. Global average SISRE values for the individual constellations amount to 0. 7 +/- 0. 02 m (GPS), 1. 5 +/- 0. 1 m (BeiDou), 1. 6 +/- 0. 3 m (Galileo), 1. 9 +/- 0. 1 m (GLONASS), and 0. 6 +/- 0. 2 m (QZSS) over a twelve-month period in 2013 / 14...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study of the <b>radial</b> {{velocity}} <b>offsets</b> between narrow emission lines and host galaxy lines (stellar absorption and H I 21 -cm emission) in Seyfert galaxies with observed redshifts less than 0. 043. We find that 35 % of the Seyferts in the sample show [O III] emission lines with blueshifts with respect to their host galaxies exceeding 50 km/s, whereas only 6 % show redshifts this large, in qualitative agreement with most previous studies. We also find that a greater percentage of Seyfert 1 galaxies show blueshifts than Seyfert 2 galaxies. Using HST/STIS spatially-resolved spectra of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 and the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151, we generate geometric models of their narrow-line regions (NLRs) and inner galactic disks, and show how these models can explain the blueshifted [O III] emission lines in collapsed STIS spectra of these two Seyferts. We conclude that the combination of mass outflow of ionized gas in the NLR and extinction by dust in the inner disk (primarily in the form of dust spirals) is primarily responsible for the velocity offsets in Seyfert galaxies. More exotic explanations are not needed. We discuss the implications of this result for the velocity offsets found in higher redshift AGN.
