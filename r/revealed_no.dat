5|$|The letter {{caused a}} stir in the upper echelons of the Nazi regime. In his diaries, Joseph Goebbels, Reich Minister of Propaganda, assumed that someone in the German Catholic church {{organisation}} wrote, and distributed, the letter. A bounty of 100,000 Reichsmark, posted by the Führer himself, <b>revealed</b> <b>no</b> clues to its origins.

5|$|A {{search of}} this star by the Hubble Space Telescope <b>revealed</b> <b>no</b> stellar companions, {{although}} {{this does not}} preclude the presence of smaller companions that are below the telescope's detection limit, such as a planet orbiting within one astronomical unit of the star. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate {{the lack of a}} debris disk in orbit around it. Radial velocity measurements of this star using the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) instrument at the Keck II observatory have not revealed any variations that might otherwise indicate the presence of an orbiting companion. This instrumentation is sensitive enough to detect the gravitational perturbations massive, short period companions with the mass of Neptune or greater.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett {{decided to}} send a team back to {{establish}} {{the exact location of}} the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars <b>revealed</b> <b>no</b> signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the National Cancer Institute {{undertook}} a large study, using cancer case {{information from the}} Institute's SEER database. The published findings from the study revealed {{that there was no}} increased incidence of cancer in persons who may have received vaccine containing SV40. Another large study in Sweden examined cancer rates of 700,000 individuals who had received potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957; the study again <b>revealed</b> <b>no</b> increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 and those who did not. The question of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the people}} from Pichilemu are Catholic, as of the 2002 census, 7,611 persons (83.44%), well above the {{national}} and regional average (69.96% and 79.08%, respectively); the evangelical population is considerably lower, at only 689 people (7.55%); 361 (3.96%) said they were Atheists or Agnostic individuals, while the remaining 460 (5.04%) are part of other religions. Based on information from the Casen survey, twenty-four persons living in Pichilemu declared themselves as Aymaras in 2006, and in 2009, 390 people said {{they were part of}} the Mapuche indigenous ethnic group; the survey <b>revealed</b> <b>no</b> one living in Pichilemu claimed to be either of the Atacameños or of the Rapa Nui indigenous peoples.|$|E

5|$|On September 8, 2001, Titania occulted {{a bright}} star (HIP106829) with a visible {{magnitude}} of 7.2; {{this was an}} opportunity to both refine Titania's diameter and ephemeris, and to detect any extant atmosphere. The data <b>revealed</b> <b>no</b> atmosphere to a surface pressure of 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar); if it exists, {{it would have to be}} far thinner than that of Triton or Pluto. This upper limit is still several times higher than the maximum possible surface pressure of the carbon dioxide, meaning that the measurements place essentially no constraints on parameters of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests <b>revealed</b> <b>no</b> serious {{shortcomings}} in the air. The operational CG {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and their effect on the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E
5|$|Durant {{was forced}} out of the 2015 season due to injury when he {{suffered}} a ruptured Achilles tendon in the Riders' first week game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. After rehabbing his Achilles tendon all off-season Durant returned as the Roughriders leading quarterback for the 2016 season. Early {{in the second quarter of}} the fourth week Durant left the game after BC defensive linemen Mic’hael Brooks fell into his leg on a passing play. He was taken into the Riders locker room and later appeared on the sidelines using crutches. Following the game the X-Rays <b>revealed</b> <b>no</b> structural damage, and Durant was considered day-to-day with an ankle sprain. Durant ending up only missing two weeks returning as the starting quarterback in Week 7. Durant was also rested for the final game of the season as the team was eliminated from playoff competition and wanted to see their other quarterbacks on roster (Brandon Bridge, Mitchell Gale, and G.J. Kinne) get some playing time. Following the conclusion of the regular season Durant expressed his disappointment that contract negotiations with the Roughriders had stalled. If no deal had been reached, Durant would have been a free-agent when the free agency period commenced on 14 February 2017. On January 5, 2017 the Riders made a new offer to Durant. The offer reportedly included a base salary of around $300,000, with performance incentives set to reach $400,000 in 2017.|$|E

5|$|Following the Norman Conquest of England, William the Conqueror {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Wales. According to the Domesday Survey of 1086, the Norman Robert of Rhuddlan was nominally in command of the whole of northern Wales. He was killed by the Welsh in 1088. His cousin Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester, reasserted Norman control of north Wales by building three castles: one at an unknown location somewhere in Meirionnydd, one at Aberlleiniog on Anglesey, and another at Caernarfon. This early castle was built on a peninsula, bounded by the River Seiont, the Menai Strait; {{it would have been a}} motte and bailey, defended by a timber palisade and earthworks. While the motte, or mound, was integrated into the later Edwardian castle, the location of the original bailey is uncertain, although it may have been to the north-east of the motte. Excavations on top of the motte in 1969 <b>revealed</b> <b>no</b> traces of medieval occupation, suggesting any evidence had been removed. It is likely that the motte was surmounted by a wooden tower known as a keep. The Welsh recaptured Gwynedd in 1115, and Caernarfon Castle came into the possession of the Welsh princes. From contemporary documents written at the castle, it is known that Llywelyn the Great and later Llywelyn ap Gruffudd occasionally stayed at Caernarfon.|$|E
5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound <b>revealed</b> <b>no</b> anomalies of internal organs.|$|E
