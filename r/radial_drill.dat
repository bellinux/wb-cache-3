30|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>drilling</b> {{is already}} {{not a new}} {{technique}} in the petroleum engineering area. According {{to the state of}} art (Marbun et al. 2011), <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> is implemented through a special high pressure tube to form the water jet to penetrate and drill several lateral boreholes in one or several layers, which is an effective way to increase the drainage area and improve the oil recovery. Dickinson et al. (1989) first introduced the <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> system and predicted the promising expectation of this drilling system. Dickinson et al. (1992) presented two methods of combining water jet drilling and coiled tubing, and discussed their advantages and weaknesses in the practice. Yang et al. (2006) introduced the technique status in China and its application situation in Liaohe oilfield. Bruni et al. (2007) exhibited the <b>Radial</b> <b>drilling</b> technique in Argentina. Ursegov et al. (2008) presented the first results of cyclic steam stimulations of vertical wells with radial horizontal bores in heavy oil carbonates, and the results validated the wide usability of <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> technique. And Abdel-Ghany et al. (2011) stated the first <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> well conditions in Egypt. As for all of the researches above, most of them are just focused on the application status or the techniques of the <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> system, but almost no research was carried out to probe how to optimize the <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> branch length and branch number in terms of reservoir engineering respect, which is quite important for the multi-layer water drive reservoirs.|$|R

The paper {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} results of <b>radial</b> <b>drilling,</b> drilling perforation, cumulative reperforation and acid treatment. The study was focused at carbonate deposits in Russia. For each technology average incremental oil rates were estimated at the same exploration targets. The analysis of technological effectiveness in the given geologic and physical conditions revealed that <b>drilling</b> perforation and <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> allow reaching higher incremental oil rates compared to acid treatment and cumulative perforation. This fact confirms effectiveness of <b>drilling</b> <b>radial</b> canals by enlarging infiltration area. For the sake of completion <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> and drilling perforation are performed in the same wells. To reveal limiting conditions of applying <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> and drilling perforation an effectiveness analysis is made depending on the thickness of the interlayers exposed. To formulate criteria of radial exposing applicability an analysis of effects of different geological and physical formation parameters on geological and engineering operations effectiveness is done. The following parameters are considered: relation between the current formation pressure and initial formation pressure, formation permeability, skin factor, thickness of interlayers in overall perforation interval, thickness of interlayers exposed by radial canals.

30|$|In the low {{permeability}} reservoirs, several layers are produced together, {{due to the}} differences in the rock properties, the flow abilities of different layers are quite various, which lead to the conflicts of multi-layer, and unbalanced displacement performance. In the practice, engineers tried to solve this problem using the <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> technique in the poor property layers to drill several boreholes in order to improve their flow ability, which is proved to be really effective. But, there is still no theoretical basis to guide the engineers to decide how long the lateral wells should be drilled and how many number of the lateral branch bores should be implemented. So, herein according to the equilibrium displacement principle, applying the equivalent flow resistance method, the model of optimizing the <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> branch number and length in the high water cut {{low permeability}} reservoirs is established.|$|R

Then, given the values of branch length a and the branch number n, applying Eq.  22 – 29, the time spent Δt 1 for the water saturation of the exit end from S we 1 to S weq is calculated. If the difference between Δt 1 and Δt 2 is not negligible, {{try to change the}} values of branch length a and branch number n to recalculate the time spent Δt 1, until the difference is reduced to the tolerant error. Then, the results are the optimal <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> branch number n and branch length a values that are used to realize the equilibrium displacement in the high water cut stage of the low permeability reservoirs.|$|R

The results indicated that the rock breaking result of pulsed cavitating multihole nozzle is better than that of multihole nozzle. The rock breaking volume is 1. 23 ∼ 2. 35 times. To guarantee the minimum hole diameter is bigger than nozzle diameter, jet impact pressure should not be lower than 30 MPa in the experiment. The experimental optimal standoff distance is 12 mm.

5000|$|A <b>radial</b> arm <b>drill</b> {{press is}} a large geared head drill press in which the head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine's column. As it is {{possible}} to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a <b>radial</b> arm <b>drill</b> press is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the drill head than it is to unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing {{out of the way of}} the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a <b>radial</b> arm <b>drill</b> press, but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture. Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest <b>radial</b> arm <b>drill</b> presses are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron. <b>Radial</b> arm <b>drills</b> are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm.

This paper establishes mechanical equations for jet bits and analyzes the hydroseal of backward jets in bottom holes.

Laboratory experiments indicate that the flow rate, the angle between the backward nozzle axis and the jet bit axis, and the hole diameter are the major influencing factors; the generation of the pulling force is mainly due to the inlet pressure of the jet bit; the backward jets can significantly increase not only the pulling force but also the stability of jet bits. The pulling force would reach 8, 376 N under experimental conditions, which can steadily pull the high-pressure hose forward.|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands, a {{significant}} number (25 +) of small tight natural gas fields are stranded. They are classified, according to the PRMS definition, as ‘contingent resources’. The combination of low GIIP and low permeability currently do not allow these fields to be developed economically without stimulation, which is usually required to produce tight gas reservoirs. The recent change in legislation on hydraulic fracturing increases {{the need for a}} more cost effective and politically accepted alternative. Since natural gas has played, and will continue {{to play an important role}} in the energy security of the Netherlands, alternative methods are considered to extract these stranded resources. <b>Radial</b> jet <b>drilling</b> could be such an alternative method to develop these reservoirs in a cost effective, environmental friendly and socially acceptable manner. In this report, a numerical reservoir simulator is used to compare the production performance of a synthetic low permeable homogeneous reservoir based on three development options: a conventional vertical well, a vertical well stimulation through <b>radial</b> jet <b>drilling</b> and one case where the vertical well is stimulated through hydraulic fracturing. The static and dynamic models are based on typical tight gas reservoir properties as found in the Netherlands. The objectives are: to determine the operational scope / boundary conditions for the application potential of <b>radial</b> jet <b>drilling,</b> to identify the reservoir- and well variables that control the effectiveness and production performance, and to evaluate the economics. The comparison of the development option includes a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the well and reservoir performance and the impact it has on the economic viability. The simulations demonstrate that the laterals appear to be most effective in low permeable (~ 0. 1 mD) reservoirs, reservoirs with near-well bore formation damage, with lower initial water saturation's, depleted reservoirs and thin reservoirs. The laterals appear less effective in more permeable reservoirs and reservoirs with high horizontal-to-vertical anisotropy. The application of small diameter laterals generally results in a recovery improvement factor of 2 - 3. 5 compared to a vertical well. The initial gas production improves with a factor 4 - 7. The small diameter laterals become effective for reservoirs with permeabilities lower than 10 mD. In reservoirs with a permeability lower than 0. 1 mD the application results in a recovery factor improvement of at least 2. The lateral length is the well design parameter that has the most profound impact on the recovery factor. The economics demonstrate that the onshore application of <b>radial</b> jet <b>drilling</b> as a stimulation method is economically feasible and robust whereas a vertical well is economically very marginal. The offshore application of <b>radial</b> jet <b>drilling</b> is only feasible for stranded volumes $>$ 1 BCM in combination with a re-entry scenario.
