The organisation also promotes the use and take up of DAB in the United Kingdom and ensure that the deadline for digital migration in 2015 is met. Digital Radio UK is formed from the Digital Radio Delivery Group which also absorbed the Digital Radio Development Bureau (DRDB).

5|$|On October 1, 1938, Skelton {{replaced}} Red Foley as {{the host}} of Avalon Time on NBC; Edna also joined the show's cast, under her maiden name. She developed a system for working with the show's writers: selecting material from them, adding her own and filing the unused bits and lines for future use; the Skeltons worked on Avalon Time until late 1939. Skelton's work in films led to a new regular radio show offer; between films, he promoted himself and MGM by appearing without charge at Los Angeles area banquets. A <b>radio</b> <b>advertising</b> agent was a guest {{at one of his}} banquet performances and recommended Skelton to one of his clients.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{was cast}} as {{four of the}} show's main {{characters}}: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. MacFarlane chose to voice these characters himself, believing {{it would be easier}} to portray the voices he already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian. The voice of Quagmire was inspired by fast-speaking <b>radio</b> <b>advertising</b> spokesmen from the 1950s. MacFarlane also provides voices for various other recurring and one-time characters, including news anchor Tom Tucker and Lois' father Carter Pewterschmidt.|$|E

25|$|The new {{business}} controlled 60% of the <b>radio</b> <b>advertising</b> market in November 1998 {{and more than}} half the market in 2002. However, in response to increased competition and falling market share, it looked for ways to cut costs. In its early years Classic Hits broadcast live local programmes in every region from Monday to Saturday, taking Auckland network programmes at night and on Sundays. In 1998 it reduced local programming to four hours a day in all regions except Christchurch, and introduced new network shows for mornings and afternoons. As Christchurch announcers left, their shows were also replaced with network programmes.|$|E

25|$|The chindonya had {{a revival}} again between 1946 and 1956, and between 1950 and 1960 there {{were up to}} 2,500 chindon'ya active in Japan. They often {{performed}} on black markets. Many stores also moved from a street stall to fixed locations, generating business for chindon'ya, as did {{the rise of the}} pachinko business. One well known group in Osaka was Aozora Gakudan, founded by former actor Saeki Yosan. This group played with up to 18 members, and many other chindon'ya joined this group. The introduction of TV and <b>radio</b> <b>advertising</b> had only a small effect on the chindon'ya, as these new mediums were too expensive for the small shops that used the chindon'ya services, and not targeted enough for the customers living nearby the stores.|$|E
25|$|Among PEF's major {{political}} initiatives {{at this time}} were a cost-of-living increase for worker pensions. Benson also said he would seek improvements to job security; accrual (rather than use-or-lose) for overtime, sick leave, and vacation; eliminate tiers in the pension plan; seek an end to penalties for early retirement; new workplace safety protections; {{an increase in the}} size of the state workforce; and new restrictions on contracting out. The state replied that it would seek a four-year wage freeze. Angered by the state's response in a time of budget surpluses, Benson led PEF workers in an extensive lobbying effort. He also said PEF would seek a three-year rather than four-year contract, and 5 percent per year wage increases. Benson also replaced the union's top negotiator in order to adopt a more aggressive stand with the state. The state countered with a 3 percent per year salary increase over four years, coupled with new restrictions on time off for union business, higher health care costs, and new worktime reporting requirements (all of which PEF rejected). At a rally at the state capital on January 5, 2000, some 5,000 (state estimate) to 25,000 (PEF estimate) workers peacefully confronted 25 Albany police and 300 New York State troopers. PEF revised its wage offer to 12 percent over three years. Benson accused the state in March 2000 of dragging out the negotiations, and began a statewide <b>radio</b> <b>advertising</b> campaign against the governor. In April, PEF accepted a contract with the New York State Canal Corporation with a 3 percent per year salary hike. Days later, after another state union accepted a contract containing a 13.6 percent raise over four years, about 2,000 PEF members held a noisy rally outside the governor's offices demanding faster negotiations. Two weeks afterward, PEF agreed to end its advertising campaign and rallies as a spur to negotiations. A week later, Governor George Pataki agreed to wage and pension COLAs. A tentative agreement reached on June 10, 2000, incorporated a 13 percent wage hike over four years, rejected the new working time data collection methods, and imposed slight increases in member health care payments. Union members approved the contract by a vote of 33,899 to 2,876.|$|E

500|$|As the new decade dawned, it was {{speculated that}} Briskin would sign an {{agreement}} with Paramount Studios, in charge of production under Y. Frank Freeman, in the new position, Briskin would function as the de facto head of production for the studio. After accepting the position, his tenure was short lived, as he resigned in January 1951, due to an undisclosed illness, although he remained employed by the studio. By April, {{it was announced that}} Briskin would remain at Paramount, and had signed a five-year contract to produce for the studio. In July 1951 Briskin was selected to head up the [...] "Movie Town U.S.A." [...] <b>radio</b> <b>advertising</b> campaign for the Council of Motion Picture Companies (COMPO). The Movietime campaign was scheduled to debut on October 8, 1951 with over 200 acting stars and other Hollywood personalities volunteering their time to make personal appearances in all 48 of the U.S. State capitals, although those locations were later changed to 33 major cities, due to a scheduling conflict with many of the state governors. In addition to his responsibilities at Paramount and with COMPO, in late 1951 Briskin partnered with Sol Lesser to produce 6 films, which were distributed by United Artists. All the films were scheduled for a 1952 release, and Briskin was partly responsible for the financing along with Edward Small, as well as having production oversight. At the time, it was considered a very important independent partnership by the Hollywood community. The partnership, known as Associated Players and Producers, was short-lived, producing only one of the six films agreed to with Universal, Kansas City Confidential, a film noir starring John Payne.|$|E
