The vehicle was certified for European B6 ballistic protection standard. It includes side-blast and under-floor grenade protection, uprated suspension, handling and braking system, wheels fitted with <b>run-flat</b> <b>tire</b> system, and fuel cut-off override. Optional security features include tinted windows, anti-tamper exhaust, and intercom.|$|E
2500|$|The 540i Protection light-armored {{vehicle was}} {{launched}} in Europe on September 1997 and in North America from January 1998, The base price in 1998 was US$88,000. These models included aramid fiber armor, bullet-resistant glass that is coated with polycarbonate to reduce spall. The 540i Protection is rated to withstand the impact of handgun fire {{up to and including}} [...]44 Magnum, the glass is also protected from attack with blunt objects such as baseball bats and bricks. The additional security measures brought an additional weight of 130 kg compared to the normal 540i sedan. on request, an intercom system was available and from January 1998 a <b>run-flat</b> <b>tire</b> was available.|$|E
50|$|While {{the use of}} a <b>run-flat</b> <b>tire</b> {{can prevent}} these problems, some run-flat tires have other {{inherent}} flaws that make them less appealing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires</b> and emergency spare tires by several tire and vehicle manufacturers has motivated {{to make at}} least some basic TPMS mandatory when using <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires.</b> With <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires,</b> the driver will most likely not notice that a tire is running flat, hence the so-called [...] "run-flat warning systems" [...] were introduced. These are most often first generation, purely roll-radius based iTPMS, which ensure that <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires</b> are not used beyond their limitations, usually 80 km/h (49.7 mph) and 80 km (49.7 miles) driving distance. The iTPMS market has progressed as well. Indirect TPMS are able to detect under-inflation through combined use of roll radius and spectrum analysis and hence four-wheel monitoring has become feasible. With this breakthrough, meeting the legal requirements is possible also with iTPMS.|$|R

50|$|<b>Run-flat</b> <b>tires</b> {{accounted}} {{for less than}} 1% of replacement tire sales in the U.S. in 2005. In 2006, {{it was expected that}} such tires would gain popularity with armored vehicle manufacturers, but growth figures were slow with one major model, the Michelin PAX System, no longer being developed by the manufacturer (though replacements will be produced for the foreseeable future). A Michelin study released in 2008 found that 3 percent of drivers worldwide want <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires.</b> U.S. market share is well below 1 percent. American Honda Motor Co. announced that the 2009 Honda Odyssey Touring and Acura RL were its last models available with <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires</b> and with Honda no longer using run-flats. This leaves only a handful of volume manufacturers offering them as standard fittings and only on some models. An exception is BMW, who are the largest fitter of run-flats as original equipment.|$|R
50|$|A <b>run-flat</b> <b>tire</b> is a {{pneumatic}} vehicle tire that {{is designed}} to resist the effects of deflation when punctured, and to enable the vehicle to continue to be driven at reduced speeds (under 56 mph), and for limited distances (generally between 10 mi to 50 mi, {{depending on the type of}} tire).|$|E

50|$|BFGoodrich {{produced}} the first radial tires in the United States in 1965. This innovation made tires even safer as the radial type tire have {{longer tread life}} and permit better absorption of road bumps. The company patented an early sort of <b>run-flat</b> <b>tire</b> two years later, in 1967. This technology enables the vehicle {{to continue to be}} driven in emergencies by avoiding that the tire becomes flat instantly.|$|E
50|$|Most recently, Bridgestone and Pirelli <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires</b> are {{supplied}} on {{some new}} model BMW cars. The automaker promoted these {{as a safety}} feature and {{as an alternative to}} carrying a spare tire.|$|R

50|$|The Kz1000P (police) has 18 inch wheels with Dunlop <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires.</b> The front tire is size MN90-18, and {{the back}} tire is size MR90-18. They came with either cast {{magnesium}} or chrome-plated wire wheels.|$|R
50|$|A {{tire changer}} is a machine {{used to help}} tire {{technicians}} dismount and mount tires with automobile wheels. After the wheel and tire assembly are removed from the automobile, the tire changer has all the components necessary to remove and replace the tire from the wheel. Different tire changers allow technicians to replace tires on automobiles, motorcycles and heavy-duty trucks. New tire and wheel technology has improved certain tire changers {{to be able to}} change a low profile tire or a <b>run-flat</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Stryker {{can alter}} the {{pressure}} in all eight tires to suit terrain conditions: highway, cross-country, mud/sand/snow, and emergency. The system warns the driver if the vehicle exceeds the recommended speed for its tire pressure, then automatically inflates the tires to the next higher pressure setting. The system can also warn the driver of a flat tire, although the Stryker is equipped with <b>run-flat</b> <b>tire</b> inserts that also serve as bead-locks, allowing the vehicle to move at reduced speeds for several miles before the tire completely deteriorates.|$|E
50|$|The Michelin PAX is an {{automobile}} <b>run-flat</b> <b>tire</b> system that utilizes a special type of rim and tire to allow temporary {{use of a}} wheel if its tire is punctured. The core of Michelin's PAX system is the semi-rigid ring installed onto the rim using special equipment. It provides support to the tire and its sidewall to allow emergency operation at limited speed {{until such time as}} the tire can be replaced. Cars that use the system include supercars like the Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4, luxury cars like the Rolls Royce Phantom, and more common vehicles like the Honda Odyssey and Nissan Quest.|$|E
50|$|The Z4 used {{lightweight}} materials {{to offset the}} increased weight over the smaller Z3, such as an aluminium hood and suspension components, magnesium roof frame. <b>Run-flat</b> <b>tires</b> removed {{the need for a}} spare tire, which reduces weight and allows for a larger trunk.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the 335i {{became the}} first 3 Series model to be sold with a {{turbocharged}} petrol engine. The E90 also saw the introduction of <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires</b> to the 3 Series range. Consequently, cars with run-flats are not equipped with a spare tire.|$|R
2500|$|The {{armoured}} [...] "Protection Line" [...] {{vehicles were}} built from 2000â€“2001, {{based on the}} 740iL and 750iL models.

50|$|Besides the cost, {{which can}} be more than double other tires of {{comparable}} size, run-flat tires can not be run flat if the flat is due to sidewall damage, a common cause of flats. Also, under the best circumstances, the speed and range that the run-flat tires can be run flat is very limited. Run-flat tires cannot be driven over 50 miles per hour and usually offer only up to 50 miles of extended mobility. These limitations lower {{the value of the}} extra expense for many buyers. In certain applications, depending on the vehicle, specific tire design, and driving surface, a <b>run-flat</b> <b>tire</b> can provide from 25 miles to 200 miles driving while flat with limited speed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Inner support design {{criteria}} is put forward and systematic cornering theory model is established. Displacement differential equation is deduced, {{and then the}} radial stress and hoop stress expressions of inner support under the condition of high speed are proposed {{on the basis of}} assumption of axisymmetric problem, which makes sure that the inner support is safe under normal pressure and high speed condition. Research results are helpful for inner support structure design of <b>run-flat</b> <b>tire</b> system...|$|E
5000|$|All have inline, 4-cylinder, normally-aspirated four-stroke, double overhead-cam {{engines and}} chain drives, and larger {{generating}} systems than similar civilian models. C- and P-series Police Specials were also equipped with tires designed {{to stay on}} the rim in case of deflation. These <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires,</b> supplied by Dunlop, were able to increase safety significantly by enabling the rider to safely slow to a stop if the tires are damaged in a high-speed pursuit. However, the very thick sidewalls on <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires</b> transmit a much greater level of road shock to the handlebars, increasing rider fatigue; and also generated excess friction/heat which resulted in above average tire wear, prompting operating agencies to migrate to standard high-performance tires. As a result, Dunlop discontinued production of the run-flats. The most popular replacement tires are provided by Metzeler.|$|R
5000|$|In some cases, {{automobiles}} may {{be equipped}} with <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires</b> and thus not require a separate spare tire. Other vehicles may carry a can of tire repair foam, to repair punctured tires, although these often do not work {{in the case of}} larger punctures, and are useless {{in the event of a}} blow-out.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} is {{that many}} <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires</b> cannot be repaired if a puncture occurs. This is due to manufacturer's informing the automotive industry that the state in which the sidewall is in cannot be determined due to the compacted sidewall of rubber. Some brands may permit one repair to a run flat tire, while others do not allow any.|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{wireless}} devices influencing everyday life communication behaviour increases continuously. This trend encourages traffic engineers to develop systems which utilize the identifier of wireless communication standards to measure traffic. The principle to derive traffic parameters by querying the deviceâ€™s address via the BluetoothÂ® interface {{is well known}} and frequently tested by the ITS community. Additionally, the DLR develops methods for measuring travel times in a road network {{on the basis of}} Wi-Fi. A new field of DLRâ€™s research is to detect and recognize vehicles via wireless networks integrated in modern automobiles. Tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) are thought to be promising in-vehicle sensor systems for purposes of traffic. They evaluate inflation pressure of tires and transmit the measured data along with its static identifier to an electronic control unit (ECU) wirelessly. After being mandatory in the U. S., in the European Union all vehicles type approved after November 1 st, 2012 have to be equipped with TPMS as well as all vehicles manufactured after November 1 st, 2014. Thus, the dissemination level of motor vehicles coming with TPMS will theoretically increase up to 100 percent within the upcoming years. Since it is mandatory for every sold <b>run-flat</b> <b>tire</b> system, already today car dealers sell vehicle equipped with TPMS. For proof of concept the authors selected an aftermarket TPMS consisting of four sensors and display unit. Its sensors were easy to mount by replacing the valve caps with the sensor caps. The sensors proved to be advantageous for our purposes since by removing and reinstating the battery, a measurement and transmission can be triggered. Thus the moment of transmission was known, the raw signal data is easy to capture. Since the protocols do not rely on cryptographic mechanisms, the modulation scheme was determined: the data transmission of the selected TPMS utilizes an amplitude shift keying in the 433 MHz band. Next, we resolved the encoding scheme. The sensors employed Manchester encoding, which is a binary signalling mechanism that combines data and clock into bit-symbols. In order to understand the messageâ€™s bitfield, we varied pressure and temperature and observed which bits changed...|$|E
50|$|While BMW uses <b>run-flat</b> <b>tires</b> for its 7 Series, the B7 {{comes with}} non-reinforced tires with a tire repair kit for emergencies. By using conventional, softer-sidewalled tires, {{compared}} to the reinforced sidewalls of run-flats, Alpina engineers were able to stiffen the B7's suspension for better handling and still improve the ride quality over that of a stock BMW 750i.|$|R
