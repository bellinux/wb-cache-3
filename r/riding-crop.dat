6000|$|... "Back there! Look {{after your}} master, Jenkins!" [...] the major's voice rang out, {{and a man}} dropped {{suddenly}} beneath his <b>riding-crop.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was a {{rush and}} a scuffle, the major's <b>riding-crop</b> was torn from him, and groom and {{gardener}} and keeper were swept away, while Ingleby, laughing harshly, reeled into {{the shadow of}} the trees with his hand on Leger's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|The slight {{figure of}} his lordship in its grey frock was stiff and erect, his booted leg firmly planted, {{his hands behind}} him {{clutching}} his <b>riding-crop</b> and cocked hat. His face was set and his voice as he greeted O'Moy sharp and staccato.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{findings}} of the study, bilateral trade agreement is able to expand the export of the Philippines with its trade partner, Japan. Based on the export data of Philippine export to Japan, there are certain commodities that were initially decreasing prior to the agreement that significantly increased, 7 Â years since the implementation of the agreement such as: meat and edible meat offal (15, 3312.2 %), umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, whips, <b>riding-crops</b> and parts thereof (1878.1 %), explosives; pyrotechnic products, matches, pyrophoric alloys, certain combustible preparations (1091.7 %). It is therefore recommended {{to increase the number of}} bilateral trade agreement of the Philippines with other countries in order to boost export. It is further recommended to pursue assessment of other trade agreements undertaken by the Philippines to support this conclusion.|$|R
6000|$|John Worlington Dodds {{had many}} of the gifts which lead a {{speculator}} to success. He was quick in observing, just in estimating, prompt and fearless in acting. But in finance {{there is always the}} element of luck, which, however one may eliminate it, still remains, like the blank at roulette, a constantly present handicap upon the operator. And so it was that Worlington Dodds had come to grief. On the best advices he had dabbled in the funds of a South American Republic in the days before South American Republics had been found out. The Republic defaulted, and Dodds lost his money. He had bulled the shares of a Scotch railway, and a four months' strike had hit him hard. He had helped to underwrite a coffee company {{in the hope that the}} public would come along upon the feed and gradually nibble away some of his holding, but the political sky had been clouded and the public had refused to invest. Everything which he had touched had gone wrong, and now, on the eve of his marriage, young, clear-headed, and energetic, he was actually a bankrupt had his creditors chosen to make him one. But the Stock Exchange is an indulgent body. [...] What is the case of one to-day may be that of another to-morrow, and everyone is interested in seeing that the stricken man is given time to rise again. So the burden of Worlington Dodds was lightened for him; many shoulders helped to bear it, and he was able to go for a little summer tour into Ireland, for the doctors had ordered him rest and change of air to restore his shaken nervous system. Thus it was that upon the 15th of July, 1870, he found himself at his breakfast in the fly-blown coffee-room of the [...] "George Hotel" [...] in the market square of Dunsloe. It is a dull and depressing coffee-room, and one which is usually empty, but on this particular day it was as crowded and noisy as that of any London hotel. Every table was occupied, and a thick smell of fried bacon and of fish hung in the air. Heavily booted men clattered in and out, spurs jingled, <b>riding-crops</b> were stacked in corners, and there was a general atmosphere of horse. The conversation, too, was of nothing else. From every side Worlington Dodds heard of yearlings, of windgalls, of roarers, of spavins, of cribsuckers, of a hundred other terms which were as unintelligible to him as his own Stock Exchange jargon would have been to the company. He asked the waiter for the reason of it all, and the waiter was an astonished man that there should be any man in this world who did not know it.|$|R
60|$|Our guide's {{answer was}} a {{singular}} one. He snatched off the dark beard which had disguised him {{and threw it}} on the ground, disclosing a long, sallow, clean-shaven face below it. Then he raised his revolver and covered the young ruffian, who was advancing upon him with his dangerous <b>riding-crop</b> swinging in his hand.|$|E
60|$|Lord Wellington {{claimed his}} {{attention}} {{for a full}} hour with the details of several matters that are not immediately concerned with this narrative. Having done, he rose at last from Sir Terence's desk, at {{which he had been}} sitting, and took up his <b>riding-crop</b> and cocked hat from the chair where he had placed them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ring the stable-bell!" [...] he said. [...] "Tell {{them all}} to run with buckets and ladders. Send Higson off to Cornmarket on the mare. Go and tell Mr. Barter, and rouse the village. Don't stand there--God bless me! Ring the stable-bell!" [...] And {{snatching}} up his <b>riding-crop</b> and hat, he ran past the butler, closely followed by the spaniel John.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not need}} to be shown the way in a house where I have drunk many a bottle of good claret," [...] cried a deep voice in reply; and there in the doorway stood the broad figure of Squire Ovington in his buckskins and top-boots, a <b>riding-crop</b> in his hand. Sir Lothian Hume was at his elbow, and I saw the faces of two country constables peeping over his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|She was {{so intent}} upon these {{thoughts}} that she hardly at first {{took note of}} a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the street. Possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane that he saw her so quickly, and directed his horse so close to the cottage-front that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for plants growing under the wall. It was not till he touched the window with his <b>riding-crop</b> that she observed him. The rain had nearly ceased, and she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture.|$|E
6000|$|... "A chair {{here for}} me, if you please, sergeant," [...] he called and, {{when it was}} fetched, took his seat {{at the end of}} the table, with his back to the door through which he had come and {{immediately}} facing the prosecutor. He retained his hat, but placed his <b>riding-crop</b> on the table before him; and the only thing he would accept was an officer's notes of the proceedings as far as they had gone, which that officer himself was prompt to offer. With a repeated injunction to the court to proceed, Lord Wellington became instantly absorbed in the study of these notes.|$|E
60|$|At the exclamation the new-comer {{checked and}} turned. He wore a plain grey undress frock and white stock, {{buckskin}} breeches and lacquered boots, and {{he carried a}} <b>riding-crop</b> tucked under his left arm. His features were bold and sternly handsome; his fine eyes singularly piercing and keen in their glance; and the sweep of those eyes now took in not merely the adjutant, but the spread table and the ladies seated before it. He halted a moment, then advanced quickly, swept his cocked hat from a brown head that was but very slightly touched with grey, and bowed {{with a mixture of}} stiffness and courtliness to the ladies.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Wellington {{took up his}} hat and <b>riding-crop</b> from Sir Terence's desk. [...] "I shall {{leave for}} the {{frontier}} at once," [...] he announced. [...] "Sir Robert will need the encouragement of my presence to keep him within the prudent bounds I have imposed. And I {{do not know how}} long Ciudad Rodrigo may be able to hold out. At any moment we may have the French upon the Agueda, and the invasion may begin. As for you, O'Moy, this has changed everything. The French and the needs of the case have decided. For the present no change is possible in the administration here in Lisbon. You hold the threads of your office and the moment is not one in which to appoint another adjutant to take them over. Such a thing might be fatal {{to the success of the}} British arms. You must withdraw this resignation." [...] And he proffered the document.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{continued}} Ainslie, [...] "there was {{a tenant}} on this estate who was rather more badly off {{than the rest}} of them. He had a piece of upland with rock under it, and in a dry season--though we don't often get one--it was with the greatest trouble he got water enough for his stock. He asked young Weston to find him a likely spot to drive a well. The lad was walking over one parched meadow with the hazel twig in his hand, when his father came upon the procession--everybody belonging to the farm was out with him. Weston, I heard, went purple when he saw what was going on, and, from his point of view, his indignation was perhaps comprehensible. His son was openly, before one of the tenants and a parcel of farm-hands, making use of a superstitious device in which no sane person could believe. Weston, as I remember it, compared him to a gipsy fortune-teller, and went on through the gamut of impostor, mountebank and charlatan, before he commanded him to desist on the moment. I don't quite know what came next, though something was said about a lifted <b>riding-crop,</b> but within the week Clarence started for Canada." ...|$|E
