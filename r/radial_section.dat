The use of the image <b>radial</b> <b>sections</b> allows to determine the maximal number of crests and valleys in the spectrogram. The application of the least square fitting leads to determination of the image centers and radii of the crests and valleys with precision higher than one pixel.

The values of the filter parameters thus obtained are closer to the laboratory measured ones. Comment: 9 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|The size {{effects in}} {{shearing}} strength were investigated {{by means of}} the torsional test in two species of Western hemlock and Red lauan. The torsional tests were carried out by using four kinds of specimens whose size were two times, four times and eight times as long as the smallest specimens respectively. The shearing strength of these specimens was measured. The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) It was observed that there was a high negative correlation between logarithms of the shearing strentgh (log γmax) and logarithms of the volume of the specimens (log V). Preticularly, the regression line in three kinds of specimens, except the smallest one (Type I specimen), was very nearly identical. Accordingly, it was considered that the shearing fracture coincided with the weakest link theory. 2) The constants of the size effect of Western hemlock specimens were 10. 8 (shearing strength in <b>radial</b> <b>section)</b> and 10. 7 (shearing strength in tangential section).

40|$|Aims The {{aim of this}} PhD {{research}} project {{was to investigate the}} application of dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) as a treatment for traumatic and degenerative eye diseases. The accuracy and reliability of counting retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in <b>radial</b> retinal <b>section</b> was also assessed. Methods Numbers of RGC in <b>radial</b> retinal <b>sections</b> were compared to numbers in retinal wholemounts. DPSC were cultured with RGC and survival and neuritogenesis were quantified. DPSC were also transplanted intravitreally into rat models of optic neuropathy (optic nerve crush) and glaucoma and surviving RGC and regenerated axons were quantified in <b>radial</b> retinal <b>sections.</b> Results Quantifying RGC in <b>radial</b> retinal <b>sections</b> was as reliable and accurate as the current gold standard Thus, retinal wholemounts with Brn 3 a proved to be the most reliable marker for RGC. DPSC protected RGC from optic nerve crush-/glaucoma-induced death, promoting significant regeneration of RGC axons in the former and preserving visual function (as measured by electroretinography) in the latter. The mechanism of action, as determined in vitro, appeared to be through the secretion of multiple neurotrophic factors (NTF).

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the reliability of}} different methods of quantifying retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in rat retinal sections and wholemounts from eyes with either intact optic nerves or those axotomised after optic nerve crush (ONC). Adult rats received a unilateral ONC and after 21 days the numbers of Brn 3 a(+), βIII-tubulin(+) and Islet- 1 (+) RGCs were quantified in either retinal <b>radial</b> <b>sections</b> or wholemounts in which FluoroGold (FG) was injected 48 h before harvesting. Phenotypic antibody markers were used to distinguish RGCs from astrocytes, macrophages/microglia and amacrine cells. In wholemounted retinae, counts of FG(+) and Brn 3 a(+) RGCs were of similar magnitude in eyes with intact optic nerves and were similarly reduced after ONC. Larger differences in RGC number were detected between intact and ONC groups when images were taken closer to the optic nerve head. In <b>radial</b> <b>sections,</b> Brn 3 a did not stain astrocytes, macrophages/microglia or amacrine cells, whereas βIII-tubulin and Islet- 1 did localize to amacrine cells as well as RGCs. The numbers of βIII-tubulin(+) RGCs was greater than Brn 3 a+ RGCs, both in retinae from eyes with intact optic nerves and eyes 21 days after ONC. Islet- 1 staining also overestimated the number of RGCs compared to Brn 3 a, but only after ONC. Estimates of RGC loss were similar in Brn 3 a-stained <b>radial</b> retinal <b>sections</b> compared to both Brn 3 a-stained wholemounts and retinal wholemounts in which RGCs were backfilled with FG, with sections having the added advantage of reducing experimental animal usage...|$|R

The potential use of roughness measurement technique for macroscopically detection of tension wood {{was one of the}} main objectives of this research. Before roughness measurement and for accurate sampling, the detection of tension wood was carried out using Herzberg reagent and microscopic studies. The roughness of samples was measured by stylus profilometer at 12 % moisture content and the surface quality was also studied by stereo-microscope. Results showed that there is no significant difference in the radial and tangential roughness between tension and normal wood. No difference was also observed between the roughness of tangential and <b>radial</b> <b>sections</b> of both types of woods. In contrast, stereo-microscopic studies clearly showed the higher roughness of tension wood. Steaming for 30 min increased the roughness but the treatment for 60 min had a decreasing effect on the roughness of both types of woods.

50|$|Light {{microscopy}} {{can be used}} {{to magnify}} the structure of dinosaur eggshell for scientific research. To do so an eggshell fragment must be embedded in epoxy resin and sliced into a thin section with a thin-bladed rock saw. This basic method was invented by French paleontologist Paul Gervais and has remained almost unchanged ever since. Horizontally cut thin sections are called tangential thin sections while vertically cut thin <b>sections</b> are called <b>radial</b> <b>sections.</b> Regardless of direction, the sample must be abraded by fine-grit sand or emery paper until it is translucent. Then the structure of the shell's calcite crystals or pores can be examined under a petrographic microscope. The calcite crystal structure of dinosaur eggshell can be classified by their effect on polarized light. Calcite is capable of acting as a polarizing light filter. When a microscopic thin section sample is rotated relative to polarized light it can eventually block all the light and seem opaque. This phenomenon is called extinction. Different varieties of dinosaur eggs with their different calcite crystal structures have different light extinction properties that {{can be used to}} identify and distinguish even eggs that seem very similar on the surface. To reconstruct the three-dimensional structures of the shell's pore channels scientists require a series of multiple <b>radial</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
