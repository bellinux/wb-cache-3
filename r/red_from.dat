5|$|The Holy Roman Empire (800/962 – 1806, {{known as}} the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation after 1512) {{did not have a}} {{national}} flag, but black and gold were used as colors of the Holy Roman Emperor and featured in the imperial banner: a black eagle on a golden background. After the late 13th or early 14th century, the claws and beak of the eagle were colored <b>red.</b> <b>From</b> the early 15th century, a double-headed eagle was used.|$|E
5|$|The writers {{considered}} introducing {{about six}} personality cores stored in portable spheres, whose main function would be story advancement. They planned cores based on Morgan Freeman's character <b>Red</b> <b>from</b> The Shawshank Redemption and Quint from Jaws, among others. Ultimately {{they decided to}} concentrate on a single core, Wheatley, recycling two of the rejected cores in the final boss fight. Karen Prell led the animation team for Wheatley and the other personality cores.|$|E
5|$|Satisfied {{with his}} skills, the {{publishers}} asked Tolkien {{to design a}} dust jacket. This project, too, {{became the subject of}} many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription {{around the edges of the}} illustration are a phonetic transliteration of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher. The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the <b>red</b> <b>from</b> the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, with Ken Bates now {{owner of}} the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked. The new badge {{featured}} a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications {{such as the use}} of different colours, including <b>red</b> <b>from</b> 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned. With the new ownership of Roman Abramovich, and the club's centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 2005–06 season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words '100 YEARS' and 'CENTENARY 2005–2006' on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.|$|E

25|$|The Grand Library of Baghdad, {{containing}} countless precious historical {{documents and}} books on subjects ranging from medicine to astronomy, was destroyed.

25|$|The {{forces of}} an {{imaginary}} country (Red) {{had crossed the}} frontier dividing <b>Red</b> <b>from</b> Britain (Blue) between Wells-next-the-Sea and Hunstanton.

Time was of the essence for both sides.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Dorset {{expatriate}} Stephen Coombs conceived a Dorset flag using {{white and}} <b>red</b> <b>from</b> {{the arms of}} Dorset County Council, using a simple cross design on a golden background.

25|$|Later {{during the}} Middle Ages, these colours {{came to be}} {{associated}} with the reigning house of France. In 1328, the coat-of-arms of the House of Valois was blue with gold fleurs-de-lis bordered in <b>red.</b> <b>From</b> this time on, the kings of France were represented in vignettes and manuscripts wearing a red gown under a blue coat decorated with gold fleurs-de-lis.|$|E
25|$|Red, gold, green, {{and black}} are {{the colors of}} Pan-Africanism. Several African {{countries}} thus use the color on their flags, including South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Togo, Guinea, Benin, and Zimbabwe. The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the flag of Ethiopia, {{one of the oldest}} independent African countries. Rwanda, notably, removed <b>red</b> <b>from</b> its flag after the Rwandan Genocide because of red's association with blood.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} enols, rhodizonic acid can lose the {{hydrogen}} cations H+ from the hydroxyls (pK1 = 4.378 ± 0.009, pK2 = 4.652 ± 0.014 at 25°C), yielding the hydrogenrhodizonate anion C6HO6 and the rhodizonate anion C6O62. The latter is aromatic and symmetric, as the double bond {{and the negative}} charges are delocalized and evenly distributed over the six CO units. Rhodizonates tend to have various shades of <b>red,</b> <b>from</b> yellowish to purplish.|$|E

25|$|The flag of Guayama {{is made up}} {{of three}} stripes of {{different}} colors: black, yellow, and <b>red</b> <b>from</b> top to bottom. The black stands for the enslaved Africans brought to Puerto Rico, many to Guayama. The yellow represents sugar cane industry in Puerto Rico and the significance of Guayama's sugar plantations. The red symbolizes the blood shed by Taíno Indians in their fight against the Spanish/European colonizers. To the left of the top stripe we can see the Old Mill, which today is known as the Molino de Vives.|$|E
25|$|Catalinas had a {{reputation}} for being confused with the Japanese Kawanishi H6K flying boat. In one instance, a Catalina returning from a bombing mission was mistaken for a H6K by a USN Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter and attacked. The American pilot later stated that the red markings of the standard RAF roundel (which was still used by the RAAF at that time) confused him into believing that the aircraft was Japanese. This incident led the RAAF to remove the <b>red</b> <b>from</b> the British roundel, and in doing so created the modern RAAF roundel.|$|E
25|$|Volkswagen Sedán City.- This was {{a budget}} version {{with all the}} {{equipment}} reduced to its minimum expression, disappearing from the equipment list elements such as: the door armrests, the automatic front seat belts, the rear seat belts, the front disc brakes, and the central bumper black stripe. This version was only available in Verona <b>Red</b> (<b>from</b> 1997 in Tornado Red) and Bright White. Its upholstery was new cloth with vinyl in Grey Frannel. One way to distinguish the Volkswagen Sedán City was that the City had no Sedan black sticker on its bumpers, which was the norm {{in the rest of}} the Volkswagen Beetles.|$|E

25|$|However, {{even among}} primates, full color vision differs between New World and Old World monkeys. Old World primates, {{including}} monkeys and all apes, have vision similar to humans. New World monkeys {{may or may}} not have color sensitivity at this level: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats. Visual sensitivity differences between males and females in a single species is due to the gene for yellow-green sensitive opsin protein (which confers ability to differentiate <b>red</b> <b>from</b> green) residing on the X sex chromosome.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Spring Fest bore {{witness to}} a never before seen concept of unified music from around the Globe. With musical {{performances}} {{from all around the}} world, the Global Music Festival was a huge success. Performances by the post-rock band Paint the Sky <b>Red</b> <b>from</b> Singapore; the indie pop band Pleasantry from Singapore; the Irish folk music duo Fasta Duo; the Israeli rock band Ouzo Bazooka; and the seven piece contemporary folk music band Skipper's Alley from Ireland, all coupled with a sensational star night featuring Dead By April from Sweden, escalated the first Global Music festival to produce a sensational boom. Also, the third international carnival in 2016 continued the ongoing momentum with four exhilarating acts, which included Tommillusions, a magician from Singapore; Shazet, a beatboxer from Malaysia; Logy Logan (Logy On Fire), a street juggler from Ireland; and Murray Molloy from Ireland.|$|E
