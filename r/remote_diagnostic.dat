In our paper we introduce our research results on how to make possible <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> of vehicles through a GSM system.

40|$|<b>Remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> {{technology}} is embedded into physical products {{in order to}} prevent breakdowns by monitoring the products’ condition via sensors. However, this technology also hides indirect possibilities to monitor the users. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore how <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> technology changes surveillance and its ethical consequences by studying which surveillance dilemmas users and suppliers identify in <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> technology and the rationale behind their perspectives. The results show how visibility and non-visibility are of decisive importance concerning whether or not users can examine ethical dilemmas in computer use as visibility seems to be what triggers employees’ feelings of being monitored or not. Despite their monitoring possibilities, <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> systems do not seem to evoke such feelings. By embedding technology and thereby also the monitoring into physical things, both the technology and the cues of surveillance become concealed, both literally and virtually for the user. To the user the direct reminders of surveillance are thus embedded together with the technology, creating an embedded panopticon. As the users cannot examine possible ethical dilemmas the responsibility remains with the suppliers and challenges them to pick a strategy for how to handle ethical questions...|$|R

In one single instance quoted in 2006: [...] "A nurse-led clinic at Letham has received positive feedback on a trial of a video-link which allowed 60 pensioners to be assessed by medics without travelling to a doctor's office or medical clinic." [...] A further improvement in telemedical services has been the development of new technology incorporated into special videophones to permit <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostic</b> services, such as blood sugar level, blood pressure and vital signs monitoring. Such units are capable of relaying both regular audiovideo plus medical data over either standard (POTS) telephone or newer broadband lines.Videotelephony has also been deployed in corporate teleconferencing, also available through the use of public access videoconferencing rooms. A higher level of videoconferencing that employs advanced telecommunication technologies and high-resolution displays is called telepresence.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTimely {{diagnosis}} and early interventions {{are critical to}} improving the long term functioning {{of a child with}} ASD. However, a major challenge facing parents is difficulty in obtaining on-time access to appropriate diagnostic services. To address this need, an imaging technology, NODA® (Naturalistic Observation Diagnostic Assessment), has been successfully developed and field-tested. NODA® includes 1) NODA SmartCapture; a smart-phone based recording system for parents to capture and share in-home video evidence of their child behavior and 2) NODA Connect; a HIPPA compliant web-platform for diagnosticians to conduct remote autism diagnostic assessments based on in-home video evidence of behavior, developmental history and their clinical judgment. In the field study, parents captured and shared videos evidence from their homes via NODA SmartCapture and diagnosticians conducted <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostic</b> assessment via NODA Connect. Results show that parents were able to successfully collect video evidence of behavior as per given prescription and diagnosticians were able to complete <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostic</b> assessments.

40|$|An {{upcoming}} {{trend for}} automotive manufacturers is to perform <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> and firmware updates over the air, which allows identifying hardware problems and correction of software flaws with minimal customer inconvenience. These procedures {{require that the}} previously isolated in-vehicle network permits external communication, which introduces a number of security risks, e. g., cyber attack threats. In this paper, we identify cyber attack threats and classify the electronic control units (ECUs) in the in-vehicle network to assist in determining which ones to protect and restrict access to. We divide the ECUs into five categories: powertrain, vehicle safety, comfort, infotainment, and telematics. We then use four safety integrity levels to classify the ECU categories. Moreover, we define safety effect levels of security threats which are used to classify identified attacks in the <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> and firmware updates over the air procedures. The safety and security levels are combined to classify the ECU categories. From the results we conclude that ECU categories such as powertrain and vehicle safety require further protection prior to introducing remote connectivity. As a conclusion, we suggest that automotive manufacturers should emphasize security or restrict the <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> and firmware updates over the air procedures to certain ECUs...|$|R
40|$|Troubleshooting unresponsive sensor nodes is a {{significant}} challenge in remote sensor network deployments. This paper introduces the tele-diagnostic powertracer, an in-situ troubleshooting tool that uses external power measurements to determine the internal health condition of an unresponsive host and the most likely cause of its failure. We developed our own low-cost power meter with low-bandwidth radio to report power measurements and findings, hence allowing remote (i. e., tele-) diagnosis. The tool was deployed and tested in a remote solar-powered sensing network for acoustic and visual environmental monitoring. It was shown to successfully distinguish between several categories of failures that cause unresponsive behavior including energy depletion, antenna damage, radio disconnection, system crashes, and anomalous reboots. It was also able to determine the internal health conditions of an unresponsive node, such as {{the presence or absence}} of sensing and data storage activities (for each of multiple sensors). The paper explores the feasibility of building such a <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostic</b> tool from the standpoint of economy, scale and diagnostic accuracy. To the authors ’ knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostic</b> tool that uses power measurements to diagnose sensor system failures...|$|E

40|$|To {{learn and}} adapt, {{organizations}} engage widely in Information Technology (IT) -mediated boundary-spanning. This involves {{making sense of}} a swath of peripheral information made available by digital means so as to expand local knowledge. Prior research on boundary-spanning has paid scant attention to material differences between IT systems in enabling or constraining such activity. In this article, we argue that material features do matter: features afforded by IT systems {{have a significant impact}} on the form and content of boundary-spanning. We analyze material features and related affordances provided by <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> systems – a family of ubiquitous IT systems. These features allow <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> systems to collect, store, and continuously analyze data about the state of machinery and related production processes across space, time and organizational boundaries. Organizations use these systems to determine when maintenance intervention is needed, or to improve their production processes. Often, these systems are run by external service providers at remote sites, which become the new ears and the eyes of a focal organization’s production processes. Building on a longitudinal multi-site case study of two organizations, we explore the impacts of <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> systems on boundary-spanning. We observe that material features afforded by the <b>remote</b> <b>diagnostics</b> led the organizations to change their boundary-spanning in contradictory ways. On one hand, they reinforced existing boundaries. On the other hand, they crossed or cut down others, or created new ones. This suggests that the material features of these systems, when combined with new knowledge creation and sharing practices, within and between the local and the remote sites generate richer, multifaceted inter-organizational knowledge flows. We surmise that IT’s new material features will continue to significantly shape organizing logics that determine where and when organizational boundaries are drawn and crossed. Future boundary-spanning will increasingly be shaped by socio-technical assemblages brought together by increasingly pervasive IT capabilities...|$|R
