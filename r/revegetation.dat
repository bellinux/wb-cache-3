5|$|A {{hardy and}} {{versatile}} garden plant, B.integrifolia is widely planted in Australian gardens. It {{is a popular}} choice for parks and streetscapes, and {{has been used for}} bush <b>revegetation</b> and stabilisation of dunes. Its hardiness has prompted research into its suitability for use as a rootstock in the cut flower trade, but has also caused concerns about its potential to become a weed outside its natural habitat.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1976, Bob Lewis, an {{environmental}} activist in Aspen, organized <b>revegetation</b> efforts on some {{sections of the}} pass near the road that were having serious erosion problems. He realized eventually that a dedicated nonprofit organization {{would be a better}} way to address the many issues that remained. The Independence Pass Foundation (IPF) was established in 1989. Its first project, coordinated with the Forest Service, CDOT and Pitkin County, was the reconstruction of a curve near the popular Weller Lake trailhead.|$|E
5|$|Main Roads' 2006 {{plan for}} {{environmental}} {{management of the}} project included numerous aspects, described as best management practices, which for the northern segment of the project were beyond the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, vegetation, dieback and weeds, and <b>revegetation</b> and rehabilitation. Other areas with specific plans included topsoil management, drainage, construction (covering dust, noise, and vibrations), foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that wild Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China {{exhibited}} very high concentrations of copper within the plants, more so than the 48 species tested. Commelina communis had sequestered some 361mg/kg of copper, while the plant with the next highest concentration, Polygonum macrathum, had 286mg/kg. Five of the species examined, including the Asiatic dayflower, also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc, lead, and cadmium. The results suggest that the Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil <b>revegetation</b> and phytoremediation.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of these {{projects}}, IPF has been doing <b>revegetation</b> projects along the road below the Top Cut since 2004. Compost blankets were applied to large sections of the soil to replace lost nutrients. In 2009 the foundation began removing metal and rebar snow fences embedded in the soil just below the pass summit during the 1960s as part of an abortive project to increase meltwater capture by the Twin Lakes Tunnel. They were an aesthetic blight as well as an environmental problem, and had to be removed using a team of mules and helicopters due to the wilderness area restrictions. The last fence material was removed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the impacts}} of Wipha to the already {{severely}} flooded areas of North Korea, the International Red Cross delivered relief supplies to the 2,000 people made homeless by the typhoon. Hundreds of medical clinics which were damaged or destroyed set up makeshift clinics as up to 70 percent of the affected population reported abdominal pains or diarrhea. More than 23,000 volunteers from the Red Cross mobilized to provide quick rehabilitation in the affected regions. By mid-September, €420,000 ($527,000 USD) was provided to repair hospitals and an additional €110,000 ($138,000USD) was planned to be sent. By the end of September, health kits were provided for 300,000 people and an additional $300,000 (USD) was provided for medical supplies in hospitals. From October15 to 18, a Rapid Nutritional Screening of children {{took place in the}} worst affected areas. Eleven hospitals were restocked with medical supplies and a permanent water supply was constructed at the Wonsan general hospital. About $180,000 in aid from Norway was sent to North Korea. By October 22, 2007, 80 percent of the $14.1million pledged in assistance had been funded. About 4,800 tonnes of cereal was to be distributed in October as part of the second shipment of food, following the first which was sent prior to Wipha. Funds and materials, worth $166,000 (USD), for <b>revegetation</b> were expected to arrive between December 2007 and February 2008.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{alternatives}} {{used to control}} weeds such as biological and/or manual control, herbicides, controlling ecosystem degradation processes that favour weeds, and fire management. The weed control strategies are commonly associated to <b>revegetation</b> efforts.|$|E
25|$|Intensive <b>revegetation</b> and {{weed control}} work {{continues}} {{on the peninsula}} {{with the aim of}} restoring it nearer to the pre-European settlement environment, in 2015 over 2,500 plants were planted with works focused on Allocasuarina shrubs to assist in slowing the spread of Melaleuca.|$|E
25|$|Projects at Kirby Canyon {{were behind}} the {{original}} schedule in the late 1990s. <b>Revegetation</b> efforts were slowed in large part due to lower than expected rates landfill filling. Waste Management fulfilled the ten-year duration of the agreement and offered after to fund 50 percent of the agreement for three additional years.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 the Summerland Peninsula {{buy-back}} {{was completed}} and in 2011 a subsequent Summerland Restoration Project initiated with a $3.4 million {{grant from the}} State Government of Victoria. The program included under-grounding power, demolition and removal of the last remaining houses and redundant infrastructure, <b>revegetation</b> {{and the provision of}} artificial nests and pest and predator control.|$|E
25|$|Historical ecology {{can also}} {{aid in the}} goals of other fields of study. Conservation biology recognizes {{different}} types of land management processes, each attempting to maintain the landscape and biota in their present form. Restoration ecology restores sites to former function, structure, and components of biological diversity through active modification of the landscapes. Reclamation deals with shifting a degraded ecosystem back toward a higher value or use, but not necessarily to its original state. Replacement of an ecosystem would create an entirely new one. <b>Revegetation</b> involves new additions of biota into a landscape, {{not limited to the}} original inhabitants of an area. Each method can be enriched by the application of historical ecology and the past knowledge it supplies. The interdisciplinary nature of historical ecology would permit conservation biologists to create more effective and efficient landscape improvements. Reclamation and <b>revegetation</b> can use a historical perspective to determine what biota will be able to sustain large populations without threatening native biota of the landscape.|$|E
25|$|A {{hardy and}} {{versatile}} Australian native plant, B.integrifolia is widely planted in domestic gardens. Within its natural distribution it {{is a popular}} choice in parks, streetscapes, bush <b>revegetation</b> and stabilisation of dunes.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, <b>revegetation</b> of penguin habitat and {{installation}} of artificial nesting boxes had been initiated, {{as well as}} improved control of tourists and vehicles. While some fox control was in place, improved strategies were imperative to reduce the mortality of predator-killed penguins of which 56% of deaths were attributed to foxes between 1986 and 1989. Control of visitors to the Penguin Parade was improved with the installation of boardwalks and stands to prevent trampling through the colony and allowing only 10% of the penguin population to be viewed by the public for 1–2 hours after dusk.|$|E
25|$|The Esopus was one {{of three}} valleys that trees {{followed}} into the Catskills, as <b>revegetation</b> of the mountain slopes took place in the glaciers' wake. First to come were the boreal species, such as balsam fir, that today persist only on the summits of the range's higher peaks. Next were the northern hardwoods, primarily beech, birch and maple species, that dominate much of the Catskill forests today. Last were southern hardwood species, mostly oak, hickory and American chestnut, probably following the Indians as they migrated north. Most of the chestnuts died in the chestnut blight of the early 20th century. Catskill forest historian Michael Kudish found that other southern hardwood species {{can be found in the}} Esopus valley all the way to Oliverea, a mile or so below the creek's source.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Acaba {{received}} his Bachelor's degree in Geology from the University of California, Santa Barbara and in 1992, {{he earned his}} Master's degree in Geology from the University of Arizona. Acaba was a Sergeant in the United States Marine Corps Reserves where he served for six years. He also worked as a hydrogeologist in Los Angeles, California. Acaba {{spent two years in}} the United States Peace Corps and trained over 300 teachers in the Dominican Republic in modern teaching methodologies. He then served as Island Manager of the Caribbean Marine Research at Lee Stocking Island in the Exumas, Bahamas. Upon his return to the United States, Acaba moved to Florida where he became Shoreline <b>Revegetation</b> Coordinator in Vero Beach. He taught one year of science and math in high school and four years at Dunnellon Middle School. He also briefly taught at Melbourne High School in Melbourne, Florida. Upon his return to Earth in Fall 2012, Acaba began coursework for a Ph.D. in education from Texas Tech University through a distance learning program.|$|E
500|$|A highly {{regarded}} garden plant, the common heath was first cultivated in England in 1825; over seventy named cultivars have been developed, {{most of which}} have now vanished. A pink-flowered form, {{often referred to as}} [...] "pink heath", is the floral emblem of the state of Victoria. Epacris impressa has proven a difficult plant to propagate reliably, which has limited its use in horticulture and <b>revegetation.</b> It grows best in well-drained but moist soil in a semishaded position.|$|E
500|$|Channelized blast zone, an {{intermediate}} zone, extended out to distances {{as far as}} [...] from the volcano, {{an area in which}} the flow flattened everything in its path and was channeled to some extent by topography. In this zone, the force and direction of the blast are strikingly demonstrated by the parallel alignment of toppled large trees, broken off {{at the base of the}} trunk as if they were blades of grass mown by a scythe. This zone was also known as the [...] "tree-down zone". Channeling and deflection of the blast caused strikingly varied local effects that still remained conspicuous after some decades. Where the blast struck open land directly, it scoured it, breaking trees off short and stripping vegetation and even topsoil, thereby delaying <b>revegetation</b> for many years. Where the blast was deflected so as to pass overhead by several metres, it left the topsoil and the seeds it contained, permitting faster <b>revegetation</b> with scrub and herbaceous plants, and later with saplings. Trees in the path of such higher-level blasts were broken off wholesale at various heights, whereas nearby stands in more sheltered positions recovered comparatively rapidly without conspicuous long-term harm.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the Weller Curve project {{cleared the way for}} work on the Top Cut, the [...] stretch just below the summit on the western side, which {{includes}} the most seriously eroded slopes anywhere in the pass corridor. Lewis had always intended to focus the IPF's efforts on it, and the organization began the first of several ongoing projects there in 1996. Work included the construction of stone retaining walls as well as <b>revegetation.</b> By the 2010s the results were evident.|$|E
500|$|In 2002 the city, the MCDD, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began {{a project}} to improve habitat by {{creating}} [...] of stream meanders and wetland terraces along the slough. Through its Watershed <b>Revegetation</b> Program, begun in 1996, the city worked with property owners to plant native vegetation and to remove invasive weeds. Through 2005, participants had replanted more than [...] along nearly [...] of riparian corridors in the slough watershed. Other strategies pursued by the city, Metro, and other interest groups include connecting separated habitats with a continuous riparian corridor, removing wildlife corridor barriers, restoring hydrological connections to the slough, and restoring the floodplain where feasible.|$|E
500|$|Management of {{the park}} is {{influenced}} by the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources's long term biodiversity goals for the hill face zone and is also being managed in the broader context of a planning initiative known as Yurrebilla – The Greater Mount Lofty Parklands. The Department manages the park in association with local council and a volunteer group—The Friends of Anstey Hill. This volunteer group makes significant contributions to <b>revegetation,</b> weed control, ruin stabilisation and creation of walking trails. There are no visitor facilities or amenities except for walking trails, most of which follow fire access tracks; a single constructed pedestrian trail leads to Klopper’s Quarry. The park is mostly designated as a [...] "conservation zone" [...] where only passive recreation, including walking dogs on leads, is permitted. Horses and motor vehicles are not allowed and only the main tracks are maintained.|$|E

2500|$|The Society for Ecological Restoration defines [...] "ecological restoration" [...] as an [...] "intentional {{activity}} that initiates or accelerates {{the recovery of}} an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability". The practice of ecological restoration includes a wide scope of projects such as erosion control, reforestation, usage of genetically local native species, removal of non-native species and weeds, <b>revegetation</b> of disturbed areas, daylighting streams, reintroduction of native species, as well as habitat and range improvement for targeted species.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the lower, western {{parts of}} the park were cleared for pasture and {{cropping}} until the early 1970s. While there is remnant vegetation on higher ground, introduced pasture grasses and associated weeds dominate much of the understorey. [...] Perennial native grasses, such as kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra), {{have been used as}} part of the park's <b>revegetation.</b> Many of the introduced grasses dry in summer and pose a greater fire hazard than the regrowth. To combat this hazard, and protect surrounding residential areas, annual burns are held particularly around the park's margins. These burns also serve to encourage native vegetation to dominate over introduced weeds.|$|E
2500|$|The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Article 4(1)(a) {{requires}} all Parties to [...] "develop, periodically update, publish {{and make}} {{available to the}} Conference of the Parties" [...] as well as [...] "national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources" [...] "removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol." [...] Under the UNFCCC reporting guidelines, human-induced greenhouse emissions must be reported in six sectors: energy (including stationary energy and transport); industrial processes; solvent and other product use; agriculture; waste; and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). The rules governing accounting and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from LULUCF under the Kyoto Protocol are contained in several decisions of the Conference of Parties under the UNFCCC and LULUCF {{has been the subject}} of two major reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Kyoto Protocol article 3.3 thus requires mandatory LULUCF accounting for afforestation (no forest for last 50 years), reforestation (no forest on 31 December 1989) and deforestation, as well as (in the first commitment period) under article 3.4 voluntary accounting for cropland management, grazing land management, <b>revegetation</b> and forest management (if not already accounted under article 3.3).|$|E

50|$|<b>Revegetation</b> {{is often}} used to join up patches of natural habitat that have been lost, and can be a very {{important}} tool in places where much of the natural vegetation has been cleared. It is therefore particularly important in urban environments, and research in Brisbane has shown that <b>revegetation</b> projects can significantly improve urban bird populations The Brisbane study showed that connecting a <b>revegetation</b> patch with existing habitat improved bird species richness, while simply concentrating on making large patches of habitat {{was the best way to}} increase bird abundance. <b>Revegetation</b> plans therefore need to consider how the revegetated sites are connected with existing habitat patches. <b>Revegetation</b> in agricultural areas can support breeding bird populations, but often it supports more common species, rather than those that are in decline.|$|E
