50|$|A {{change to}} any of this {{information}} might <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different premium being charged if the change <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different actuarial class or risk level for that variable. For instance, <b>a</b> change <b>in</b> the drivers' age from 38 to 39 may not <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different actuarial class because 38- and 39-year-old people {{may be in the}} same actuarial class. However, <b>a</b> change <b>in</b> driver age from 38 to 45 may <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different premium because the records of the insurer indicate <b>a</b> difference <b>in</b> risk associated with those ages and, therefore, the age difference <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> change <b>in</b> actuarial class or assigned risk level.|$|R
50|$|A {{leadership}} election may <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new leader, or may {{confirm the}} status quo.

50|$|An {{increase}} in the temperature of <b>a</b> semiconducting material <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> charge-carrier concentration. This <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> higher number of charge carriers available for recombination, increasing the conductivity of the semiconductor. The increasing conductivity causes the resistivity of the semiconductor material to decrease with the rise <b>in</b> temperature, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> negative temperature coefficient of resistance.|$|R
5|$|A freedom-of-information request in 2015 {{revealed}} that the university received 31,857 undergraduate applications and made 13,302 offers in 2014–15.

The School of Medicine received 1,764 applications, only 39 offers were made <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> offer rate of just 2.2%.

Although his weight was a comedic topic throughout his sitcom and improv shows, in 2010 he began a diet and exercise plan, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> extensive weight loss (similar to former TPIR announcer Rod Roddy). He also claimed that he cured his Type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the seventh and eighth {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> imbalance in {{the capabilities of the}} Australian Defence Force. The option was cancelled outright by late 2001.|$|E

5|$|Covalent bonding {{takes place}} {{when one of}} the {{constituent}} atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> electron cloud that is shared by the molecule as a whole. In both ionic and covalent bonding the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically brittle.|$|E

5000|$|The highest {{proportion}} of pale malts <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lighter color. The term [...] "pale ale" [...] first appeared around 1703 for beers made from malts dried with coke, which <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lighter color than other beers popular at that time.

5|$|Current {{practice}} {{involves a}} celebrity turning {{the lights on}} in mid- to late-November, and they remain lit until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The festivities were postponed in 1963 due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy and in 1989 to fit Kylie Minogue's touring commitments. In 2015, the lights were switched on earlier, on Sunday 1 November, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unusual closure of the street to all traffic.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} {{acceptance of the}} 3R's, many countries—including Canada, Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and Germany—have reported rising experimental use of animals in recent years with increased use of mice and, in some cases, fish while reporting declines {{in the use of}} cats, dogs, primates, rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters. Along with other countries, China has also escalated its use of GM animals, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase in overall animal use.|$|E
5|$|Few zoos hold termites, {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} in keeping them captive and to the reluctance of authorities to permit potential pests. One of the few that do, the Zoo Basel in Switzerland, has two thriving Macrotermes bellicosus populations– <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> event very rare in captivity: the mass migrations of young flying termites. This happened in September 2008, when thousands of male termites left their mound each night, died, and covered the floors and water pits of the house holding their exhibit.|$|E
50|$|A ball {{played by}} a team over the {{opposing}} bye line <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> goal hit {{from the edge of}} the D, while a ball {{played by a}} team over their own line <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner. A ball hit over the sideline <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shy: a shinty shy involves the taker tossing the ball above his head and hitting the ball with the shaft of the caman, and the ball must be directly overhead when struck.|$|R
