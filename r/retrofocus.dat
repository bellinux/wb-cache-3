40|$|In {{the present}} paper an {{iterative}} time-reversal algorithm that <b>retrofocuses</b> an acoustic wave field to its controllable part is established. For a fixed temporal support, i. e., transducer excitation time, the algorithm generates an optimal <b>retrofocusing</b> in the least-squares sense. Thus the iterative time-reversal algorithm reduces the temporal support of the excitation from the requirement of negligible remaining energy to the requirement of controllability. The time-reversal <b>retrofocusing</b> is analyzed from a boundary-control perspective where time reversal is used to steer the acoustic wave field towards a desired state. The wave field is controlled by transducers located at subsets of the boundary, i. e., the controllable part of the boundary. The time-reversal cavity and time-reversal mirror cases are analyzed. In the cavity case, the transducers generate a locally plane wave in the fundamental mode {{through a set of}} ducts. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the convergence of the iterative time-reversal algorithm. In the mirror case, a homogeneous half space is considered. For this case the analytic expression for the <b>retrofocused</b> wave field is given for finite temporal support. It is shown that the mirror case does not have the same degree of steering as the cavity case. It is also shown that the pressure can be perfectly <b>retrofocused</b> for infinite temporal support. Two examples are given that indicate that the influence of the evanescent part of the wave field is small...|$|R

40|$|National audienceRecent {{results have}} shown that Nonlinear Elastic Wave Spectroscopy (NEWS) and Time Reversal (TR) {{techniques}} can be combined to precisely localize defects, produced by their nonlinear response. NEWS techniques can be used either as a post-treatment of TR used {{as a tool for}} ultrasound focusing in order to generate strong localized stress, or as a pre-treatment, of TR used as a tool for defect (nonlinear source) identification. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a single PZT ceramic glued on a chaotic cavity, a so called chaotic cavity transducer, {{can be used as a}} TR mirror or a multi-elements system on non reverberating samples. In this study, numerical and experimental results, performed in order to optimize the chaotic cavity shape and material, and the time reversal process will be presented. The numerical results have been obtained with a nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method developed for the simulation of linear and nonlinear elastic wave propagation. The experimental set-up used is based on the combination of a chaotic cavity glued on the sample for the elastic wave emission (and focalization), and a laser vibrometer in order to image the nonlinear response at the surface of the sample. The obtained results enable us to find that chirp-coded excitation, instead of single-carrier short pulses, combined with inverse filter and 1 -bit processes have to be used in order to transmit more energy per time on the defect, and so increase its nonlinear response, without increasing the peak intensity of the excitation. Moreover, the benefit of using emitters having a more or less chaotic shape is clearly found in breaking the symmetry of the problem, leading to an unambiguous <b>retrofocusing.</b> The technique is applied to image a crack in a steel sample...|$|R

5000|$|... 1950: Angénieux 35mm f/2.5 <b>Retrofocus</b> Type R 1 (France): first <b>retrofocus</b> {{wide angle}} lens for 35 mm SLRs (for Exaktas). Regular {{wide angle lens}}es (meaning short focal length lenses) need to be mounted close to the film. However, SLRs require that lenses be mounted far enough {{in front of the}} film to provide space for the {{movement}} of the mirror — the [...] "mirror box." [...] Therefore, the focal length of early 35 mm SLR lenses were no less than about 40 mm. This prompted the development of wide view lenses with more complex <b>retrofocus</b> optical designs. These use very large negative front elements to force back-focus distances long enough to ensure clearance. Note, [...] "retrofocus" [...] was an Angénieux trademark before losing exclusive status. The original generic term is [...] "inverted telephoto." [...] A telephoto lens (multiple inventions, 1891) has a front positive group and rear negative group; <b>retrofocus</b> lenses have the negative group in front and positive group to the rear. The first inverted-telephoto imaging lens was the Taylor-Hobson 35mm f/2 (1931, UK) developed to provide back-focus clearance for the beamsplitter prism used by the full-color via three negative Technicolor motion picture process. <b>Retrofocus</b> wide angle prime lenses reached fields of view as wide as 118° with the Nikkor 13mm f/5.6 (Japan) lens for Nikon 35 mm SLRs in 1975, but they are extremely large compared to non-SLR short focal length lenses because of their gigantic negative elements.|$|E

50|$|Inverting the {{telephoto}} configuration, employing one or {{more negative}} lens groups {{in front of a}} positive lens group, creates a wide-angle lens with an increased back focal distance. These are called <b>retrofocus</b> lenses or inverted telephotos, which have greater clearance from the rear element to the film plane than their focal length would permit with a conventional wide-angle lens optical design. This allows for greater clearance for other optical or mechanical parts such as the mirror parts in a single-lens reflex camera. Zoom lenses that are telephotos at one extreme of the zoom range and <b>retrofocus</b> at the other are now common.|$|E
5000|$|Pierre Angénieux (...) (14 July 1907 in Saint-Héand - 26 June 1998) was a French {{engineer}} and optician, {{one of the}} inventors of the modern zoom lenses, and famous for introducing the Angénieux <b>retrofocus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Note, it is {{impossible}} to have 180° rectilinear coverage because of light falloff. 120° (12mm focal length for the 35mm film format) is about the practical limit for <b>retrofocus</b> designs; 90° (21mm focal length) for non-retrofocus lenses.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for the rear element of a <b>retrofocus</b> lens of 18 mm to be more than 25 mm from the film plane. This makes it possible to design wide-angle lenses for single-lens reflex cameras.|$|E
50|$|Many normal {{perspective}} lenses for today's digital SLRs are <b>retrofocus,</b> {{because their}} smaller-than-35mm-film-frame image sensors require much shorter focal lengths to maintain equivalent fields of view, but the {{continued use of}} 35mm SLR lens mounts require long back-focus distances.|$|E
50|$|<b>Retrofocus</b> lenses are {{extremely}} asymmetric with their large front elements and therefore {{very difficult to}} correct for distortion by traditional means. On the upside, the large negative element also limits the oblique cos4θ light falloff of regular wide-angle lenses.|$|E
50|$|Made in focal {{lengths of}} 24 mm, 28 mm, and 35 mm, the Angénieux <b>retrofocus</b> lens {{inspired}} other lens makers to produce wide-angle lenses {{of this type}} for almost every 35mm SLR, and helped {{to make it the}} definitive camera type of the late 20th century.|$|E
50|$|This makes short-focus {{wide-angle}} lenses undesirable for single-lens reflex cameras {{unless they}} are used with the reflex mirrors locked up. On large format view cameras and rangefinder cameras, short-focus lenses are widely used because they give less distortion than the <b>retrofocus</b> design {{and there is no}} need for a long back focal distance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Retrofocus</b> design also {{influenced}} non-retrofocus lenses. For example, Ludwig Bertele's Zeiss Biogon 21mm f/4.5, released in 1954 for the Contax IIA (1950, West Germany) 35mm RF, and its evolution, the Zeiss Hologon 15mm f/8 of 1969, {{fixed to the}} Zeiss Ikon Hologon Ultrawide (West Germany), were roughly symmetrical designs. However, each half can visualized as <b>retrofocus.</b> The Biogon and Hologon designs {{take advantage of the}} large negative elements to limit the light falloff of regular wide angle lenses. With a 110° field of view, the Hologon would otherwise have had a 3¼ stop corner light falloff, which is wider than the exposure latitude of contemporaneous films. Nonetheless, the Hologon had a standard accessory radially graduated 2 stop neutral density filter to ensure completely even exposure. The distance from the Hologon's rear element to the film was only 4.5 mm.|$|E
50|$|A fisheye lens is {{a special}} type of ultra-wide angle <b>retrofocus</b> lens {{with little or no}} attempt to correct for {{rectilinear}} distortion. Most fisheyes produce a circular image with a 180° field of view. The term fisheye comes from the supposition that a fish looking up at the sky would see in the same way.|$|E
50|$|The next {{landmark}} zoom was the Sigma 21-35mm f/3.5-4 (Japan) of 1981. It was {{the first}} super-wide angle zoom lens for still cameras (most 35mm SLRs). Previously, combining the complexities of rectilinear super-wide angle lenses, <b>retrofocus</b> lenses and zoom lenses seemed impossible. The Sigma's all-moving eleven element/seven group/three cell formula was a triumph of computer-aided design and multicoating.|$|E
50|$|The {{name comes}} from Pierre Angénieux, {{inventor}} of a <b>retrofocus</b> zoom mechanism {{and founder of the}} French manufacturer of zoom lenses. It does not award a film from Cannes' Official selection for its cinematography. It is intended to pay tribute to a prominent Director of Cinematography whose career is praised by all the industry for its aesthetic work.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{varieties}} of wide-angle lens: short-focus lenses and <b>retrofocus</b> lenses.Short-focus lenses are generally {{made up of}} multiple glass elements whose shapes {{are more or less}} symmetrical in front of and behind the diaphragm. As the focal length decreases, the distance of the rear element of the lens from the film plane or digital sensor also decreases.|$|E
5000|$|Except for {{close-up}} and macro photography, {{the effect}} of lens asymmetry is minimal. At unity magnification, however, the errors from neglecting the pupil magnification can be significant. Consider a telephoto lens with [...] and a <b>retrofocus</b> wide-angle lens with , at [...] The asymmetrical-lens formula gives [...] and , respectively. The symmetrical lens formula gives [...] in either case. The errors are −33% and 33%, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Especially {{outside of}} the [...] "normal lenses", lens speed also tends to {{correlate}} with the price and/or quality of the lens. This is because lenses with larger maximum apertures require greater care with regard to design, precision of manufacture, special coatings and quality of glass. At wide apertures, spherical aberration becomes more significant and must be corrected. Faster telephoto and wide-angle <b>retrofocus</b> designs tend {{to be much more}} expensive.|$|E
5000|$|There is no precise {{definition}} of bokeh and no objective tests for it - {{as with all}} aesthetic judgments. However, symmetrical optical formulae such as the Rapid-Rectilinear/Aplanat and the Double Gauss are usually considered pleasing, while asymmetric <b>retrofocus</b> wide angle and telephoto lenses are often thought harsh. The unique [...] "donut" [...] bokeh produced by mirror lenses because of the optical pathway obstruction of the secondary mirror is especially polarizing.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on the format, {{the design}} of the lens and its {{performance}} will differ considerably. For example, for the 4/3 format, a 12 mm lens is a wide-angle lens and will have a <b>retrofocus</b> design. For the 2/3-inch format, a 12 mm lens is [...] "normal" [...] and can have a simple and fast double Gauss layout. For the 1/3-inch format, a 12 mm lens is long and can have a telephoto design.|$|E
5000|$|The problem {{arises when}} such lenses have too short a focal length {{to fit in}} front of the {{retractable}} mirrors used in reflex cameras. In such a situation, a pancake lens focuses in front of, rather than on, the focal plane (film or light sensor) of the camera. This has necessitated the design of <b>retrofocus</b> lenses that refocus the image further back, which is why such lenses are longer and bulkier than their [...] "pancake" [...] equivalents.|$|E
