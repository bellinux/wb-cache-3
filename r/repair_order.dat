The walk-up building, which was 55 years old, was the last block in a group of ten identical buildings. Each floor housed four apartments of around 150 square feet (14 square metres), which in some cases were further partitioned by their owners. Residents in the adjoining blocks were subsequently relocated to temporary shelters in the immediate aftermath and then on to interim housing at public estates. This type of building is typical of many over the territory.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} many other {{buildings}} of this era, such as Thomson's Caledonian Road Church and the St Vincent Street Church, it fell into disrepair {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. The upper floors were left vacant in the early 1980s and by the early 1990s the building was in such poor condition that the council issued a <b>repair</b> <b>order</b> to a Hong Kong restaurateur who owned part of the upper floors. This did not stop the decay and in 1995 further repairs were undertaken following an 'Urgent Repairs Notice'. In 1996 Glasgow City Council announced a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on the building. In subsequent years a number of schemes were proposed to restore the building, but legal wrangles with the building's owners, who were contesting the CPO, led to further delays. In July 2000, Dundee businessman Derek Souter and his company Union Street Developments (USD) acquired a stake in the property and announced plans to restore it, but funding problems led to further delays.|$|E

40|$|Comprehensive {{realization}} of post-earthquake restoration process for highway network considering repair prioritization {{are necessary for}} preparing effective countermeasures to restore transportation service and social activity in seismically active and automobile dependent regions like broader Los Angeles area quickly. Since the progress and the time to achieve full-recovery realistically change depending on <b>repair</b> <b>orders</b> and reconstruction works, restoration strategies without taking into account actual restoration phenomena negatively affect decision-making, efficient recovery, damage mitigation effort and network resilience enhancement. For dealing with these concerns, a probabilistic model to simulate post-earthquake restoration process of highway network is developed with consideration of repair prioritization and reconstruction constraint in this research. Analytic Hierarchy Process, prioritizing algorithm, is used to decide bridge <b>repair</b> <b>orders</b> based on initial damage state due to earthquake and priority weight of four criteria; difficulty, importance, urgency and cost. Numbers of available construction labor around the target region is applied for constraint of repair work progress. The recovery passage of bridge, the critical component of highway restoration process, is modeled probabilistically based on Markov Chain process, Uniform distribution and Normal distribution. As performance of highway network, drivers' delay and trip opportunity loss over entire recovery period are estimated by conducting traffic network analysis through origin-destination matrix, gravity model and user equilibrium model considering the models of trip reduction and traffic demand recovery. The adequacy of developed model is then verified by the documented recovery records and loss estimations of Northridge earthquake. As an application study, a regional possible scenario earthquake {{is applied to the}} established methodology implemented in the highway network system of Los Angeles and Orange counties. A number of simulations through Monte Carlo technique to express restoration processes corresponding to several repair prioritizations are presented by restoration curves and loss estimations. The analyzed results show that the developed procedure can simulate numerous thinkable recovery scenarios according to <b>repair</b> <b>orders</b> and contribute to decision-making for choosing the best suited repair prioritization for minimizing loss and maximizing resilience. Moreover, the basic scheme of this innovative technique can be applied to evaluation of restoration process of other infrastructure network systems and other disasters...|$|R

40|$|Regulative {{rules are}} central to the efforts made in {{organizations}} to ensure orderliness in the presence of physical danger. The reportedly routine violation of safety rules in organizations therefore brings into question the longstanding association of rules with organizational order, and the literature is sharply divided on whether rule violation represents a dangerous disorder or a reasonable way of getting by. This study is an attempt to carry out a more interpretive analysis, looking at how organizational members construct a sense of order in the presence of rule violation – and in particular how they do so by using a concept of intentionality to maintain accountability yet avoid rules becoming taboos. We find that the way people explain intentions attests to several senses of order that otherwise appear to be lost when rules are violated, such as predictability, purposefulness and progressiveness. This indicates that rules do not maintain, symbolize and constitute order simply because they are normative restraints on behaviour – but act as nuclei for discourses that can <b>repair</b> <b>order</b> even when they are violated. The order that is repaired in this way is both a mechanistic and a moral one...|$|E
40|$|As {{more data}} {{is stored in}} XML and more {{applications}} need to process this data, XML query optimization becomes performance critical. While optimization techniques for relational databases have been developed over the last thirty years, the optimization of XML queries poses new challenges. Query optimizers for XQuery, the standard query language for XML data, need to consider both document order and sequence order. Nevertheless, algebraic optimization proved powerful in query optimizers in relational and object oriented databases. Thus, this dissertation presents an algebraic approach to XQuery optimization. In this thesis, an algebra over sequences is presented that allows for a simple translation of XQuery into this algebra. The formal definitions of the operators in this algebra allow us to reason formally about algebraic optimizations. This thesis leverages {{the power of this}} formalism when unnesting nested XQuery expressions. In almost all cases unnesting nested queries in XQuery reduces query execution times from hours to seconds or milliseconds. Moreover, this dissertation presents three basic algebraic patterns of nested queries. For every basic pattern a decision tree is developed to select the most effective unnesting equivalence for a given query. Query unnesting extends the search space that can be considered during cost-based optimization of XQuery. As a result, substantially more efficient query execution plans may be detected. This thesis presents two more important cases where the number of plan alternatives leads to substantially shorter query execution times: join ordering and reordering location steps in path expressions. Our algebraic framework detects cases where document order or sequence order is destroyed. However, state-of-the-art techniques for order optimization in cost-based query optimizers have efficient mechanisms to <b>repair</b> <b>order</b> in these cases. The results obtained for query unnesting and cost-based optimization of XQuery underline the need for an algebraic approach to XQuery optimization for efficient XML query processing. Moreover, they are applicable to optimization in relational databases where order semantics are considered...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a Relation Extraction {{algorithm}} to extract knowledge out of automotive data. While most approaches to Relation Extraction are only evaluated on newspaper data dealing with general relations from the business world their applicability to other data sets is not well studied. Part I of this thesis deals with theoretical foundations of Information Extraction algorithms. Text mining cannot {{be seen as the}} simple application of data mining methods to textual data. Instead, sophisticated methods have to be employed to accurately extract knowledge from text which then can be mined using statistical methods from the field of data mining. Information Extraction itself can be divided into two subtasks: Entity Detection and Relation Extraction. The detection of entities is very domain-dependent due to terminology, abbreviations and general language use within the given domain. Thus, this task has to be solved for each domain employing thesauri or another type of lexicon. Supervised approaches to Named Entity Recognition will not achieve reasonable results unless they have been trained for the given type of data. The task of Relation Extraction can be basically approached by pattern-based and kernel-based algorithms. The latter achieve state-of-the-art results on newspaper data and point out the importance of linguistic features. In order to analyze relations contained in textual data, syntactic features like part-of-speech tags and syntactic parses are essential. Chapter 4 presents machine learning approaches and linguistic foundations being essential for syntactic annotation of textual data and Relation Extraction. Chapter 6 analyzes the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms of POS tagging, syntactic parsing and Relation Extraction on automotive data. The findings are: supervised methods trained on newspaper corpora do not achieve accurate results when being applied on automotive data. This is grounded in various reasons. Besides low-quality text, the nature of automotive relations states the main challenge. Automotive relation types of interest (e. g. component – symptom) are rather arbitrary compared to well-studied relation types like is-a or is-head-of. In order to achieve acceptable results, algorithms have to be trained directly on this kind of data. As the manual annotation of data for each language and data type is too costly and inflexible, unsupervised methods are the ones to rely on. Part II deals with the development of dedicated algorithms for all three essential tasks. Unsupervised POS tagging (Chapter 7) is a well-studied task and algorithms achieving accurate tagging exist. All of them do not disambiguate high frequency words, only out-of-lexicon words are disambiguated. Most high frequency words bear syntactic information and thus, {{it is very important to}} differentiate between their different functions. Especially domain languages contain ambiguous and high frequent words bearing semantic information (e. g. pump). In order to improve POS tagging, an algorithm for disambiguation is developed and used to enhance an existing state-of-the-art tagger. This approach is based on context clustering which is used to detect a word type’s different syntactic functions. Evaluation shows that tagging accuracy is raised significantly. An approach to unsupervised syntactic parsing (Chapter 8) is developed in order to suffice the requirements of Relation Extraction. These requirements include high precision results on nominal and prepositional phrases as they contain the entities being relevant for Relation Extraction. Furthermore, accurate shallow parsing is more desirable than deep binary parsing as it facilitates Relation Extraction more than deep parsing. Endocentric and exocentric constructions can be distinguished and improve proper phrase labeling. unsuParse is based on preferred positions of word types within phrases to detect phrase candidates. Iterating the detection of simple phrases successively induces deeper structures. The proposed algorithm fulfills all demanded criteria and achieves competitive results on standard evaluation setups. Syntactic Relation Extraction (Chapter 9) is an approach exploiting syntactic statistics and text characteristics to extract relations between previously annotated entities. The approach is based on entity distributions given in a corpus and thus, provides a possibility to extend text mining processes to new data in an unsupervised manner. Evaluation on two different languages and two different text types of the automotive domain shows that it achieves accurate results on <b>repair</b> <b>order</b> data. Results are less accurate on internet data, but the task of sentiment analysis and extraction of the opinion target can be mastered. Thus, the incorporation of internet data is possible and important as it provides useful insight into the customerś thoughts. To conclude, this thesis presents a complete unsupervised workflow for Relation Extraction – except for the highly domain-dependent Entity Detection task – improving performance of each of the involved subtasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, this work applies Natural Language Processing methods and Relation Extraction approaches to real world data unveiling challenges that do not occur in high quality newspaper corpora...|$|E
