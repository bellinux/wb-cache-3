40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to achieve a <b>referral</b> <b>database</b> for dental age {{estimation}} of unaccompanied minors of Thai nationality. A total of 1199 orthopantomograms were collected from original Thai women and men equally divided in age categories between 15 and 24 years. On the radiographs, the developmental stage of the third molars was scored applying a modified scoring technique. Inter- and intra-observer reliabilities were tested using kappa statistics. Correlation between the scores of all four wisdom teeth and left-right symmetry were evaluated with Pearson's correlation coefficient. Student's t-test on asymmetry was performed and regression formulas were calculated. The present database was the first to assemble third molar developmental scores on radiographs of Thai individuals and provides more appropriate dental age estimation of unaccompanied Thai minors.

40|$|Abstract: Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} {{is usually}} assessed according to International Standard ISO 5349 - 1 : 2001 using the frequency weighting Wh. This paper compares eight frequency weightings {{that might be}} used to supplement or replace Wh. The comparison is based on a data from two databases, one containing over 7200 measured hand-arm vibration (HAV) spectra {{from a wide range of}} industrial machines the other recording exposure history and injury for workers referred to the Health and Safety Laboratory. Acceleration spectra from the machinery database are analysed to give weighted values for the alternative frequency weightings. These weighted values are compared and then used to estimate a set of alternative lifetime vibration dose values for subjects in the <b>referral</b> <b>database.</b> Statistical comparison of these lifetime dose values against assessments of hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) and sensorineural HAVS prevalence suggests that values based the two weightings Wh and Wh 50 lp (the Wh weighing low-pass filtered at 50 Hz) provide the strongest indicators for developing these injuries. For vascular HAVS there was no clear evidence to advocate any individual frequency weighting.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some {{patients}} are repeatedly referred from primary to secondary care with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). We aimed {{to estimate the}} healthcare costs incurred by such referrals and to compare them with those incurred by other referred patients from the same defined primary care sample. METHODS: Using a <b>referral</b> <b>database</b> and case note review, all adult patients aged less than 65 years, who had been referred to specialist medical services from one of five UK National Health Service primary care practices in a five-year period, were identified. They were placed {{in one of three}} groups: (i) repeatedly referred with MUS (N= 276); (ii) infrequently referred (IRS, N= 221), (iii) repeatedly referred with medically explained symptoms (N= 230). Secondary care activities for each group (inpatient days, outpatient appointments, emergency department attendances and investigations) were identified from primary care records. The associated costs were allocated using summary data and the costs for each group compared. RESULTS: Patients who had been repeatedly referred with MUS had higher mean inpatient, outpatient and emergency department costs than those infrequently referred (£ 3, 539, 95 % CI 1458 to 5621, £ 778 CI 705 to 852 and £ 99, CI 74 to 123 respectively. The mean overall costs were similar to those of patients who had been repeatedly referred with medically explained symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The repeated referral of patients with MUS to secondary medical care incurs substantial healthcare costs.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and the adequacy of its treatment in patients who had been repeatedly referred from primary to specialist medical care {{for the assessment of}} {{a medical condition}}. METHODS: All patients who had at least three referrals to medical and surgical specialists for an assessment of symptoms attributed to a medical condition, over a five year period from five primary care practices in Edinburgh, UK were identified using a <b>referral</b> <b>database</b> and review of records. Participants were sent a questionnaire which included the PHQ- 9 depression scale and additional questions about depression during the preceding 5 years. Details of treatment for depression were obtained from primary care records. RESULTS: Questionnaires were sent to 230 patients and returned by 162 (70. 4 %). Forty-one (25. 3 %) had a PHQ- 9 score of 10 or more and hence probable current depressive disorder. An additional 36 (22. 2 %) reported depression in the previous 5 years. Only eight (19. 5 %) of those reporting current depression and 20 (26 %) of the 77 patients reporting previous depression had received minimally adequate treatment for it. CONCLUSION: Whilst we know that patients with medical conditions are often depressed and that such co-morbid depression is often undertreated, we have found that it is undertreated even in patients repeatedly referred to medical specialists. Better assessment and management of depression in such patients could both improve patients' quality of life and reduce the cost of care...|$|E

40|$|IINASP Access {{to current}} {{scientific}} and technical literature is essential to research and teaching. In many countries, universities and research institutes cannot fulfill their mandate because lack of foreign currency and other problems {{make it impossible to}} purchase essential text books, journals and reference materials. Organizations such as the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) have for some time donated copies of their publications to developing country institutions. But a more comprehensive approach was needed to overcome the dearth of scientific literature in so many regions of the world. In 1988 ICSU, together with the Third World Academy of Sciences/lnternational Centre for Theoretical Physics, sponsored a workshop to explore ways to enhance the flow of scientific information to developing countries. The workshop participants recommended the establishment of a network to coordinate existing donation efforts and develop new initiatives. In early 1990 the Publishing Service of ICSU took up the challenge of developing the proposed network, and the International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP) was launched in 1991. INASP, which is a cooperative network of donors and representatives of recipient institutions, has three immediate objectives: to support and strengthen existing programmes involved in the distribution, publication, exchange and donation of books, journals and related materials (maps and charts, audio-visual materials, software and CD-ROM); to encourage new initiatives that will increase the availability of quality scientific literature; and to identify methods that will permit the ongoing and sustainable exchange and distribution of scientific publications. The Network is creating several computerized <b>databases.</b> Initially, two <b>referral</b> <b>databases</b> are involved. The first already provides current information on existing sources of low-cost exchange or donated scientific material and is being expanded to include support to indigenous publishing. The second will provide an inventory of 'recipient 'institutions. Retrieval of data is manipulated in order to identify areas of duplication and omission. The results of these analyses will be circulated to encourage discussions among existing donation programmes on ways to further rationalize and coordinate efforts. INASP offers a clearing house and advisory service and assists in the matching of donors to appropriate recipients and vice versa. It will promote and support the establishment ofnew programmes to distribute current journals on a continuing basis. A newsletter will be circulated to link users and others who may be interested, to provide updated information from the databases and discuss the problems involved and possible solutions for making scientific lit erasure available to developing countries.

A prerequisite for exploring the actions taken by general practitioners (GPs) on symptoms of cancer {{is being able to}} identify patients urgently referred for suspected cancer. Such system is not available in Denmark; however, all referrals are electronically stored. This study aimed to develop and test an algorithm based on referral text to identify urgent cancer referrals from general practice. Methods: Two urgently referred reference populations were extracted from a research database and linked with the Primary Care <b>Referral</b> (PCR) <b>database</b> through the unique Danish civil registration number to identify the corresponding electronic <b>referrals.</b> The PCR <b>database</b> included GP <b>referrals</b> directed to private specialists and hospital departments, and these referrals were scrutinized. The most frequently used words were integrated in the first version of the algorithm, which was further refined by an iterative process involving two population samples from the PCR database. The performance was finally evaluated for two other PCR population samples against manual assessment as the gold standard for urgent cancer referral. Results: The final algorithm had a sensitivity of 0. 939 (95 % confidence intervals [CI]: 0. 905 – 0. 963) and a specificity of 0. 937 (95 % CI: 0. 925 – 0. 963) compared to the gold standard. The positive and negative predictive values were 69. 8 % (95 % CI: 65. 0 – 74. 3) and 99. 0 % (95 % CI: 98. 4 – 99. 4), respectively. When applying the algorithm on referrals for a population without earlier cancer diagnoses, the positive predictive value increased to 83. 6 % (95 % CI: 78. 7 – 87. 7) and the specificity to 97. 3 % (95 % CI: 96. 4 – 98. 0).

In some areas the NHS has formed partnerships with commercial companies to offer weight management services, {{but there has been}} little evaluation of these schemes. This study is an independent audit of the Weight Watchers NHS Referral scheme and evaluates the weight change of obese and overweight adults referred to Weight Watchers (WW) by the NHS. METHOD: Data was obtained from the WW NHS <b>Referral</b> Scheme <b>database</b> for 29, 326 referral courses started after 2 nd April 2007 and ending before 6 th October 2009 [90 % female; median age 49 years (IQR 38 - 61 years); median BMI 35. 1 kg/m 2 (IQR 31. 8 - 39. 5 kg/m 2). Participants received vouchers (funded by the PCT following referral by a healthcare professional) to attend 12 WW meetings. Body weight was measured at WW meetings and relayed to the central database. RESULTS: Median weight change for all referrals was - 2. 8 kg [IQR - 5. 9 [...] 0. 7 kg] representing - 3. 1 % initial weight. 33 % of all courses resulted in loss of ≥ 5 % initial weight. 54 % of courses were completed. Median weight change for those completing a first course was - 5. 4 kg [IQR - 7. 8 [...] 3. 1 kg] or - 5. 6 % of initial weight. 57 % lost ≥ 5 % initial weight. CONCLUSIONS: A third of all patients who were referred to WW through the WW NHS Referral Scheme and started a 12 session course achieved ≥ 5 % weight loss, which is usually associated with clinical benefits.

METHODS: A retrospective secondary data analysis of 16 445 singleton births was performed using a tertiary <b>referral</b> centre obstetric <b>database</b> (1995 - 1999). Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Stillbirth complicated 1 % of the pregnancies in the study population, and 59 % of stillbirths were associated with a male fetus. Significant characteristics associated with stillbirth were intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), birth defects, gestational age, Aboriginal ethnicity, previous stillbirth, parity greater than three and placental abruption.

40|$|Introduction: Not all {{national}} health centers include specialized units or clinicians devoted to inflammatory bowel disease. The {{goal of the}} survey was to gain an insight into the management of this disease within Spanish gastroenterology departments via a survey among their members. Material and methods: An online survey was conducted in February and March 2015, among SEPD members (2017 clinician members), who were split into three categories: heads of department, general gastroenterologists, and experts in this disease. The results {{of the last two}} surveys are reported, including demography-related questions and specific questions on the strategies and resources available for the care of these patients. Results: A total of 166 responses were received (response rate 8. 19 %), excluding those from heads of department (previously published). Sixty gastroenterologists considered themselves experts in inflammatory bowel disease, and 106 non-experts in it, the latter being either general gastroenterologists or specialists in other areas, mainly endoscopy. Twenty-eight percent of non-expert gastroenterologists said their hospitals had specific units, with a monographic clinic in 46 %. However, 26 % reported that they were treating affected patients themselves. Experts in inflammatory bowel disease reported that their institute had resources to support their work, but {{there was a lack of}} surgeons with expertise in this condition, particularly in county hospitals. Conclusions: At least, within SEPD members, 2 out of 3 experts in inflammatory bowel disease seem to have the resources available for their work (nurses, day unit, telephone line, <b>database,</b> <b>referrals,</b> joint sessions). Although there is room for improvement (email to contact patients, devoted surgeon, absence of referral protocols), and 2 out of 3 are concerned about pharmacy costs.

40|$|Background: The {{autosomal}} dominant condition multiple osteochondromas, formerly called multiple hereditary exostoses, {{is associated with}} a risk of malignant progression of osteochondroma into secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. Most patients with multiple osteochondromas have exostosin- 1 or exostosin- 2 gene mutations. To our knowledge, it has not been previously reported that patients may also harbor intraosseous (central) chondroid neoplasms, enchondromas, or atypical chondroid tumors or central chondrosarcomas. The combination of osteochondroma and enchondromas also exists in patients with metachondromatosis, a disorder associated with a protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11 gene mutation. This study aims to establish any correlation between multiple osteochondromas and intraosseous cartilaginous neoplasms. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all histologically proven intraosseous atypical chondroid tumors or chondrosarcomas in our prospective nationwide Dutch tertiary <b>referral</b> multiple osteochondromas <b>database.</b> Demographic, clinical, radiographic, histological, and genetic data were recorded. The institutionalmedical ethics review board approved the study. Results: From 195 adult patients, seven (3. 6 %) were identified with intraosseous atypical chondroid tumor or chondrosarcoma World Health Organization grade 1 and had a mean age of forty-two years; five of these patients were male. In all cases, radiographic and genetic findings were consistent with multiple osteochondromas, not metachondromatosis; three patients had an exostosin- 1 mutation, four patients had an exostosin- 2 mutation, and no patients had a protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 mutation. Six patients underwent successful operative treatment without complications or recurrences after a mean follow-up duration of forty-eight months (range, twelve to 144 months). One patient was scheduled for surgery after biopsy and histologic confirmation. Of the seven patients, five (71 %) also developed a peripheral chondrosarcoma in a known osteochondroma during the study period. Conclusions: Apart from osteochondromas or peripheral chondrosarcomas, multiple osteochondromas are also associated with intraosseous chondroid neoplasms, potentially resulting in central chondrosarcoma. Therefore, intraosseous lesions should not automatically be regarded as innocuous in this patient populatio...|$|R

Methods: Pitt County Athletic Training collected data to record daily activities at high schools in the county from August 1, 2014 to December 3, 2014 to include fall and winter sports. The certified athletic trainers tracked and recorded the daily activities of five high schools in Pitt County. The database served as an injury tracker that recorded information such as date, sport, level, event, injury, illness, medical care and <b>referral.</b> The <b>database</b> was reviewed and analyzed by sport in terms of upper extremity, lower extremity and non-extremity injury, as well as illness. Concussions were analyzed by gender, season, event and sport. Upper extremity injuries include those to the hands, elbow, thumb, lower arm, fingers or shoulder, while lower extremity injuries consist of injuries to the ankle, knee, lower leg, thigh, gluteals, toe or foot. Non-extremity injuries are injuries that occur to the brain (concussion), cervical spine, lumbar spine, ear, nose, mouth, back abdomen or chest and illnesses were recorded when athletes were experiencing heat illness, skin infection, asthma, respiratory condition, diabetes, or stomach discomfort. Results: 4, 254 injuries occurred in 1, 182 athletes among five of the high schools in Pitt County. Lower extremity injuries were the most prevalent with about 1, 978 cases being reported, while only 1, 524 cases of upper extremity injuries were reported. There were 361 cases of concussions, 239 injuries reported as other of other injuries (non-extremity injuries excluding the brain) and only 152 instances of an illness recorded. Varsity and junior varsity football reported the highest number of injuries among all five categories, while Track/Field/Cross Country had the next highest number of lower extremity injuries reporting 156 cases of this injury. Cheer also reported 59 incidents of concussion after both varsity and junior varsity football. Wrestlers reported 20 cases of illnesses while varsity football reported 84 and junior varsity football reported 41. More males experienced concussions than females and most concussions occurred at practice or during the regular season. Conclusion: In contrast to our prediction, Cheer had one of the highest concussion incidences among the sports excluding Football, which did have the highest concussion and injury occurrence. Our results show that more safety should be implemented in all sports to prevent and avoid the possible development of a disability or death in severe cases. B. S...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Hereditary {{pancreatitis}} (HP) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal dominant}} disorder with variable expression and an overall lifetime penetrance of 80 %. We hypothesised that (1) monozygotic twins within similar environments would develop the typical signs of HP at a similar age, and (2) if penetrance were due to modifier genes or environment, all twin pairs would be concordant for expression of HP.  AIM—Identify monozygotic twins with HP and determine the penetrance, concordance, and age of onset of symptoms.  METHODS—Twins from HP kindreds were identified from the Midwest Multicenter Pancreatic Study group <b>database,</b> <b>referrals,</b> and literature searches. Each twin set was assessed for phenotypic expression, concordance, and difference in age of phenotypic onset of pancreatitis. The difference in onset of symptoms for symptomatic affected non-twin sibling pairs as well as non-twin pairs that were mutation, sex, and age matched were calculated as two comparison groups.  RESULTS—Seven of 11  monozygotic pairs identified were suitable for evaluation and four were concordant for pancreatitis. Forty eight affected sibling pairs and 33  pairs of mutation, sex, and age matched (cationic trypsinogen R 122 H (30  pairs) and N 29 I (three pairs)) subjects were identified for comparison groups. The median (quartiles Q 1, Q 3) difference {{in the age of}} phenotypic onset in the concordant twins was 1  (0,  2. 4) years, 2  (1,  6) for the affected siblings, and 7  (2,  15) years in the comparison control group. Three of the seven sets of twins (43 %) were discordant for phenotypic expression of pancreatitis. The overall penetrance in the seven pairs of monozygotic twins was 78. 6 %.  CONCLUSIONS—Genetic and/or environmental factors contribute to expression and age of onset of HP. Nuclear genes or general environmental factors alone cannot explain the 80 % penetrance. Determining the mechanism of non-penetrance may help in developing a strategy to prevent the phenotypic expression of pancreatitis in individuals with an underlying genetic predisposition.    Keywords: hereditary pancreatitis; genetic; twins; penetrance; trypsinoge...|$|R
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} {{is a neurodegenerative}} disorder {{characterized by}} progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons, with a median survival of 2 - 3 years. Although various phenotypic and research diagnostic classification systems exist and several prognostic models have been generated, there is no staging system. Staging criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis would help to provide a universal and objective measure of disease progression with benefits for patient care, resource allocation, research classifications and clinical trial design. We therefore sought to define easily identified clinical milestones that could be shown to occur at specific points in the disease course, reflect disease progression and impact prognosis and treatment. A tertiary <b>referral</b> centre clinical <b>database</b> was analysed, consisting of 1471 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis seen between 1993 and 2007. Milestones were defined as symptom onset (functional involvement by weakness, wasting, spasticity, dysarthria or dysphagia of one central nervous system region defined as bulbar, upper limb, lower limb or diaphragmatic), diagnosis, functional involvement of a second region, functional involvement of a third region, needing gastrostomy and non-invasive ventilation. Milestone timings were standardized as proportions of time elapsed through the disease course using information from patients who had died by dividing time to a milestone by disease duration. Milestones occurred at predictable proportions of the disease course. Diagnosis occurred at 35 % through the disease course, involvement of a second region at 38 %, a third region at 61 %, need for gastrostomy at 77 % and need for non-invasive ventilation at 80 %. We therefore propose a simple staging system for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Stage 1 : symptom onset (involvement of first region); Stage 2 A: diagnosis; Stage 2 B: involvement of second region; Stage 3 : involvement of third region; Stage 4 A: need for gastrostomy; and Stage 4 B: need for non-invasive ventilation. Validation of this staging system will require further studies in other populations, in population registers and in other clinic databases. The standardized times to milestones may well vary between different studies and populations, although the stages themselves and their meanings are likely to remain unchanged...|$|R
40|$|Objetivo: Analizar el efecto de la puesta en marcha de una {{consulta}} de alta resolución (CAR) y de un programa de aumento de la capacidad resolutiva de atención primaria (PACRAP) en las derivaciones a las consultas de gastroenterología desde atención primaria y en los recursos utilizados. Métodos: Estudio observacional retrospectivo basado en la revisión de las hojas de derivación y de las bases de datos de documentación clínica. Se analizaron el número y el motivo de las derivaciones, los tiempos de demora y el consumo de recursos en dos periodos: anterior (primer cuatrimestre de 2007) y posterior (primer cuatrimestre de 2009) a la puesta en marcha de la CAR y el PACRAP. Resultados: Se evaluaron 881 derivaciones en el periodo anterior y 1076 en el posterior, y se halló una disminución de los tiempos de demora en el segundo periodo (80, 8 ± 64, 34 días frente a 36, 1 ± 29, 12 días, p Objectives: To {{analyze the}} effect of implementing a high-resolution clinic (HRC) and an increasing resolution capacity program in primary care (IRCPPC) for referrals to a gastroenterology outpatient clinic from primary care and the resources used. Methods: A retrospective and observational study based on a review of <b>referral</b> sheets and <b>databases</b> was performed. We analyzed the number and reason for referrals, delay times and resource consumption in two periods: before (first 4 months of 2007) and after (first 4 months of 2009) {{the launch of the}} IRCPPC and HRC. Results: In the first and second periods, 881 and 1076 patients, respectively, referred from primary health care were evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic, with a decrease in the delay time in the second period (80. 8 ± 64. 34 days vs 36. 1 ± 29. 12 days, p< 0. 001). The most frequent reasons for referral were dyspepsia (27. 7 %), high-risk of colorectal cancer (17. 1 %), disturbance of bowel rhythm (18. 2 %), abdominal pain (16 %), and gastroesophageal reflux (11. 2 %), with no differences between the two periods. Although delay times until the first visit (10. 8 ± 9. 03 days vs 42. 8 ± 28. 67 days, p< 0. 001) and until discharge (39. 6 ± 80. 65 days vs 128. 6 ± 135. 34 days, p< 0. 001) were lower in referrals to the HRC, the number of visits (3. 6 ± 2. 20 vs 3. 2 ± 1. 95, p= 0. 015) and the cost of referrals (592. 7 ± 421. 50 € vs 486. 0 ± 309. 66 €, p< 0. 001) was higher. Conclusions: In the study period the number of referrals increased, while the delay time decreased. Although the HRC reduces delay times, it is associated with an increase in health resource use...|$|R
