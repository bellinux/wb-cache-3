5|$|In its {{broadest}} definition, mimicry {{can include}} non-living models. The specific terms masquerade and mimesis are sometimes used when the models are inanimate. For example, {{animals such as}} flower mantises, planthoppers and geometer moth caterpillars <b>resemble</b> twigs, bark, leaves or flowers. Many animals bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to <b>resemble</b> the eyes of larger animals. They may not <b>resemble</b> any specific organism's eyes, {{and whether or not}} animals respond to them as eyes is also unclear. Nonetheless, eyespots are the subject of a rich contemporary literature.|$|E

5|$|The child's sex can be {{influenced}} by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age.

5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly <b>resemble</b> a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which <b>resemble</b> eyes.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to <b>resemble,</b> even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that even very slightly better <b>resemble</b> the distasteful species. This is because {{even a small}} degree of protection reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E
