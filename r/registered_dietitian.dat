25|$|In the US, <b>Registered</b> <b>dietitian</b> nutritionists (RDs or RDNs) are health {{professionals}} qualified to provide safe, evidence-based dietary advice {{which includes a}} review of what is eaten, a thorough review of nutritional health, and a personalized nutritional treatment plan. They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places, schools and similar institutions. Certified Clinical Nutritionists or CCNs, are trained {{health professionals}} who also offer dietary advice {{on the role of}} nutrition in chronic disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs. Government regulation especially in terms of licensing, is currently less universal for the CCN than that of RD or RDN. Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition Specialist or CNS. These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in obesity and chronic disease. In order to become board certified, potential CNS candidate must pass an examination, much like Registered Dieticians. This exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including; Clinical Intervention and Human Health.|$|E
2500|$|According to a 2015 {{systematic}} review, {{there is}} little evidence available about vegetarian and vegan diets during pregnancy, and a lack of randomized studies meant that the effects of diet could not be distinguished from confounding factors. It concluded: [...] "Within these limits, vegan-vegetarian diets may be considered safe in pregnancy, provided that attention is paid to vitamin and trace element requirements." [...] A daily source of vitamin B12 is important for pregnant and lactating vegans, as is vitamin D if there are concerns about low sun exposure. Researchers have reported cases of vitamin B12 deficiency in lactating vegetarian mothers that were linked to deficiencies and neurological disorders in their children. A doctor or <b>registered</b> <b>dietitian</b> should be consulted about taking supplements during pregnancy.|$|E

40|$|Dietary {{choices are}} a viable {{solution}} to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While <b>Registered</b> <b>Dietitians</b> {{are on the}} front lines of food and nutrition recommendations, it is unclear how many are concerned with climate change and take action in practice in the United States. We explored concern about climate change amongst <b>Registered</b> <b>Dietitians,</b> and identified factors that may influence practice-related behaviors. Our study population included a random sample of all <b>Registered</b> <b>Dietitians</b> credentialed in the United States. Primary data was gathered using a cross-sectional survey. Of the 570 survey responses, 75 % strongly agreed or agreed that climate change is an important issue while 34 % strongly agreed or agreed that dietitians should play a major role in climate change mitigation strategies. Thirty-eight percent engaged in activities that promoted diet as a climate change mitigation strategy. Vegetarian (p= 0. 002) and vegan dietitians (p= 0. 007) were significantly more likely than non-vegetarian and non-vegan dietitians to engage in activities that promoted diet as a climate change mitigation strategy. Overall, concern for climate change amongst dietitians varied significantly by the region of the country in which the dietitian resided, and awareness that animal products are implicated in climate change. <b>Registered</b> <b>Dietitians</b> in the United States are concerned with climate change. However, there is a discrepancy between concern and practice-based actions. These results suggest the need for educational and experiential opportunities connecting climate change mitigation to dietetics practice...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Identification of {{low levels}} of health {{literacy}} is important for effective communication between providers and clients. Assessment instruments for general health literacy are inadequate for use in nutrition education encounters {{because they do not}} identify nutrition literacy. The primary objective of this 2 -part study was to assess content validity for the Nutrition Literacy Assessment Instrument (NLAI). Methods This study included a 35 -item online survey of <b>registered</b> <b>dietitians</b> (134 of whom answered all questions) and a pilot study in which 5 <b>registered</b> <b>dietitians</b> used the NLAI among 26 clients during nutrition education consultations. To assess agreement with the NLAI by survey participants, we used the following scale: “necessary” (70 % agreement), “adequate” (80 % agreement), or “good” (90 % agreement); comments were analyzed by using content analysis. For the pilot, we made comparisons between subjective assessments, the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), and the NLAI. <b>Registered</b> <b>dietitians</b> also completed a postpilot–study survey. Results For the online survey, we found good agreement (average, 89. 7 %) for including each section of the NLAI. All sections accomplished their purpose (average, 81. 5 %). For the pilot, REALM and NLAI correlation (r = 0. 38) was not significant; the subjective assessment of clients by dietitians and NLAI lacked agreement 44 % of the time, and <b>registered</b> <b>dietitians</b> provided instruction on deficient knowledge and skills identified by the NLAI 90 % of the time. Conclusion The NLAI is a content-valid measure of nutrition literacy.

40|$|The {{level of}} {{awareness}} for visiting nutrition/dietary intervention services was not so high in both the patient（ 23 %） and staff（ 50 %） groups and accordingly, the rate of service utilization was also low. However, once being used, the level of satisfaction for services was high in both the patient（ 100 %） and staff（ 71 %） groups. On the other hand, there was discrepancy between the patient（ 58 %） and staff（ 82 %） groups for the {{level of awareness}} for patients suffering from problems with dietary and nutrition.

40|$|Adult patient {{education}} is a major responsibility of <b>registered</b> <b>dietitians.</b> It is essential for <b>registered</b> <b>dietitians</b> to be effective adult educators as they teach adults in various employment settings. Review of the literature revealed that one important factor in being an effective adult educator is developing a teaching style which facilitates learning, known as learner-centered teaching style. The purpose of this descriptive {{study was to identify}} the teaching style preference and identify factors that have influenced registered dietitians' teaching style preference. The study sample of six hundred <b>registered</b> <b>dietitians</b> residing in the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin) were sent two tools to complete, the "Principles of Adult Learning Scale (PALS) ". Two hundred and fifty-two respondents completed the questionnaire and PALS, designed by Conti to determine teaching style preference. The overall PALS scores were computer generated. Frequency distributions and populations percentages were calculated for demographic and descriptive data. The mean, median, and standard deviation of PALS scores were calculated. Analysis of various factors and the PALS scores. The findings suggest that registered dietitians' teaching style preference is teacher-centered. The years of employment positively affected teaching style toward learnercentered until the dietitian had been employed more than 16 years, then the years of employment negatively affected teaching style preference. The number of formal educational sessions relating to adult education had the most positive effect on teaching style preference. The number of continuing education session related to adult education proved to be the factor that most affected teaching style preferences. The study has implications for <b>registered</b> <b>dietitians</b> regarding dietetic education and curriculum development, continuing professional education and adult educators utilizing the PALS instrument. Further study is recommended using PALS with only entry-level dietitians and comparing PALS scores with actual classroom teaching behavior. Department of Educational LeadershipThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
