25|$|In 1935, Reza Shah {{asked that}} the {{international}} community to refer to the country by its native name, Iran. Opposition to the change led to the reversal of the decision and Professor Ehsan Yarshater, editor of Encyclopædia Iranica, proposed the use of Persia and Iran interchangeably. Russian policy towards Iran in 1914 was based on assurances that Iranian territorial integrity would be respected but Tsarist expansion in northern Iran and opposition to the emergence of a stable modern state, led to suspicion that its policy was <b>really</b> <b>to</b> keep Iran as a dependency or to absorb more of its northern provinces. Britain traditionally sought to maintain commercial interests in the country and the use of naval power to protect India. The geographical position of Iran, between Europe and India and the ancient west–east trade routes through Iranian provinces, had led the British in the nineteenth century to follow a policy of using Iran as a buffer state.|$|E

500|$|There is no supplication in Christian Science prayer. The process {{involves}} the Scientist {{engaging in a}} silent argument to affirm to herself the unreality of matter, something Christian Science practitioners will do for a fee, including in absentia, to address ill health or other problems. Wilson writes that Christian Science healing is [...] "not curative... on its own premises, but rather preventative of ill health, accident and misfortune, since it claims {{to lead to a}} state of consciousness where these things do not exist. What heals is the realization that there is nothing <b>really</b> <b>to</b> heal."

500|$|Various actresses {{auditioned for}} the role of Epiphany Proudfoot before Lisa Bonet secured the part.

Parker cast Bonet based on the strength of her audition and was unaware of her role on The Cosby Show. On preparing {{for the role}}, Bonet said, [...] "I did a lot of meditation and a lot of self-inquiry. I did some research on voodoo.

500|$|Pound {{contrasts}} this empiricism against {{knowledge gained}} through increasingly abstract definitions. As an example, Pound relates {{what might happen}} if a European is asked to define [...] "red". After the initial response that red is a color, Pound imagines asking for a definition of color and having it described in terms of vibration, with vibration then defined in terms of energy, and that successive abstractions eventually reach a level where language has lost its power. Returning to empiricism, Pound reminds the reader that the progress of science increased rapidly once [...] "Bacon had suggested the direct examination of phenomena, and after Galileo and others had stopped discussing things so much, and had begun <b>really</b> <b>to</b> look at them". Pound provides several other examples of the same contrasting ideas throughout the first chapter, ranging over topics as diverse as chemistry, Chinese writing, and Stravinsky. At the end of the chapter he summarizes his argument by claiming abstraction does not expand knowledge.|$|E
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not <b>really</b> <b>to</b> antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's <b>really</b> <b>to</b> present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E

He sends out a runner, Preacher, to Johnny's Bar, ostensibly for whiskey, but <b>really</b> <b>to</b> get professional gambler Bert Gordon to the hall. Eddie gets ahead $11,000 and Charlie tries to convince him to quit, but Eddie insists the game will end only when Fats says it is over. Fats agrees to continue after Bert labels Eddie a [...] "loser."

At their hotel later, Eddie leaves half of the remaining stake with a sleeping Charlie and leaves.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics.

[...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated it two stars out of five. The two noted that, had the episode used real magic tricks instead of [...] "resort to CGI, the episode would have been much more than a simple [...] "cheat". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the fact that the explanation behind Maleeni turning his head around 360 degrees was never satisfactorily explained. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four.

[...] The game's music and sound were designed in cooperation between Sunsoft's staff and an outside composer, Naoki Kodaka, who had previously worked on scores for many of the company's other titles. Iwata credited him for giving the company a good reputation for video game music in the late 1980s and lamented that [...] "none of those people are working together anymore since they've all separated from Sunsoft [...] ".|$|E
500|$|To {{follow-up}} It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, {{the group}} pursued a different direction, content-wise.

Chuck D also cited in their creative vision the commercial circumstances for hip hop at the time, having quickly transitioned from a singles to an album medium in the music industry during the 1980s. In an interview for Westword, he later said, [...] "We understood the magnitude of what an album was, so we set out to make something that not only epitomized the standard of an album, but would {{stand the test of time}} by being diverse with sounds and textures, and also being able to home in on the aspect of peaks and valleys".|$|E
