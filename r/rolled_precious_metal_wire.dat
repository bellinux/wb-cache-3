50|$|The art {{may be said}} {{to consist}} in curling, {{twisting}} and plaiting fine pliable threads of metal, and uniting them at their points of contact with each other, and with the ground, by means of flux such as borax, by the help of the blowpipe. When granulated motifs are desired, small beads are made traditionally by using <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> <b>wire</b> or fine sheet to start with, which is cut up in small pieces mixed with flux and placed in the small holes of a pitted block of charcoal (or any other suitable refractory material) and are then melted with a blowpipe (or today with a blowtorch), after which the bits of wire curl up and take a natural spherical like shape to end up in minuscule grains which slightly differ one from the other. Small grains or beads of the same metals are often set in the eyes of volutes, on the junctions, or at intervals at which they will set off the wirework effectively. The more delicate work is generally protected by framework of stouter wire.|$|R
40|$|Power {{demands for}} the {{operation}} of satellite payloads are increasing steadily {{and as a consequence}} so does the power generation capability of solar arrays. In most cases, this energy has to pass through the Solar Array Drive Mechanism; in other words through a slipring assembly. The use of new technologies for the manufacturing of slipring assemblies becomes thus compulsory. Among these new technologies the use of <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> alloy <b>wire</b> brushes in direct contact with gold or gold plated tracks is a real improvement. This technology permits to manufacture more compact slipring assemblies in a large range of electrical power capacity. In the present paper some aspects of the design of such slipring assemblies is discussed as well as some tests conducted to verify the capacities of this technology to be adapted to medium to high power space applications. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the price discovery, market efficiency and the temporal dynamic price relationships between financial prices (futures and index) and spot price, for three of the most important <b>precious</b> <b>metals,</b> namely gold, silver and platinum.

Further it will extend the research on price relationships and interactional impacts of <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> markets based on non-synchronous trading that connects all the major markets around the world.

On the other hand, mixed results of short-term causality suggested that US futures and indices led spot prices in the majority of cases.
