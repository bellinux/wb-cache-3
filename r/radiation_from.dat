5|$|A {{polar ice}} cap, or polar ice sheet, is a high-latitude region {{of a planet}} or moon that is covered in ice.

5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak.

Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{study has been}} made of the radiochemical decomposition of trypsin by the <b>radiations</b> <b>from</b> radium emanation. The following equation accounts quantitatively for the experimental results presented. See PDF for Equation It follows from this that the amount of trypsin decomposed by the <b>radiations</b> <b>from</b> radium emanation depends on the concentration of trypsin present and is proportional to the quantity of emanation expressed in millicuries and to the time of irradiation expressed in hours. It would seem that it is the active or undissociated trypsin that is affected. Evidence has been found which suggests that the beta radiations produce the decomposition observed for which the above statement holds. Qualitative evidence has been found which suggests that x-rays, gamma rays, and beta rays produce identical effects in dilute trypsin solutions...|$|R

5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives an absolute magnitude of 2.42, {{as compared to the}} Sun, which has an absolute magnitude of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times greater than that of the Sun.

5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo {{gravitational}} collapse to form a black hole. According to classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic <b>radiation,</b> <b>from</b> escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.|$|E

His body was returned to New London, where he was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery.|$|E

Observing more incoming <b>radiation</b> <b>from</b> the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged.
