40|$|This article {{examines}} media literacy in the UK: {{a policy that}} emerged within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in the late 1990 s, {{was adopted by the}} New Labour administration, and enshrined in the Communications Act 2003.

The article describes how Ofcom managed this <b>regulatory</b> <b>duty.</b> It argues that over time, media literacy was progressively reduced in scope, focusing on two policy priorities related to the growth of the internet. In the process, media literacy’s broader educative purpose, so clearly articulated in much of the early policy rhetoric, was effectively marginalized. From the Coalition government onwards, the promotion of media literacy was reduced further to a matter of market research. Today, if not altogether dead, the policy is governed by entirely different priorities to those imagined at its birth...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{differences in}} countries' approaches to investor protection regulation and explores {{the reasons why}} they exist {{in the first place}} as well as why they are likely to persist. I first provide a framework that can explain the need for regulation in financial markets in general and secondary capital markets in particular. Next, taking the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia as case studies, I present descriptive and stylised evidence on regulatory and institutional differences across countries with regards to private enforcement of <b>regulatory</b> <b>duties.</b> Differences in the institutional treatment of those entitled to the regulatory protection as well as what <b>regulatory</b> <b>duties</b> entail are evident. However, the two countries are similar in that they both provide for private enforcement of <b>regulatory</b> <b>duties</b> through a cause of action in tort. An important implication of this finding is that the level of protection provided is unlikely to converge globally, despite efforts to harmonies by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). Convergence of the legal protection provided for investors is also unlikely due to persistent differences in tort law around the world. Given an ostensibly strong need for appropriate level of protection for investors, I propose a different way forward that does not require convergence of substantive regulation and enforcement across countries.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an impact of credit risk management and credit risk regulation on {{the volume and}} quality of credits. Consequently there is an influence on economic activity of people and companies, price level and business cycle. In the thesis {{the basic principles of}} credit risk management and regulations are described. The volume of granted credit determines the probability of default. If there is an option to transfer a credit risk to the third party, volume of granted credits increases. The volume of credit depends also on the <b>regulatory</b> <b>duty</b> to hold an adequate amount of capital. In the case the banks find the way to diminish this regulatory capital, the volume of credit increases. Credit activity of banks boosts economic activity of people and companies and it has an impact on the price level. The option of credit risk transfer to the third party together with high saturation of credit market leads to taking higher risk by lenders. At the end it has an impact on the business cycle...|$|E
40|$|The Establishment Clause is not {{violated}} {{when government}} enacts regulatory or tax legislation but provides, concerning these new burdens, an accommodation for those holding conflicting religious beliefs or practices. Such religious exemptions are enacted {{at the discretion}} of the legislature and have as their purpose to ameliorate hardships borne by religious minorities and other dissenters who find themselves {{out of step with the}} prevailing social or legal culture. In an unbroken line of cases now spanning a century, the Supreme Court has ten times rejected the argument that a religious exemption contravenes the Establishment Clause. In some instances, no doubt, lawmakers should exercise their discretion and narrow or deny an exemption for religious observance. What is not the law, however, is that the presence of adverse effects on those who do not benefit from an discretionary religious exemption causes an otherwise lawful accommodation to violate the Establishment Clause. Cases involving an exemption are being confused with religious preferences. An exemption occurs when a dissenter’s religious practice is simply left alone even as others are made to labor under a burden of the legislature’s creation, be it a tax or <b>regulatory</b> <b>duty.</b> Government does not establish religion by leaving it alone. An exemption, rather, ensures that a new regulatory burden on others is not also thrust in the path of individuals who are already inclined to privately follow the dictates of their faith. Because the government’s exemption is not the causal agent behind the religious observance, any incidental harm to third parties is the result of private conduct. Harm redressable under the Establishment Clause must be injury that was caused by the government, not private actors. In contrast, a religious preference arises when the government first takes note of a disagreement in the private sector that involves religion. If a law is subsequently adopted that takes the side of the religious disputant, the government is intentionally preferring religion over its competitor. The favoritism occurs in a situation not of the state’s creation, but in circumstances arising out of private social or market forces. Should the form of the government’s discretionary intervention go on to unyieldingly side with religion such that any costs to others are not weighed in the balance, then the Court will strike down the preference. The operative Establishment Clause rule is that persons in the private sector should not be forced to readjust their lives so that a neighbor can better conform to his or her religion. Along with true preferences, progressives want religious exemptions to be balanced against any incidental harms that befall third parties. They want this not as a matter of legislative discretion, but as a constitutional imperative. This not only misconceives the nature of the Establishment Clause, but the argument assumes that “third-party harm” is a juridical category that can be both defined and bounded. It cannot. Additionally, the logic behind this category is in danger of expanding and thereby end up overwhelming most every religious exemption. The founding generation did not regard a discretionary religious exemption as an establishment. Moreover, there are presently thousands of religious exemptions in local, state, and federal law. To abolish them all because they are thought to be unconstitutional under a novel theory would work primarily to the injury of religious minorities. That would bring a sea change in the venerable American practice of extending a welcoming hand to diverse peoples of diverse faiths...|$|E

40|$|Using {{a public}} health policy perspective, this article {{examines}} the persistence of racial inequities in nursing homes and prescribes a solution to address these inequities. I use empirical data to prove the persistence of racial inequities in health care, analyze the government policies that allow racial inequities to continue, and provide a solution of regulatory integration. Specifically, I propose that civil rights enforcement be integrated with the nursing home enforcement system, which has been aggressively enforced and monitored. There are many strategies that may lead to the adoption of this system. One such strategy is using the Medicaid Act to induce the government to fulfill its non-race based <b>regulatory</b> <b>duties</b> of access and quality of care, which would improve the care of African Americans. Aimed at forcing the government to fulfill its regulatory mandates, this strategy is intended to transform a broken civil rights system that implicitly accepts the unequal treatment of African Americans into an effective one that proscribes and puts an end to racial discrimination...|$|R

Evidene indicates that extension is the bottle-neck in agricultural development in South Africa. However, in spite of this, it is neglected when compared to research. The unmanageable number of clients per extension worker and diverse <b>regulatory</b> <b>duties</b> are some of the factors responsible for a passive information service benefiting only those farmers who have already realised their need for it. The end result is an ever increasing gap between the small percentage of progressive farmers and the majority of less progressive farmers, with correspondingly detrimental social and economic results.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a qualitative study into the goods transport sector and its vulnerability to crime. Based on 33 interviews with professionals and law enforcement agents, four interviews with convicted criminals, 26 case files from the Belgian Federal Police and the customs services and 9 informal conversations with law enforcement agency personnel, academics and professionals, the paper analyses what structures, mechanisms, conditions and interdependencies make the goods transport network susceptible to criminal activity. It is suggested that vulnerability to crime is twofold, consisting of opportunities based on weak sector conditions and weak regulation. It will be demonstrated that small and medium enterprises present particular opportunities for criminal exploitation due to their weaker financial position and the lack of crime prevention measures in place. The study found no criminal 'front' structures that are transport businesses alone, because of the high start-up costs within the industry; rather, non-transport companies are exploited to connect to the legal transport sector. Finally, the paper identifies key weaknesses in the sector, asking whether there should be due diligence or <b>regulatory</b> <b>duties</b> for certain roles in the supply chain like shipping agents...|$|R
