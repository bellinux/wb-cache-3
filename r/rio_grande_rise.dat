50|$|Apart {{from the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the Walvis Ridge and the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> <b>Rise</b> {{are the most}} {{distinctive}} feature of the South Atlantic sea floor. They originated from hotspot volcanism and together they form a mirrored symmetry across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with the Tristan Hotspot at its centre.

The complex of seamounts in the western end of the Walvis Ridge, however, does not have a similar structure on the American side, but there is a Zapiola Seamount Complex south of the eastern end of the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> <b>Rise.</b> The formation of this mirrored structure {{is the result of the}} opening of the South Atlantic some 120 Mya and the Paraná and Etendeka continental flood basalts, the lateral-most parts of the structure, formed at the beginning of this process in areas that are now located in Brazil and Namibia.|$|E

50|$|The Vema Channel, a deep trough in the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> <b>Rise</b> of the South Atlantic at , is an {{important}} conduit for Antarctic Bottom Water and Weddell Sea Bottom Water migrating north.

The other part recirculates and some of it flows through the Romanche Fracture Zone into the eastern Atlantic. In the Guiana Basin, west of 40°W, the sloping topography and the strong, eastward flowing deep western boundary current might prevent the Antarctic bottom water from flowing west: thus it has to turn north at the eastern slope of the Ceará Rise. At 44°W, north of the Ceará Rise, Antarctic bottom water flows west in the interior of the basin. A large fraction of the Antarctic bottom water enters the eastern Atlantic through the Vema Fracture Zone.|$|E

50|$|The oldest phorusrhacoids {{are from}} South America and Antarctica, {{suggesting}} that the ancestors of Lavocatavis migrated into Africa from the west. During the Eocene, the Atlantic Ocean separated South America from Africa by at least 1000 km, ruling out a land migration. For a flightless terrestrial bird like Lavocatavis, {{the only means of}} entering Africa would be through rafting on floating islands or island hopping. Currents traveled westward in the South Atlantic during the early Paleocene, making it unlikely that phorusrhacoids traveled on floating islands. The ancestors of Lavocatavis most likely traveled between very large islands that existed on what are now the submerged <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> <b>Rise</b> and Walvis Ridge.
