40|$|Development and {{maintenance}} of virtual <b>reality</b> <b>engines</b> are coupled with large effort. It is therefore common today, to use existing solutions originating from the entertainment sector. This is often a compromise, since they fulfill individual requirements only in parts, due to their different background. The decision for a specific engine can have a large effect on the effort required to implement own functionality. The number of existing engines further complicates decision making. To enable a comprehensible and replicable decision making, we propose a structured selection process. In a multi-step approach, first the requirements and criteria for comparison are identified and analyzed. A pre-filtering is then used to select a feasible number of engines which are then compared in detail...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{interaction}} techniques for virtual reality applications are implemented in a proprietary way on specific target platforms, e. g., requiring specific hardware, physics or rendering libraries, which withholds reusability and portability. Though hardware abstraction layers for numerous devices {{are provided by}} multiple virtual reality libraries, they are usually tightly bound to a particular rendering environment. In this paper we introduce Viargo- a generic virtual reality interaction library, which serves as additional software layer that is independent from the application and its linked libraries, i. e., a once developed interaction technique, such as walking with a headmounted display or multi-touch interaction, can be ported to different hard- or software environments with minimal code adaptation. We describe the underlying concepts and present examples on how to integrate Viargo in different graphics engines, thus extending proprietary graphics libraries with a few lines of code to easy-to-use virtual <b>reality</b> <b>engines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to visualize the sensor performance for a generic missile. We simulate the proceses performed by a missile using IR or TV sensors. Two generic scenes (background) were created, one for each generic sensor. The program simulates the scene {{from the point of}} view of a missile sensor. A graphical user interface was included for user input. These inputs provide the initial environmental conditions and the structural specifications of the sensor and the targets. Depending on these inputs, the sensor will show a detection and a lock-on range to the user. The detection range for the IR sensor was based on the intensity of the signal, above a specific threshold. For the TV system, target contrast was used. Atmospheric extinction was included. Several aspects of the SGI hardware and software capability were used to mimic physical problems and processes at considerable savings in computational effort. One was the use of the SGI Gouraud shading capability to establish the temperature distribution for IR targets; a second was use of the hardware (screen) projection to map from 3 -D to 2 -D. For further work, this program can be integrated to the EOTDA (Electro-optical Tactical Decision Aid) software. The graphics part of the program was written by using OpenGL graphics library and the user interface was implemented by using OSF/Motif.

40|$|Abstract: The {{technical}} {{capabilities of}} modern smart mobile devices {{more and more}} enable us to run desktop-like appli-cations with demanding resource requirements in mobile environments. Along this trend, numerous concepts, techniques, and prototypes have been introduced, focusing on basic implementation issues of mobile applica-tions. However, only little work exists that deals with the design and implementation (i. e., the engineering) of advanced smart mobile applications and reports on the lessons learned in this context. In this paper, we give profound insights into the design and implementation of such an advanced mobile application, which enables location-based mobile augmented reality on two different mobile operating systems (i. e., iOS and Android). In particular, this kind of mobile application is characterized by high resource demands since various sensors must be queried at run time and numerous virtual objects {{may have to be}} drawn in realtime on the screen of the smart mobile device (i. e., a high frame count per second be caused). We focus on the efficient implemen-tation of a robust mobile augmented <b>reality</b> <b>engine,</b> which provides location-based functionality, as well as the implementation of mobile business applications based on this engine. In the latter context, we also discuss the lessons learned when implementing mobile business applications with our mobile augmented <b>reality</b> <b>engine.</b> ...|$|E
