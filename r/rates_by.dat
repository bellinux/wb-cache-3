5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling <b>rates</b> <b>by</b> predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection <b>rates</b> <b>by</b> approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E

5|$|In {{multiple}} steps during 2012–2013, the ECB {{lowered its}} bank rate to historical lows, reaching 0.25% in November 2013.

The moves were designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that lower cost of money would {{be passed on to}} businesses taking out loans, boosting investment in the economy.

5|$|Switzerland has an {{overwhelmingly}} private sector economy and low tax <b>rates</b> <b>by</b> Western World standards; overall taxation {{is one of}} the smallest of developed countries. Switzerland is a relatively easy place to do business, currently ranking 20th of 189 countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index. The slow growth Switzerland experienced in the 1990s and the early 2000s has brought greater support for economic reforms and harmonisation with the European Union. According to Credit Suisse, only about 37% of residents own their own homes, one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe. Housing and food price levels were 171% and 145% of the EU-25 index in 2007, compared to 113% and 104% in Germany.|$|E

Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Missouri and South Carolina, indicated on the map at right as having many counties with high premature mortality rates could therefore reduce mortality by expanding Medicaid, other things equal.|$|E

The bonds are implicitly subsidised, as they are guaranteed by the Government of Bangladesh, and still they are sold above the bank rate. In 2013, Bangladesh parliament passed 'Grameen Bank Act' which replaces the Grameen Bank Ordinance, 1983, authorising the government to make rules for any aspect of the running of the bank.|$|E

5|$|Pressure from an {{increasing}} population {{led to the}} town being supplied with amenities such as sewers, which were built in 1875–1880; and Sale {{was connected to the}} telephone network in 1888. As in the late-19th century, the early-20th century saw a great deal of construction work in Sale. The town's first swimming baths were built in 1914, and its first cinema, the Palace, was opened during the First World War. The end of the war in 1918 resulted in a rush of marriages, which highlighted a shortage of housing. The local councils of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey took the initiative of building council housing, and rented it to the local population at below market <b>rates.</b> <b>By</b> the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Sale had 594council houses. The building programme was interrupted by the start of the war. additional private housing development brought the total of inter-war houses built in Sale to around 900, including large housing estates like Woodheys Hall estate in Ashton.|$|E

40|$|Background: Internalizing {{and externalizing}} problem {{behavior}} at school can have major consequences {{for a child}} and is predictive for disorders later in life. Teacher ratings are important to assess internalizing and externalizing problems at school. Genetic epidemiological studies on teacher-rated problem behavior are relatively scarce and the reported heritability estimates differ widely. A unique feature of teacher ratings of twins is that some pairs are <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> different and others are <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> the same teacher. This offers the opportunity to assess geneenvironment interaction. Methods: Teacher ratings of 3, 502 7 -year-old, 3, 134 10 -year-old and 2, 193 12 -year-old twin pairs were analyzed with structural equation modeling. About 60 % of the twin pairs were <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> the same teacher. Twin correlations and the heritability of internalizing and externalizing behavior were estimated, separately for pairs <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> the same and different teachers. Socioeconomic status and externalizing behavior at age 3 were included as covariates. Results: Twin correlations and heritability estimates were higher when twin pairs {{were in the same}} class and <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> the same teacher than when pairs were <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> different teachers. These differences could not be explained by twin confusion or rater bias. When twins were <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> the same teacher, heritability estimates were about 70 % for internalizing problems and around 80 % in boys and 70 % in girls for externalizing problems. When twins were <b>rated</b> <b>by</b> different teachers, heritability estimates for internalizing problems were around 30 % and for externalizing problems around 50 %. Conclusions: Exposure to different teachers during childhood may affect the heritability of internalizing and externalizing behavior at school. This finding points to geneenvironment interaction and is important for the understanding of childhood problem behavior. In addition, it could imply an opportunity for interventions at schoo...|$|R
