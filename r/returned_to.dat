50|$|The laws of <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> {{scale are}} {{a set of}} three interrelated and {{sequential}} laws:Law of Increasing <b>Returns</b> <b>to</b> Scale,Law of Constant <b>Returns</b> <b>to</b> Scale,and Law of Diminishing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> Scale.If output increases by that same proportional change as all inputs change then there are constant <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale (CRS). If output increases by less than that proportional change in inputs, there are decreasing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale (DRS). If output increases by more than the proportional change in inputs, there are increasing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale (IRS). A firm's production function could exhibit different types of <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale in different ranges of output. Typically, there could be increasing returns at relatively low output levels, decreasing returns at relatively high output levels, and constant returns at one output level between those ranges.|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{a structural}} dynamic programming model of schooling decisions and obtain individual specific {{estimates of the}} local (and average) <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling {{as well as the}} <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience. Homogeneity of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> human capital is strongly rejected in favor of a discrete distribution version of the random coefficient specification. The results indicate that individuals who have the higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling are also those who have the higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience. There is a 5. 9 percentage points difference in the average <b>return</b> <b>to</b> schooling at college graduation between high and low market ability individuals (2. 3 % vs 8. 2 %) and a 5. 4 percentage points difference in the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> experience upon entrance in the labor market (3. 1 % vs 8. 5 %). When averaged over all types, the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> experience in the early phase of the life cycle (6. 8 %) exceeds the average <b>return</b> <b>to</b> schooling (6. 4 % at college graduation). After conditioning on a specific type, the log wage regression function remains rather convex in schooling. The conflictual effects of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling and experience on schooling decisions imply weak dynamic self-selection; that is educational attainments are only weakly correlated with individual differences in the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling...|$|R

30|$|To {{summarize}} {{our results}} about the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> {{different types of}} specific human capital, we find a strong <b>return</b> <b>to</b> tenure in the formal sector, but no significant <b>return</b> <b>to</b> tenure in the informal sector. Our estimates of 10 -year <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> employer, occupation, industry, and sector tenure indicate that formal sector tenure matters more than other specific human capital, namely employer or occupation tenure. In addition <b>to</b> the strong <b>return</b> <b>to</b> formal sector tenure, we find significant <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> potential experience with and without controlling for sector tenure, {{which is consistent with}} previous findings in the literature.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{differences}} in private marginal <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education between wage-employees and the self-employed in Uganda, using the Mincerian framework with pooled regression models. We use a two-wave household panel to estimate homogenous and heterogeneous private <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education for both worker types. The study finds similar marginal <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> an additional year of schooling for both worker types. Further, the study finds the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> educational qualifications are convex for wage-employees and concave for the self-employed. With regard <b>to</b> heterogeneous <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education, we employ quantile regression models and find <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education decreasing with quantile for both worker types...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} examines {{differences in}} earnings structure between Communist and post-Communist Czech Republic and Slovakia using {{four sets of}} similar micro-data. It presents hypotheses about how earnings dispersion <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education and <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience will change across regimes and tests those hypotheses using earnings equations. From approximately 2. 5 percent in 1984, the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> education increased to approximately 5 percent by 1993. During that period, <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience fell. Though women have higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education, <b>returns</b> for men increased more across regime change. Those with academic secondary education experienced a particularly large earnings increase. Earnings structure changes appear larger in the Czech Republic than in Slovakia.

30|$|In this paper, we {{have shown}} that <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> {{employer}} tenure in Indonesia are {{higher than in the}} USA and other developed countries. By contrast, <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience are lower in Indonesia than in developed countries. Furthermore, in Indonesia, <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> employer tenure are larger than <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience, and our estimates of <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> employer tenure are unaffected when we account for <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> other types of human capital, such as occupation and industry-specific human capital. As in many developing countries, informality is quite prevalent in Indonesia. We test for <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> sector-specific human capital and find that only formality offers positive returns. Overall, we conclude that employer tenure and formal sector tenure are the main sources of wage growth in Indonesia, with general labor market experience playing a smaller but significant role.|$|R

Before 1990 the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience and education were lower in East Germany than in West Germany. After the reunification East German <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience obtained before 1990 and to education decreased. I find a significant decrease of <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> high educated workers who spent in the East German educational system 15 and more years. East German <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> both human capital variables are smaller than West German ones before the reunification and the difference is more pronounced after the reunification...|$|R
