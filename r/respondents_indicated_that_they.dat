We observed that most of the <b>respondents</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have an ecological awareness regarding their daily consumption of public water.

In reality, detection of metastatic disease neither “catches the spread of cancer {{to other parts of the}} body early” nor “reduces the chances of dying from breast cancer”. However, if imaging is being performed to “rule out in the presence of metastatic disease” it is clearly evident that many patients will relapse despite the presence of “normal” imaging. Further highlighting this discrepancy between physician and patient perceptions and expectations is that the overwhelming {{majority of}} patients <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would feel uncomfortable if their physician did not order imaging to look for metastatic disease in their circumstance, even if this physician choice was in keeping with the evidence based guidelines.

40|$|Abstract: The {{private and}} public orphanages that dotted the child welfare {{landscape}} three or more decades ago have been widely condemned, often without qualification, by child welfare researchers and practitioners for “harming ” children in multiple ways, emotionally, behaviorally, and intellectually. This paper reports {{the findings of a}} second extensive survey of over 800 alumni from five private and state orphanages in the South and Midwest who left their orphanages in the late 1960 s and before. According to their own reports, the orphanage alumni have outpaced their age counterparts in the general population on a substantial majority of the social and economic outcome measures covered in the study. Also, the alumni overwhelmingly report favorable assessments of their orphanage experiences. Nine out of ten <b>respondents</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would prefer to have grown up in their orphanages than in foster care.

40|$|This {{research}} {{tests the}} intuition that parties {{to a contract}} approach each other differently before the contract is formed than they do once it is finalized. We argue {{that one of the}} most important determinants of self-protective behavior is whether the promisee considers herself to be in negotiations or already in an ongoing contract relationship. That shift affects precaution taking even when it has no practical bearing on the costs and benefits of self-protection: the moment of contracting is a reference point that frames the costs and benefits of taking precautions. We present the results of three questionnaire studies in which <b>respondents</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be more likely to protect their own interests—by requesting a liquidated damages clause, by purchasing a warranty, or by shopping around to ensure the best deal—when the contract is not yet finalized than they would when they understand the agreement to be finalized. We discuss competing explanations for this phenomenon, including both prospect theory and cognitive dissonance. Finally, we explore some doctrinal implications for work on disclosure, modification, and promissory estoppel...|$|R
