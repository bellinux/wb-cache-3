5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{are white}} rot pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the lignin {{of the host}} wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the <b>red</b> <b>rot</b> is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner—wood wasps—include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness, common in hanging, falling or tanning needles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Red</b> <b>rot</b> is the {{degradation}} of leather when it reacts with sulfur dioxide or other air pollutants. Objects affected by <b>red</b> <b>rot</b> go through several stages.

The degradation and disintegration of <b>red</b> <b>rot</b> cannot be reversed. In order to preserve the object in this altered state the two most significant steps for preservation are to store the object in a controlled air environment and to place where minimal handling will occur.|$|E

Since <b>red</b> ring <b>rot</b> is generally only a significant loss factor in very old stands, damage can be limited by managing stands to younger ages. Younger trees, if infected, are usually able to add new growth {{at a faster rate}} than that of decay. If a marketable tree is infected, it should be salvaged before disease progression significantly influences its value. Infected trees in public areas should be checked and removed if <b>red</b> ring <b>rot</b> disease has rendered them potentially dangerous (trees weakened due to heart rot are more likely to fall). Where timber management is the focus, infected trees should be removed. A reduction in rotation age should be considered if decay is frequent to minimize losses. Injuries to healthy trees should be avoided during logging to prevent new infections.|$|R

40|$|Background: Soybean <b>red</b> crown <b>rot</b> {{is a major}} soil-borne disease {{all over}} the world, which {{severely}} affects soybean production. Efficient and sustainable methods are strongly desired to control the soil-borne diseases. Principal Findings: We firstly investigated the disease incidence and index of soybean <b>red</b> crown <b>rot</b> under different phosphorus (P) additions in field {{and found that the}} natural inoculation of rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) could affect soybean <b>red</b> crown <b>rot,</b> particularly without P addition. Further studies in sand culture experiments showed that inoculation with rhizobia or AMF significantly decreased severity and incidence of soybean <b>red</b> crown <b>rot,</b> especially for coinoculation with rhizobia and AMF at low P. The root colony forming unit (CFU) decreased over 50 % when inoculated by rhizobia and/or AMF at low P. However, P addition only enhanced CFU when inoculated with AMF. Furthermore, root exudates of soybean inoculated with rhizobia and/or AMF significantly inhibited pathogen growth and reproduction. Quantitative RT-PCR results indicated that the transcripts of the most tested pathogen defense-related (PR) genes in roots were significantly increased by rhizobium and/or AMF inoculation. Among them, PR 2, PR 3, PR 4 and PR 10 reached the highest level with co-inoculation of rhizobium and AMF. Conclusions: Our results indicated that inoculation with rhizobia and AMF could directly inhibit pathogen growth and reproduction, and activate the plant overall defense system through increasing PR gene expressions.

50|$|Red {{ring rot}} {{is one of}} the most common and {{destructive}} heart rot pathogens in the Western United States. In Engelmann spruce it is the most common type of fungal decay and causes the largest decay columns of all the fungal heart rots, rendering the tree useless for harvesting. It is a particularly important disease in lodgepole pine and subalpine fir as well. Studies have shown that 64% of all defects in these three species were caused by Phellinus pini. It has been estimated that over three-fourths of the total 17% of decayed, overmature Douglas-fir is the Pacific Northwest were in decline due to <b>red</b> ring <b>rot.</b> Apart from the economic impacts of this disease, <b>red</b> ring <b>rot</b> decay may lead to mechanical failure of live trees, which may cause a potential hazard in recreational or public areas.|$|R

Urban {{trees on}} the Gadjah Mada University (UGM) area play an {{important}} role in increasing environmental qualities as well as in supporting the teaching and learning processes. However, <b>red</b> root <b>rot</b> disease caused by Basidiomycete Ganoderma sp. has severely infected some existing urban trees. This experiment was aimed to determine the susceptibility of Polyalthia longifolia (glodokan) and Pterocarpus indicus (angsana) to the infection of Ganoderma sp. Identification of infected trees was performed in UGM area. Further steps were carried out to achieve those objectives : (1) isolation of Ganoderma spp. and testing of Koch’s postulate and (2) examination of the susceptibility of  P. longifolia and P. indicus to infection of Ganoderma sp. The susceptibility test of P. longifolia and P. indicus to Ganoderma sp. indicated that P. longifolia was more resistant to fungal pathogen infection than that of P. indicus. Based on this experiment, it can be concluded that P. longifolia is a species that is more suitable than P. indicus.   P. longifolia should be planted on the areas that have been infested with inocula of Ganoderma sp. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Within-field {{multiple}} crop species intercropping is {{well documented}} and used for disease control, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. As roots are the primary organ for perceiving signals in the soil from neighboring plants, root behavior may {{play an important role}} in soil-borne disease control. Principal Findings: In two years of field experiments, maize/soybean intercropping suppressed the occurrence of soybean <b>red</b> crown <b>rot,</b> a severe soil-borne disease caused by Cylindrocladium parasiticum (C. parasiticum). The suppressive effects decreased with increasing distance between intercropped plants under both low P and high P supply, suggesting that root interactions play a significant role independent of nutrient status. Further detailed quantitative studies revealed that the diversity and intensity of root interactions altered the expression of important soybean PR genes, as well as, the activity of corresponding enzymes in both P treatments. Furthermore, 5 phenolic acids were detected in root exudates of maize/ soybean intercropped plants. Among these phenolic acids, cinnamic acid was released in significantly greater concentrations when intercropped maize with soybean compared to either crop grown in monoculture, and this spike in cinnamic acid was found dramatically constrain C. parasiticum growth in vitro. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report to demonstrate that intercropping with maize can promote resistance in soybean to <b>red</b> crown <b>rot</b> in a root-dependent manner. This supports the point that intercroppin...|$|R
5000|$|The red-cockaded {{woodpecker}} {{makes its}} home in fire-dependent pine savannas.

The older pines favored by the red-cockaded woodpecker often suffer from a fungus called <b>red</b> heart <b>rot</b> which attacks the center of the trunk, causing the inner wood, the heartwood, to become soft.
