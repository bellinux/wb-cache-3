25|$|In the United States, adverse medical event {{reporting}} systems were mandated {{in just over}} half (27) of the states as of 2014, a figure unchanged since 2007. In U.S. hospitals error reporting is a condition of payment by Medicare. An investigation by the Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services released January 6, 2012 found that most errors are not reported {{and even in the}} case of errors that are reported and investigated changes are seldom made which would prevent them in the future. The investigation revealed that there was often lack of knowledge regarding which events were <b>reportable</b> and recommended that lists of <b>reportable</b> events be developed.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} annual {{incidence}} {{rates have been}} reported in the literature: 15, 24, and 25–53 (all rates per 100,000 population per year).

John Snow, in England, {{was the first to}} identify the importance of contaminated water as its cause in 1854. Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to filtering and chlorination of water supplies, but still heavily affects populations in developing countries.|$|E

25|$|Tracking the {{transmission}} of infectious diseases is called disease surveillance. Surveillance of infectious diseases in the public realm traditionally has been the responsibility of public health agencies, either on the (inter)national or a local level. Public health staff rely on health care workers and microbiology laboratories to report cases of <b>reportable</b> diseases to them. The analysis of aggregate data can show the spread of a disease and {{is at the core}} of the specialty of epidemiology.|$|E
25|$|Onfield infractions {{considered}} {{to warrant a}} more severe penalty than a free kick are handled off-field by a league tribunal. Such incidents include deliberate or reckless acts of violence, such as striking, punching, tripping, kicking or endangering {{the head of an}} opponent, as well as misconduct such as abusing umpires or other players. Field umpires, boundary umpires and goal umpires are all permitted to report players for such infractions; in matches where there is video footage and where league rules permit, players may also be reported based on video evidence. For players who are found guilty of <b>reportable</b> offences, tribunals can issue fines or suspend players for a certain number of games.|$|E
25|$|Stigma {{has been}} {{associated}} with HIV in Jamaica {{since the beginning of the}} epidemic, partly because of its association with male homosexuality. Jamaican men, in particular, are so concerned about being associated with homosexuality that they are hesitant to seek HIV treatment and prevention services. Poor men living with HIV are assumed to have participated in same-sex sexual acts, and poor men who participate in those acts are assumed to be HIV positive. Some people in Jamaica become suicidal when they first receive their HIV diagnosis, rooted in the fear of isolation and discrimination that will result from others finding out and not from the potential of death associated with it. HIV is a <b>reportable</b> disease, resulting in a visit by a contact investigator who asks for the names of sexual partners.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} on-field {{incidents}} grew {{and after a}} particularly difficult game during 1935, newspaper cartoonist John Ludlow in The Age drew a picture of Dyer as a pirate and a journalist nicknamed him 'Captain Blood', after the Errol Flynn film Captain Blood. Initially, Dyer was angry at the connotation and the implied slur on his sportsmanship. Dyer preferred the 'hip and shoulder' method of meeting an opponent rather than grabbing him in a tackle. The force of being hit by the athletic, 89kg frame of Dyer was often enough to leave a player prostrate {{and not wanting to}} re-enter the fray for a while. Occasionally, the hip and shoulder could go awry and Dyer's forearm would come into play, which was a <b>reportable</b> offence. In a nineteen-year career, he was reported five times and suspended once.|$|E

2500|$|These {{arguments}} were ruled invalid in Schiff v. Commissioner. Another argument made by Schiff on {{his web site}} is: [...] "On the [...] 1040 itself... you report 'zero' income regardless of how much you received in: wages, commissions, interest, alimony, capital gains or from operating a business. For tax purposes, 'income' only means corporate 'profit.' Therefore, no individual receives anything that is <b>reportable</b> as 'income'." [...] This argument has been rejected by the lower courts, {{as well as the}} United States courts of appeal. See Cameron v. Internal Revenue Serv.; Stoewer v. Commissioner;Reinhart v. United States;Fink v. Commissioner;Flathers v. Commissioner;Schroeder v. Commissioner;Sherwood v. Commissioner; and Ho v. Commissioner.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, the Writers Guild went {{on strike}} over the home video market, which was then small and {{primarily}} consisted of distribution via video tape. At that time, the entertainment companies argued home video was an [...] "unproven" [...] market, with an expensive delivery channel (manufacturing VHS and Betamax tapes, and to a much smaller extent, LaserDisc). Movies were selling {{in the range of}} between $40–$100 per tape, and the Guild accepted a formula in which a writer would receive a small percentage (0.3%) of the first million of <b>reportable</b> gross (and 0.36% after) of each tape sold as a residual. As manufacturing costs for video tapes dropped dramatically and the home video market exploded, writers came to feel they had been shortchanged by this deal.|$|E
2500|$|From {{early in}} the 19th century the {{existence}} of natural mineral waters was noted here and exploited. A local businessman Thomas Potter built, in 1831, the famous Ilkeston Bath {{at the bottom of}} Town Street attached to the Rutland Hotel. For over 60 years the baths helped tourism to the town at a time when spa towns like Bath and Harrogate enjoyed popularity. [...] 'If you're doubled in pain and thin as a lath, Come at once then and try, the famed Ilkeston Bath,' was a well known advertising slogan. A mixture of a general decline in the popularity of spa bathing and, <b>reportable,</b> contamination of the waters from mining activities led to the eventual closure of the baths just before 1900. The baths and the adjacent Rutland Hotel, which also enjoyed a revenue from tourism, no longer exist though they are remembered in the name of 'Bath Street'.|$|E
2500|$|A {{month before}} the {{election}} the inspector general of the Ohio General Assembly announced he was investigating three legislators for accepting gifts and failing to report them. Schmidt was implicated in this, but could not be investigated because {{she was no longer}} a member of the Ohio house. (The others were Representatives Jim Raussen of Springdale, Michelle G. Schneider of Madeira, and Diana M. Fessler of New Carlisle.) On October 24, 2004, the legislators had accepted dinner at Nicola's Ristorante on Sycamore Street in Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood and Cincinnati Bengals tickets from a lobbyist for pharmaceutical company Chiron. Schmidt said she thought her $644 gift was from former Bengals player Boomer Esiason, who was, like Chiron, interested in cystic fibrosis. Schmidt repaid the lobbyist for the cost of the entertainment. Her spokesman told The Columbus Dispatch [...] "Jean specifically asked if this was a <b>reportable</b> gift. We immediately corrected it by paying the full price of the tickets." [...] Her former colleague Raussen blamed the lobbyist. [...] "Here we have a lobbyist who was extremely sloppy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mortgages on Trump's major properties—including Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street, and the Trump National Doral golf course—each {{fall into}} the [...] "above $50 million" [...] range, the highest <b>reportable</b> {{category}} on FEC filings, with Trump paying interest rates ranging from 4% to 7.125%. Mortgages on those three properties were separately reported as $100 million, $160 million, and $125 million in 2013. Trump is a leaseholder, not owner, of the land beneath 40 Wall Street. Other outstanding Trump mortgages and debts are pegged to current market interest rates. A 2012 report from Trump's accounting firm estimated $451.7 million in debt and other collateral obligations. Filings in 2015 disclosed debt of $504 million, according to Fortune magazine. Bloomberg documented debt of at least $605 million in 2016. Trump's outstanding debt was at least $650 million in August 2016, {{in addition to an}} outstanding loan of $950 million to the Bank of China and Deutsche Bank (among other creditors) on 1290 Avenue of the Americas, in which Trump is a minority owner.|$|E
2500|$|With a high {{concentration}} of troops in the New York City area, administration started to become burdensome. [...] In 1921, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was persuaded to head a foundation overseeing the New York borough councils. [...] Dr. George J.

2500|$|After the STS-125 mission, a {{work light}} knob was {{discovered}} jammed {{in the space}} between one of Atlantiss front interior windows and the Orbiter dashboard structure. The knob was believed to have entered the space during flight, when the pressurized Orbiter was expanded to its maximum size. Then, once back on Earth, the Orbiter contracted, jamming the knob in place. Leaving [...] "as-is" [...] was considered unsafe for flight, and some options for removal (including window replacement) would have included a 6-month delay of Atlantiss next mission (planned to be STS-129). Had the removal of the knob been unsuccessful, the worst-case scenario was that Atlantis could have been retired from the fleet, leaving Discovery and Endeavour to complete the manifest alone. On 29 June 2009, Atlantis was pressurized to [...] (3 psi above ambient), which forced the Orbiter to expand slightly. The knob was then frozen with dry ice, and successfully removed. [...] Small areas of damage to the window were discovered where the edges of the knob had been embedded into the pane. [...] Subsequent investigation of the window damage discovered a maximum defect depth of approximately , less than the <b>reportable</b> depth threshold of [...] and not serious enough to warrant the pane’s replacement.|$|E

Such journey is decided on; Crown-Prince to accompany. Summer of 1738: a short visit, quite without fuss; to last only three days;--mere sequel to the Reviews held in those adjacent Cleve Countries; so that the Gazetteers may take no notice.
