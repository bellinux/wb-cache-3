The spherical structure of all glycogen molecules was demonstrated in {{the slopes of the}} Mark-Houwink-Kuhn-Sakurada-type power-law relations for sedimentation coefficient (s 20,wo), intrinsic viscosity ([Î·]), radius of gyration (rg,z) and radius of hydration (rH,z), respectively, and was further supported by the Ï� (=rg,z/rH,z) function, the fractal dimension and the Perrin function. The degree of branching was estimated to be âˆ¼ 10 % from the shrinking factors, gâ€² (=[Î·]branched/[Î·]linear) and also h (=(f/fo) branched/(f/fo) linear), respectively, where (f/fo) is the translational frictional ratio, consistent with expectation.

2500|$|Throughout {{the entire}} {{period of the}} Famine, Ireland was {{exporting}} enormous quantities of food. In the magazine History Ireland (1997, issue 5, pp.32–36), Christine Kinealy, a Great Hunger scholar, lecturer, and Drew University professor, relates her findings: Almost 4,000 vessels carried food from Ireland to the ports of Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, and London during 1847, when 400,000 Irish men, women, and children died of starvation and related diseases. She also writes that Irish exports of calves, livestock (except pigs), bacon, and ham actually increased during the Famine. This food was shipped under British military guard from the most famine-stricken parts of Ireland; Ballina, Ballyshannon, Bantry, Dingle, Killala, Kilrush, Limerick, Sligo, Tralee, and Westport. A wide variety of commodities left Ireland during 1847, including peas, beans, onions, <b>rabbits,</b> salmon, <b>oysters,</b> herring, lard, honey, tongues, animal skins, rags, shoes, soap, glue, and seed. The most shocking export figures concern butter. Butter was shipped in firkins, each one holding [...] In {{the first nine months}} of 1847, [...] were exported from Ireland to Bristol, and [...] were shipped to Liverpool, which correlates with [...] of butter exported to England from Ireland during nine months of the worst year of the Famine. The problem in Ireland was not lack of food, which was plentiful, but the price of it, which was beyond the reach of the poor.|$|R
