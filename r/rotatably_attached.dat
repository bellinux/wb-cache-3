40|$|An {{extendable}} {{column is}} described {{which consists of}} several axially elongated rigid structural sections nested within one another. Each section includes a number of <b>rotatably</b> <b>attached</b> screws running along its length. The next inner section includes threaded lugs oriented to threadingly engage the screws. The column is extended or retracted upon rotation of the screws. The screws of each section are selectively rotated by a motor and an engagement mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Concepts and {{technologies}} described herein {{provide for a}} low noise aircraft wing slat system. According to {{one aspect of the}} disclosure provided herein, a cove-filled wing slat is used in conjunction with a moveable panel <b>rotatably</b> <b>attached</b> to the wing slat to provide a high lift system. The moveable panel rotates upward against the rear surface of the slat during deployment of the slat, and rotates downward to bridge a gap width between the stowed slat and the lower wing surface, completing the continuous outer mold line shape of the wing, when the cove-filled slat is retracted to the stowed position...|$|E
40|$|Devices {{and methods}} are {{provided}} for forming a vascular graft by axially distending a blood vessel to induce growth. The device preferably comprises a stretching mechanism which includes (i) a stabilization rod, (ii) {{a pair of}} rotatable elements, wherein each rotatable element is <b>rotatably</b> <b>attached</b> to the elongated body and has a channel substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and (iii) a means for rotating each rotatable element to axially distend a blood vessel positioned in the channels of the rotatable elements. The elements can be rotated intermittently, cyclically, or continuously, over a period to distend or elongate the donor vessel. Preferably, the device is implanted, for example using endoscopic techniques, for use in vivo, although the device {{also can be used}} in vitro. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|E
40|$|A remote {{appliance}} {{is described}} for supporting {{a tool for}} performing work at a worksite on a substantially circular bore of a workpiece and for providing video signals of the worksite to a remote monitor comprising: a baseplate having an inner face and an outer face; a plurality of rollers, wherein each roller is <b>rotatably</b> and adjustably <b>attached</b> to the inner face of the baseplate and positioned to roll against the bore of the workpiece when the baseplate is positioned against {{the mouth of the}} bore such that the appliance may be rotated about the bore in a plane substantially parallel to the baseplate; a tool holding means for supporting the tool, the tool holding means being adjustably attached to the outer face of the baseplate such that the working end of the tool is positioned on the inner face side of the baseplate; a camera for providing video signals of the worksite to the remote monitor; and a camera holding means for supporting the camera on the inner face side of the baseplate, the camera holding means being adjustably attached to the outer face of the baseplate. In a preferred embodiment, roller guards are provided to protect the rollers from debris and a bore guard is provided to protect the bore from wear by the rollers and damage from debris...|$|R
