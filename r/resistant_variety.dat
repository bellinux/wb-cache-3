When Brazil was hit by a frost in the 1970s, world market coffee prices soared. The Philippines became a member of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{specific}} variety of cocoa that shows resistant to Phytophthora infections {{and the establishment}} and utilization of <b>resistant</b> <b>variety</b> will be most likely depends on the region. Numerous breeding programs have been established worldwide in order to screen and test for local hybrids for disease resistant of Phytophthora spp. For example, a study in Cameroon assessed the performance of local cocoa cultivars (the southern and northern Cameroon cultivar) compared to the local and international gene bank cultivars. The local genebank cultivar consisted of F1 hybrid of Upper Amazon X Trinidad, and an international cultivar from Papua New Guinea, and Latin America were provided through International Cocoa Genebank, Trinidad. Based on the information provided by farmers and leaf disc test to assess <b>resistant</b> <b>variety,</b> the local cultivars selected from farmers field showed some resistant to P. megakarya compared to other varieties. Thus, {{it was concluded that}} there are some potential resistant varieties available in this area. In addition, some molecular work on developing resistant varieties to black pod is being done by CEPLAC (Executive Plan of Cocoa Farming) agency in Brazil [...] and hopefully more breeding program focusing on black pod resistant will be established and produced commercialized resistant varieties.|$|E

40|$|SCN-resistant soybean {{varieties}} {{reduce the}} amount of SCN reproduction that occurs when soybeans are grown. But if <b>resistant</b> soybean <b>varieties</b> are grown repeatedly, an SCN population capable of reproducing readily on the <b>resistant</b> <b>varieties</b> can develop. This is because <b>resistant</b> <b>varieties</b> are not immune; they allow some low level of SCN reproduction. The possibility of SCN populations building up on <b>resistant</b> <b>varieties</b> is especially a concern because almost all <b>resistant</b> soybean <b>varieties</b> have SCN resistance genes from the soybean breeding line PI 88788 (see article on newly published list of SCN-resistant soybean varieties for 2007 in this issue) ...|$|R
40|$|Seven <b>resistant</b> <b>varieties</b> of sweetpotato were {{compared}} with three susceptible varieties in field trials and laboratory bioassays and showed that resistance was an active process rather than an escape mechanism, as field <b>resistant</b> <b>varieties</b> also had reduced root damage and oviposition compared with susceptible varieties in the laboratory. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) of root surface and epidermal extracts showed significant variation in the concentration of hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, and quinic acid esters of caffeic and coumaric acid, with higher concentrations correlated with resistance. All compounds were synthesized to enable their positive identification. Octadecyl coumarate and octadecyl caffeate applied {{to the surface of}} susceptible varieties in laboratory bioassays reduced feeding and oviposition, as observed on roots of <b>resistant</b> <b>varieties,</b> and therefore are implicated in weevil resistance. Segregating populations from breeding programs can use these compounds to identify trait loci for resistance and enable the development of <b>resistant</b> <b>varieties...</b>|$|R

50|$|Since most {{sugar beet}} seed came from Europe, the Americans asked their {{suppliers}} to develop blight-resistant beet lines.

50|$|The {{best way}} to manage SDS is with a <b>{{resistant}}</b> <b>variety.</b> One issue is that most resistant varieties are only partially resistant so yield reductions may still occur.

Aside from resistance, the only other ways to control SDS are management practices.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{management}} practice for controlling Fusarium crown rot of wheat {{is to use}} resistant varieties.

A few of the resistant wheat varieties include 2-49, Sunco, Kukri, Brundage, Gene, Weatherford, Madson, Temple, and Tubbs. Tolerance still allows the host to become infected by the pathogen, but it provides the host with the ability to withstand the infection and produce an acceptable yield.|$|E

50|$|Barley {{varieties}} with {{resistance to}} loose smut are also commercially available.

Research has also been done to use radio frequency heating to treat seed.|$|E

The final cross was made in 1956, but it took another ten years for the variety to be tested and multiplied before it was recommended by the National Institute of Agricultural Botany in 1966.

5000|$|Cultural {{practices}} {{not only}} {{reduce the incidence}} of disease but also allow for better use of chemical control. [...] If the disease is not causing much damage, cultural control alone may be sufficient. Choosing a <b>resistant</b> <b>variety</b> of plant is an effective method of minimizing the damage of P. megakarya. Breeding for resistance for either P. palmivora or P. megakarya will increase the plant's resistance to both pathogens simultaneously. Removal of infected plant parts reduces sporangial inoculum and is an effective cultural control. Weeding reduces the humidity of the surrounding air which is unfavorable for the production of sporangia. Frequently harvesting the pods reduces the amount of sporangial inoculum. Another form of cultural control is the burning of the pod husk piles to destroy additional sources of chlamydospores and sporangia. These cultural practices can limit disease caused by P. megakarya significantly.|$|E
50|$|Gibberella zeae, {{also known}} {{by the name of}} its anamorph Fusarium graminearum, is a plant {{pathogen}} which causes fusarium head blight, a devastating disease on wheat and barley. The pathogen is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year. Infection causes shifts in the amino acid composition of wheat, resulting in shriveled kernels and contaminating the remaining grain with mycotoxins, mainly deoxynivalenol, which inhibits protein biosynthesis; and zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin. These toxins cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock, and are harmful to humans through contaminated food. Despite great efforts to find resistance genes against F. graminearum, no completely <b>resistant</b> <b>variety</b> is currently available. Research on the biology of F. graminearum is directed towards gaining insight into more details about the infection process and reveal weak spots in the life cycle of this pathogen to develop fungicides that can protect wheat from scab infection.|$|E
50|$|There {{are only}} a couple ways to manage Colletotrichum trifolii. The first way is to start {{scouting}} right away in early summer. If this pathogen is found in a field rotate crops in the field away from forage crops {{for at least two}} year. Another method of management is planting <b>resistant</b> <b>varieties.</b> It is recommended to plant only varieties with a minimum moderate resistant rating but if Colletotrichum trifolii has been a problem in the past only plant highly <b>resistant</b> <b>varieties.</b> The last management tactic is to delay planting until after Colletotrichum trifolii is normally a problem. This means waiting until late summer, around August, doing this allows the plants to become a good stand during late summer and fall while escaping most of the time when the pathogen is prevalent. This method is not very practical especially with the <b>resistant</b> <b>varieties</b> of today.|$|R
