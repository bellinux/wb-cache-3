40|$|<b>Rugates</b> are optical {{structures}} {{that have a}} sinusoidal index of refraction (harmonic gradient-index field). As their discrete high/ low index filter counterparts, {{they can be used}} as narrow rejection band filters. However, since <b>rugates</b> do not have abrupt interfaces, they tend to have a smaller absorption, hence deliver a higher in band reflectivity. The absence of sharp interfaces makes <b>rugates</b> even more desirable for high-energy narrow band reflectors. In this application, the lack of a sharp interface at the maximum internal standing wave electric field results in higher breakdown strengths. Our method involves fabricating <b>rugates,</b> with molecular beam epitaxy, on GaAs wafers as an Al(x) Ga(1 -x) As single-crystal film...|$|R

30|$|<b>Rugate</b> {{filters are}} {{one-dimensional}} photonic crystals {{based on a}} smooth variation of the refractive index along {{the depth of the}} structure which results in a photonic bandgap (PBG) [1]. Unlike distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR), <b>rugate</b> filters display a single reflectivity band without harmonics or sidelobes. Thanks to this feature, <b>rugate</b> filters with complex optical response and multiple PBG can be fabricated by superimposing multiple refractive index profiles [1 – 3]. However, these filters are difficult to fabricate because the smooth variation of the refractive index is challenging and requires complex equipment. An interesting method for fabricating <b>rugate</b> filters is by means of electrochemically etched materials such as porous silicon (pSi). In porous materials, the refractive index depends on the porosity of the layer. Thus, pSi <b>rugate</b> filters have been fabricated thanks to the ease of porosity modulation by adjusting the electrochemical etching conditions [4 – 6]. Thanks to the porous nature of the resulting pSi <b>rugate</b> filters, these optical devices have been exploited for the development of highly sensitive detectors [7 – 12].|$|E

However, the production of <b>Rugate</b> filters is crucial since they need to be produced in a continuously process with two depositon sources running simultaneously. Therefore, process stability as well as process control is important. In the present paper, we report about the deposition of <b>Rugate</b> filters by radio frequency magnetron sputtering.

40|$|Carbon/porous silicon {{composite}} <b>rugate</b> filters, {{for use as}} end-of service-life indicators in {{gas mask}} filters, are more capable of increased sensitivity to volatile organic chemical vapors than porous silicon sensors alone. Compositional variations of the carbon layer within these composite materials have not been well studied. At low carbon content, the carbonized surface will not effectively mimic the active carbon used in gas mask filters. At high carbon content, there is increased noise and a broader, less intense <b>rugate</b> stop band, reducing the signal to noise level of the sensor response. The focus of this thesis is the optimization of the carbon layer in the carbon/porous silicon composite <b>rugate</b> filters. To accomplish this, porous silicon <b>rugate</b> filters were etched and then carbonized using varying concentrations of the poly(furfuryl alcohol) precursor. Variations in the carbon layer were then analyzed via spectral analysis, elemental analysis, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. At concentrations greater than 50 % furfuryl alcohol there is minimal difference observed in the carbon layer on the porous silicon surface. Samples were also shown to have a minimal increase in sensitivity at concentrations greater than 50 % furfuryl alcohol, and an increased signal-to- noise with increased furfuryl alcohol concentration.

In particular, <b>rugate</b> filters are nanostructured resonant optical structures based on porous silicon, which have been often exploited in biosensing thanks to high sensitivity, low limit of detection, and low-cost and straightforward fabrication. In this work we study the immunoaffinity interaction between Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and its specific antibody anti-BSA as model system for immunosensing applications of <b>rugate</b> filters as label-free transducers. Porous silicon <b>rugate</b> filters with high-reflectivity and good reproducibility operating in three specific regions of the visible spectrum (namely, red, green, and blue) are fabricated by electrochemically etching of p++ silicon wafer in HF-ethanol solutions using computer-controlled sinusoidal current-density waveform. <b>Rugate</b> filters features good Q factors (about 30), thus envisaging that high sensitivity can be achieved for biosensor applications. An immobilization procedure using APTES (3 -Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane) as linker is optimized to covalently bind biomolecules to the nanostructured pSi surface. BSA is then covalently immobilized on the aminosilanized surface for a competitive immunoassay with BSA antibody.

It also allows depositing ternary compounds such as SixNyOz or AlxNyOz using mixtures of different reactive gases such as oxygen and nitrogen. Gradient layers with varying composition and refractive index in growth direction can be obtained by changing the gas mixing ratio during the deposition. In the paper the application of this new technology to fabricate antireflective (AR) coatings and <b>rugate</b> filters is reported.
