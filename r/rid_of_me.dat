5|$|Harvey {{began her}} career in 1988 when she joined local band Automatic Dlamini as a vocalist, guitarist, and {{saxophone}} player. The band's frontman, John Parish, would become her long-term collaborator. In 1991, she formed an eponymous trio and subsequently began her professional career. The trio released two studio albums, Dry (1992) and <b>Rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> (1993) before disbanding, after which Harvey continued as a solo artist. Since 1995, she has released a further nine studio albums with collaborations from various musicians including John Parish, former bandmate Rob Ellis, Mick Harvey, and Eric Drew Feldman and has also worked extensively with record producer Flood.|$|E
5|$|Among the accolades she has {{received}} are the 2001 and 2011 Mercury Prize for Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea (2000) and Let England Shake (2011) respectively—the only artist to have been awarded the prize twice—eight Brit Award nominations, seven Grammy Award nominations and two further Mercury Prize nominations. Rolling Stone awarded her 1992's Best New Artist and Best Singer Songwriter and 1995's Artist of the Year, and listed <b>Rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>Me,</b> To Bring You My Love (1995) and Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. In 2011, she was awarded for Outstanding Contribution To Music at the NME Awards. In June 2013, she was awarded an MBE for services to music.|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided {{it did not}} [...] "infringe on {{the integrity of the}} roster or of the season", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum — and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know." [...] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.|$|E

500|$|Island (PolyGram) {{signed the}} trio amid a major label bidding war in mid-1992, and in December 1992 the trio {{travelled}} to Cannon Falls, Minnesota in the United States {{to record the}} follow-up to Dry with producer Steve Albini. Prior to recording with Albini, the band recorded a second session with John Peel on 22 September and recorded a version of Bob Dylan's [...] "Highway 61 Revisited," [...] and two new songs [...] "Me Jane" [...] and [...] "Ecstasy." [...] The recording sessions with Albini took place at Pachyderm Recording Studio and resulted in the band's major label debut <b>Rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> in May 1993. Rolling Stone wrote that it [...] "is charged with aggressive eroticism and rock fury. It careens from blues to goth to grunge, often {{in the space of}} a single song." [...] The album was promoted by two singles, [...] "50ft Queenie" [...] and [...] "Man-Size", as well as tours of the United Kingdom in May and of the United States in June, continuing there during the summer.|$|E
500|$|However, {{during the}} American {{leg of the}} tour, {{internal}} friction started to form between {{the members of the}} trio. Deborah Frost, writing for Rolling Stone, noticed [...] "an ever widening personal gulf" [...] between the band members, and quoted Harvey as saying [...] "It makes me sad. I wouldn't have got here without them. I needed them back then – badly. But I don't need them anymore. We all changed as people." [...] Despite the tour's personal downsides, footage from live performances was compiled and released on the long-form video Reeling with PJ Harvey (1993). The band's final tour was to support U2 in August 1993, after which the trio officially disbanded. In her final appearance on American television in September 1993 on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Harvey performed a solo version of [...] "Rid of Me." [...] As <b>Rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> sold substantially more copies than Dry, 4-Track Demos, a compilation album of demos for the album was released in October and inaugurated her career as a solo artist. In early 1994, it was announced that U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, had become her manager.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana {{ultimately}} chose Albini {{to record}} its third album. [...] Albini {{had a reputation}} as a principled and opinionated individual in the American independent music scene. [...] While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials, Cobain told Request magazine in 1993, [...] "For the most part I wanted to work with him because he happened to produce two of my favorite records, which were Surfer Rosa [...] and Pod [...]" [...] Inspired by those albums, Cobain wanted to utilize Albini's technique of capturing the natural ambiance of a room via the usage and placement of several microphones, something previous Nirvana producers had been averse to trying. [...] Months before the trio had even approached Albini about the recording, rumors circulated that he was slated to record the album. [...] Albini sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying involvement, only to get a call from Nirvana's management a few days later about the project. [...] Although he considered the group to be [...] "R.E.M. with a fuzzbox" [...] and [...] "an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound", Albini told Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad he accepted because he felt sorry for the band members, whom he perceived to be [...] "the same sort of people as all the small-fry bands I deal with", at the mercy of their record company. [...] Before the start of recording sessions, the band sent Albini a tape of the demos it had made in Brazil. [...] In return, Albini sent Cobain a copy of the PJ Harvey album <b>Rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>Me</b> to give him an idea of the acoustics at the studio where they would record.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{their many}} {{disagreements}} Brooke and Churchill held an affection for each other. After one fierce clash Churchill told {{his chief of}} staff and military adviser, Sir Hastings Ismay, that he did not think he could continue to work any longer with Brooke because [...] "he hates me. I can see hatred looking from his eyes." [...] Brooke responded to Ismay: “Hate him? I don't hate him. I love him. But the first time I tell him that I agree with him when I don't will be the time to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> for then I can be no more use to him." [...] When Churchill was told this he murmured, ”Dear Brookie.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. [...] In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, so I understand {{if you want to}} get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> [...] In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but maybe you are not aware of it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E
2500|$|Bow won {{an evening}} gown {{and a silver}} trophy, and the {{publisher}} committed to help her [...] "gain a role in films", but nothing happened. Bow's father told her to [...] "haunt" [...] Brewster's office (located in Brooklyn) until {{they came up with}} something. [...] "To get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> or maybe they really meant to (give me) all the time and were just busy", Bow was introduced to director Christy Cabanne, who cast her in Beyond the Rainbow, produced late 1921 in New York City and released February 19, 1922. Bow did five scenes and impressed Cabanne with true theatrical tears, but was cut from the final print. [...] "I was sick to my stomach," [...] she recalled and thought her mother was right about the movie business.|$|E
60|$|I had {{no doubt}} that this change of tone in Corbridge was {{intended}} to produce in <b>me</b> a feeling <b>of</b> security, that they might thus <b>rid</b> themselves <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> But, though I saw through his purpose, the man's words encouraged <b>me.</b> <b>Of</b> course there must be a good deal of doubt about the German's powers; and, after all, there might be no cause whatever for our anxieties.|$|R

2500|$|In 1970 Clyde Packer became joint {{managing}} director of Nine Network with his father, Frank. Clyde later recalled: [...] "t was a very equitable arrangement ... I had the responsibility {{and he had the}} authority". Late in the next year Clyde Packer launched A Current Affair on the Nine network, with Mike Willesee hosting. In 1972, Willesee organised for A Current Affair to have an on-air interview with then-union leader, Bob Hawke, during an industrial dispute. When Frank heard of the arrangement he vetoed the decision to allow Hawke on his network, undermining Clyde's authority. Willesee later declared: [...] "You can't run a current affairs program, as you couldn't run a serious newspaper, and have people tell you you can't have the leader of the Trade Union movement". Packer resigned his posts at the Nine Network and ACP, and later reflected on the split: [...] "I suspect my father was as glad to get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> as I was to get rid of him".|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{things are}} {{different}} throughout the game if the player is playing as a neutral character. For example, the letter from Blackmore is to Cory, not Torque, telling him Torque doesn't really love him. During the scene when Torque sees Killjoy on his TV, Killjoy reminds Torque that Blackmore had manipulated Cory. When the helicopter attacks, it is piloted by Jordan, and in the drowning pool, Torque fights Copperfield. Later, Blackmore reveals that he gave Cory spiked drugs prior to Cory's murder of Malcolm and subsequent suicide. In the final battle, neither Blackmore nor Torque is able to win, and when they approach one another they are repelled away from touching. Blackmore points out [...] "Looks like we're going {{to play this game}} a while longer. I couldn't change you, and you couldn't get <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> The ties that bind, they'll keep us connected, but apart. And I'll be right here, standing over your shoulder." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Pete lasted {{in the show}} for eight years, and was eventually written out in 1993 when the writers felt that the character {{had come to a}} natural end. There was initially talk of Pete getting back together with his ex-wife Kathy, but it was felt {{that it would have been}} a retrogressive step, and it was dismissed. The character was killed off-screen in December 1993 and brought back to Walford to be buried. The press reported at the time that Pete was killed-off because he spoke negatively about EastEnders in the press following his axing. There was also speculation that he had not got along with Gillian Taylforth, who played his ex-wife Kathy. Dean commented, [...] "When they wrote me out of EastEnders, they said they had run out of storylines. I was a naughty boy and said if the wheel falls off the cart, get rid of the cart. But they got <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> not the scriptwriters [...] What gets me is the way it was done. It's all politics and backstabbing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E
