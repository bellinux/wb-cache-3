5|$|At 01:00 on 25 April the British ships {{stopped at}} sea, and thirty-six <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> towed by twelve steamers {{embarked}} {{the first six}} companies, two each from the 9th, 10th and 11th Battalions. At 02:00 a Turkish sentry reported seeing ships moving at sea, and at 02:30 the report was sent to 9th Division's headquarters. At 02:53 the ships headed towards the peninsula, continuing until 03:30 when the larger ships stopped. With 50 yards (46m) to go, the <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> continued using only their oars.|$|E

It was {{a strong}} male, and it towed two <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> and two steamboats as far as Montrose {{and then to the}} Firth of Forth. After a struggle that lasted all night, the harpoon lines broke and the whale escaped.|$|E

5|$|Birdwood {{planned to}} arrive off the {{peninsula}} after the moon had set, {{with the first}} troops landing at 03:30, an hour before dawn. He declined the offer of an old merchant ship, loaded with troops, being deliberately grounded at Gaba Tepe. Instead, the troops were to travel in naval and merchant ships, transferring to <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> towed by small steamboats to make the assault.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} months small {{passenger}} ferries travel between Tuckton and Mudeford Spit via the town quay. Another ferry crosses the Stour between Wick and the Quay just below Tuckton Bridge. This ferry was running before the bridge was built in 1882 and was then, the only crossing below Iford. Another ferry service operates across the harbour entrance from Mudeford Sandbank to Mudeford Quay. This ferry was operated by <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> until the 1960s; payment being {{at the discretion of}} the passenger.|$|E
5|$|The lake is {{well known}} for trout fishing from its banks and the fleet of 18 <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> for hire. The suction tanks which {{originally}} supplied water to the steam boilers for the pumping engines are now used as rearing pools for the fish before they are transferred into the lake. On average 50,000 trout are reared at Blagdon each year by Bristol Water to stock this and surrounding lakes such as Chew Valley Lake and the Barrow Tanks.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{navigation}} being closed, {{a guide to}} Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired, and fishing could be enjoyed. The boats were hired out by a plumber called William Port, and his business continued to prosper until 1912, when his boathouse burned down. <b>Rowing</b> <b>boats</b> were also available for hire at Coultershaw and Fittleworth. Another book called A New Oarsman's Guide, published in 1896, suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun, a distance of , when there was sufficient water. By that time, none of the locks were workable, and boats had to be carried around them.|$|E
5|$|In early May Cochrane was escorting {{a convoy}} from Cagliari to Leghorn. On 11May a ship {{which turned out}} to be the 6-gun {{privateer}} Intrépide was spotted capturing one of the merchant ships in the convoy, at which point Cochrane chased the Intrépide and forced her to surrender. Three days later, as the convoy passed the island of Montecristo, five <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> emerged from one of the island's coves and captured two of the rearmost merchant ships. Cochrane immediately gave chase, and recaptured them early the next morning. He was then given a free hand to raid enemy shipping in the area, and captured seven or eight vessels that June and July, including the 10-gun privateer Asuncion off Bastia on 25June and the privateer Constitution off Caprea on 19 July. On 22September he captured a large Neapolitan vessel and, on bringing her into Port Mahon, discovered that the Spanish had taken notice of his depredations and were preparing a frigate to capture Speedy.|$|E
5|$|On {{their way}} in, the <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> had become mixed up. The 11th Battalion {{grounded}} {{to the north}} of Ari Burnu point, while the 9th Battalion hit the point or just south of it, together with most of the 10th Battalion. The plan was for them to cross the open ground and assault the first ridge line, but they were faced with a hill that came down almost to the water line, and there was confusion while the officers tried to work out their location, under small arms fire from the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, who had a platoon of between eighty and ninety men at Anzac Cove and a second platoon in the north around the Fisherman's Hut. The third platoon was in a reserve position on the second ridge. They also manned the Gaba Tepe strong-point, equipped with two obsolescent multi-barrelled Nordenfelt machine-guns, and several smaller posts in the south.|$|E

5|$|At 12:30 two {{companies}} of the Canterbury Battalion landed and {{were sent to}} support the Aucklands, who had now been ordered back to Plugge's Plateau, and were forming on {{the left of the}} 3rd Brigade. The Canterbury companies moved into the line on the Aucklands' left, waiting {{for the rest of their}} brigade to land. However, between 12:30 and 16:00 not one infantry or artillery formation came ashore. The ships carrying the New Zealanders were in the bay, but the steamers and <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> were being used to take the large numbers of wounded to the hospital ship. The transports with the 4th Australian Brigade on board were still well out at sea and not due to land until that evening. The landings recommenced around 16:30 when the Wellington Battalion came ashore, followed by the Otago Battalion around 17:00, who were put into the line beside the Aucklanders. Next to land were the two other Canterbury companies, who were sent north to Walker's Ridge to extend the corps left flank. Events ashore now forced a change in the disembarkation schedule, and at 17:50 orders were issued for the 4th Australian Brigade to start landing to boost the defence. It would take until the next day for the complete brigade to come ashore. The transports carrying both divisions' artillery batteries had been forced further out to sea by Turkish artillery fire, and were unable to land.|$|E
5|$|Having {{escaped the}} {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of ways (including through doors and out of windows), some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school. However, some were able to use <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and the fire in the exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records. Nine of the victims were found in the exam room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the victims were female students, one a male student, and one a male member of staff. All of the students killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass. All the victims were classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed that the male student was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol. A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's head with his forefinger. The names of the other victims were withheld by police.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems likely}} that the Loddon was used for {{navigation}} in the past, although the details are not clear. There is circumstantial evidence in the naming of Barge Lane, which runs beside the river at Swallowfield, and of some of the pools by the mills. The pools at Arborfield Mill and Sindlesham Mill are both called Lock Pool. More concrete evidence is provided by the number of boat houses marked on old maps, including two on the Arborfield estate, one of which still exists, one near Mill Lane at Sindlesham, and another at Woodley, near to Colmansmoor Lane. Other evidence includes postcards in the collection at Reading Local Studies Library, which show a punt at Twyford and <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> at Sindlesham Mill and Arborfield Hall. Old postcards also show that The George public house at Winnersh used to have <b>rowing</b> <b>boats</b> on the river available for hire. There was a boathouse on the opposite bank to the public house, one of eleven on the river around the 1900s.|$|E
25|$|Whale hunting {{equipment}} is legally restricted to hooks (blásturkrókur), ropes, mønustingari (a specially-designed Faroese knife {{to cut the}} whale's spine, so it dies within seconds) and assessing-poles for measurement. When the men hear the news about the grindaboð (that a whale pod has been discovered near land), fishermen already at sea in their boats sail towards the whales and wait for other boats to arrive. In older times the boats which were used to the whale hunt were the traditional wooden <b>rowing</b> <b>boats.</b> In modern times they use boats with engines; these boats can be wooden boats or other types of boats like fiberglass boats. In the village of Vágur however they have preserved ten old whaling boats, which are wooden <b>rowing</b> <b>boats,</b> the oldest one dates back to 1873. These boats are still in use but mostly for pleasure trips. Most of the boats used in whale hunts are small modern fishing boats. In Vágur equipment like ropes and hooks (for the whales blowhole) are kept in boat houses and only taken out from their place when there is grindaboð in the island of Suðuroy.|$|E
