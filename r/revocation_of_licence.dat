5000|$|The Act {{provides}} {{that it is}} a criminal offense to possess or use a printing press without a licence granted by the Home Affairs Minister. The Minister is given [...] "absolute discretion" [...] in the granting and <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences,</b> and can also restrict or ban outright publications that is likely to endanger national security interest or create social unrest. Should one possess or use an unlicensed printing press, he may be imprisoned for up to three years and/or fined up to RM20,000.

50|$|Toronto also {{enacted a}} bylaw to {{restrict}} intimate erotic lap dancing in August 1995 to prohibit physical contact, including touching, between patrons and attendants, {{with a maximum}} fine <b>of</b> $50,000, and <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences.</b> Adult entertainment parlours were unsuccessful in having this quashed by the courts. In Ont. Adult Entertainment Bar Assn. v. Toronto, 26 O.R. (3d) 257 1995, it was held that the bylaw was enacted for valid objectives relating to business regulation, including health, safety and the prevention of crime, and did not usurp the Government's jurisdiction over criminal law. The court {{did not believe that}} the bylaw violated dancers' freedom of expression. Close-contact dancing was not a constitutionally protected right. This was upheld at the appellate level.|$|R
5000|$|On July 5, 2017, Cartt {{reported}} via a Rogers representative that G4 {{would shut}} down on August 31, 2017, {{and that it}} will not be replaced with a new service. The representative cited [...] "the current competitive television landscape" [...] and a desire to focus on Rogers' [...] "core specialty portfolio". The CRTC approved the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> G4's <b>licence</b> in August 2017. By coincidence, G4's Canadian iteration outlasted both its American mother network and Esquire Network, G4's intended replacement, which ended all operations on June 27, 2017.|$|R
50|$|The new {{operation}} traded as United Buses using Greenock and District Omnibuses' 'o' licence with vehicles on hire from ABC Taxis {{which also has}} an 'o' licence and capitalised on the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the operating <b>licences</b> held by local operator John Walker to move onto four routes previously served by his group of companies.|$|R
50|$|In May 2008 he gave an {{interview}} to The West Australian which resulted in calls for the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> his lobbyist's <b>licence.</b> Halden had indicated that Public Service officers had occasionally been indiscreet and provided him with confidential governmental information. On 3 June 2008, the matter was referred to the Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission.|$|R
50|$|On February 20, 2013, Way of Life Broadcasting has {{requested}} the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> its broadcasting <b>licence</b> for CJIV-FM, as of September 1, 2013, as they contended {{that it does}} not have the listenership to justify operating the station. Consequently, it will cease broadcasting by no later than August 31, 2013, the expiry date for the licence.|$|R
50|$|Gun law in Kenya is {{specified}} in the Firearms Act (Cap. 114) Laws of Kenya. The Chief Licensing Officer (CLO) has discretion to award, deny, or revoke firearms licenses. Applicants must be 12 {{years of age or}} older, pass a stringent background check for criminal activity, mental health and domestic violence, and state genuine reason(s) for their need to privately own and carry a firearm. Checks are regularly repeated, with failure to pass resulting in immediate <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>licence.</b> Once licensed to own a gun, no additional permit is required to carry a concealed firearm.|$|R
50|$|Many LEAs {{are also}} {{involved}} in the monitoring or application of regulations and codes of practice. See, for example, Australian Commercial Television Code of Practice, building code, and code enforcement. Monitoring of the application of regulations and codes of practice is not normally considered law enforcement. However, the consistent non-compliance by a subject with regulations or codes of practice may result in the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>licence</b> for the subject to operate, and operating without a licence is typically illegal. Also, the failure to apply codes of practice can impact other subjects’ safety and life, which can also be illegal.|$|R
5000|$|The Canadian Museum of History {{relocated}} {{nearby in}} 1989, and politicians in Hull {{expressed concern about}} the city's image. Official committees in Hull weighed the job creation and profitability of Hull's nightlife, against the costs of policing and cleanup. A [...] "zero tolerance" [...] campaign began in 1990, which involved undercover policing, the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> liquor <b>licences,</b> and a public awareness campaign to inform young drinkers in Ontario that disorderly behaviour would not be tolerated in Hull. Soon, police in Hull were aggressively towing illegally parked cars, and individuals caught urinating in public were fined as much as $400.|$|R
50|$|Gatecrasher's Broad Street Club {{was shut}} down on 31 October 2015 {{the result of a}} {{stabbing}} and alleged brawl involving security staff. This was the second closing in three months. The victim was stabbed in the leg and security staff were accused of using makeshift weapons in a brawl with a group of customers. Superintendent Andrew Beard, of West Midlands Police, said the force would be asking for the full <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>licence</b> at a full hearing on 25 November 2015. On November 25, Birmingham City Council revoked Gatecrasher's licence to operate. The Deltic Group is in discussions with Gatecrasher about taking over operations of the venue.|$|R
50|$|On 13 December 2006, strong rumours resurfaced {{that the}} FFA was {{considering}} the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the Knights' <b>licence</b> {{to compete in}} the A-League. It quickly became clear that, with five weeks remaining in the current season, the FFA fully intended to reclaim the licence from the Knights. The FFA had continued to express angst at low attendance numbers, poor on-field performance and the lack of domestically developed players.|$|R
50|$|Besigye's {{campaign}} came to {{an abrupt}} halt on 14 November when he was arrested on charges of treason and rape. The treason charges pertained to his alleged links to the PRA and the 20-year-old northern Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army rebellion. The rape charge related to a 1997 accusation by the daughter of a deceased friend. His arrest sparked riots in Kampala and around the country. Museveni was accused of trumping up charges against his main rival in an attempt to discredit Besigye or even prevent him from standing in the election. Both the local and international community came down heavily against Museveni's administration, urging it to release Besigye on bail. The government reacted by banning all public rallies, demonstrations, assemblies or seminars related to the trial of Besigye. It further barred the media from discussing the trial, threatening media houses with the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> their <b>licences</b> should they refuse to heed the ban.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{the release}} of Ofcom's findings, Press TV {{launched}} a campaign against Bahari and Ofcom. Bahari was accused of being [...] "an MI6 contact person". Press TV called Ofcom's ruling [...] "part of an anti-Iranian campaign," [...] and noted [...] "A quick look at senior decision makers at Ofcom demonstrates that the regulator is mostly made up of former Channel 4 and BBC executives, {{some of whom are}} well-linked to and influenced by powerful pro-Israeli politicians." [...] Press TV's failure to pay a £100,000 fine for showing Bahari's 'confession' was connected with the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> Press TV's <b>licence</b> to broadcast in the UK, via satellite, in January 2012.|$|R
5000|$|CJRU {{is governed}} by a nine-member board of {{directors}} with includes three representative of the student body, three representatives of Ryerson University's administration, one representative of the station's volunteers and two directors, chosen by the board, to represent the community at large. The board's chair is Gerd Hauck, the dean of Ryerson's Faculty of Communication & Design. Ted Rogers School of Management dean Steven Murphy and Radio Television Arts chair Charles Falzon also sit on the board {{on behalf of the}} university, [...] while the president of the Ryerson Students Union sits as one of the student representatives. While two individuals intervening at the CRTC hearing opposed the station's application alleging too few community directors, the station responded by telling the CRTC that [...] "it was appropriate to restrict membership in this case to avoid governance problems such as those that led to the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> CKLN-FM’s <b>licence,</b> where a second competing board of directors was elected by members". The CRTC agreed in its decision that [...] "the proposed governance model is appropriate and provides for balanced representation from students, the community, the university and volunteers".|$|R
2500|$|While {{some people}} feel {{economic}} rights ought to be included, jurisprudence in this area appears not to support this view. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that [...] "The ability to generate business revenue by one's chosen means is not a right that is protected under s. 7 of the Charter." [...] In 2004, Justice Blair, writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal in Mussani v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario noted that [...] "the weight of authority {{is that there is}} no constitutional right to practise a profession unfettered by the applicable rules which and standards which regulate that profession", before going on to conclude that the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> Mr. Mussani's <b>licence</b> to practice medicine did not deprive him of life, liberty, or the security of his person. The courts have also held that [...] "salary or compensation (in whatever form they may take), are in my view a purely economic right, and are not protected by section 7." ...|$|R
50|$|Appointees to the Order of Canada {{can have}} their {{membership}} revoked if the order's advisory council determines a member's actions have brought dishonour to the order. As of 2016, seven people {{have been removed from}} the Order of Canada: Alan Eagleson, David Ahenakew, T. Sher Singh, Steve Fonyo, Garth Drabinsky, Conrad Black, and Ranjit Chandra. Eagleson was removed from the order after being jailed for fraud in 1998; Ahenakew was removed in 2005, after being convicted of promoting anti-Semitic hatred in 2002; Singh was removed after the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> his law <b>licence</b> for professional misconduct; Fonyo was removed due to numerous criminal convictions; Drabinky was removed in 2012 after being found guilty of fraud and forgery in Ontario; and Chandra was removed in 2015 for committing research fraud. The formal removal process is performed by the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada, though it can be initiated by any citizen of Canada.|$|R

5000|$|... 2011 : The double-diffuser {{concept is}} banned, with teams {{requiring}} {{the use of}} simple, single-piece diffusers. The [...] "F-duct" [...] system pioneered by McLaren is banned (in conjunction with banning shark fins from being connected to the rear wing). Adjustable front wings have also been banned. Gearboxes must last for 5 race weekends, but for the season each driver has one penalty free gearbox change at their disposal. Driver adjustable rear wing, known as DRS (drag reduction system) introduced to help overtaking. Can be freely used in practice and qualifying, but in the race only when within 1 second of the next car by the detection zone, and only activated in the activation zone. DRS wing must immediately close under braking, and DRS is banned in the first 2 laps of each race, plus when a track is declared wet. 107% qualifying rule re-introduced following concerns about new teams pace. Teams agree to re-introduce KERS, with minimum car weight increasing by twenty kilograms to offset {{the weight of the}} KERS device. Sporting regulations amended to clear up last-lap safety car and qualifying in-lap procedures. Drivers are also warned to be examples of road safety when driving in public following Lewis Hamilton being pulled over following the 2010 Australian Grand Prix; FIA President Jean Todt suggests a policy similar to the NFL Personal Conduct code for suspension or <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> racing <b>licences.</b> Ban on team orders lifted (although FIA can use disrepute clause for misuse of it).|$|R
5000|$|Hamer purported {{that his}} method is a [...] "Germanic" [...] {{alternative}} to mainstream clinical medicine which he claimed {{is part of}} a Jewish conspiracy to decimate non-Jews. In this Hamer follows the antisemitic [...] "Neue Deutsche Heilkunde" [...] propagated in Nazi Germany. More precisely, he asserted that chemotherapy and morphine are used to [...] "mass murder" [...] Western Civilisation, while such treatment is not used in Israel where nearly no people die of cancer, according to him. He promoted the idea that most oncologists in Germany are Jewish and that [...] "no Jew is treated with chemotherapy in Germany". According to him, hypodermic needles are used during chemotherapy to implant [...] "chips" [...] containing [...] "chambers of poison" [...] that can be activated by satellite to specifically kill patients. He proposeed that the swine flu vaccination campaign of 2009 was also used to mark people with those [...] "chips" [...] and denies the existence of HIV. Hamer also believed that the denial of recognition of his theories and the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> his practitioner's <b>licence</b> is due to a Jewish conspiracy.|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} with the above two examples, European countries {{have tended to be}} somewhat less welcoming. Dudley et al. cite “fierce battles” in France, Germany, Belgium and Italy ([13], p. 493), whilst Hungary’s regulators expelled Uber from the country. In the UK, the picture is more mixed: Uber is now operating in all of the UK’s principal urban areas and the UK government has chosen not to act in response to protests by taxi drivers. As mentioned above, Uber registered with TfL when it commenced London operations in 2012. Whilst the city authorities have not sought since to shut Uber down directly, the relationship has been tempestuous, with TfL attempting unsuccessfully to impose a five-minute wait time before rides could commence, and subsequently succeeding in imposing English-language and topography tests on drivers [13]. London’s concern arises in part from the issue of congestion: analysis of traffic data indicates a considerable growth in the volume of “private hire vehicles”, mirroring a large {{increase in the number of}} licensed drivers ([58], pp. 186 – 188). More recently, various members of TfL’s board have expressed significant misgivings about the company’s conduct, threatening to seek the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> its <b>licence</b> [51]. At the European level, cases in Spain and Belgium were referred up to the European Court of Justice, whose general advocate concluded that Uber is a transport company and not an information company [67], a conclusion which, if ratified by the Court itself, would oblige Uber to comply with national transport legislation.|$|R

50|$|In the {{following}} year emigrated to the United States, where he obtained employment as a hammer maker at Shoemakersville, Pennsylvania. Here he soon began to preach on Sundays while still employed in the factory on weekdays. His earnest, rugged, simple style of oratory made him extremely popular, and at once secured for him a wide reputation. His advocacy of anti-slavery principles, then frowned upon by the Methodist authorities, aroused opposition, and eventually resulted in his trial for heresy and the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> his <b>licence.</b> He continued, however, as an independent preacher and lecturer, and in 1859, having joined the Unitarian Church, became a missionary of that church in Chicago, Illinois working as the first minister-at-large of the First Unitarian Church of Chicago. In 1860 he organized and became pastor of the Unity Church, the second Unitarian church in Chicago. Under his guidance the church grew {{to be one of}} the strongest of that denomination in the West, and Collyer himself came to be looked upon as one of the foremost pulpit orators in the country. During the American Civil War, he was active in the work of the Sanitary Commission. In 1879 he left Chicago and became pastor of the Church of the Messiah, now renamed the Community Church in New York City. Later he brought his old friend, the popular writer and hymnodist, Minot Judson Savage, to assist him in his ministry. In 1883, when he visited Birmingham in England, he engaged Marie Bethell Beauclerc to report and edit his sermons and prayers which were published during the same year. In 1903 Collyer became pastor emeritus. He died in 1912.|$|R
