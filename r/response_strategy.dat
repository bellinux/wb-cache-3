In 1962, both RNoAF and NATO proposed that Banak be expanded to full NATO standards. RNoAF planned that Banak should host a detachment of up to six fighters or fighter-bombers and act as a stopover for fighters, transports and helicopters. The airfield was to stockpile supplies, including fuel and ammunition, for one month of war efforts.

40|$|The {{few studies}} {{investigating}} partners' response behavior in strategic alliances {{often fail to}} provide empirical support for {{a large proportion of}} the relationships they hypothesized. This discrepancy between theory and empirical findings could be attributed to a misconceptualization of <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> as independent from each other. Indeed, <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> could be better conceptualized as a circumplex structure rather than as discrete responses. Whereas the circumplex structure of <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> has been empirically established, it has not yet been taken into account when detecting the effects of potential antecedents on <b>response</b> <b>strategies.</b> A model that accounts for the circumplex structure thus should exhibit superior explanatory power by reducing Type II error. PLS path modeling is particularly suited to substantiate the superiority of such a model, however PLS path modeling as implemented in extant software is not equipped to estimate circumplex structures. Therefore, the objective of the present study is twofold. First, we extend PLS path modeling so that it can handle circumplex structures. Second, building on a circumplex structure of <b>response</b> <b>strategies,</b> we develop and test a model of alliance partners' <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> and key antecedents. The results of a survey of alliance managers corroborate our expectations and demonstrate that non-significant antecedents become significant when accounting for the circumplex structure.

The purpose of this research was to identify the <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> organisations implement to remove the career advancement barriers that exist for women managers, and to determine if these <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> are beneficial or detrimental to women’s career advancement. The research also aimed at determining why certain <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> are successful or detrimental to women’s advancement. The research design chosen was a mixed-method design, and included a quantitative descriptive study and an explanatory study. The data was collected from women at middle and senior management level by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 101 female respondents. The highest ranked career advancement barriers were found to be work-life balance, lack of networking, and excessive modesty. In response, the research results indicated that organisations mostly implement fair performance review processes, flexible working, and equal pay in an attempt to remove career advancement barriers. Appointing women in leadership positions with profit-and-loss responsibility, equal pay, and transparent review processes were found to be the most successful strategies to remove career advancement barriers.

2500|$|Initially, {{the basic}} {{policies}} outlined by President Kennedy in {{a message to}} Congress on March 28, 1961, guided McNamara in the reorientation of the defense program. Kennedy rejected the concept of first-strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the United States and its allies. U.S. arms, he maintained, must constantly be under civilian command and control, and the nation's defense posture had to be [...] "designed to reduce the danger of irrational or unpremeditated general war." [...] The primary mission of U.S. overseas forces, in cooperation with allies, was [...] "to prevent the steady erosion of the Free World through limited wars". Kennedy and McNamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response. The U.S. wanted choices in an emergency other than [...] "inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation", as the president put it. Out of a major review of the military challenges confronting the U.S. initiated by McNamara in 1961 came a decision to increase the nation's [...] "limited warfare" [...] capabilities. These moves were significant because McNamara was abandoning President Dwight D. Eisenhower's policy of massive retaliation {{in favor of a}} flexible <b>response</b> <b>strategy</b> that relied on increased U.S. capacity to conduct limited, non-nuclear warfare.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{evolutionary}} approaches have established that when {{played in a}} large population, players might fail to play the payoff dominant equilibrium strategy and instead {{end up in the}} payoff dominated, risk dominant equilibrium. Two separate evolutionary models both support the idea that the risk dominant equilibrium is more likely to occur. [...] The first model, based on replicator dynamics, predicts that a population is more likely to adopt the risk dominant equilibrium than the payoff dominant equilibrium. The second model, based on best <b>response</b> <b>strategy</b> revision and mutation, predicts that the risk dominant state is the only stochastically stable equilibrium. Both models assume that multiple two-player games are played in a population of N players. The players are matched randomly with opponents, with each player having equal likelihoods of drawing any of the N1 other players. The players start with a pure strategy, G or H, and play this strategy against their opponent. In replicator dynamics, the population game is repeated in sequential generations where subpopulations change based on the success of their chosen strategies. In best response, players update their strategies to improve expected payoffs in the subsequent generations. The recognition of Kandori, Mailath & Rob (1993) and Young (1993) was that if the rule to update one's strategy allows for mutation, and the probability of mutation vanishes, i.e. asymptotically reaches zero over time, the likelihood that the risk dominant equilibrium is reached goes to one, even if it is payoff dominated.|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} navigational strategies across the life span, by testing 8 -year old children to 80 -year old healthy older adults on the 4 on 8 virtual maze (4 / 8 VM). The 4 / 8 VM was previously developed to assess spontaneous navigational strategies, i. e. hippocampal-dependent spatial strategies (navigation by memorizing relationships between landmarks) versus caudate nucleus-dependent <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> (memorizing a series of left and right turns from a given starting position). With the 4 / 8 VM, we previously demonstrated greater fMRI activity and grey matter in the hippocampus of spatial learners relative to response learners. A sample of 599 healthy participants was tested in the current study. Results showed that 84. 4 % of children, 46. 3 % of young adults, and 39. 3 % of older adults spontaneously used spatial strategies (p < 0. 0001). Our results suggest that while children predominantly use spatial strategies, the proportion of participants using spatial strategies decreases across the life span, in favor of <b>response</b> <b>strategies.</b> Factors promoting <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> include repetition, reward and stress. Since <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> can result from successful repetition of a behavioral pattern, we propose {{that the increase in}} <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> is a biological adaptive mechanism that allows for the automatization of behavior such as walking in order to free up hippocampal-dependent resources. However, the downside of this shift from spatial to <b>response</b> <b>strategies</b> occurs if people stop building novel relationships, which occurs with repetition and routine, and thereby stop stimulating their hippocampus. Reduced fMRI activity and grey matter in the hippocampus were shown to correlate with cognitive deficits in normal aging. Therefore, these results have important implications regarding factors involved in healthy and successful aging...|$|R
