40|$|Objective. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{study was}} to compare under in vitro {{conditions}} marginal sealing of 4 different bulk-fill materials composite <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> class II. Methods. Comparative evaluation concerned 4 composites of a bulk-fill type: SonicFill, Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill, Filtek Bulk Fill, and SDR. The study used 30 third molars without caries. In each tooth 4 cavities of class II were prepared. The prepared tooth samples were placed in a 1 % methylene blue solution for 24 [*]h, and after that in each <b>restoration</b> <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> dye penetration along the side walls was evaluated. Results. The highest rating (score 0, no dye penetration) was achieved by 93. 33 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restorations</b> made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SDR material, 90 % <b>of</b> <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> SonicFill system, 86. 66 % <b>of</b> <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composite Filtek Bulk Fill, and 73. 33 % <b>of</b> <b>restorations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill. Conclusion. The performed study showed that bulk-fill flowable or sonic-activated flowable composite restorations have better marginal sealing (lack of discoloration) in comparison with bulk-fill paste-like composite...|$|R
