50|$|R2 <b>register</b> <b>signalling</b> is {{a family}} of {{protocols}} that govern the conveyance of addressing information during the addressing phase and how the call attempt turned out during the disposition phase. Although in the 1960s R2 <b>register</b> <b>signalling</b> was represented by electromechanical devices that could generate multi-frequency audio tones and by electromechanical devices that could detect those audio tones, by the latter 1970s these electromechanical registers also could be represented by digitized PCM audio in DS0 channels of an E1 other than the R2 line signalling DS0 channel in that E1.|$|R
50|$|Line {{signaling}} is a {{class of}} telecommunications signaling protocols. Line signaling is responsible for off-hook, ringing signal, answer, ground start, on-hook unidirectional supervision messaging in each direction from calling party to called party and vice versa. After an off-hook, line <b>signaling</b> initiates <b>register</b> <b>signaling</b> to accomplish the exchange of telephone numbers of called party and in more modern line-signaling protocols, the calling party as well. While <b>register</b> <b>signaling</b> occurs, line signaling remains quiescent unless the calling party goes on-hook or an abnormal cessation of the call occurs, such as due to equipment malfunction or shutdown or due to network outage upstream in that call-attempt's series of spanned trunks.|$|R

In addition to routing Signal's messages, the servers also facilitate {{the discovery of}} contacts who are also <b>registered</b> <b>Signal</b> users and the automatic exchange of users' public keys. By default, Signal's voice and video calls are peer-to-peer. If the caller {{is not in the}} receiver's address book, the call is routed through a server in order to hide the users' IP addresses.

5000|$|<b>Register</b> <b>signaling</b> is {{concerned}} with conveying addressing information, such as the calling and/or called telephone number.

Finally, starting in the second half of the century, address signaling is by DTMF.|$|R
40|$|On-load {{tap changers}} (OLTC) {{are some of}} the main {{transformer}} elements that make voltage adjustment in a power network possible.

5000|$|One unifying {{aspect of}} R2 <b>register</b> <b>signalling</b> {{variants}} {{is that all}} audio tones are combinations of two frequencies. Each pair of two frequencies is called a multi-frequency tone, or MF tone. Each call attempt has an origination end and a termination end, both to the multi-span call {{as well as for}} each span within that multi-span call routing. The origination end is called the outgoing register in R2 parlance. The termination end is called the incoming register in R2 parlance. The outgoing register transmits forward MF tones to the incoming register. The incoming register transmits backward MF tones to the outgoing register. The outgoing register detects backward MF tones arriving from the incoming register. The incoming register detects forward MF tones arriving from the outgoing register. The outgoing register transmits the first signal, but from that point forward the outgoing register merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by the incoming register. (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, the outgoing <b>register's</b> first push <b>signal</b> to the incoming register is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas the incoming <b>register's</b> pull <b>signals,</b> which request information from the outgoing register, are client-server, where the client is the incoming register and the server is the outgoing register.) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{aforementioned}} examples {{relate to}} the cases {{when there is a}} single source of noise. However, noise can originate from several different sources, for example, image pixel generation (photon counting, coherent processing of <b>registered</b> <b>signals)</b> and circuitry (thermal) noise [19]. Then, one deals with a mixed noise, such as mixed additive and impulse noise [26, 27] where impulse noise usually originates from coding/decoding errors at image transmission via communication channels. However, here, we address another type of mixed noise that has SI and SD components. A prominent example is noise in modern imaging sensors namely dark noise, thermal noise, and photon-counting noise [19].|$|R
