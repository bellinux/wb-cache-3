40|$|In practice, design {{cooling load}} {{calculations}} {{are based on}} steady periodic inputs, but histori-cally cooling load procedures have not taken advantage of this fact.

40|$|The radiant {{time series}} method (RTSM) takes {{advantages}} {{of the fact that}} design cooling load calculations are based on steady periodic excitations. The main difference between the RTSM and the other cooling load calculation methods is that the periodic <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> of the RTSM are restricted to calculating the conduction heat gain through building elements under periodic outdoor conditions, which simplifies the computational procedure significantly. It is vital to have a reliable method or procedure to accurately calculate the periodic <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> of various types of walls and roofs. In this study, a procedure, based on the frequency-domain regression (FDR) method, is developed to directly and accurately calculate the outside, across and inside periodic <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> of a multilayer wall or roof from its geometric and thermal properties. At first, a polynomial s-transfer function is established from the frequency characteristics of the wall or roof using the FDR method. The periodic <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> are then generated from the poles and residues of the polynomial s-transfer function. Computational tests show that the FDR method provides an accurate and hopefully better alternative procedure to calculate periodic <b>response</b> <b>factors.</b> Using this procedure, the periodic <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> of various representative wall and roof types are calculated and compared with those calculated by other conventional methods. Some results, particularly of the periodic <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> whose CTF coefficients tabulated in the ASHRAE Handbook are inaccurate, are presented and evaluated.

40|$|International audienceDirect {{analysis}} of geological reference materials {{was performed by}} LA-ICP-MS using two Nd:YAG laser systems operating at 266 nm and 1064 nm.
