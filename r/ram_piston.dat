500|$|The rammerman's {{position}} was of special concern, as ramming {{was considered the}} most dangerous part of loading the gun. The ram was used to first thrust the projectile and then the powder bags into the gun's breech.

None of Iowas rammermen had any training or experience in ramming nonstandard five-bag loads into the guns. Complicating the task, as the rammerman was shoving the powder bags, he was also supposed to simultaneously operate a lever to shut the powder hoist door and lower the powder hoist car.

40|$|Master's thesis in Risk managementDuring well {{drilling}} operation, {{there is a}} possibility of a kick (influx). When a kick is not controlled properly it will become a blow out. This is an uncontrolled and sudden flow of formation fluid that releases from a reservoir through a well bore into surface as a result of pressure difference in formation and well. The kick could flow to surface and create explosions causing fatality, environment damage and loss of asset resulting in high cost. There are procedures and methods to deal with the occurrence of kicks and blowouts in order to control a well flow. Moreover, well barriers should be established and designed based on the characteristics of the reservoir and rock formation. The last line of protection in well barriers is known as Blowout Preventer (BOP). It {{is one of the most}} important barriers to prevent unintentional hydrocarbon release when all well barriers in a well have failed. There are many factors that influence the performance of a BOP. The purpose of this thesis is to determine the criticality of components in BOP related to the redundancies they have during well shut in, stripping, snubbing and BOP testing operation. By knowing the criticality of BOP components, we can assure which components that should be focused on for maintenance and testing. It will also indicate which components that gives redundancy to the BOP during well shut in, stripping, snubbing and BOP testing operation, if one or more components are failed. A literature study is the main work of this thesis. Studying the principal, functions, operations and factors related to drilling activity with respect to the use of BOP. In addition, relevant regulations and standards are also describes to specify the required specification of BOP. The analysis of criticality is done by using risk tools such as reliability block diagram, FMECA, criticality matrix, redundancy and effect table. All of these risk tools complement each other to give the final conclusion of critical component in a BOP. The result of the analysis shows five critical components in a BOP with the prioritization start from shuttle valve (blind shear ram function), blind shear ram (<b>ram</b> <b>piston),</b> flange (BOP stack), gasket (BOP stack) and annular preventer (rubber housing) respectively. In the event of kick and well shut in is initiated, the above critical component is very critical to the safety of personnel. Stripping and snubbing operation also require the critical components to be function properly, but with less critical when well shut in has been done earlier. During BOP testing operation, the critical components might not be critical if it fail as there are many safety measure and procedure for safety...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a modular system for high-resolution microscopy at high hydrostatic pressure. The system consists of a pressurised cell of volume ~ 100 microlitres, a temperature controlled holder, a <b>ram</b> and a <b>piston.</b> We have made each of these components in several versions which can be interchanged to allow {{a wide range of}} applications. Here, we report two pressure cells with pressure ranges 0. 1 - 700 MPa and 0. 1 - 100 MPa, which can be combined with hollow or solid <b>rams</b> and <b>pistons.</b> Our system is designed to work with fluorescent samples (using a confocal or epifluorescence microscope), but also allows for transmitted light microscopy via the hollow <b>ram</b> and <b>piston.</b> The system allows precise control of pressure and temperature [- 20 - 70 C], as well as rapid pressure quenching. We demonstrate its performance and versatility with two applications: time-resolved imaging of colloidal phase transitions caused by pressure changes between 0. 1 MPa and 101 MPa, and imaging the growth of Escherichia coli bacteria at 50 MPa. We also show that the isotropic-nematic phase transition of pentyl-cyanobiphenyl (5 CB) liquid crystal provides a simple, convenient and accurate method for calibrating pressure in the range 0. 1 - 200 MPa...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} ram BOPs of the 1920s {{were simple}} and rugged manual devices with minimal parts. The BOP housing (body) had a vertical well bore and horizontal ram cavity (ram guide chamber). Opposing rams (plungers) in the ram cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded <b>ram</b> shafts (<b>piston</b> rods) {{in the manner}} of a screw jack. Torque from turning the ram shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the rams, coupled to the inner ends of the ram shafts, opened and closed the well bore. Such screw jack type operation provided enough mechanical advantage for rams to overcome downhole pressures and seal the wellbore annulus.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. SPX is {{hydraulic}} company {{located in}} Rockford, Illinois that manufactures high-pressure hydraulic components. They make {{a variety of}} products that include handpumps, hydraulic pumps {{to be used in}} heavy machinery, hydraulic <b>rams</b> and <b>pistons</b> for leveling structures, railroad equipment, cable tools and much more. Our focus for this project is to produce a plan for redesigning the current production floor layout for SPX. To do this we obtained all of the current data for the facility including high-volume part numbers and their routings. After we gained this information we conducted a CORELAP algorithm analysis to determine placement of the departments in the layout. These results were then used to find the optimal layout for the facility and then reanalyze the material flow. Upon comparing the original and revised flow, it was shown that if out improvements were implemented, SPX would save about 15 % on material handling costs each year which translates into about $ 500, 000 a year. We recommend implementation of the revised layout {{due to the fact that}} the return on investment will only take about a year and overall profits will be significantly higher for SPX in the future.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the reduction of}} noise from a pneumatic 18 gauge nail gun. The objectives were to identify the major sources of noise, implement possible noise reduction measures, and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the modifications. Sound measurements were taken according to a procedure that was developed based on the ANSI S 12. 15 - 1992 standard for power tools. Results show that the nail gun was found to have several sources of noise for reduction consideration. Efforts were taken to reduce the two major sources of noise that contributed the highest sound pressure levels. The first major source of noise occurred right after pulling the trigger when the <b>piston</b> <b>ram</b> was forced into front bumper and the second major source was the compressed air exhausting out of the rear of the nail gun. The noise reduction treatments included new bumper materials inside of the nail gun and different types of mufflers on the exhaust. The sound pressure level measurements of the nail gun with mock-up treatments were compared to the baseline measurements to test the effectiveness of the treatments...|$|R
50|$|From an army manual on {{pile driving}} hammers:The initial start {{up of the}} hammer {{requires}} the <b>piston</b> (<b>ram)</b> to be raised {{to a point where}} the trip automatically releases the piston, allowing it to fall by gravity. As the piston falls, it activates the fuel pump, which discharges a metered amount of fuel into the ball pan of the impact block. The falling piston also blocks the exhaust ports, and compression of fuel trapped in the cylinder begins. The compressed air exerts a pre-load force to hold the impact block firmly against the drive cap and pile. At the bottom of the compression stroke, the piston strikes the impact block, atomizing the fuel and starting the pile on its downward movement. In the instant after the piston strikes, the atomized fuel ignites, and the resulting explosion exerts an even greater force on the already moving pile, driving it further into the ground. The reaction of the explosion rebounding from the resistance of the pile drives the piston upward. As the piston rises, the exhaust ports open, releasing the gases and force of the explosion into the atmosphere. After the piston stops its upward movement, it again falls by gravity to start another cycle.|$|R
40|$|In robotic excavation, hybrid position/force {{control has}} been {{proposed}} for bucket digging trajectory following. In hybrid position/force control, the control mode is required to switch between position- and force-control {{depending on whether the}} bucket is in free space or in contact with the soil during the process. Alternatively, impedance control can be applied such that one control mode is employed in both free and constrained motion. This paper presents a robust sliding controller that implements impedance control for a backhoe excavator. The control law consists of three components: an equivalent control, a switching control and a tuning control. Given an excavation task in world space, inverse kinematic and dynamic models are used to convert the task into a desired digging trajectory in joint space. The proposed controller is applied to provide good tracking performance with attenuated vibration at bucket-soil contact points. From the control signals and the joint angles of the excavator, the <b>piston</b> position and <b>ram</b> force of each hydraulic cylinder for the axis control of the boom, arm, and bucket can be determined. The problem is then how to find the control voltage applied to each servovalve to achieve force and position tracking of each electrohydraulic system for the axis motion of the boom, arm, and bucket. With an observer-based compensation for disturbance force including hydraulic friction, tracking of the <b>piston</b> <b>ram</b> force and position is guaranteed using robust sliding control. High performance and strong robustness can be obtained as demonstrated by simulation and experiments performed on a hydraulically actuated robotic excavator. The results obtained suggest that the proposed control technique can provide robust performance when employed in autonomous excavation with soil contact considerations. ...|$|R
