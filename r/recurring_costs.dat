5|$|REL intends {{ultimately}} {{to operate as}} a for-profit commercial enterprise which, upon the completion of development, shall manufacture Skylon vehicles for multiple international customers who shall operate their fleets directly, while being provided with support from REL. Skylon has been designed with the target of achieving no less than 200 flights per vehicle. According to the company, its business plan is to sell vehicles for $1 billion each, for which it has forecast a market for at least 30 Skylons, while <b>recurring</b> <b>costs</b> of just $10 million per flight are predicted to be incurred by operators. While the REL intends to manufacture some components directly, such as the engine precooler, other components have been designed by partner companies and a consortium of various aerospace firms is expected to handle full production of Skylon.|$|E
25|$|Closed-die forging {{has a high}} {{initial cost}} due to the {{creation}} of dies and required design work to make working die cavities. However, it has low <b>recurring</b> <b>costs</b> for each part, thus forgings become more economical with more volume. This {{is one of the major}} reasons closed-die forgings are often used in the automotive and tool industries. Another reason forgings are common in these industrial sectors is that forgings generally have about a 20 percent higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to cast or machined parts of the same material.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfuric acid is used {{in large}} {{quantities}} by the iron and steelmaking industry to remove oxidation, rust and scaling from rolled sheet and billets prior to sale to the automobile and major appliances industry. Used acid is often recycled using a spent acid regeneration (SAR) plant. These plants combust spent acid with natural gas, refinery gas, fuel oil or other fuel sources. This combustion process produces gaseous sulfur dioxide (...) and sulfur trioxide (...) which are then used to manufacture [...] "new" [...] sulfuric acid. SAR plants are common additions to metal smelting plants, oil refineries, and other industries where sulfuric acid is consumed in bulk, as operating a SAR plant is much cheaper than the <b>recurring</b> <b>costs</b> of spent acid disposal and new acid purchases.|$|E
40|$|The SMRF (Scalable Multifunction Radio Frequency Systems) {{concept has}} been {{launched}} in the WEAG (Western European Armament Group) context, recently restructured into the EDA (European Defence Agency). A derived concept is introduced here, namely the SMRF-APAS (Scalable Multifunction Radio Frequency-Active Phased Array System) concept. In this paper, the cost/effectiveness derived from {{the introduction of the}} SMRF-APAS concept is comparedto an Active Phased Array System which makes no use of scalable techniques. In particular, a comparison is performed between a SMRF-APAS solution and a conventional solution with regard to Non <b>Recurring</b> <b>Cost</b> i. e. cost of radar design and <b>Recurring</b> <b>Cost</b> i. e. cost of radar construction. We find that thereduction in cost due to the adoption of the SMRF-APAS concept could be about 80 % for Non <b>Recurring</b> <b>Cost</b> and 40 % for <b>Recurring</b> <b>Cost.</b> This reduction could become more and more relevant after the insertion of the new technologies still in developmen...|$|R

40|$|The cargo {{transport}} {{capability and}} the cost of space transportation operations for transportation of solar power satellites (SPS) to space are addressed. The history of SPS launch vehicle evolution is shown. Alternative vehicle designs developed include: (1) a parallel burn, crossfeed configuration; (2) single stage to orbit airbreathing/rocket runway takeoff vehicle concept; and (3) a smaller HLLV concept. The smaller HLLV was analyzed to compare the nonrecurring cost benefits of a less challenging development with the <b>recurring</b> <b>cost</b> increases expected due to losses in efficiency associated with smaller vehicle size. The vehicle payload bay size was selected to be adequate to accommodate the SPS transmitter subarrays fully assembled. The resulting vehicle design is compared with the shuttle, the Saturn V, and the reference SPS HLLV. A nonrecurring savings of at least five billion dollars was obtained with a <b>recurring</b> <b>cost</b> penalty of 3 % per SPS. The environmental benefits of the small vehicle were deemed more important than the slight increase in upper atmosphere propellant deposition. It is recommended that the small HLLV be adopted as the SPS reference launch system...|$|R

30|$|Introduction: Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} reason for slower acceptance of advanced laparoscopy is that the 2 D view on flat screen laparoscopy is cerebrally intensive.

The 3 D HD laparoscopy with great depth perception and tactile feedback improves surgical precision and hand–eye coordination, shortens the learning curve and improves surgical results.|$|R
