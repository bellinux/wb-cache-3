50|$|Mr Homer claimed {{indirect}} age discrimination, {{because after}} a rule change he {{was required to}} have a law degreee to get onto the third and highest pay grade, once he was 62 years old. He began working as a legal adviser in 1995 with the Police National Legal Database. He was required to have a law degree or in his case ‘exceptional experience in criminal law with a lesser qualification’. But to get the highest pay grade after a 2005 <b>review,</b> legal <b>advisers</b> now actually {{had to have a}} law degree, and so he was refused entry. He brought a claim under the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006, SI 2006/1031 after internal grievances and appeals were dismissed.|$|R

40|$|The Australian {{aid program}} aims to assist {{developing}} countries reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development, {{in line with}} Australia’s national interests. The program has doubled in size {{over the last five}} years to an estimated $ 4. 3 billion in 2010 – 11 and, on current economic projections, will double again to meet the Government’s commitment to increase Australia’s aid to 0. 5 per cent of gross national income by 2015 – 16. The Government, Parliament and taxpayers need to be confident that this significant investment is both effective and efficient in fulfilling its objectives. The Government has taken a range of measures to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the aid program. The Office of Development Effectiveness (ODE), which was established in 2006, has completed a number of reviews and evaluations of the program, including the Annual Review of Development Effectiveness, which is tabled in Parliament. The findings of this analysis are used to improve aid program planning and implementation. AusAID, the lead agency within the Government on the aid program, has rigorous systems and processes in place to ensure that the aid program is well managed and prioritised. These systems are reviewed and improved regularly. A <b>review</b> of <b>advisers</b> engaged under the aid program is currently bein...|$|R
5000|$|The {{registration}} system {{was ordered to}} be removed {{near the end of}} the President Obama's second term in 2016. The removal order occurred after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman wrote, [...] "We can't risk giving President-elect Trump the tools to create an unconstitutional religious registry." [...] However, because the order occurred within the last 60 days of a President's term, if it is a [...] "major regulation" [...] (major social policy significance or cost of more than $100 million), it is subject to Congressional review (see Midnight regulations) and may be voided by Congress under the Congressional <b>Review</b> Act. Trump's <b>advisers</b> had suggested keeping the system to track immigrants. The Obama administration's order to remove the system said the program was redundant because it called for manual collection of data that is now captured automatically.|$|R

In {{the seventh and}} final article, Martin Neil Baily from the Institute for International Economics, and former Chairman of the U. S. Council of Economic <b>Advisers</b> <b>reviews</b> the report. Baily notes that key findings include: the diversity in GDP per capita growth across OECD countries, largely reflecting differences in labour utilization; the importance for growth of exposure to international trade, sound macro policies and investment in physical and human capital; and the high returns to growth from business sector R&D activities, {{in contrast to a}} lack of any positive effect from government R&D. Baily observes that the report fails to discuss ways to improve employment growth, concluding that combining full employment with high productivity is the key challenge currently facing policymakers.

40|$|For this {{assignment}} you will prepare a draft and final literature review for your planning report. You will submit the draft literature <b>review</b> to your <b>adviser</b> by October 21. The {{final version of}} the literature review, due November 18, should incorporate the feedback received from your adviser. Purpose In-depth knowledge of the field you wish to study is a pre-requisite for credible research. The literature review assignment is your chance to show that you are familiar with the literature pertinent to your general topic of research, as well as to your more specific research question. A well-written literature review will help you with your planning report (and work as a professional planner) in many ways. For example, a good literature review helps you to: 1. Assess whether planning policies or tools you could recommend will achieve specific outcomes. This outcome is likely to be particular important to most 298 planning reports—and to your work as a planning professional. Planners are often asked to evaluate the potential effectiveness of a new policy under consideration, and one extremely useful technique for doing so is to review existing research. When decision makers consider adopting a ne...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{its release}} date, the Huffington Post {{published}} {{a review of}} the book written by a journalist who had read the book, suggesting Bush supported [...] "self-deportation" [...] even though he had derided presidential candidate Mitt Romney for it in his 2012 campaign. In an update added to the <b>review,</b> former Romney <b>advisers</b> suggested this had been unfair on Romney, but Bush retorted that this was a misunderstanding of his views on letting undocumented immigrants return to their home countries and apply for citizenship there; he added that it was not present in the book. Writing for the Miami Herald, Marc Caputo suggested this might have been a marketing ploy for Bush to attract more readers. In the National Review, Reihan Salam suggested Bush's idea bore [...] "close resemblance to" [...] the ideas of Peter Skerry, a Professor of Political Science at Boston College and Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, and expressed his approval of the notion, adding that its implementation may prove difficult. However, Peter Skerry, in his review for The Weekly Standard, did not acknowledge this. Instead, he argued that they misunderstood a study by the Brookings Institution they use as a citation on the burden that immigrants impose on welfare programs. He added that it would be preferable to train low-skilled workers already on U.S. soil rather than bring in new ones, both for skilled and unskilled work.|$|R
40|$|The policy {{imperative}} {{of increasing the}} nation's economic competitiveness by up-skilling and re-skilling the workforce emphasises {{the importance of the}} accurate and early identification of barriers to employment, together with the need to support adults making transitions into and through the labour market. This literature review examines the evidence on these two separate, but inter-related, areas: skills appraisals measuring individual skill levels; and screening methodologies that help recognise influences on employability. The literature on skills appraisals is limited. Five skills appraisal tools, with robust evidence bases, all developed in the United States, were identified. Additionally, a well-established methodology for career development operates in France, incorporating a skills assessment - the 'bilans de competences'. However, in the UK, limited practice in assessment of adult skills was found, with no one suitable tool identified. In contrast to the literature on skills appraisals, that on screening tools is extensive and developing. Varied approaches have been implemented in various countries across the world. Some have been withdrawn from use, whilst others have thrived. Where tools have been successful, there has been a commitment to continuous quality improvement, sustained investment and policy commitment. In none of the examples identified in the <b>review</b> has the <b>adviser</b> been replaced by a tool. These screening tools are underdeveloped in the UK with existing methodologies, often {{in the early stages of}} development, taking delivery beyond an emphasis on placement outcomes. The successful implementation of both skills appraisals and screening tools has important implications for staff capacity and training...|$|R
40|$|The Defra ‘Action Plan to Develop Organic Food and Farming in England’ {{identifies}} cereals as {{the organic}} commodity farthest from meeting demand from UK production. The project quantified {{the extent and}} nature of this deficit and collected information on constraints from research projects and <b>reviews,</b> from <b>advisers</b> & farmers and from cereal buyers & end users. The obstacles to increased organic cereal production were identified and suggestions made on what Defra and the industry {{could do to help}} overcome them. The study focused on England but, as the main buyers of cereals operate across the UK, the supply and demand modelling was of necessity done on that basis. As identified by the Defra Organic Action Plan and by the Scotland and Wales plans, {{there is a lack of}} collated and reliable data on organic and in-conversion crop areas across the UK. Our calculations are based on best estimates, where possible confirmed from more than one source. There is a very limited scope for an increase in total grain production from existing organic farms due to rotational limitations. It is clear from consultations with grain buyers that their overwhelming requirement is for wheat for breadmaking and animal feed. Triticale and barley will continue to be difficult to sell to the feed compounders. There may be some scope for changing the balance of cereal species grown on existing organic farms. However, this is likely to be limited by constraints of location and soil type as the majority of the organic land in England, and in the UK, is on soils unsuited to wheat production. It may be more productive to seek direct sale to other farmers for these grains. The fragmented nature of supply with many farms selling small quantities of grain makes sourcing supply of consistent quality difficult for the large purchasers. Co-operation, with regional cleaning and storage facilities, has been suggested by many as a way to more effectively compete with imports. Work in this area has been started by Organic Grain LINK with Defra support under the ERDP. Our consultations show that the dominant constraints to further conversion to organic methods are concerns about marketing and profitability. These concerns are not specific to cereals which have remained relatively profitable, but are more related to falling prices for other products such as potatoes, and some vegetables. These potentially high gross-margin crops are the key to farm profitability in stockless arable systems where they balance the high levels of set-aside employed. With slowing retail growth and still more land coming through conversion, this situation is unlikely to improve in the short term. Although technical constraints are not dominant in decisions of conversion, they are limiting yield and quality of organic cereals and hence also the saleability and value of the grain. A better understanding of N availability should come from Defra project OF 0316 but further work on agronomy and grain quality is necessary. We recommend action in four areas, in line with priorities 2, 4 and 5 in the Defra Action Plan: 1. The most critical constraint on the development of the UK organic cereal supply is economic viability, particularly in the context of a 2 - 3 year lag between starting conversion and marketing organic produce. It is recommended that the new support system (under ELS) should be devised to deliver long-term environmental benefits (through ongoing payments) while minimising short-term market distortions (through conversion support). A higher level of annual payment than the modified OFS is needed, as £ 30 /ha is unlikely to provide sufficient incentive for further substantial conversion of arable farms. 2. The availability of good data on supply and demand, by species, is needed. This would give buyers and sellers more confidence and help farmers plan rotations to better meet market demand. This shortcoming was identified in the Defra Organic Action Plan and action is underway. 3. Co-operation between organic cereal producers should be encouraged to allow better cleaning & storage, and bulking to create larger quantities for sale. The Organic Grain Link initiative is helping publicise the availability of support from ERDP for marketing and facilities and could be a model for wider application. 4. Whilst not the primary constraint to increase in cereal production, technical issues are limiting the yield and quality of grain, farm profitability, adding cost to the supply chain, and making produce less competitive with imports. Direct issues include improving breadmaking quality and a better understanding of the interactions of seed rate, sowing date and row width. There are also issues affecting organic livestock production that will impact on demand for cereals. These include the ending of the derogations on feeding synthetic amino acids, non-organic feed inclusion and pullet rearing. These will all add substantially to livestock production costs and are likely to require further research to find innovative technical and management solutions to maintain and expand these sectors and their associated demands for cereals. Defra funding may be necessary to make immediate progress on these issues in view of the current stop on new projects by the HGCA. Future changes in supply and demand for organic cereals will be influenced by a range of complex and interacting factors which make precise predictions of the likely impacts of these actions impossible. However, together they should help maintain current organic cereal production and create the best environment for the industry to respond to future market needs...|$|R
