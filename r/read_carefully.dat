5|$|Lamarck {{was largely}} {{ignored by the}} major French {{zoologist}} Cuvier, but he attracted much more interest abroad. The book was <b>read</b> <b>carefully,</b> but its thesis rejected, by nineteenth century scientists including the geologist Charles Lyell and the comparative anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Darwin acknowledged Lamarck as an important zoologist, and his theory a forerunner of Darwin's evolution by natural selection.|$|E
500|$|The {{first thing}} for a private {{secretary}} {{to do is to}} study her employer. After I went to work for Mr. Roosevelt, for months I <b>read</b> <b>carefully</b> all the letters he dictated ... I learned what letters he wanted to see and which ones it was not necessary to show him ... I came to know exactly how Mr. Roosevelt would answer some of his letters, how he would couch his thoughts. When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many letters he could just say yes or no and I knew what to say and how to say it.|$|E

2500|$|Lord Franks is {{reported}} to have believed that, while there must be some criticism of government actions, as no government can be held to blame for the reckless aggression of another, there could be [...] "no hanging conclusion". To the charge of a whitewash, he {{is reported}} as saying that it should be remembered the report was produced in the aftermath of victory and that [...] "there is a time and place for blame", and that the report should be <b>read</b> <b>carefully</b> and to read between the lines. William Wallace of Chatham House also interpreted the Franks Report as containing two readings. According to Wallace, on first reading it [...] "exonerated the government in office of all blame", but could also be read as a coded document much more critical of British government policy from 1977 to 1982 and less damning of the intelligence apparatus.|$|E

6000|$|But we can {{notice in}} [...] "Ripostes" [...] other evidences than of {{versatility}} only; certain poems show Mr. Pound turning to more modern subjects, {{as in the}} [...] "Portrait d'une femme," [...] or the mordant epigram, [...] "An Object."
