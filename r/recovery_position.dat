Spurious error reports and confusing diagnostics are common problems confronting the programmer. Innumerable error possibilities have made recovery design a frustrating task. This thesis implements a method of syntactic error recovery using recursive calls on the error recovery routine. Parsing is accomplished by traversing transition diagrams which are created from syntax charts. Key language symbols and dynamically generated <b>recovery</b> <b>positions</b> are used in restoring the parse. High-quality error diagnostics give a clear, accurate, and thorough description of each error, providing an excellent instructional software tool.

40|$|International audienceThe Kerguelen Plateau {{constitutes}} a natural obstacle for the eastward {{progress of the}} Antarctic Circumpolar Current, especially around the Kerguelen Islands. However, there is little quantitative knowledge of the current field around the islands {{due to lack of}} long-term current measurements. We performed a systematic analysis of a total of 28917 points of fishing gear drifts from setting and <b>recovery</b> <b>positions</b> of demersal longlines deployed between 2002 and 2007 for Patagonian Toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fisheries in Kerguelen waters. This enabled the construction of a realistic field of depth-averaged time-mean slope currents along the 1000 m isobath all around the Kerguelen Islands. The strongest depth-mean velocities of 25 cm s− 1 are associated with the Polar Front, which rounds the islands from the south and flows northward along the inner continental slope immediately east of the islands, strongly supporting previous hydrographic evidence. These results demonstrate the potential for hitherto unexploited historic longline drift data from demersal fishing grounds to provide valuable quantitative information on the regional circulatio...|$|R

40|$|This short {{study shows}} that in the European area high efforts are made to develop more and more {{precisely}} working drives and products based on the same. In the process it is shown that piezoelectric, electrostrictive, electrostatic and magnetostrictive drive principles are utilized to an increasing extent to ensure positioning accuracies down to the nanometer range. But also conventional motor, hydrostatic and purely mechanical drive principles are capable of reaching positioning errors of less than one #mu#m. The product range in which highly accurate precision drives are used is very versatile. Applications primarily include optics, production of precision and very small components, production of electronic circuits, precision measurement technique, medical engineering, biology, and aerospace (e. g. positioning of solar cells for energy <b>recovery,</b> <b>positioning</b> of antennas and the like, navigation (course stabilization)).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the skipjack movements {{observed in the}} Indian Ocean based on an analysis of fishery data of the 13. 128 selected recoveries of tagged skipjack. Its goal is to evaluate the potential geographical heterogeneity of the skipjack population fished in the Indian Ocean. Significant latitudinal & longitudinal movements have been frequently observed; the geographical range of skipjack movements appears to be wide in scale, showing an average distance over 1000 miles between tagging & <b>recovery</b> <b>positions.</b> These distances are showing an increasing trend with time at liberty, and reaching average distances of 1400 miles after 2 years. Recovery data are also showing that skipjack movements are often very fast, for instance reaching average distances over 800 miles after only 1 month at liberty in the Tanzania tagging. Distances covered are the lowest for skipjack tagged in the Maldives and in Seychelles islands and much larger in the Tanzania and Seychelles tagging. these differences are discussed. Because of these fast and extensive movements of skipjack, {{it can be concluded}} that its population is highly mobile in the Indian Ocean, but that the mixing rates of individual skipjack that are fished in remote parts of the Indian Ocean are probably low or very low. Based on these results, it is proposed that skipjack indicators and future skipjack stock assessment should be stratified on at least 4 areas, and estimating the mixing rates of skipjack tunas fished in each of these areas...|$|R
