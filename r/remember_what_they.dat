Additionally, when continuing a saved game, players are shown the last four actions they performed, allowing them to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} of {{anterograde}} amnesia, patients lose declarative memory, or the recollection of facts, but they retain nondeclarative memory, often called procedural memory. For instance, {{they are able}} to remember and in some cases learn how to do things such as talking on the phone or riding a bicycle, but they may not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had eaten earlier that day for lunch. One extensively studied anterograde amnesiac patient, codenamed H.M., demonstrated that despite his amnesia preventing him from learning new declarative information, procedural memory consolidation was still possible, albeit severely reduced in power. He, along with other patients with anterograde amnesia, were given the same maze to complete day after day. Despite having no memory of having completed the maze the day before, unconscious practice of completing the same maze over and over reduced the amount of time needed to complete it in subsequent trials. From these results, Corkin et al. concluded despite having no declarative memory (i.e. no conscious memory of completing the maze exists), the patients still had a working procedural memory (learning done unconsciously through practice). This supports the notion that declarative and procedural memory are consolidated in different areas of the brain. In addition, patients have a diminished ability to remember the temporal context in which objects were presented. Certain authors claim the deficit in temporal context memory is more significant than the deficit in semantic learning ability (described below).|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the general}} {{tone of the}} show, Teri Fitsell of The New Zealand Herald {{explains}} that [...] "South Park is a vicious social satire that works by spotlighting not the immorality of these kids but their amorality, and contrasting it with the conniving hypocrisy of the adults who surround them." [...] The humor of the show comes from the disparity between the cute appearance of the characters and their crude behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. [...] "There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real... Don't people <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were like in third grade? We were little bastards." ...|$|E

50|$|One {{problem with}} the {{hypothesis}} that specific punishment for intentional deception could coevolve with intelligence {{is the fact that}} selective punishment of individuals with certain characteristics selects against the characteristics in question. For example, if only individuals capable of <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had agreed to were punished for breaking agreements, evolution would have selected against the ability to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> one had agreed to.|$|R
500|$|The {{humor of}} the show comes from the [...] "disparity" [...] between the [...] "cute" [...] {{appearance}} of the characters and their [...] "crude" [...] behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. [...] "There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real... Don't people <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were like in third grade? We were little bastards." [...] Frederic Biddle of The Boston Globe notes how the show [...] "constantly plays on its grade-school aesthetic for shock value, with great success", arguing that at its height, it is [...] "more a profane 'Peanuts' than a downsized 'Beavis and Butt-Head.'" [...] He points, for example, to Kenny, who symbolically represents the voiceless underclass, which is eliminated in each episode. Claire Bickley of the Toronto Sun explains that [...] "The show captures that mix of innocence and viciousness that can co-exist in kids that age", that [...] "the boys are fascinated by bodily functions", and that they [...] "mimic adult behavior and language". For example, Kyle instructs Stan and Wendy to [...] "make sweet love down by the fire", a phrase he learns from Chef. In a light-hearted study of the humor of flatulence, Jim Dawson explains how the rise of adult animation in the 1990s allowed television to indulge in such humor with The Ren & Stimpy Show, The Simpsons, and Beavis and Butt-Head. Beginning with [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", South Park builds on this tradition.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{reference}} was excised {{from the}} final version but is of interest {{in that it is}} a rare reference to his father; Beckett’s writing is generally matricentric. The writing breaks down following this sentimental passage where C recalls a fishing trip with his father: “Bring me back to the hot summer evening out in the Bay with my father in the little rowboat, fishing for mackerel with a spinner. To the time when it was all still time. ‘Do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> look like?’ ‘Yes, father, all blue and silver.’” When Beckett discussed this with James Knowlson in 1989 he used the exact turn of phrase, “‘fishing for mackerel with a spinner’ … that he had used over thirty years before in his rejected play fragment.” Even accounting for Beckett’s astounding memory this was an exceptionally clear and vivid recollection. In more typical Beckett fashion the image resurfaced in Texts for Nothing: “Yes, I’m here forever, with the spinners and the dead flies, dancing to the tremor of their meshed wings…” ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{tapes of}} Genie's {{first two months}} in the hospital, {{linguists}} discerned that by January 1971 she knew her own name, the words mother and father, the four color words red, blue, green, and brown, the words no and sorry, and a few miscellaneous nouns such as jewelry box, door, and bunny. She also appeared to understand negative commands, and accordingly could discern a warning using a negation, although whether she understood them {{in the context of}} sentences was unclear. There was speculation, though no conclusive evidence, that she understood the intonation to indicate a yes or no question and that she understood imperative mood sentences based on tone of voice, but she otherwise lacked any grammar. Her active vocabulary at that time appeared to consist of just two short phrases, [...] "stop it" [...] and [...] "no more". Some doctors thought she may have spontaneously said a few other words or negative commands, as her very few vocalizations were extremely difficult to understand, but there was no record of them and no one could <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> might have been. Linguists could not determine the extent of her expressive or receptive vocabulary at any point before then, and therefore did not know whether she acquired any or all of this language during the preceding two months at the hospital.|$|E

500|$|U2's 1987 album The Joshua Tree and the {{supporting}} Joshua Tree Tour brought them critical acclaim and commercial success. However, their 1988 album and motion picture Rattle and Hum precipitated a critical backlash.

Hot Press editor Niall Stokes commented [...] "having started out as a band in the slipstream of punk, U2 <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had felt about the supergroups of the late '70s.

[...] In the time leading up {{to the start of the}} Achtung Baby sessions, U2 listened to records which had a [...] "hard-edged industrial kind of sound", including works by KMFDM and Sonic Youth, as well as artists such as Roy Orbison and Jacques Brel. These influences led the band to seek the creation of songs which were harder musically than their previous work, while remaining personal lyrically.|$|R
