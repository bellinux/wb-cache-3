Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>veto.</b> In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit possession of firearms. The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit possession of firearms. The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.|$|E

We characterize and welfare rank four classes of second best constitutions: constitutions that specify one rule for all types of decisions; constitutions that provide incentives for information about costs and benefits to be revealed; constitutions that allow for vetoes from interested parties and constitutions that specify different rules for different policy areas.

50|$|Article 111 of the Indian {{constitution}} {{stipulates that}} the President shall give assent to a bill passed by {{both houses of}} the parliament or return the bill {{as soon as possible}} for reconsideration with his recommendation. The Indian Constitution does not give a specific time limit for presidential action on a bill sent by the Parliament. Thus, by indefinitely postponing action on a bill, the president effectively vetoes it. However, if a president receives a bill he or she had previously vetoed and sent back to Parliament, where such a veto has been overruled by another Parliamentary vote, then such a bill becomes an act within fourteen days of the President's receiving it regardless of his or her subsequent action or inaction. Zail Singh, President of India from 1982 until 1987, exercised a pocket veto to prevent the Indian Post Office (Amendment) Bill from becoming law. However, the Indian Supreme Court has not upheld the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> presidents to <b>veto</b> bills in this manner.|$|R

25|$|The {{links between}} {{religious}} and political life were vital to Rome's internal governance, diplomacy and development from kingdom, to Republic and to Empire. Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite: kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices. In the early Republic, as presumably in the regal era, plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office, and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge. They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office, public priesthood, and knowledge of civil and religious law. The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency; he negotiated a settlement, and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia. The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public. Plebeian tribunes were appointed, with sacrosanct status and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>veto</b> in legislative debate. In principle, the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians. In reality, the patrician {{and to a lesser}} extent, plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond.|$|E
500|$|It was the {{prevailing}} wisdom that the House of Lords could not amend money bills, since only the House of Commons {{had the right}} to decide upon the resources the monarch could call upon. This did not, however, despite the apparent contradiction, prevent it from rejecting such bills outright. In 1860, with the repeal of the paper duties, all money bills were consolidated into a single budget. This denied the Lords the ability to reject individual components and the prospect of voting down the entire budget was seemingly unpalatable. It was only in 1909 that this possibility became a reality.

Zaharoff wanted the University of Paris to have a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>veto</b> over the appointment, but Oxford would not accept this.

2500|$|In about 1379 Denys [...] {{obtained}} the hand in marriage of a Gloucestershire heiress, Margaret Corbet, and [...] became thereby {{a man of}} wealth and influence. [...] Margaret had been born a triplet in about 1352, and both her brothers had died young in succession, leaving her the sole heir of the large Corbet landholdings in Gloucestershire and elsewhere. John the eldest had died in 1370 [...] and William in 1377. Their father William, husband of Emma Oddingseles, had died while his children were young, predeceasing his own father, Sir Peter Corbet(d.1362). The manors held by Sir Peter Corbet on his death in 1362, which descended to his grandchildren in succession, John, William and Margaret were as follows: Hope-juxta-Caus, Shropshire, a remnant manor from the great Corbet honour, or virtually autonomous lordship established under William I at Caus Castle. Lawrenny in Pembrokeshire, (held from the Carew family) remnant of the family's large Welsh holdings, most {{of which had been}} earlier settled on Corbet male lines. The Corbet lands in Gloucestershire were as follows: Siston, held from the Bishops of Bath and Wells, [...] and Alveston and Earthcott Green, both held in chief from the King. The possession of these tenancies-in-chief meant that should they ever descend into the hands of a female heiress, the King could repossess them and install his own favoured tenant who would thenceforth owe royal knight service and would be obliged to become a local administrator of the royal government. Margaret had been married off to a Pembrokeshire man, William Wyriott of Orielton, probably with the intention of consolidating Lawrenny with the Wyriott lands. Yet in 1379, only two years after her brother William's death aged 25, her husband William Wyriott died also, leaving Margaret as a female tenant-in-chief, a very precarious position for her. She could only remarry by royal licence, effectively giving the King the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>veto</b> over her free choice or she could relinquish her family manors to live with a husband of her choice, probably in relative poverty and social obscurity. Within a short time after Wyriott's death, Margaret had accepted Gilbert Denys as her husband. The two were contemporaries, and the marriage proved on a personal level to be successful, as Denys asked in his will to be buried next to Margaret. The marriage, like most of the period, is unlikely to have been the result of a romance but rather arranged by some powerful figure at [...] Court who wished to see Denys rise in the world. Insufficient evidence exists to identify who this patron of Denys might have been, but pure speculation might suggest John of Gaunt.|$|E

The predictions made by veto player theory correspond with why conflicts are, or become more intense and longer (Cunningham 2006). I argue that the number <b>of</b> <b>veto</b> players influences the cost-benefit calculations of conflict actors, as low numbers <b>of</b> <b>veto</b> players limit concession making, while high numbers <b>of</b> <b>veto</b> players exacerbate information asymmetries. Therefore, I test the hypothesis that the relationship between the number <b>of</b> <b>veto</b> players and mediation onset probability is curvilinear, with medium numbers <b>of</b> <b>veto</b> players increasing mediation incidence likelihood. Using data on mediation onsets in civil conflicts for the period 1946 - 2003, I find across different statistical model specifications that low and high numbers <b>of</b> <b>veto</b> players impede mediation onset. The models explain and predict mediation occurrence well, but are sensitive to model specifications, i. e. the exclusion of observations does not allow the model to reproduce the same results. The findings confirm the explanatory value of conflict costs and the benefits of a dyadic conflict analysis approach, yet suggest that more research on conflict actors’ characteristics is necessary to understand mediation...|$|R
