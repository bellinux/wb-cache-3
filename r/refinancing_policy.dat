40|$|The {{external}} debt burden of many low-income developing countries has increased significantly since the 1970 s. Developments {{in a sample}} of ten countries show that the main factors behind the buildup of debt were (1) exogenous (adverse terms of trade shocks or weather), (2) a lack of sustained macroeconomic adjustment and structural reforms, (3) nonconcessional lending arid <b>refinancing</b> <b>policies</b> of creditors, (4) inadequate debt management, and (5) political factors (civil war and social strife). Future policies should limit the need for external financing and create an environment conducive to diversifying export growth, managing debt more prudently, and basing economic projections on more cautious assumptions. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the recent}} {{development}} of Czech interest rates during the Czech Republic's {{transition to a}} market economy is discussed. First, the situation in the economy and in the banking sector, as well as the monetary policy of the central bank during the period of 1990 - 1999 is presented. However, the main focus is on monetary policy instruments and their application during transition. The paper also describes the targeting of the central bank's policy by using direct limitations in banking during 1990 - 1991 and refinancing instruments exploited during the period of 1991 - 1992. Finally, the central bank's orientation towards free market operations, starting in 1993, is discussed. Czech National Bank, monetary <b>policy,</b> <b>refinancing,</b> monetary instruments...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} {{a model to}} value debt related tax shields. This model allows for a {{discontinuous}} debt financing policy by giving the opportunity to choose the firm’s leverage ratio and a refinancing interval of corporate debt. We show how to include the <b>refinancing</b> <b>policy</b> into the well-known APV approach and derive a pricing equation adjusting the discounting procedure accordingly. Moreover, we derive general relations between the unlevered and the levered beta factor. For the tax shield valuation and the APV approach, we also show that the two simplified financing policies currently proposed by the valuation literature, the Modigliani/Miller and the Miles/Ezzell case {{can be regarded as}} polar cases of the discontinuous financing policy. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the general inapplicability of the textbook WACC approach in combination with discontinuous financing.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simple model of banking behavior where portfolio, liquidity, and liability management determine simultaneously the demand and supply of borrowed reserves on the interbank market. As {{the central bank}} is one player in this market due to its <b>refinancing</b> <b>policy,</b> {{it is able to}} determine the interest rate and henceforth the residual demand for central bank loans. Comparative static analysis shows how external or monetary policy shocks affect the behavior on the interbank market, the volume as well as the structure of the bank's balance sheet. It turns out that the banking firm behavior is non-linear and partially non-monotonous, indicating that the transmission of monetary measures is more complex when endogeneous banking behavior is taken into account. banking firm, balance sheet, interbank market, borrowed reserves, central banking, liquidity, transmission...|$|E
40|$|The {{monetary}} policy process has two stages: (1) setting {{the value of}} intermediate or final monetary targets {{on the basis of}} available information, and (2) setting the instruments of {{monetary policy}} in order to neutralize stochastic disturbances and to render the actual value of the intermediate target {{as close as possible to}} the targeted value. After becoming independent, Slovenia had to establish an independent central bank and create effective instruments of monetary policy. Slovenia did away with the nonmarket instruments of monetary policy that were used in the former Yugoslavia. Old, selective instruments of monetary policy were replaced by new instruments: an open market policy, Lombard loans, minimum reserve requirements, bills with warrants, twin bills, and foreign currency bills. Slovenia must use open-market policy instruments as the core instrument; the fiscal component should be eliminated; minimum reserve requirements should not change frequently due to fluctuations deriving from reserve ratio movements; <b>refinancing</b> <b>policy</b> should have a safety valve function to satisfy unexpected demand for the central bank's money. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the likely impact of market interest rates on the choice of farm mortgages for the borrower. The study focuses on choice of mortgages with different rate repricing periods. ^ The stochastic process of market interest rate movement is first estimated using a state space time series model. A simulation model is then built up to determine the preferred refinancing strategy and the initial mortgage choice. Using the simulation model, we addressed: (1) the preferred <b>refinancing</b> <b>policy</b> and the impact on the mortgage decisions of the varying market interest rates, (2) the impact of leverage choices on the mortgage decisions, (3) the effect of the decision maker 2 ̆ 7 s temporal risk preference, and (4) the effect of initial market interest rates on refinancing activities. ^ Based on the experimental results, it was found that the preferred expected cost calculation period does not exceed 3 years and the risk adjustment parameter lies within the range of zero to 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the choice of}} banks between alternative channels for interbank payments. The conventional view assumes a tradeoff between the safety of real-time gross settlement (RTGS) and the liquidity savings of multilateral netting. Moreover, correspondent banking {{is believed to be}} inefficient, both in terms of liquidity and of administrative costs. In the last decade, however, the impulse of the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, technological changes and the management of RTGS systems by central banks have reduced the difference between the various systems. This is especially true for risk, whereas liquidity cost crucially depends on the <b>refinancing</b> <b>policy</b> adopted by the central bank and the co-ordination among the participants. On the basis of the recent evolution of payment systems in Europe, we verify the importance of liquidity, as well as other variables like transaction costs, for the choice of banks among different settlement systems. Cost factors imply that the nature of payments flows (value, commercial versus financial) and some structural features of the banking systems (dimension of the intermediaries, concentration of the banking sector) become important. The analysis is carried out both through a theoretical model and a cross-country comparison based on three data sources: ECB (European Central Bank, EBA (Euro Banking Association) and SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication).

3000|$|The result derived in {{this section}} has an {{important}} implication for the practical relevant WACC approach. It {{is well known that}} cost of capital needs to be known with certainty at the timepoint of valuation t. 16 Random future cost of capital cannot be used as discount rates to obtain present values of future expected cash flows. 17 Given a <b>refinancing</b> <b>policy</b> with a fixed interval of k periods, the capital structure of the firm (in market values) is known with certainty every k periods, i.e., when the firm readjusts the debt level according to the target leverage ratio l. Thus, the firm’s WACC, defined as wacc_t+nk=r_L (1 -l) [...] + [...] r_D (1 -τ [...]) l, at any arbitrary refinancing point t+nk is also non-random. However, this is not true for any intermediate timepoint s between two arbitrary adjustment dates, with t+nk<s<t+(n+ 1)k. Between two refinancing dates, the financing policy described fixes the debt level to D_t+nk and the leverage ratio l_s=D_t+nk/V^L_s turns into a random variable. As a consequence, wacc_s is a random variable for any intermediate point in time s and thus does no longer meet the requirement from above to serve as cost of capital, implying that a WACC-based valuation for discontinuous financing is not possible. Only in one special case, WACC may be used as discount rate for every future period’s cash flow: if k= 1, i.e., the ME policy applies, the firm’s debt level will be adjusted every period and l is known with certainty at any future point in time.|$|E
