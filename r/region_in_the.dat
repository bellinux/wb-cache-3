5|$|The {{centre of}} these {{architectural}} developments was the region encompassing the present-day Dharwad district; it included areas of present-day Haveri and Gadag districts. In these districts, about fifty monuments have survived {{as evidence of}} the widespread temple building of the Western Chalukyan workshops. The influence of this style extended beyond the Kalyani <b>region</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeast to the Bellary <b>region</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east and to the Mysore <b>region</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south. In the Bijapur–Belgaum region to the north, the style was mixed with that of the Hemadpanti temples. Although a few Western Chalukyan temples {{can be found in the}} Konkan region, the presence of the Western Ghats probably prevented the style from spreading westwards.|$|E

40|$|We study {{photometric}} properties, chemical abundances {{and sizes}} {{of star formation}} <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two principal arms of the galaxy NGC 628 (M 74). The GALEX ultraviolet, optical UBVRI, and H-alpha? surface photometry data are used, including those obtained with the 1. 5 -m telescope of the Maidanak Observatory. The thirty brightest star formation <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> ultraviolet light located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spiral arms of NGC 628 are identified and studied. We find that <b>the</b> star formation <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> one (longer) arm are systematically brighter and larger than <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other (shorter) arm. However, both luminosity and size distribution functions have approximately the same slopes for the samples of star formation <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> both arms. <b>The</b> star formation <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longer arm have a higher star formation rate density than <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shorter arm. <b>The</b> <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shorter arm show higher N/O ratio at a higher oxygen abundance, but they have lower ultraviolet and H-alpha? luminosities. These findings can be explained {{if we assume that}} star formation <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shorter arm had higher star formation rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, but now it is lower than for those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite arm. Results of stellar evolutionary synthesis show that <b>the</b> brightest <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longer arm are slightly younger than <b>the</b> ones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shorter arm (3. 5 +- 2. 2 Myr versus 6. 0 +- 1. 1 Myr). Our results demonstrate that there is a difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner structures and parameters of the interstellar medium between the spiral arms of NGC 628, one of which is long and hosts a regular chain of bright star formation complexes and the other, shorter one does not.

A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In 2004 a deeper image, known as the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure. The HUDF image was at the time the most sensitive astronomical image ever made at visible wavelengths, and it remained so until the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) was released in 2012.|$|E
5|$|A vast {{marshland}} {{could only}} have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25million and 2million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a <b>region</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.|$|E

5|$|Although it was {{the largest}} of the African {{nationalist}} parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate évolués and the more radical mass membership. A radical faction headed by Iléo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party's support base into those who endured with Lumumba, chiefly in the Stanleyville <b>region</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, which became most popular around the southern city of Élisabethville and among the Luba ethnic group.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} the {{contribution}} of technology to economic growth convergence among coastal <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern part of Indonesia (KTI). Panel data spanning 1975 - 2002 are analyzed using Total Factor Productivity (TFP) catch-up model and Transfer of Technology model. The TFP model results show that <b>the</b> difference <b>in</b> technological level among <b>the</b> coastal <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KTI explains the slow speed of the TFP catch-up. When <b>the</b> difference <b>in</b> technology level disappears the TFP catch-up takes place {{at a faster rate}} thereby pushing income level convergence to occur among <b>the</b> coastal <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KTI. The results of the transfer of technology model show that a greater portion of the convergence comes from transfer of technology. If the technology difference disappears, the transfer of technology would be faster and speed up income convergence among <b>the</b> coastal <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KTI.
