Previous attempts to reduce the formaldehyde have lowered the filtration rate. The current filtration rate is 75 gallons per hour. Four factors are considered: temperature (A), pressure (B), formaldehyde concentration (C), and stirring rate (D). Each of the four factors will be tested at two levels.

An engineer performed an experiment to increase the filtration <b>rate</b> (<b>output)</b> of a process to produce a chemical, and {{to reduce the amount}} of formaldehyde used in the process. The full factorial experiment is described in the Wikipedia page Factorial experiment. Four factors were considered: temperature (A), pressure (B), formaldehyde concentration (C), and stirring rate (D). The results in that example were that the main effects A, C, and D and the AC and AD interactions were significant. The results of that example may be used to simulate a fractional factorial experiment using a half-fraction of the original 24 = 16 run design. The table shows the 24-1 = 8 run half-fraction experiment design and the resulting filtration rate, extracted from the table for the full 16 run [...] factorial experiment.|$|E
50|$|The first {{lead-acid}} {{gel battery}} {{was invented by}} Elektrotechnische Fabrik Sonneberg in 1934. The modern gel or VRLA battery was invented by Otto Jache of Sonnenschein in 1957. The first AGM cell was the Cyclon, patented by Gates Rubber Corporation in 1972 and now produced by Enersys.The cyclon is a spiral-wound cell with thin lead foil electrodes. A number of manufacturers seized on the technology to implement it in cells with conventional flat plates. In the mid-1980s two UK companies, Chloride and Tungstone, simultaneously introduced 10 year life AGM batteries in capacities up to 400 Ah, stimulated by a British Telecom specification for batteries for support of new digital exchanges. In the same period, Gates acquired another UK company, Varley, specialising in aircraft and military batteries. Varley adapted the Cyclon lead foil technology to produce flat plate batteries with exceptional high <b>rate</b> <b>output.</b> These gained approval {{for a variety of}} aircraft including the BAe 125 and 146 business jets, the Harrier and its derivative the AV8B, and some F16 variants as the first alternatives to the normal NiCd batteries.|$|E

We employ the innovative nonlinear {{vector autoregressive model}} of Kilian and Vigfusson (2011), which allows us to observe the effect of different stances (tight or loose) and different sizes (small or large) of monetary policy actions. Our empirical evidence reveals that tight monetary policy, which, in this case, is captured with a positive shock to interest rate, decreases exchange <b>rate,</b> <b>output</b> and prices, as economic theory suggests. Loose monetary policy, which is captured with a negative shock to interest rate, has the opposite effect on these variables. However, the effects of loose monetary policy are weaker than the effects of tight monetary policy because loose monetary policy shocks are less effective than tight monetary policy shocks. Moreover, as the magnitude of a shock increases, {{the difference between the}} effects of tight and loose monetary policy policies also increases. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis...|$|E
40|$|The retina {{contains}} photoreceptors {{for light}} detection {{as well as}} Bipolar, Horizontal, Amacrine and Ganglion cells. These form a neural network where synaptic convergence, divergence and integration take place. It serves as a simple network to simulate and thus {{can be used as}} a learning tool to demonstrate neural processing, desensitization, experimental design and protocol. The simulation is designed for students to facilitate inquiry based learning. A given retinal ganglion cell responds to light directed to a specific area of the retina. This area is called the â€˜receptive fieldâ€™. Ganglion cell receptive fields have a â€˜centreâ€™ and an antagonistic â€˜surroundâ€™ and can be classified as â€˜On Centreâ€™ or â€˜Off Centreâ€™. On Centre are activated by light in the centre of the receptive field and inhibited by light in the surrounding receptive field. Off Centre are inhibited by light in the centre of the receptive field and activated by light in the surrounding receptive field The model simulates the receptive fields of four ganglion cells. The four receptive fields are arranged into 4 arrays with each array containing 64 Light Dependent Resistors (LDRâ€™s; EG&G Vactec). These simulate the photoreceptors contained within each receptive field. The LDRâ€™s are connected via the Multiplexor (Temic) and through the programming of a HC 12 microprocessor (Motorolla) simulate the â€˜On Centreâ€™ and â€˜Off Centreâ€™ receptive fields. Students shine a variable point of light onto one of the four arrayâ€™s and will see either an increase or decrease in the clock <b>rate</b> <b>output</b> of the HC 12. This represents a change in the discharge of the ganglion cell. The clock <b>rate</b> <b>output</b> of the HC 12 is visualised by means of an oscilloscope. The clock <b>rate</b> <b>output</b> will vary depending on whether they are activating â€˜Onâ€™ or â€˜Offâ€™ LDRâ€™s. Prolonged stimulation of the LDRâ€™s reduces the clock <b>rate</b> <b>output</b> to pre-stimulus levels to simulate desensitization. Students are required to design an experimental protocol that determines an optimal standard stimulus, a systematic protocol for testing the different receptive fields and a protocol for gathering and analysing the data. The simulation challenges students to determine (i) the optimum size, strength and duration of a stimulus that is sufficient to stimulate the receptive field (ii) the receptive field characteristics of retinal ganglion cells (iii) how such receptive fields can be formed on the basis of the cell types and connections found in the retina...|$|E
