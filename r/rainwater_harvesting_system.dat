25|$|The {{station has}} been {{designed}} to use environmentally friendly techniques wherever possible. Some of the building's electricity is provided by Photovoltaic cells. A 700,000 litre <b>rainwater</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>system</b> has also been installed to reduce the use of mains water. This water will be used for cleaning and washing, as well as toilet flushes. All timber used has been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council as being from a well-managed forest. The roof is made from recycled aluminium instead of virgin materials. The automatic doors at each of the five bus stances open only when a bus arrives, enhancing safety but also retaining heat within the building and avoiding excessive openings of the doors. The free-access main entrance uses a revolving door to avoid draughts.|$|E
25|$|BMRCL, in a {{public-private}} partnership, harvests rainwater {{from the}} viaducts {{on the rail}} system. The private partner, Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development (KRIDL), collects the water at multiple points, treats it, and sells it in bulk as potable water. Pipes inside each metro viaduct pillar carry the rainwater from the viaduct down to underground tanks located beneath the median. When these tanks overflow, the water is diverted to 5 metre deep rainwater harvesting pits. Two rainwater harvesting pits are installed between each pillar. The average distance between two pillars is 28 meters. As of March 2017, a 33.48km of elevated metro are covered by the <b>rainwater</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>system.</b> With the completion of Phase 2 of the metro, the BMRCL will cover a total of 58km with rainwater harvesting systems. Around 8 crore litres of water {{are expected to be}} collected annually.|$|E
25|$|Restoration {{work by the}} Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), in {{collaboration}} with Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), began around 1999 after research work, which started in 1997, and was completed in March 2003. Around 12 hectares of lawns were replanted, and over 2500 trees and plants, including mango, lemon, neem, hibiscus and jasmine cuttings, were planted in the gardens. Installation of a new water circulation system for the walkway channels was also undertaken. To ensure that water flowed naturally through the channels and pools on the 12-hectare (30 acre) site {{without the aid of}} hydraulic systems, the water channels were re-laid to an exacting grade of one centimetre every 40 metres (1:4000 slope). This eventually enabled water to flow through the watercourses in the gardens, and dormant fountains to start functioning once again. Other tasks in this mammoth restoration project included setting up a <b>rainwater</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>system</b> using 128 ground water recharge pits, and desilting and revitalising old wells that were discovered during the restoration work. This was first a privately funded collaborative effort {{under the aegis of the}} National Cultural Fund (NCF) by the ASI. Funding included a sum of $650,000 from the Aga Khan Trust for Culture of His Highness the Aga Khan, with help from the Oberoi Hotels Group. In addition, AKTC is conducting a more significant restoration at Babur's tomb, the resting place of Humayun's father in Kabul.|$|E

40|$|Green roofs (GRs) are {{becoming}} a trend in urban areas, favouring thermal performance of buildings, promoting removal of atmospheric pollutants, and acting as possible water collection spots. <b>Rainwater</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>systems</b> in buildings can {{also contribute to the}} management of stormwater runoff reducing flood peaks. These technologies should be enhanced in Mediterranean countries where water scarcity is increasing and the occurrence of extreme events is becoming very significant, as a result of climate change. An extensive pilot GR with three aromatic plant species, Satureja montana, Thymus caespititius and Thymus pseudolanuginosus, designed to study several parameters affecting rainwater runoff, has been in operation for 12 months. Physico-chemical analyses of roof water runoff (turbidity, pH, conductivity, NH 4 (+), NO 3 (-), PO 4 (3 -), chemical oxygen demand) have shown that water was of sufficient quality for non-potable uses in buildings, such as toilet flushing. An innovative approach allowed for the development of an expression to predict a 'monthly runoff coefficient' of the GR system. This parameter is essential when planning and designing GRs combined with <b>rainwater</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>systems</b> in a Mediterranean climate. This study is a contribution to improving the basis for the design of <b>rainwater</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>systems</b> in buildings with extensive GRs under a Mediterranean climate. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
