5|$|In early July 1941, Rejewski and Zygalski {{were asked}} to try solving {{messages}} enciphered on the secret Polish Lacida cipher machine, which was used for secure communications between Cadix and the Polish General Staff in London. Lacida was a <b>rotor</b> <b>machine</b> {{based on the same}} cryptographic principle as Enigma, yet had never been subjected to rigorous security analysis. The two cryptologists created consternation by breaking the first message within a couple of hours; further messages were solved in a similar way.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s, {{several new}} cipher {{machines}} were developed generally based on using typewriter mechanics and basic electrical circuitry. An early example was the Hebern <b>Rotor</b> <b>Machine,</b> {{designed in the}} US in 1915 by Edward Hebern. This system offered such security and simplicity of use that Hebern heavily promoted it to investors.|$|E
25|$|The Enigma was an {{electro-mechanical}} <b>rotor</b> <b>machine</b> {{used for}} the encryption and decryption of secret messages. It was developed in Germany in the 1920s. The repeated changes of the electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard implemented a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which turned plaintext into ciphertext and back again. The Enigma's scrambler contained rotors with 26 electrical contacts on each side, whose wiring diverted the current to a different position on the two sides. On depressing a key on the keyboard, an electric current flowed through an entry drum at the right-hand end of the scrambler, then through the set of rotors to a reflecting drum (or reflector) which turned it back through the rotors and entry drum, and out to cause one lamp on the lampboard to be illuminated.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} other patents for <b>rotor</b> <b>machines</b> issued in 1919, {{and several other}} <b>rotor</b> <b>machines</b> were {{designed}} independently {{at about the same}} time. The most successful and widely used was the Enigma machine.|$|R

50|$|Another early <b>rotor</b> <b>machine</b> {{inventor}} was Dutchman Hugo Koch, {{who filed}} {{a patent on}} a <b>rotor</b> <b>machine</b> in 1919.

50|$|Scherbius {{applied for}} a patent (filed 23 February 1918) for a cipher machine based on {{rotating}} wired wheels, what {{is now known as}} a <b>rotor</b> <b>machine.</b> Scherbius' company also purchased the rights to another patent for a <b>rotor</b> <b>machine</b> from Hugo Koch - patented in 1919. Business was slow enough that the firm was reorganized at least twice in the 1920s.|$|E

50|$|In the United States Edward Hugh Hebern built a <b>rotor</b> <b>machine</b> using {{a single}} rotor in 1917. He became {{convinced}} {{he would get}} rich selling such a system to the military, the Hebern <b>Rotor</b> <b>Machine,</b> and produced a series of different machines with one to five rotors.

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>rotor</b> <b>machines</b> {{modification}} requires {{development of new}} approaches {{to the design of}} specific nodes. As bearings are considered the most important elements of <b>rotor</b> <b>machines,</b> such approaches can imply the application of active control. In the present paper using the example of fluid-film bearings the approach is considered to enchancing energy efficiency of <b>rotor</b> <b>machines</b> by means of generating optimal trajectories. Means are shown to analyze the dynamics of a rotor system and types of the obtained trajectories. The paper also covers the approach to setting the criteria of energy efficiency of rotor’s trajectories. After the optimal trajectory is obtained, active bearings are proved feasible to control the displacement of a rotor by generating a force to match the actual trajectory to the calculated one, and by this to decrease the energy loss...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} be as easy to {{decipher}} as encipher, some <b>rotor</b> <b>machines,</b> most notably the Enigma machine, were designed to be symmetrical, i.e., encrypting twice with the same settings recovers the original message (see involution).|$|R

Several inventors had similar ideas about the same time, and <b>rotor</b> cipher <b>machines</b> were patented four times in 1919.
