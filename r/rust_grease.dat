50|$|Axle {{counters}} {{are also}} useful in instances {{where there are}} issues with water on the track. Generally wheel sensors work under water, {{as long as the}} wiring is above the water. Axle counters do not suffer problems with railhead contamination, e.g. due to <b>rust,</b> <b>grease</b> or compacted leaf residue. Sometimes a train puts down anti-slip sand to increase the deceleration while using a emergency brake, but the sand contaminates the rail and the track circuit stops working. Axle counters are immune to these problems because they do not rely on the contact of wheel with the rail head to provide an electrical circuit.|$|E
5000|$|Ultrasonic {{cleaning}} uses cavitation bubbles {{induced by}} high frequency pressure (sound) waves to agitate a liquid. The agitation produces high forces on contaminants adhering to substrates like metals, plastics, glass, rubber, and ceramics. This action also penetrates blind holes, cracks, and recesses. The {{intention is to}} thoroughly remove all traces of contamination tightly adhering or embedded onto solid surfaces. Water or solvents can be used, {{depending on the type}} of contamination and the workpiece. Contaminants can include dust, dirt, oil, pigments, <b>rust,</b> <b>grease,</b> algae, fungus, bacteria, lime scale, polishing compounds, flux agents, fingerprints, soot wax and mold release agents, biological soil like blood, and so on. Ultrasonic cleaning can be used for a wide range of workpiece shapes, sizes and materials, and may not require the part to be disassembled prior to cleaning.|$|E

This dissertation presents the impact of highway runoff to soil and groundwater. The dissertation is composed of two major distinct parts. ^ First part assessed the bacterial community diversity in highway runoff contaminated sediment from an infiltration basin located in Plymouth, MA that had undergone nineteen years of acetate-based de-icing agents addition followed by three years of acetate-free de-icing agents. Sediment sample from four drilled soil cores collected in two field events documented the change in bacterial community structure with depth and distance from the infiltration basin origin. ^ To meet the objective, a variety of multi-disciplinary techniques were employed. Soil samples were collected, using drilling and core barrel / freeze-shoe coring methods, from different locations and depths to obtain vertical profiles of bacterial distribution along groundwater plume. Analyses of groundwater dissolved oxygen and pH, physical and chemical properties of the soil complemented molecular phylogenetic determinations to distinguish ambient and contaminated plume zones. ^ Analysis of sediment samples from four drilled soil cores by means of 16 S rDNA PCR indicated an overall high bacterial diversity both into the plume and into the ambient aquifer, with no prominent members within the communities. Sequence analyses provided evidences that each sediment sample displayed a specific structure bacterial community. Proteobacteria-affiliated clones (50...|$|R
