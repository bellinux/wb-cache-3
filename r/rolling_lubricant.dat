40|$|Abstract—Vancron 40, a {{nitrided}} powder metallurgical tool Steel, {{is used in}} {{cold work}} applications where the predominant failure mechanisms are adhesive wear or galling. Typical applications of Vancron 40 are among others fine blanking, cold extrusion, deep drawing and cold work rolls for cluster mills. Vancron 40 positive results for cold work rolls for cluster mills and {{as a tool for}} some severe metal forming process makes it competitive compared to other type of work rolls that require higher precision, among others in cold rolling of thin stainless steel, which required high surface finish quality. In this project, three roll materials for cold rolling of stainless steel strip was examined, Vancron 40, Narva 12 B (a high-carbon, high-chromium tool steel alloyed with tungsten) and Supra 3 (a Chromium-molybdenum tungsten-vanadium alloyed high speed steel). The purpose of this project was to study the depth profiles of the ironed stainless steel strips, emergence of galling and to study the lubrication performance used by steel industries. Laboratory experiments were conducted to examine scratch of the strip, galling and surface roughness of the roll materials under severe tribological conditions. The critical sliding length for onset of galling was estimated for stainless steel with four different lubricants. Laboratory experiments result of performance evaluation of resistance capability of rolls toward adhesive wear under severe conditions for low and high reductions. Vancron 40 in combination with cold <b>rolling</b> <b>lubricant</b> gave good surface quality, prevents galling o...|$|E
40|$|Some form of {{lubrication}} {{is required}} {{at each stage}} in the rolling of strip in copper and its alloys. In the finishing operations the problem {{is complicated by the}} need to produce a clean, stain-free surface, which imposes severe limitations on the types of lubricants and additives that can be used. This paper briefly reviews the reasons for lubrication during rolling and then discusses the qualities required in the lubricants, how near the precise requirements can be achieved in practice, and the limitations which currently available lubricants place on the processes. Hot rolling and cold breaking down give little trouble, but intermediate and finish rolling are more critical; the types of both oil-in-water emulsions and neat oils needed are dealt with in some detail for slow- and high-speed mills. The problem of contamination of the <b>rolling</b> <b>lubricant</b> by the oils and greases used as mill lubricants and in mill hydraulic systems is considered and suggestions are presented for minimizing the trouble by the use of special lubricants and modem methods of lubrication, including the latest practices on cluster-type Sendzimir mills. The design of roll coolant systems for modem high-speed four-high strip m i l l s and cluster-type Sendzimir mills is discussed, in so far as it affects the lubricant and strip finish. The paper concludes with a brief review of the problems posed by the latest development of the pendulum mill and their possible solutions...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{topography}} of a bulk material {{is not only}} responsible for its optical appearance; {{it also has a}} strong influence on its physical properties like tensile strength or corrosion resistance. The topography develops during deformation due to extrinsic effects like tool-contact or due to intrinsic effects like microstructure related inhomogeneous deformation. The object of this investigation is {{to examine the relationship between}} microstructure and surface roughness during compressive and tensile deformation. The formation of the matt surface during foil rolling was taken as an example for the compressive deformation and the one-dimensional tensile test was taken as an example for the tensile deformation. The potential applicability of the crystal-plasticity finite element method was tested with regard to microstructure dependent roughness evolution. The microstructure was characterized with EBSD (electron backscattering diffraction) in a high resolution SEM with a field emission gun. The topography was measured using a white light confocal microscope. A small tensile test frame was constructed for use with the confocal microscope thus allowing in-situ surface measurements during tensile testing. The local strain distribution was calculated from the topographic dataset with a photogravimetric method. The foil rolling experiments showed an exponential relation between the roughness of the matt side and the strain. Neither the rolling velocity nor the viscosity of the <b>rolling</b> <b>lubricant</b> had a direct effect on the evolution of the matt side. An increase of the rolling force and a decrease of the viscosity of the separating lubricant reduced the roughness of the matt side because of the shift to from hydrodynamic lubrication to mixed lubrication. The homogenisation procedure after continuous casting and the modification of the chemical composition of the alloy has a strong influence on the roughness. A fine globular grain or subgrain structure has a positive effect. Such a microstructure evolves if a high volume fraction of fine particles is present. The type and fraction of precipitates was simulated with the Calphad-method. The influence of the iron, silicon, manganese and magnesium content on the roughening behaviour was investigated. Two different mechanisms were found for the roughness evolution during tensile testing. As a result of the grain structure a valley and hill structure was formed parallel to the tensile direction. In agreement with earlier publications a linear relation between roughness and strain was found. The second mechanism is based on the formation of shear bands. This leads to a surface texture, which is transverse to the tensile direction and shows an exponential relation to the strain. A method based on the classification of the localized necking of a tensile specimen was developed for the estimation of the roughening tendency of a material. With this method it is possible to make a first approximation of the roughening behaviour of an alloy during rolling without cost intensive rolling experiments. This could be advantageously used during alloy development. With a simple model the possibilities of the implementation of a crystal plasticity material law into the finite element simulation were demonstrated. The model can be used for the simulation of the orange peel effect...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{lubricants}} and roll wear in striprolling. Regarding lubricants, the possibility of introducing newones, which are less detrimental towards environment, isstudied in laboratory scale. This is done for cold rolling,both of an Al- alloy and a low carbon steel. The lubricationperformance of such newly developed 9 ̆ 6 water-based 9 ̆ 6 synthetic lubricants is compared with currently used mineraloils and emulsions. By using the experimental method of"forward slip" measurements combined with slab methodcalculations and FE- simulations, friction coefficients areevaluated for different single pass reductions. Lubricantsbearing capacity and the product surface roughness are alsoevaluated. The results are encouraging. A synthetic water-based lubricant, used in the cold rollingof an Al- alloy, showed good lubrication capability, betterthan the mineral oil but worse than the emulsion. The rolledAl- strip finish {{was found to be}} finest for the syntheticlubricant followed by the mineral oil and the emulsion. Similarresults were obtained from the steel <b>rolling.</b> Here foursynthetic <b>lubricants</b> were compared with two mineral oils andone emulsion. The best lubricant was found to be one of thewater-based synthetics, showing the lowest value of thefriction coefficient and a smooth product surface. The aim of the wear study is to develop an accurateroll-wear prediction for hot strip finishing mills, which takesmore influential parameters into account. A new model of higheraccuracy is presented. This model is based on a large amount ofproduction campaigns. The strategy of the work is describedbelow. After a comprehensive literature study a promising modelstructure was found. The corresponding equation is tested ontwo hot strip mills. Predicted wear is found to be inqualitative agreement with industrial experience and measuredwear. Thus the structure 9 ̆ 6 taking the influence of back-uprolls into account 9 ̆ 6 was chosen for further development. This was done on behalf of results obtained from one mill builtup by six stands and three different work-roll materials. Campaigns of "mixed" and "similar" strip grades were used. Theobtained model is tested successfully in two other hot stripmills. Contradictory to the currently used on-line model, the newmodel takes the work roll flattening and back-up rolls contactarea into consideration. Also the influence of strip- and workroll grades is included. The model enables increased rolledstrip length and prolonged lifetime of the rolls, because ofimproved process control. Further more, grinding cost and timefor roll changing can be minimized. Of course thesepossibilities should result in considerable energy saving.

Different lubrication conditions of lubricating oil, solid lubricant and dry condition were used during ferrite rolling tests of thin interstitial free steel strip on a 2 -high Hille 100 experimental rolling mill. Different rolling speed, rolling temperature and reductions were applied to the rolling process.

40|$|In {{the cold}} <b>rolling</b> process a <b>lubricant</b> is applied on the rolls and/or the strip mate­rial. Due to the {{velocities}} of the rolls and the strip, {{part of the}} lubricant is sheared into the contact causing, amongst others, a reduction of the friction. In this thesis a physical-mathematical model is described which {{makes it possible to}} predict the quantity of lubricant between roll and strip. From this, a number of statements can be made relating to the friction between the roll and the strip. After a short description of the process, an overview is presented of previous re­ search in this field. The literature reveals that the amount of lubricant between the roll and the strip is not sufficient to neglect asperity interaction : the lubrication mechanism is of the mixed type. Furthermore, the literature reveals that, despite enormous progress in this field, the available models can certainly be improved. In the present work the complexity of the problem is initially reduced by assuming the surfaces of the strip and the roll to be perfectly smooth (the so called "smooth sur­ face problem"). For this simplified problem equations have been derived describing the lubricant flow, the deformation of the strip and the deformation of the rolls. Solving the equations analytically is impossible. Consequently, a numerical ap­proach is required. In order to allow for the simulation of surface roughness at a later stage, a dense grid must be applied. By using conventional techniques, computing time will be very long when applying such a fine grid. In order to avoid this problem so-called "Multi-grid techniques" have been used. These techniques are extensively described in this thesis. Next, the application of these techniques to the governing equations describing lubrication in cold rolling is described. In the second part of this thesis a number of simulations have been performed using both steel and aluminium. These simulations resulted, despite the simplifications, in interesting insights with respect to lubrication in cold <b>rolling.</b> The <b>lubricant</b> film thicknesses calculated using the present model results in values which are much larger than those found so far. A deviation up to some 500 % may occur. In the last part of this thesis surface roughness aspects are described and implemented in the model. The thesis is concluded with recommendations for further research...|$|R

Ik ITJRING the past 15 years, a large amount of com-plex and expensive test equipment has been built to enable the measurement of wear and elastohydrodynamic (EHD) oil film thickness in <b>rolling</b> point contacts. <b>Lubricant</b> film thickness has been measured between rolling disks and balls using X-ray beams, laser techniques, and conductance and capacitance measure-ments [l]. 1 Wear is typically measured using a four-ball test 1 Numbers in brackets designate References at end of paper...|$|R
40|$|Rail defects {{are caused}} by fatigue from contact by wheels and by {{defective}} materials.

The Technical Center has conducted technological development for rail defect management such as development of new rail defect detecting cars. Here we will explain current studies on head checks caused in rail heads and transverse cracks (squat) that we are currently working on. 2. 1 Current State of Head Checks In recent years we have found many head checks with breaking out (spalling) shown as in Fig. 1 on high rails at curves with relatively large radii on conventional lines.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the key components that cause variation in the instantaneous fuel consumption of vehicles and their level of impact using an in-depth literature review of technical papers. The literature is rigorously screened using an algorithm that excluded unreliable studies by criteria defined herein. Papers that are identified using this strategy are stratified according to vehicle subsystem and component. Relationships are established between external factors and fuel consumption using linear regression models and ranked by level of importance. Results show that coolant, air conditioning, alternator, <b>rolling</b> resistance and <b>lubricants</b> have an impact on vehicle fuel consumption and its variation.

40|$|To {{extend the}} service life of <b>rolling</b> element {{bearings}} <b>lubricant</b> {{such as oil}} or grease is used. In the lubricated contacts between the rollers and the raceways pressures of several GPa can occur. In that case the elastic deformation of the rollers and the raceways has {{a significant effect on}} the film thickness and shape. Such contacts are referred to as Elasto-Hydrodynamically Lubricated (EHL) contacts. When the thickness of the lubricant film in an EHL contact is reduced due to insufficient supply of lubricant, it is operating in the so-called starved lubrication regime. This typically occurs in grease lubricated rolling element bearings. As most bearings are lubricated with grease, accurate prediction of the EHL film thickness in starved lubricated rolling element bearings is of great importance. The film thickness in a starved EHL contact {{is directly related to the}} thickness of the lubricant layers on the running tracks supplied to the contact. Therefore, accurate models predicting the thickness of these supply layers are a prerequisite to the reliable prediction of the film thickness in rolling element bearings operating in the starved regime. In rolling element bearings the thickness of these supply layers is determined by many effects. In this thesis in particular two effects are modelled: the centrifugal effect and the contact pressure effect. The flow of the liquid layers is effectively modelled using the lubrication approximation. The model is successfully validated experimentally using optical interferometry. It can be used to predict the layer thickness for millions of revolutions and for multiple contacts, without having to solve the starved EHL contact problem for each contact individually...|$|R
40|$|Friction and {{lubrication}} {{are important}} in the roll bite of cold rolling process as they influence the rolling force and other rolling process parameters. The rolling force determines the reduction of strip being rolled, the rolling mill stretch and final strip thickness and shape accuracy. The ability to control more accurately the rolling force in industry is becoming increasingly important. Inaccurate understanding of friction in the roll bite has affected the accuracy of rolling force prediction, and hence the accuracy the final strip thickness. Much research {{work has been done}} in modeling the pressure distribution for the rolling process under fully hydrodynamic lubrication and mixed film lubrication. At the same time, some experimental works have also been done in determining the value of friction coefficient in cold rolling by using embedded pin transducer method in the work roll. This study proposes to determine the friction coefficient and temperature in the roll bite in cold rolling by experimental methods. A sensor roll embedded with loadcells and strain gauged pins was designed and manufactured to determine the friction coefficient along the roll bite in cold rolling. The loadcells and strain gauges were calibrated insitu. The average friction coefficient was also derived from the forward slip which was determined by Laser Doppler method and a strip marking method. The temperature over the roll bite was measured by the embedded thermocouple under different rolling conditions. A large number of experiments were performed to determine the friction coefficient under different reduction, rolling speed, surface roughness, material property and lubricants. The relationships between the rolling parameters such as rolling force, <b>rolling</b> torque, temperature, <b>lubricant,</b> friction coefficient and surface roughness etc. have been discussed. Empirical formulae of friction coefficient and rolling force were given. The measured friction coefficient was used in the calculation of rolling force and torque which were compared with the measured values to validate the measured friction coefficient. A theoretical model was developed by to consider the hydrodynamic inlet zone, plastic work zone and hydrodynamic outlet zone. The effects of lubricant and friction coefficient etc. in the mixed film model were discussed. The effect of the modification to the hydrodynamic film thickness at the inlet caused by the strip elastic recovery at entry was also considered. The temperatures in the lubricant and at the asperity contacts were calculated, respectively. The lubricant temperature at the roll and strip interface and lubricant mean temperature was obtained by using the energy equation. The temperature at asperity contact was calculated by using the moving heat source theory. The temperature calculation considers not only the plastic deformation of the bulk material, but also the frictional heat at the interface. The effects of different friction coefficient, reduction and fraction of plastic work converted to heat have been discussed. The final strip and roll surface calculated temperature was verified by the experimental work and other author 2 ̆ 7 s work...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the tribological behaviours of the rubbing steel/steel pairs with a proposed polyphosphate lubricant at the temperatures of ferrite rolling {{and the effect of}} lubrication on the texture of interstitial free (IF) steel which is rolled in the ferrite temperature range. As complex tribological reactions at the sliding interface depend on the high load and temperature conditions, the thesis will provide a better insight into the possible tribochemical reactions of the given polyphosphate lubricant system which can reduce friction and wear, minimise oxidation, improve surface quality and texture for better drawability. The flow stress and pyroplastic behaviour of two kinds of IF steels were investigated systematically by the compression tests on Gleeble 3500 Simulator in the ferrite (warm) temperature range. Two different constitutive equations were developed from the experimental results and they can be used to reliably predict the flow stress and pyroplastic deformation behaviour of IF steel under ferrite rolling. The rolling of IF steel indicates a better lubrication performance of the polyphosphate lubricant can be achieved over lubricating oil and unlubricated condition. The influence of polyphosphate <b>lubricant</b> during ferrite <b>rolling</b> process was studied in the ferrite temperature range. Another two different lubrication conditions of lubricating oil and dry conditions were used to compare the lubrication performance with proposed <b>lubricant.</b> The <b>rolling</b> force, friction coefficient, roll and strip roughness and strip oxidation can be improved under lubricated conditions. The polyphosphate lubricant showed a better micro surface roughness than under lubricating oil and dry conditions. The mechanism of inorganic polyphosphate lubricant effect on the steel surface was studied to explain the improved lubrication performance during ferrite rolling of IF steel. A series of high temperature tests which included the in-situ thermal evolution test and isothermal reaction test of the polyphosphate lubricant on the steel surface were carried out from 100 to 850 °C by the laser confocal microscope (high temperature microscope). The in-situ thermal evolution test indicated the liquid-like lubricating behaviour of the proposed lubricant. It formed a uniform film covering on the steel surface to further protect the steel surface from the oxidation at elevated temperatures. A homogeneous film was formed which included iron atoms. This phosphate layer adhered well to the steel surface through the chemical reactions at the interface. The IR spectra indicated that for all testing temperatures, the thermal chemical reaction film showed no change of their structure due to its highly thermal stability. High temperature ball-on-disc tribological tests were carried out to simulate the contact, tribological behaviours, chemical conversion evolution and oxidation resistance of polyphosphate lubricant in the roll bite from 600 to 800 °C The polyphosphate reduced the friction between the tribo-pair and increased the wear resistance because of the formation of layered tribo-induced zone. It also presented good lubrication persistence in the long duration tribotests. The IF steel disc outstandingly showed the reduction of wear volume up to 80 %, and the corresponding steel ball showed the reduction up to 60 %. The micro roughness of worn surfaces under lubricated condition was also improved. The dendritic pattern of polyphosphate was observed via SEM/EDS from worn surface. It showed the fluid-like character during the sliding process at elevated temperatures, providing the viscous lubricating ability of molten polyphosphate. The microstructure evolution of the tribo-induced interface was investigated by TEM at the elevated temperatures, as well as the structural change of the lubricant in the molten state and its effect on the oxidation. It clearly showed the inhomogeneously multi-layered structure, including four distinct sublayers from surface to iron oxide base. Higher load always presents a better layer density during the formation of this sublayer. It also provides the motive power for the chemical reaction at high temperatures. The sublayer formation mechanism was presented in the tribo-induced zone. It was mainly due to the molten glassy state, ions exchange and chemical reaction at high temperature. Different sublayer showed various effective functions during contact and relative motion at ferrite temperature range. It showed the load supporting capability, as well as covered cracks and pores to reduce further oxidation. The whole layered tribo-induced zone showed good wear and friction resistance property at ferrite temperatures. The lubrication effect on both macrotexture and microtexture of ferrite rolled strips was analysed with various temperature and rolling reduction by means of XRD and EBSD. Compared with dry rolling condition, the polyphosphate lubricant and lubricating oil pronouncedly improved the surface macrotexture with a higher fraction of γ-value of { 111 } orientation intensity and decreased { 100 } orientation. As a consequence, good drawability can be obtained after ferrite <b>rolling.</b> These <b>lubricant</b> effects mainly acted on the top surface while the center of thickness cross-section showed less effect by the lubricant. The polyphosphate lubricant can effectively suppress the shear texture even at a higher reduction and reduce in-grain shear bands...|$|R
