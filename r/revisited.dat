40|$|Designing {{learning}} experiences {{that support the}} development of coherent understanding of complex scientific phenomena is challenging. We sought to identify analytics that can guide such designs to also support retention of coherent understanding. Based on prior research that distributing study of material over time supports retention, we explored <b>revisiting</b> previously studied material as an analytic. We tested ways to operationalize revisiting: as a general propensity to <b>revisit</b> previously studied material; as a propensity to <b>revisit</b> specific curricular steps; as a general propensity to distribute study by <b>revisiting</b> previously studied material on different days; and as a propensity to distribute study by <b>revisiting</b> specific steps on different days. The specific steps identified as central to the learning design included a static illustration and a dynamic visualization. We modeled <b>revisiting</b> {{in a sample of}} 664 students taught by 7 different teachers using a Web-based Inquiry Science Environment unit. Analysis of log files and regression modeling revealed that a general propensity to <b>revisit</b> did not predict retention. <b>Revisiting</b> the dynamic visualization better supported retention than <b>revisiting</b> static material, but only for distributed <b>revisiting.</b> Our findings suggest that <b>revisiting</b> can be a useful analytic when aligned to the framework guiding learning design...|$|R

40|$|For some reasons, {{tourists}} who experienced visiting a foreign city or country, have an intention to <b>revisit</b> that city or country. This study was aimed to predict intention of Indonesian tourists to <b>revisit</b> Sydney, {{the most popular}} destination among other cities in Australia for Indonesians. The authors applied four predictor variables including tour service quality, image destination, perceived value, and tourist satisfaction. Based on literature review, this combination of variables had never been used by existing researchers. An online survey attracted 227 participants who experienced visiting Sydney before, listed in three big tour operators in Jakarta. Data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. The findings produced three competing models. The first fitted model retained three of four predictor variables: tour service quality and destination image negatively linked to <b>revisit</b> intention whereas tourist satisfaction positively linked to <b>revisit</b> intention. The second fitted model dropped perceived value. The remaining variables directly linked to <b>revisit</b> intention. Additionally, tourists satisfaction became a mediator variable for tour service quality and destination image to link to <b>revisit</b> intention. All relationships between variables were positively significant, unless between tour service quality and <b>revisit</b> intention, and destination image and <b>revisit</b> intention. The third fitted model applied all predictor variables {{and all of them}} had a direct link to <b>revisit</b> intention. Like in the second model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Tourism {{researchers}} have recently focused on repeat visitation {{as a part}} of destination loyalty. Different models have also considered satisfaction as the main determinant of <b>revisit</b> intention, while findings in many studies show it as a continuous issue. This conceptual paper attempts at evaluating recent empirical studies on satisfaction and <b>revisit</b> intention. Based on limitations and gaps in recent studies, the current paper suggests a new model that would be more comprehensive than those in previous studies. The new model offers new relationships between antecedents (destination image, perceived value, specific novelty seeking, and distance to destination) and both of satisfaction and <b>revisit</b> intention. <b>Revisit</b> intention in turn is suggested to be measured in a temporal approach.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of the use of a video camera and video printer compared to a 35 -mm camera on learning by student teachers of the documentation panel-making and <b>revisiting</b> processes as methods of enhancing student teachers 2 ̆ 7 teaching skills, and to determine which medium better assisted pre-service teachers in expanding their understanding of the role of the teacher. This study consisted of two major parts: The first studied documentation panel-making processes, and the second part studied <b>revisiting</b> processes. ^ Eight hypotheses were raised in this study. It is assumed that the quality of documentation panel and <b>revisiting</b> would be constrained or enhanced by the medium of documentation. ^ The participants were 12 undergraduate education majors who were in the process of completing the final preschool practicum. The participants were equally divided in two groups, the video and video printer users, and the videotaped episode and 35 -mm camera users. Six student teachers used a 35 -mm camera and videotaped episodes and the other six teachers used a video camera and video printer to create documentation panels and to <b>revisit.</b> Student teachers created two documentation panels and had two <b>revisiting</b> experiences. ^ The data for this study were derived from 24 documentation panels, 24 interview tapes, and 24 <b>revisiting</b> tapes. ^ Two-way analysis of variance showed that there were no statistically significant differences found in all seven dependent variables by treatment and practice conditions and their interactions. This might be because of the small number of subjects studied. As regards <b>revisiting,</b> the video printer group showed higher scores for both <b>revisiting</b> I and <b>revisiting</b> II than the 35 -mm camera group on the quality of <b>revisiting</b> skills and the degree of temporality on <b>revisiting.</b> ^ The results of analysis of interview responses showed that the unique aspects of each technology affected student teachers 2 ̆ 7 learning in different ways in the documentation panel-making and <b>revisiting</b> processes. The groups using a video camera and video printer displayed a process orientation of children 2 ̆ 7 s learning compared to the use of a 35 -mm camera and videotaped episode group. Also, the video printer group demonstrated better <b>revisiting</b> skills than the 35 -mm camera group when they used their photographs to facilitate children 2 ̆ 7 s construction of knowledge and interpretation of learning processes. Overall, the video printer group demonstrated a better quality of panels and <b>revisiting</b> skills than the 35 -mm camera group. ...|$|R

For dual-arm cluster tools with wafer <b>revisiting,</b> if a swap strategy is applied, {{it forms a}} three wafer periodical process with three wafers completed in each period. Such a period contains three cycles in a <b>revisiting</b> process and another three cycles in non-revisiting process. Hence, analysis and scheduling of dual-arm cluster tools with wafer <b>revisiting</b> become very complicated. In this work, a Petri net model is developed to describe the operations of such tools.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{variation}} among hospitals on pediatric readmission and <b>revisit</b> {{rates and}} {{to determine the number}} of high- and low-performing hospitals. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis using the State Inpatient and Emergency Department Databases from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project with <b>revisit</b> linkages available, we identified pediatric (ages 1 - 20 years) visits with 1 of 7 common inpatient pediatric conditions (asthma, dehydration, pneumonia, appendicitis, skin infections, mood disorders, and epilepsy). For each condition, we calculated rates of all-cause readmissions and rates of <b>revisits</b> (readmission or presentation to the emergency department) within 30 and 60 days of discharge. We used mixed logistic models to estimate hospital-level riskstandardized 30 -day <b>revisit</b> rates and to identify hospitals that had performance statistically different from the group mean. RESULTS: Thirty-day readmission rates were low (1 % of hospitals labeled as different from the mean on 30 -day risk-standardized <b>revisit</b> rates was mood disorders (4. 2 % of hospitals [n = 15], range of hospital performance 6. 3 %- 15. 9 %). CONCLUSIONS: We found that when comparing hospitals' performances to the average, few hospitals that care for children are identified as high- or low-performers for <b>revisits,</b> even for common pediatric diagnoses, likely due to low hospital volumes. This limits the usefulness of condition-specific readmission or <b>revisit</b> measures in pediatric quality measurement. Copyright © 2013 by the American Academy of Pediatrics...|$|R
