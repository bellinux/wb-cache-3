5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric <b>rescue</b> <b>unit</b> may {{be provided}} for emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. The crew would normally start decompression {{as soon as possible}} after launching.|$|E
5|$|Several {{countries}} {{offered to}} assist in both the rescue efforts and the investigation. France offered to send a special <b>rescue</b> <b>unit,</b> and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin offered to send agents with anti-terrorist expertise {{to help in the}} investigation. President Clinton declined Israel's offer, believing that accepting it would increase anti-Muslim sentiments and endanger Muslim-Americans.|$|E

This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E

5|$|Launched {{from the}} EUROSEC Space Centre in Portugal in the {{spacecraft}} Phoenix, Ross and Kane spend {{the first half}} of their six-week round trip in stasis. Three weeks after launch, the astronauts are revived in the planet's orbit. Scans for the existence of extraterrestrial life are inconclusive, and Ross and Kane decide to make a surface landing. As the astronauts descend, an electrical storm damages their Dove lander shuttle, which crashes in a mountainous region near Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. When an air-sea <b>rescue</b> <b>unit</b> returns Ross and Kane, the latter critically injured, to the Space Centre, it appears that the Phoenix mission has returned to Earth.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{protected}} by more than 700 full-time, paid firefighters of the Newark Fire Department (NFD). Founded in 1863, the NFD operates out of 16 firehouses throughout the city that are organized into 3 battalions {{under the command of}} a deputy chief. There is also a Safety Battalion, Battalion2, and a Special Operations Battalion, Battalion 6, on duty 24/7. The NFD operates 16 engine companies, 8 ladder companies, 1 rescue company, an Urban search and rescue (USAR) Collapse <b>Rescue</b> <b>Unit,</b> 2 fire boats, a scuba diving unit, an air cascade unit, a foam unit, a mobile command unit, a HazMat unit, and numerous special, support, and reserve units. The NFD responds to approximately 45,000 emergency calls annually. In 2006, the NFD responded to 2,681 fire and hazardous condition calls.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{members of}} the Kent Archaeological <b>Rescue</b> <b>Unit</b> {{conducted}} a measured survey of the monument. In 2005, Ashbee noted {{that he had found}} evidence of recent metal detectoring activity at the site. On 15 May 2007, the Kentish archaeologist Brian Philp was conducting his regular inspection of the monument when the property owner, Mrs Bygrave, pointed out to him an area where the road was beginning to subside. He alerted Kent County Council, who organised for contractors to investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen; comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.|$|E

40|$|Decision {{support systems}} play an {{increasingly}} important role in disaster management research. Coordination of <b>rescue</b> <b>units</b> during disaster response {{is one of the}} many areas which may benefit from this development. Time pressure, resource shortages, and the interdependence of scheduling and allocation tasks are yet only some challenges that persist to complicate effective coordination. This study investigates the collaboration issue of coordination during emergency response by especially accounting for the fact that incidents might require differently skilled <b>rescue</b> <b>units</b> simultaneously (e. g. both firemen and paramedics). A non-linear optimization model is proposed under the following premises: a) incidents and <b>rescue</b> <b>units</b> are spatially distributed, b) <b>rescue</b> <b>units</b> have specific capabilities which limit their usability, and c) processing is non-preemptive. Due to NP-hardness of the model, we suggest and statistically analyze a Monte-Carlo based simulation approach as a solution heuristic, which is compared to a benchmark using the software MATLAB. 1...|$|R
