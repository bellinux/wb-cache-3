Coexpression of Eag and Sh channel subunits in Xenopus oocytes {{leads to}} accelerated decay of the Sh-like transient K+ current (Chen, M. -L., T. Hoshi, and C. -F. Wu. 1996. Neuron. 17 : 535 – 542). We report that such interaction depends critically on functional expression level (controlled by <b>RNA</b> <b>injection</b> quantities and indicated by current amplitudes) and developmental time after <b>RNA</b> <b>injection.</b> The accelerated decay became apparent 3 days after coinjection and increased thereafter. This {{was observed in}} different ionic conditions and at different voltage steps. However, decay was not accelerated at low expression levels, either within 1 – 2 days after injection or with reduced amounts of RNA. With sequential <b>RNA</b> <b>injection,</b> preformation of either Eag or Sh channels prevented interactions with the other subunit. The carboxyl terminus of Eag {{was found to be}} involved in accelerating, and in retarding recovery from, N-type inactivation. The interaction was reduced upon patch excision in macropatch measurements, suggesting involvement of cytosolic factors. We have reproduced the absence of interaction between Eag and Sh reported previously within 2 days after <b>RNA</b> <b>injection</b> and with low levels of current expression (Tang, C. -Y., C. T. Schulteis, R. M. Jiménez, and D. M. Papazian. 1998. Biophys. J. 75 : 1263 – 1270). Our findings demonstrate that heterologous expression of channels in Xenopus oocytes is a dynamic process influenced by cell physiology and development. These factors must be considered in interpreting the functional properties of heterologously expressed channels...|$|E

In the mouse and other animals, homozygous null mutations in the Tyrosinase gene (Tyr) result in the absence of pigmentation, i. e. albinism.

Here we report a method using lentivirus-delivered RNAi to knockdown the glial enzyme, D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), in the mouse cerebellum. After initial characterisation in vitro, we achieved a 40 - 50 % reduction of DAO mRNA in the cerebellum 7 and 28 days after a single injection of lentivirus encoding a DAO-specific, short-hairpin <b>RNA.</b> <b>Injections</b> also decreased DAO immunoreactivity (- 33 %). The major substrate for DAO is D-serine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) co-agonist. Thus, we also measured whether DAO knockdown impacted on d-serine, or expression of NMDAR subunits, and found that DAO RNAi led to increased cerebellar D-serine levels (+ 77 %), and decreased NMDAR subunit NR 2 A mRNA (- 22 %), but did not affect NR 1 or NR 2 C mRNAs. These data demonstrate the utility of lentiviruses to deliver RNAi to glial cells within the cerebellum, and confirm the role of DAO in D-serine metabolism.

Ndr 1 is expressed maternally, andndr 1 andndr 2 are expressed during blastula stage in the blastoderm margin. During gastrulation,ndrexpression subdivides the shield into two domains: a small group of noninvoluting cells, the dorsal forerunner cells, expressndr 1,whilendr 2 RNA is found in the hypoblast layer of the shield and later in notochord, prechordal plate, and overlying anterior neurectoderm.

Overexpression of Shal by <b>RNA</b> <b>injection</b> into neurons produces a large increase in IA, but surprisingly {{little change in}} the neuron's firing properties. Accompanying the increase in IA is a dramatic and linearly correlated increase in the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih). The enhanced Ih electrophysiologically compensates for the enhanced IA, since pharmacological blockade of Ih uncovers the physiological effects of the increased IA. Expression of a nonfunctional mutant Shal also induces a large increase in Ih, demonstrating a novel activity-independent coupling between the Shal protein and Ih enhancement. Since IA and Ih influence neuronal activity in opposite directions, our results suggest a selective coregulation of these channels as a mechanism for constraining cell activity within appropriate physiological parameters...|$|E

40|$|Neural {{development}} in Drosophila is promoted {{by a family}} of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors encoded within the Achaete Scute-Complex (AS-C). XASH- 3, a Xenopus homolog of the Drosophila AS-C genes, is expressed during neural induction within {{a portion of the}} dorsal ectoderm that gives rise to the neural plate and tube. Here, we show that XASH- 3, when expressed with the promiscuous binding partner XE 12, specifically activates the expression of neural genes in naive ectoderm, suggesting that XASH- 3 promotes neural development. Moreover, XASH- 3 /XE 12 <b>RNA</b> <b>injections</b> into embryos lead to hypertrophy of the neural tube. Interestingly, XASH- 3 misexpression does not lead to the formation of ectopic neural tissue in ventral regions, suggesting that the domain of XASH proneural function is restricted in the embryo. In contrast to the neural inducer noggin, which permanently activates the NCAM gene, the activation of neural genes by XASH- 3 /XE 12 is not stable in naive ectoderm, yet XASH- 3 /XE 12 powerfully and stably activates NCAM, Neurofilament and type III β-tubulin gene expression in noggintreated ectoderm. These results show that the XASH- 3 promotes neural development, and suggest that its activity depends on additional factors which are induced in ectoderm by factors such as noggin...|$|R

Here, we show that morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown of Brachyury (MlBra) in embryos of a ctenophore, one of the most ancient groups of animals, prevents the invagination of MlBra expressing stomodeal cells and is rescued with corresponding <b>RNA</b> <b>injections.</b> <b>Injection</b> of <b>RNA</b> encoding a dominant-interfering construct of MlBra causes identical phenotypes to that of RNA encoding a dominant-interfering form of Xenopus Brachyury (Xbra) in Xenopus embryos. Both injected embryos down-regulate Xbra downstream genes, Xbra itself and Xwnt 11 but not axial mesodermal markers, resulting in failure to complete gastrulation due to loss of convergent extension movements. Moreover, animal cap assay reveals that MlBra induces Xwnt 11 like Xbra. Overall results using Xenopus embryos show that these two genes are functionally interchangeable. These functional experiments demonstrate {{for the first time in}} a basal metazoan that the primitive role of Brachyury is to regulate morphogenetic movements, rather than to specify endomesodermal fates, and the role is conserved between non-bilaterian metazoans and vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|The dorsal-specific {{homeobox}} gene goosecoid (gsc) and the {{bone morphogenetic protein}} 4 gene (BMP- 4) are expressed in complementary regions of the Xenopus gastrula. Injection of gsc mRNA dorsalizes ventral mesodermal tissue and can induce axis formation in normal and UV-ventralized embryos. On the other hand, BMP- 4 mRNA injection, which has a strong ventralizing effect on whole embryos, has been implicated in ventralization by UV, and can rescue tail structures in embryos dorsalized by LiCl. The above-mentioned putative roles for BMP- 4 and gsc are based on gain-of-function experiments. In {{order to determine the}} in vivo role of these two genes in the patterning of the Xenopus mesoderm during gastrulation, partial loss-of-function experiments were performed using antisense <b>RNA</b> <b>injections.</b> Using marker genes that are expressed early in gastrulation, we show that antisense gsc RNA has a ventralizing effect on embryos, whereas antisense BMP- 4 RNA dorsalizes mesodermal tissue. These loss-of-function studies also show a requirement for gsc and BMP- 4 in the dorsalization induced by LiCl and in the ventralization generated by UV irradiation, respectively. Thus, both gain- and loss-of-function results for gsc and BMP- 4 support the view that these two genes are necessary components of the dorsal and ventral patterning pathways in Xenopus embryos...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{homeobox}} gene goosecoid {{was the first}} specific genetic marker of Spemann's organizer in vertebrate embryos to be discovered. In the frog, misexpression of this gene by <b>RNA</b> <b>injection</b> produces duplication of the posterior axis. For these reasons, the recent finding that mice lacking goosecoid function have no early axial defects was rather surprising. Here we assay the neural inducing strength of wild-type and goosecoid-mutant mouse nodes by transplantation into primitive streak stage chick embryos. Wild-type mouse nodes strongly induce the neural-specific transcription factors Sox 2 and Sox 3 in the chick host. Homozygous goosecoid−/− nodes are severely impaired {{in their ability to}} induce both genes. Heterozygous goosecoid+/− nodes induceSox 3 as well as wild-type nodes, but resemble −/− nodes in their limited ability to induce Sox 2. We propose that goosecoid does play a role in regulating the neural inducing strength of the node and that regulative mechanisms exist which mask the early phenotypic consequences of goosecoid mutations in the intact mouse embryo...|$|E

To study this regulation, we have developed an <b>RNA</b> <b>injection</b> assay that faithfully recapitulates the regulation of the endogenous hb message.

40|$|We have {{compared}} the dorsoventral development of hemichordates and chordates to deduce {{the organization of}} their common ancestor, and hence to identify the evolutionary modifications of the chordate body axis after the lineages split. In the hemichordate embryo, genes encoding bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmp) 2 / 4 and 5 / 8, {{as well as several}} genes for modulators of Bmp activity, are expressed in a thin stripe of ectoderm on one midline, historically called "dorsal. " On the opposite midline, the genes encoding Chordin and Anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein (Admp) are expressed. Thus, we find a Bmp-Chordin developmental axis preceding and underlying the anatomical dorsoventral axis of hemichordates, adding to the evidence from Drosophila and chordates that this axis may be at least as ancient as the first bilateral animals. Numerous genes encoding transcription factors and signaling ligands are expressed in the three germ layers of hemichordate embryos in distinct dorsoventral domains, such as pox neuro, pituitary homeobox, distalless, and tbx 2 / 3 on the Bmp side and netrin, mnx, mox, and single-minded on the Chordin-Admp side. When we expose the embryo to excess Bmp protein, or when we deplete endogenous Bmp by small interfering <b>RNA</b> <b>injections,</b> these expression domains expand or contract, reflecting their activation or repression by Bmp, and the embryos develop as dorsalized or ventralized limit forms. Dorsoventral patterning is independent of anterior/posterior patterning, as in Drosophila but not chordates. Unlike both chordates and Drosophila, neural gene expression in hemichordates is not repressed by high Bmp levels, consistent with their development of a diffuse rather than centralized nervous system. We suggest that the common ancestor of hemichordates and chordates did not use its Bmp-Chordin axis to segregate epidermal and neural ectoderm but to pattern many other dorsoventral aspects of the germ layers, including neural cell fates within a diffuse nervous system. Accordingly, centralization was added in the chordate line by neural-epidermal segregation, mediated by the pre-existing Bmp-Chordin axis. Finally, since hemichordates develop the mouth on the non-Bmp side, like arthropods but opposite to chordates, the mouth and Bmp-Chordin axis may have rearranged in the chordate line, one relative to the other...|$|R

About half of the syndecan-overexpressing embryos hatched, and differentiation of epidermis, endoderm, muscle, and notochord was evident. However, the formation of pigment cells of the sensory organs was markedly disturbed. These results indicate that an appropriate level of syndecan expression is required for normal cell adhesion and morphogenesis of the ascidian embryo...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe kinase Mos, which {{activates}} intracellularly the MAP kinase pathway, {{is a key}} regulator {{of animal}} oocyte meiotic maturation. In vertebrate and echinoderm models, Mos RNA translation upon oocyte hormonal stimulation mediates “cytostatic” arrest of the egg after meiosis, as well as diverse earlier events [1 – 5]. Our phylogenetic survey has revealed that MOS genes are conserved in cnidarians and ctenophores, but not found outside the metazoa or in sponges. We demonstrated MAP kinase-mediated cytostatic activity for Mos orthologs from Pleurobrachia (ctenophore) and Clytia (cnidarian) by <b>RNA</b> <b>injection</b> into Xenopus blastomeres. Analyses of endogenous Mos in Clytia with morpholino antisense oligonucleotides and pharmacological inhibition demonstrated that Mos/MAP kinase function in postmeiotic arrest is conserved. They also revealed additional roles in spindle formation and positioning, strongly reminiscent of observations in starfish, mouse, and Xenopus. Unusually, cnidarians were found to possess multiple Mos paralogs. In Clytia, one of two maternally expressed paralogs accounted for the majority MAP kinase activation during maturation, whereas the other {{may be subject to}} differential translational regulation and have additional roles. Our findings indicate that Mos appeared early during animal evolution as an oocyte-expressed kinase and functioned ancestrally in regulating core specializations of female meiosis...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic double {{stranded}} <b>RNA</b> (Poly(I:C)) <b>injection</b> of Crassostrea gigas {{results in}} a systemic antiviral response involving many evolutionary conserved antiviral effectors (ISGs). Compared to mammals, the timing of C. gigas ISG expression to viral or poly(I:C) injection is delayed (> 12 h p. i.). It could be interpreted that a cytokine {{is responsible for the}} systemic, but delayed expression of C. gigas ISGs. We therefore analysed the acellular fraction of C. gigas hemolymph by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) to identify hemolymph proteins induced by poly(I:C). Poly(I:C) injection increased the relative intensity of four protein spots. These protein spots were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as a small heat shock protein (sHSP), poly(I:C) -inducible protein 1 (PIP 1) and two isoforms of C 1 q-domain containing protein (C 1 qDC). RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that the genes encoding these proteins are induced in hemocytes of C. gigas injected with poly(I:C) (p < 0. 05). Proteomic data from this experiment corroborates previous microarray and whole transcriptome studies that have reported up-regulation of C 1 qDC and sHSP during mass mortality events among farmed oysters. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The compact genome of Fugu rubripes, {{with its}} very small introns, {{appears to be}} {{particularly}} suitable to study intron-encoded functions, We have analyzed the Fugu gene for ribosomal protein S 7 (formerly S 8, see Note), whose Xenopus homolog contains in its introns the coding sequences for the small nucleolar RNA U 17. Except for intron length, {{the organization of the}} Fugu S 7 gene is very {{similar to that of the}} Xenopus counterpart. The total length of the Fugo S 7 gene is 3930 bp, compared with 12691 bp for Xenopus. This length difference is uniquely due to smaller introns. Although short, the six introns are longer than the similar to 100 bp size of most Fugu introns, as they host U 17 RNA coding sequences, While four of the six U 17 sequences are 'canonical', the remaining two represent diverged U 17 pseudocopies. In fact, microinjection in Xenopus oocytes of in vitro synthesized Fugu transcripts containing the 'canonical' U 17 f sequence results in efficient production of mature U 17 <b>RNA,</b> while <b>injection</b> of a transcript containing the U 17 psi b sequence does not...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHepatocellular {{carcinoma}} is {{a deadly}} cancer with growing incidence for which immunotherapy {{is one of}} the most promising therapeutic approach. Peptide-based vaccines designed to induce strong, sustained CD 8 + T cell responses are effective in animal models and cancer patients. We demonstrated the efficacy of curative peptide-based immunisation against a unique epitope of SV 40 tumour antigen, through the induction of a strong CD 8 + T cell-specific response, in our liver tumour model. However, as in human clinical trials, most tumour antigen epitopes did not induce a therapeutic effect, despite inducing strong CD 8 + T cell responses. We therefore modified the tumour environment to enhance peptide-based vaccine efficacy by delivering mengovirus (MV) -derived RNA autoreplicating sequences (MV-RNA replicons) into the liver. The <b>injection</b> of replication-competent <b>RNA</b> replicons into the liver converted partial tumour regression into tumour eradication, whereas non-replicating RNA had no such effect. Replicating <b>RNA</b> replicon <b>injection</b> induced local recruitment of innate immunity effectors (NK and NKT) to the tumour and did not affect specific CD 8 + T cell populations or other myelolymphoid subsets. The local delivery of such RNA replicons into tumour stroma is therefore a promising strategy complementary to the use of peripheral peptide-based vaccines for treating liver tumours...|$|R
