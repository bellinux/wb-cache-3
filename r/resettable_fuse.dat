40|$|Composites {{of carbon}} black {{particles}} in polyethylene {{are known to}} exhibit an unusually rapid increase in resistivity as the applied field is increased, making this material useful in automatically <b>resettable</b> <b>fuses.</b> In this application the composite is in series with the circuit it is protecting: at low applied voltages this circuit is the load, but at high applied voltages the composite becomes the load, limiting the current to the circuit. We present a simple model of this behavior {{in terms of a}} network of nonlinear conductors. Each conductor has a conductance that depends on its instantaneous Joule heating. It is shown that in the fusing regime, where the current through the composite decreases with increasing voltage, an plate-like dissipation instability develops normal to the applied field. Experimental evidence of this phenomena is described...|$|R

5000|$|Fig. 3 shows {{a typical}} Pulses Plus schematic. The pack {{includes}} diodes in each branch {{to minimize the}} possibility of reverse charging the cells. PTCs, or positive temperature coefficient thermistors act as <b>resettable</b> <b>fuses.</b> PTCs begin to get warm at a trip current. The warmth increases their resistance which produces even more heat, and the PTC quickly [...] "trips" [...] and shuts off most of the current. The PTC rarely trips in a typical ADCP pack, because the safety circuit is the primary protection against short circuits (defined to be any current above about 8 A). The safety circuit also turns off the pack before its voltage falls below a threshold. If the pack were allowed to fully discharge, one branch could discharge before the others, {{which could lead to}} the discharged branch being charged by the remaining cells. Any attempt to charge a lithium cell is potentially dangerous, and turning the pack off at about 75-80% of its starting voltage prevents this from happening. At this voltage, only around 3% of the capacity remains, but the remaining capacity still allows years for disposal of the pack before it discharges fully.|$|R
25|$|The {{manufacturer}} may {{specify the}} voltage drop across the fuse at rated current. There {{is a direct}} relationship between a fuse's cold resistance and its voltage drop value. Once current is applied, resistance and voltage drop of a fuse will constantly grow {{with the rise of}} its operating temperature until the fuse finally reaches thermal equilibrium. The voltage drop should be taken into account, particularly when using a fuse in low-voltage applications. Voltage drop often is not significant in more traditional wire type fuses, but can be significant in other technologies such as <b>resettable</b> (PPTC) type <b>fuses.</b>|$|R

Then the causes of the observed failures are determined by failure analyses, including the analyses of interconnections between different parts, the microstructures of the polymer composite, the properties (such as crystallinity) of the polymer composite, and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of different parts. The revealed failure causes include the cracks and gaps between different parts, the agglomerations of the carbon black particles, the change in crystallinity of the polymer composite, and the CTE-mismatches between different parts. Cross validation (CV) sequential probability ratio test (CVSPRT) is developed to detect anomalies. CV methods are introduced into SPRT to determine the model parameters without the need of experience and reduce the false and missed alarms. A moving window training updating based dynamic model parameter optimization (MW-DMPO) n-steps-ahead prognostics method is developed to predict the failure. MW methods update the training data for prediction models by a moving window to contain the latest degradation information/data and improve the prediction accuracy. For each updating of the training data, the model parameters for data-trending model are updated dynamically. Based on the developed MW-DMPO method, a MW cross validation support vector regression (MW-CVSVR) n-steps-ahead prediction is developed to predict failures of PPTC resettable fuses in this thesis. The cross validation method is used to determine the proper SVR model parameters.

40|$|Abstract-The {{protection}} of electrical circuits against the overload or short circuits is usually {{achieved by the}} single use of blow-out fuses. The paper contains the examining results of the multiple use of polymer fuses. The static and dynamic characteristics of selected fuses are acquired on the test station. Some interesting features of the polymer fuses, not included in datasheets, are carried out. The courses of characteristics in comparison to their technical data with elements of accuracy analysis are discussed. I. The polymer fuses attributes Fuses are the basic protection devices used in circuits. Except fuses there are also used bimetallic devices. The first ones break the circuit {{in the event of}} short circuit. The second ones provides overload protection. Both devices prevent damage to the connected equipment and cables. The disadvantageous feature of the traditional fuses is their blow-out. In consequence of that there is a break in a circuit and necessity of replacement. The typical bimetallic devices {{does not need to be}} replaced. They can back to their idle state. However they can reset even if the fault is not removed. It causes a cycling on and off between the fault event and a protected state which may damage the equipment. Nowadays above mentioned elements may be replaced by one freed from described problems. It is polymer fuse (PPTC- Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient), called <b>resettable</b> <b>fuse</b> [1 - 14]. It realizes functions like devices above, however it does not need to be replaced and it does not expose the equipment on damage. The PPTC fuses are constructed with a non-conductive polymer plastic, which can change in two phases. In normal state (without a temperature increase) the polymer has a crystalline or semi-crystalline structure, where the molecules form a regular structure (Fig. 1. a). a) b...|$|E
40|$|Composites, {{either in}} solid state or liquid state, {{are widely used}} to improve the {{transport}} properties of the matrix phase in the composites. For instance, high thermal conductivity particles are frequently added into heat transfer liquids, forming colloidal suspensions sometimes also called nanofluids, to increase the liquids thermal conductivity. High electrical and/or thermal conductivity particles are also commonly added into polymers to increase their electrical and thermal conductivities. The properties of composites depend strongly on the microstructures formed. This thesis investigates thermal, rheological, and electrical properties of graphite loaded composites in liquid and solid states. First, we use combined optical microscope and AC impedance spectroscopy technique to study the composite microstructure transformation {{with respect to the}} volume fraction to understand the peculiar thermal conductivity behavior in the graphite suspensions we observed: the thermal conductivity increases more rapidly below the percolation threshold than above it, with a sharp kink at the percolation. Our study suggests that the below the percolation, the aggregation of graphite flakes is tighter and interfacial resistance is smaller, while above the percolation threshold, the aggregation of graphite flakes becomes looser and interfacial resistance is larger. Next, we study rheological properties of graphite-loaded liquids. We observed complicate temperature-dependent rheological properties of graphite suspension at different shear rates and temperature. We rationalize the experimental data using ideas from Stokesian dynamics simulations and combined with understandings of the internal structures of suspensions. Our studies show although Brownian motion is not important for thermal transport, it is important for rheological properties of the graphite-loaded suspensions. Chapter 4 studies thermal and electrical properties of graphite flakes loaded into a material going through liquid-to-solid phase transition in the percolated regime and shows that the transport properties can be switched via the phase transition reversibly, especially achieving high contrast in the electrical conductivity. We found that the stress generated during the freezing regulates the contacts among graphite flakes if a crystal-forming liquid is use, thus leading to a dramatically increase in the electrical conductivity in the solid state. In Chapter 5, we study thermal and electrical conductivities of composites with graphite flakes loaded into ultra-high molecular weigh polyethylene that are stretched at different ratios. The mechanical stretching of the composites affect the morphology and transport properties of both the polymer and the fillers, leading to some interesting thermal conductivity behavior. The graphite-loaded composites in liquid and solid states studies in this thesis may have applications in convective heat transfer, <b>resettable</b> <b>fuse,</b> seasonal regulation of building temperature, thermal interface materials, directional heat spreader, etc. The understanding of structure-property relation could also help uS better design composite materials with superior performance [...] by Jianjian Wang.
