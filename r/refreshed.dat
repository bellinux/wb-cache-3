40|$|Technology obsolescence, {{also known}} as DMSMS (Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages), is a {{significant}} problem for systems whose operational life is much longer than the procurement lifetimes of their constitute components. The most severely affected systems are sustainment-dominated, which means their long-term sustainment (life-cycle) costs significantly exceed the procurement cost for the system. Unlike high-volume commercial products, these sustainment-dominated systems may require design <b>refreshes</b> to simply remain manufacturable and supportable. A strategic method for reducing the life-cycle cost impact of DMSMS is called <b>refresh</b> planning. The goal of <b>refresh</b> planning is to determine when design <b>refreshes</b> should occur (or what the frequency of <b>refreshes</b> should be) and how to manage the system components that are obsolete or soon to be obsolete at the design <b>refreshes.</b> 	Existing strategic management approaches focus on methods for determining design <b>refresh</b> dates. While creating a set of feasible design <b>refresh</b> plans is achievable using existing design <b>refresh</b> planning methodologies, the generated <b>refresh</b> plans may not satisfy {{the needs of the}} designers (sustainers and customers) because they do not conform to the constraints imposed on the system. 	This dissertation develops a new <b>refresh</b> planning model that satisfies <b>refresh</b> structure requirements (i. e., requirements that constrain the form of the <b>refresh</b> plan to be periodic) and develops and presents the definition, generalization, synthesis and application of part-unique temporal constraints in the design <b>refresh</b> planning process for systems impacted by DMSMS-type obsolescence. 	Periodic <b>refresh</b> plans are required by applications that are <b>refresh</b> deployment constrained such as ships and submarines (e. g., only a finite number of dry docks are available to <b>refresh</b> systems). The new <b>refresh</b> planning model developed in this dissertation requires 50 % less data and runs 50 % faster than the existing state-of-the-art discrete event simulation solutions for problems where a periodic <b>refresh</b> solution is required...|$|R

40|$|Caching is an {{effective}} mechanism for reducing bandwidth usage and alleviating server load. However, the use of caching entails a compromise between content freshness and <b>refresh</b> cost. An excessive <b>refresh</b> allows {{a high degree of}} content freshness at a greater cost of system resource. Conversely, a deficient <b>refresh</b> inhibits content freshness but saves the cost of resource usages. To address the freshness-cost problem, we formulate the <b>refresh</b> scheduling problem with a generic cost model and use this cost model to determine an optimal <b>refresh</b> frequency that gives the best tradeoff between <b>refresh</b> cost and content freshness. We prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal <b>refresh</b> frequency under the assumptions that the arrival of content update is Poisson and the age-related cost monotonically increases with decreasing freshness. In addition, we provide an analytic comparison of system performance under fixed <b>refresh</b> scheduling and random <b>refresh</b> scheduling, showing that with the same average <b>refresh</b> frequency two <b>refresh</b> schedulings are mathematically equivalent in terms of the long-run average cost...|$|R

5|$|The {{day after}} the battle, the Spanish army's German regiments, induced by Captain Jean van der Cloester, mutinied again in their quarters, {{claiming}} {{that they had not}} received their monthly pay. Verdugo sent Captain Pedrosa to take news of the Spanish victory to Farnese and, having <b>refreshed</b> his troops, aimed to capture the Niezijl fort with his Walloon regiment, his four cavalry companies and a few volunteers from among the German mutineers. As the season changed and a furious rain started, Verdugo was forced to abandon the project of seizing the fort and returned to Noordhorn. The autumnal floods made the Frisian land impassable for the armies, and thus Verdugo moved with his troops to the dry and gritty land of Drenthe, while Norreys kept the remains of his army behind the IJssel river. A group of 400 Dutchmen in Norreys' army lodged themselves in the town of Keppel, in Gelderland. In January 1582, Verdugo destroyed them and seized Keppel and the castle of Bronckhorst, achieving great success in Gelderland.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{emergence}} of data-intensive applications in mobile en-vironments {{has resulted in}} portable electronic systems with increasingly large dynamic memories. The typical operating pattern exhibited by these applications is a relatively short burst of operations followed by longer periods of standby. Due to their periodic <b>refresh</b> requirements, dynamic memories consume substantial power even during standby and thus {{have a significant impact}} on battery lifetime. In this paper we investigate a methodology for designing dynamic mem-ory with low data-retention power. Our approach relies on the fact that the <b>refresh</b> period of a memory array is dictated by only a few, worst-case leaky cells. In our scheme, multiple <b>refresh</b> periods are used to reduce energy dissipation by selectively <b>refreshing</b> only the cells that are about to lose their stored values. Additional energy savings are achieved by using error-correction to restore corrupted cell values and thus allow for extended <b>refresh</b> periods. We describe an exact O(nkâ 1) -time algorithm that, given a memory array with n <b>refresh</b> blocks and two positive in-tegers k and l, computes k <b>refresh</b> periods that maximize the average <b>refresh</b> period of a memory array when <b>refreshing</b> occurs in blocks of l cells. In simulations with 16 Mb memory arrays and a (72, 64) modified Hamming single-error correction code, our scheme results in an average <b>refresh</b> period of up to 11 times longer than the original <b>refresh</b> period. ...|$|R
5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be <b>refreshed</b> with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweedâred, green, and brown algaeâare eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E
