5|$|Several {{thousand}} animal {{bones were}} discovered in Mummy Cave. While {{the large majority of}} the bones could not be identified, <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) were able to determine the biological origins of over two thousand bones. As at many other archeological sites in the region, significant numbers of Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) and deer from the genus Odocoileus were identified. Of particular interest to biologists was the much larger number of sheep than deer: eighty-eight sheep and fifteen deer were identified. Such a prevalence of sheep over deer is highly unusual for archeological sites in the region, because deer are equally or more plentiful in areas such as the one in which Mummy Cave is located. This anomaly has led <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> UTEP to propose that the site was used as a home base for hunters to operate at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, they {{published a}} retraction after <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> other laboratories {{were unable to}} duplicate the results and the Berkeley lab could not duplicate them either.

5|$|This {{problem has}} been the object of growing concern. For example, <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> the University of Hohenheim are {{studying}} how bees can be poisoned by exposure to seed disinfectants. In France, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned an expert group, the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study on Bees (CST), to study the intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees. <b>Researchers</b> <b>at</b> the Bee Research Institute and the Department of Food Chemistry and Analysis in the Czech Republic have pondered the intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops. Romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from deltamethrin in 2002. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even has published standards for testing chemicals for bee intoxication.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could {{increase}} farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop {{because it can}} provide food, feed and fuel. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} 4.6 billion tonnes {{of uranium}} {{are estimated to}} be in sea water (Japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible). There have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water, but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water. In 2012, ORNL researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed HiCap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Brodie's theories—laid {{out in the}} book—of Smith fathering {{children}} through polygamist relationships {{have been among the}} catalysts for professional genetic genealogy studies.
