40|$|Abstract: The {{disposal}} of industrial wastes {{is a problem}} of increasing importance throughout the world. Sludge from paper mills are produced in large quantities in most industrial nations of the world today due to the large usage of paper, constitute one of our most serious environmental problems. Paper mill sludge has substantially little usage as a material that can be employed in other industrial applications. Because of its non-utility, the paper mill sludge is merely discarded, along with other waste cellulosic fiber, creating a tremendous disposal problem. The characteristics of biosolids are variable and directly related to the technology used to pulp, the wood and manufacture the paper and to the type of effluent treatment that is employed. The aim of this work is to investigate and qualify the dried sludge from a recycled paper mill and the results were compared with the earlier reports and the possibilities of reutilization for composting / soil amendment were evaluated.

Modifications of methods {{for each of these}} techniques are presented. Results from studies of normal ambulatory adults, patients with diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease and hyperlipidem ia are reported. LBT of normal lymphocytes be fore and after ethanol exposure are examined. LBT during pregnancy is evaluated. T cell populations are abnormally high in black diabetics and decreased in patients with sickle cell anemia. B cell subpopulations are increased in patients with sickle cell anemia. LBT responses are decreased in maturity onset diabetes, during pregnancy and in patients with sickle cell disease. Ethanol in amounts attainable during human consumption results in significantly decreased LBT response. CHO metabolism (especially hexose monophosphate shunt [HMPS] and HMPS by pentose sugar <b>recycl</b> ing) is abnormal in diabetic lymphocytes. The low HMPS activity is partially reversible by treatm ent with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors.

40|$|Abstract: A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} to asses the feasibility of composting of source separated organic matter of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated in low, middle and high income areas of Jabalpur city with a population over 5 lack. Results of MSW analysis indicate the presence of high percentage of Biodegradable organic matter, acceptable moisture content and C/N ratio. On windrow composting, not only the volume of the waste was reduced but also produced a crumbly earthy smelling soil-like, compost material. All quality parameters in the compost samples were found to be within the acceptable limits set by international standard. The pH ranged between 7. 8 - 8. 1, organic matter 45 %, moisture 36 % and have acceptable amount of plant nutrients C 35 %, N (0. 05 %), P (0. 002), Na (4. 8 %), K (0. 35 %). The compost quality could further be improved by adding cow manure, poultry manure or yard waste etc. Its use in plant production or land reclamation may be helpful to maintain soil fertility and improve moisture holding capacity. MSW Composting could be adapted country wide to recycle/reuse the organic residue as solid waste management option. Key words: Municipal solid waste (MSW) Composting <b>Recycl...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the {{utilization}} of sealed source for medical, industrial and research purposes has shown an accelerating increase. This situation will lead to increases {{in the amount of}} sealed radioactive. During its use, a sealed radioactive waste will eventually become either a spent sealed source or disused sealed radioactive source (DSRS), due to certain factors. The reduction of the amount of radioactive waste can be executed through the application of reuse and recycle of sealed source. The reuse and recycle policy for spent and disused sealed sources are not already specified yet. The reuse of spent sealed sources can be applied only for the sources which had been used in the medical field for radiotherapy, namely the reuse of a teletherapy Co- 60 source in a calibration facility. The recycle of a spent sealed source can be performed for radioactive sources with relatively high activities and long half-lives; however, the recycling activity may only be performed by the manufacturer. To avoid legal conflicts, in the amendment to the Government Regulation No. 27 Year 2002 on Management of Radioactive Waste, there will be a recommendation for a new scheme in the management of radioactive waste to facilitate the application of the principles of reduce, reuse, and <b>recycl...</b>|$|E
40|$|Web 2. 0 is {{affecting}} {{the structure of}} our society by creating new spaces of freedom, giving voice to any opinion, easing interpersonal relationships, and encouraging the creation of collaborating col-lectivities. Technologies such as blog, podcasting, wiki, and news feeds {{have the power to}} transform every user from a mere information consumer to a potential producer, from a spectator to an actor. The success of YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, and Wikipedia is under everybody’s eyes. Generally speaking, Web 2. 0 is seen as a powerful tool that, by exploiting Internet technologies, supplies services to the society, helping the entire socio-cultural system to develop and to move toward a democratic direction. Unfortunately, this imagery is partially distorted: first, Web 2. 0 and Internet technologies are differently accessible by different parts of the society and, second, as many sociologists pointed out, their applications often appeal to users ’ egoistic purposes and self-celebration spirit [1]. Although we cannot dismiss the value of current Web 2. 0 applications, we are convinced that there is a much more valuable potential that has not been exploited yet. By comparing the immense benefits that Web 2. 0 could bring to the whole society, with its factual employment, one could provocatively change the meaning of the acronym WWW into World Wide Waste.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{research}} is the recycling of polymers from mobile phones hulls discarded and the performance evaluation when they are submitted to the Recycling Cycle of Materials (RCM). The studied material was the ABS/PC blend in a 70 / 30 proportion. Different compositions were evaluated adding virgin material, recy cled material and using the copolymer SBS as impact modifier. In order to evaluate the properties of material's composition, the samples were characterized by TGA, FTIR, SEM, IZOD impact strength and tensile strength tests. At the first stage, the pr esented results suggest the com position containing 25 % of <b>recycl</b> ed material and 5 % of SBS combines good mechanical performance to the higher content of recycled material and lower content of impact modifier providing major benefits to recycling plans. Five cycles (RCM) were a pplied in the second stage; they evidenced a decrease trend considering the impact strength. At first and second cycle the impact strength was higher than reference materia l (A BS/PC blend) and from the fourth cycle it was lower. The superiority impact strength in the first and second cycles can be attributed to impact modifier effect. The thermal tests and th e spectrometry didn’t show the presence of degradation process in the m aterial and the TGA curves demonstrated the process stability. The impact surf ace of each sample was observed at SEM. The microstructures are not homogeneous presenting voids and lamellar appearance, although the outer surface presents no defects, dem onstrating good moldability.

Diante deste contexto, os materiais compÃsitos reforÃados com fibras naturais ganham destaque no meio cientÃfico. No entanto, seu uso ainda Ã tido com desconfianÃa, devido ao pouco ou nenhum conhecimento desses promissores materiais. Perante essa problemÃtica, surgiu a proposta deste trabalho de carÃter investigativo, em que foi pesquisado e desenvolvido um compÃsito totalmente reciclado, de matriz termoplÃstica (PVC reciclado) reforÃado, com fibras obtidas da casca de cocos verdes descartados. Para esse objetivo foram utilizadas diversas ferramentas de caracterizaÃÃo fÃsica, quÃmica, tÃrmica e mecÃnica, sendo os valores dos campos de deformaÃÃo obtidos pela CorrelaÃÃo de Imagem Digital (CID), comparando a imagem do corpo nÃo deformado com imagens do corpo deformado.

However, its utilization is still seen with suspicion due to little or no knowledge of these pr omising materials.

40|$|Although {{the rare}} earth {{elements}} (REE) are playing {{a key role in}} our lives, their recycling ratio is close to 1 % [1]. The biggest markets for REE are lamp phosphors (LP) and permanent magnets, making up almost 75 % of all REE trade. This work focuses on LP recycling. The most common recycling route for the LP is leaching, followed by solvent extraction (SX) [2]. SX is usually undertaken by batteries of mixer – settlers in series. The phosphors studied is yttrium oxide (YOX) red phosphors which is of highest economical importance [1] since it contains 20 wt. % REE (95 mol % Y and 5 mol % Eu). Microstructured extractors are known for high mass transfer area per volume. They were previously used for actinide [3] and REE [4] separation. However, currently there is no study on SX of Eu and Y in microchannels especially with the perspective of industrial application. Our aim is to optimize process parameters and investigate the possible improvements of retrofitting a microchannel mixer and a milliliter size settling vessel to the existing SX of red phosphors. For the SX experiments, a synthetic aqueous leachate of Eu and Y was used with a total REE concentration of 0. 1 mol. L- 1. The pH of the aqueous phase was varied with HCl between 1 and 4. The organic phase was the industry standard extracting agent di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (DEHPA) in kerosene. The mixer was assembled using 0. 1 – 0. 75 mm FEP tubing. The 810 mm tube was fitted to a T-junction which was fed by 2 syringe pumps to supply the two phases (Fig. 1). The total flow rate was varied between 0. 03 and 4. 5 ml. min- 1 giving slug flow regime with passage time of 314 and 2. 5 seconds, respectively. The phase ratio was varied between 0. 1 and 2. The settler volume was 1 ml, which was sufficient to give a settling time varying from 0. 2 to 30 min. The optimum residence time was found to be 30 s in the mixing channel, allowing extraction equilibrium to be reached, while 20 s in the settler was found to yield effective separation. Overall, the mixing – settling time is up to 25 times faster than in conventional systems. Forward and reverse mass transfer coefficients were calculated by fitting an analytical model to the experimental data (Fig. 2). The optimum pH, phase ratio and DEHPA concentration are found, making these results applicable to the current REE recycling route. Reference 1 : K. Binnemans, p. T.
