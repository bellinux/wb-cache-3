25|$|Non-deliverable {{forwards}} (NDF): A strictly risk-transfer {{financial product}} {{similar to a}} Forward Rate Agreement, but used only where monetary policy restrictions on the currency in question limit the free flow and conversion of capital. As the name suggests, NDFs are not delivered but settled in a <b>reference</b> <b>currency,</b> usually USD or EUR, where the parties exchange the gain or loss that the NDF instrument yields, and if the buyer of the controlled currency truly needs that hard currency, he can take the reference payout {{and go to the}} government in question and convert the USD or EUR payout. The insurance effect is the same; it's just that the supply of insured currency is restricted and controlled by government. See capital control.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of whether foreign investments should be systematically hedged against currency risk has not been clearly answered to date. Numerous theoretical and empirical studies have provided contradictory conclusions. This paper examines to what extent foreign bonds and equities are exposed to currency risk. Risk and return of different strategies are aggregated over five <b>reference</b> <b>currencies</b> for a period from 1985 to 2000. The advantage of this method is that the results do not depend much on the time period chosen. Empirical evidence confirms the hypothesis that currency hedging should be fully applied to foreign bonds, whereas foreign equities should not or only be partially hedged. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{performance}} of mean-risk efficient portfolios, several methods of portfolio comparison have been developed. In this paper we analyze the second-order stochastic dominance efficiency of portfolios on the mean-risk efficient frontier assuming that the risk is represented by standard deviations and concordance matrices {{set up on the}} basis of Pearson's linear correlation, Spearman's rho, or Kendall's tau. Empirical analysis of the market returns of selected Asia-Pacific stock markets is carried out considering both the U. S. dollar and euro as <b>reference</b> <b>currencies,</b> and different periods: before and during the subprime crisis. Measures and portfolios on the mean-risk efficiency frontier that should be of interest to at least one risk-averse investor are empirically documented. Web of Science 50124022...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between precisely timed macroeconomic “news” (or “surprises”) and the immediate currency price fluctuations that surround them. Using data from 2005 - 2011, I find significant movements in foreign exchange markets around a variety of announcements (unemployment, GDP, retail sales, inflation) for three different countries (United States, Australia, Canada). My results demonstrate that in the very short-run, as in the long run, {{the value of a}} country’s currency is driven by its macroeconomic fundamentals. Upon further investigation, this paper also uncovers the following financial phenomena in these foreign exchange responses to macroeconomic surprises: asymmetric response, nonlinearity, financial stress, liquidity, and exchange rate specificity. These phenomena refer to the difference in responses between: positive and negative surprises, big versus small surprises, pre-crisis versus crisis surprises, ten- versus sixty-minute returns, and two distinct <b>reference</b> <b>currencies,</b> respectively...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} changes in the Romanian currency exchange rates against the US dollar and the euro on an investment in the Romanian stock market {{from the perspective of a}} US dollar and euro based investor. Our analysis is directed towards identifying the significance of exchange rate volatility for the total risk of a Romanian investment from the perspective of investors with the US dollar and euro as <b>reference</b> <b>currencies.</b> Our results indicate that during more turbulent times investors were better off if invested in their home markets. We also find that the exchange rate risk decreased the risk that a US dollar or a euro-based investor was exposed to in Romania. The contribution of exchange rate risk to the risk of an international investor diversified in his home market and the Romanian market is small, even negative, with no significant differences turbulent versus normal times.

40|$|Introduction:The Internet is {{a widely}} used {{information}} resource for patients with mesothelioma. The goal {{of this study is}} to assess the content and quality of mesothelioma information presented on the internet using Google as a search engine, as well as to test the hypothesis that more popular sites (i. e., higher Google rank) are of higher quality. Methods:The top 100 websites appearing in Google using the terms “mesothelioma” were included in the study. Websites were evaluated using (a) JAMA benchmarks (authorship, <b>references,</b> <b>currency,</b> and disclosure), and (b) an Information score (IS) that awarded websites points (0 – 100) for specific information on various aspects of mesothelioma. Results:Of the top 100 websites identified, 84 websites were suitable for scoring. Only 5 (6. 0 %) sites met all 4 criteria of the JAMA benchmarks. The mean IS was 23. 8 (range, 0 – 86). There was a weak but significant positive correlation with Google ranking of websites and IS (r 2 = 0. 275, p = 0. 006). Conclusions:There is marked variation in the quality, integrity, and currency of the information in educational websites for mesothelioma patients. Google ranking has shown a weak but significant positive correlation to the quality of medical information relating to mesothelioma...|$|R
50|$|A {{currency}} {{system that}} establishes a trading range that a currency's exchange rate can float between. A currency band represents the price floor and ceiling {{within which the}} price of a given currency can trade, and is like a hybrid of a fixed exchange rate and a floating exchange rate. The currency band restricts how much the price can move relative to a <b>reference</b> <b>currency</b> or currencies.|$|E
5000|$|In modern {{monetary}} policy, a devaluation is {{an official}} lowering {{of the value}} of a country's currency within a fixed exchange rate system, by which the monetary authority formally sets a new fixed rate with respect to a foreign <b>reference</b> <b>currency</b> or currency basket. In contrast, a depreciation is a decrease in a currency's value (relative to other major currency benchmarks) due to market forces under a floating exchange rate, not government or central bank policy actions.|$|E

30|$|Very few {{papers have}} {{explored}} PPP {{in the context}} of data on Asian exchange rates thus far. Kim et al. 2009 expressed concerns over the PPP assumption in Southeast Asian countries. Investigations of the nonlinear PPP relationship using Southeast Asian data were conducted by Aggarwal et al. (2000), Zurbruegg and Allsopp (2004), and Wu et al. (2004). Their findings show that the unit root null rejection speed is larger {{in the case of a}} structural break investigation. Aggarwal et al. (2000) found that the relationship between exchange rate and price levels of two nations were stronger when the Japanese yen was considered as a numeraire compared to other <b>reference</b> <b>currencies.</b> Zurbruegg and Allsopp (2004) found that the exchange rates of Hong Kong, Singapore, Philippines, South Korea, Japan, and Malaysia, converged to the long-run PPP. They advocated that the PPP hypothesis may be investigated further in the contexts of Indonesia and Thailand. Wu et al. (2004) used monthly data and found that real exchange rates among Pacific Basin countries are mean reverting. Unlike the results obtained from the monthly data, the authors obtained mixed results while considering quarterly data. They rejected the unit-root hypothesis that real exchange rates are nonstationary only in Thailand, the Philippines, and South Korea out of eight countries, namely, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea, based on the Zivot-Andrews statistic.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} link between {{exchange}} volatility and exports in Egypt by combining wavelet analysis with an optimal GARCH model chosen among various extensions. The observed outcomes reveal that this relationship is complex and depends then widely to frequency-to-frequency variation and slightly to leverage effect and to switching regime. Indeed, it is well shown that at the low frequency, the coefficient associated to exchange rate volatility’s effect on trade performance is more intense than that at the high frequency and conversely when subtracting energy share from the total of exports. We attribute the apparently conflicting results to the financial speculation, the composition of trade partners and the choice of <b>reference</b> basket’s <b>currencies.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Currency risk is {{the risk}} that the value of the {{currency}} a bond pays out will decline compared to the holder's <b>reference</b> <b>currency.</b> For example, a German investor would consider United States bonds to have more currency risk than German bonds (since the dollar may go down relative to the euro); similarly, a United States investor would consider German bonds to have more currency risk than United States bonds (since the euro may go down relative to the dollar). A bond paying in a currency that does not have a history of keeping its value may not be a good deal even if a high interest rate is offered.|$|E
50|$|The top reserve {{currency}} is generally {{selected by the}} banking community for the strength and stability {{of the economy in}} which it is used. Thus, as a currency becomes less stable, or its economy becomes less dominant, bankers may over time abandon it for a currency issued by a larger or more stable economy. This can take a relatively long time, as recognition is important in determining a {{reserve currency}}. For example, it took many years after the United States overtook the United Kingdom as the world's largest economy before the dollar overtook the pound sterling as the dominant global reserve currency. In 1944, when the US dollar was chosen as the world <b>reference</b> <b>currency</b> at Bretton Woods, it was only the second currency in global reserves.|$|E

50|$|Under a fixed {{exchange}} rate currency regime, a country's currency is tied in value to another single currency or to a basket of other currencies (or sometimes to another measure of value, such as gold). A {{fixed exchange}} rate is usually used to stabilize {{the value of a}} currency, vis-a-vis the currency it is pegged to. It can also be used as a means to control inflation. However, as the value of the <b>reference</b> <b>currency</b> rises and falls, so does the currency pegged to it. This essentially means that the inflation rate in the {{fixed exchange rate}} country is determined by the inflation rate of the country the currency is pegged to. In addition, a fixed exchange rate prevents a government from using domestic monetary policy in order to achieve macroeconomic stability.|$|E
