Therefore, foreign direct investments are those types of investments in which investors issuers of investment flows have the ability to control and decision on the activity of economic agents receivers of investments.

40|$|Romania {{has been}} the sixth among the European Union {{countries}} {{with a high level}} of commercial deficit of 3. 7 billion Euros during the first five months of 2009, according to the data published by Eurostat. The commercial deficit of Romania decreased 2. 5 times between January and May, as compared to the same period in 2008, while the imports diminished by 36 %, faster than the exports, which decreased by 21 % as compared to the first five months of 2008. For the business domain, a decrease from plus 7 - 8 % to minus 7 - 8 % represents a real catastrophe, bankruptcies, relocation of some economic sub-domains. Therefore it is necessary that the Romanian government should take several urgent measures, especially fiscal, which could allow the quick development of the businesses, as the only solution for having a healthy economy in Romania. Even if the representatives of the state could be tempted to take short-term measures, increasing the added value tax – a way to bring money to the budget – we think that the government could find other average and long term economic measures, such as: not assigning taxes for <b>reinvested</b> <b>profit,</b> supporting the export production by warranties and counter-warranties, designing helping solutions for IMMs (small and medium companies), incrementing the trust fund for the rural credits etc...|$|E
40|$|The capital {{structure}} {{refers to the}} long-term financing types used by the enterprises (for example, <b>reinvested</b> <b>profit,</b> long-term shares and debts) {{and the way they}} are financed by a combination of the own capital and debts. An optimal structure of the capital involves making some important decisions regarding the maximization of the enterprise value by their managers. But these decisions are not important only for maximizing the enterprise value, but also for the impact they have on the enterprises ability to face the competition existing on the market. An optimal structure of the capital should provide to the shareholders bigger gains than the ones they would gain from an economical entity fully financed by the own capitals. In the attempt to explain the way the enterprises finance their assets and the factors influencing these financing decisions, a series of theories and models of the {{capital structure}} have been suggested. These theories and models try to explain the percentage of the debts and of the own capital found in the enterprises balance sheet. Among the theories of the capital structures that have been imposed in time, Modigliani and Miller’s theorem (1958) may be considered as the starting point of explaining the capital structure, although, it subsequently proved to be a purely theoretical model with no solid empiric funding. The basic idea of this classic theory is that, {{in the absence of the}} taxation and on a perfect market, the value of an enterprise is not influenced by the way it is financed. ...|$|E

Attention is given to policy issues, such as the relationship between savings, investments and government deficits, <b>reinvested</b> <b>profits,</b> official transfers from the European Commission and private transfers. The overall situation in the sustainability of current account deficits in studied transition countries is characterised as steadily improving {{and the majority of}} economies reached a stage where the current account is not an immanent threat to their growth any longer. However, economic policies in many of the countries need important adjustments {{in order to keep the}} economies in macroeconomic equilibrium. Particularly the trade deficit has been causing problems to external equilibrium. It is apparent that fiscal deficits, that have been on a rise in the last 2 - 3 years, are becoming the dominant factor behind the current account disequlibria. <b>Reinvested</b> <b>profits</b> of foreign investors and current transfers have been becoming gradually the instrument for bringing the current account deficits closer to their sustainable levels.
