5|$|Feed-in tariffs are {{designated}} prices {{which must be}} paid by utility companies for each kilowatt hour of renewable electricity produced by qualifying generators and fed into the grid. These tariffs normally represent a premium on wholesale electricity prices and offer a guaranteed <b>revenue</b> <b>stream</b> to help the power producer finance the project.|$|E

The {{system does not}} have a dedicated <b>revenue</b> <b>stream</b> as other cities' mass transit systems do. Critics allege that this has contributed to Metro's recent history of maintenance and safety problems.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century the IOC ran on a small budget. As {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest. Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making. Brundage's resistance to this <b>revenue</b> <b>stream</b> meant the IOC left organising committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols. When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45million. This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights. When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.|$|E
40|$|The Islamic State’s ambitious goals {{have led}} to the {{organization}} obtaining a large amount of costs. However, the Islamic State does not have adequate <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> to maintain these expenditures. This paper compares the Islamic State’s costs and <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> with two similar organizations, Hizballah and Al Qaeda. The comparison will explain that the Islamic State’s <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> are not as efficient and diversified as Hizballah and Al Qaeda’s <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> have historically been. As a result of inefficient and unvaried <b>revenue</b> <b>streams,</b> the Islamic State will be forced to structurally change...|$|R

5|$|Even {{before the}} Chicago Fire, the block {{was home to}} one of Chicago's largest theaters. During the late 19th century, tall office {{buildings}} proliferated on the block. By 1970, the block was densely developed with 11 buildings, housing theaters, offices, a YMCA, and retailers like Stop & Shop, a grocer. On June 14, 1973, Mayor Richard J. Daley announced a broad urban renewal initiative centered on the North Loop theater district. Over the ensuing 16 years, numerous private developers, notably the Rubloff Company and JMB Realty, planned large mixed-use developments on the site, with a mall along State Street and hotels and office towers above. Property assembly was facilitated by Mayor Harold Washington's creation of the North Loop tax increment financing district in 1983, which gave the urban renewal effort a steady <b>revenue</b> <b>stream</b> and eminent domain authority.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{provided}} for a cash grant of $12.5 million (about $94 million at 2007 prices) to be disbursed to the Alaskan {{government in a}} number of phases, to fund the construction of mental health facilities in the territory. To meet the ongoing costs of the program, the bill transferred one million acres (4,000km²) of federally owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new Alaska Mental Health Trust as a grant-in-aid—the federal government owned about 99% of the land of Alaska at the time. The trust would then {{be able to use the}} assets of the transferred land (principally mineral and forestry rights) to obtain an ongoing <b>revenue</b> <b>stream</b> to fund the Alaskan mental health program. Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood.|$|E
5|$|Avery Brundage, as {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interests as he felt that the Olympic movement should be completely separate from financial influence. The 1960 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of corporate sponsorship of the Games. Despite Brundage's strenuous resistance the commercialisation of the Games continued during the 1960s, and revenue generated by corporate sponsorship swelled the IOC's coffers. By the Grenoble Games, Brundage had become so concerned about the direction of the Winter Olympic Games towards commercialisation that, if it could not be corrected, he felt the Winter Olympics should be abolished. Brundage's resistance to this <b>revenue</b> <b>stream</b> meant that the IOC was unable to gain a share of the financial windfall that was coming to host cities, and had no control over the structuring of sponsorship deals. When Brundage retired the IOC had $2million in assets; eight years later its accounts had swelled to $45million. This was due to a shift in ideology among IOC members, towards expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.|$|E

25|$|Project finance, i.e. {{financing}} secured {{primarily by}} the projected <b>revenue</b> <b>stream</b> of the project, has been commonly used to finance wastewater treatment plants in Saudi Arabia. In May 2002 the first wastewater contract in Saudi Arabia financed in this way, in this case as a BOT contract, was awarded to a consortium of local firms. The consortium was to rehabilitate, operate, maintain and upgrade the wastewater system of the Jeddah Industrial City {{over a period of}} 20 years and invest US$32 million.

40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} market, a well-integrated {{business model}} {{can play an}} important role for a competitive advantage. One tool to create business models is the business model canvas. This method is used by many big organizations, and among these users is Communication Ltd. They are currently working on changing their focus from product to service. This change requires some big changes in the company´s business models, <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> and in their value proposition. The goal of this thesis is to analyse new possible <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> and also investigate if these could be of use for Communication Ltd. To reach this goal this thesis uses a theoretical base along with empirical data such as interviews, secondary data and a study of <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> in external markets. The conclusion reached in this thesis is that going from a product focus to a service focus requires structural changes in <b>revenue</b> <b>streams,</b> but also a clear communication of the value an organization is offering their customers. Furthermore for an organization to meet future customer needs, new types of <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> must be implemented. One solution to this could be for an organization to offer different types of memberships where different values are bundled together deepening on what the customers’ demands...|$|R

This study shows that current <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> of cloud-based platforms are unpretentious and follow simple patterns. Most cloud-based platform providers focus only on direct <b>revenue</b> <b>streams,</b> which are typically based upon subscription fees. Multi-sided business models and innovative ways of revenue generation are rarely present, even though the manner in which cloud platforms are commercialized is the deciding factor for the economic outcome...|$|R

25|$|Under the {{subscription}} model, {{the credit}} rating agency {{does not make}} its ratings freely available to the market, so investors pay a subscription fee for access to ratings.
