5|$|A small insectivorous bird, it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} by mammals, such as cats and mustelids, and birds, particularly hawks of the genus Accipiter. Its large <b>range</b> <b>and</b> population mean that its status is secure, although one subspecies is probably extinct.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{in central}} California of the {{subspecies}} propinquus {{are considered to}} be still increasing their <b>range,</b> <b>and</b> this is probably the case elsewhere in the U.S.A.|$|E
5|$|Extinction is {{the result}} of the {{elimination}} of the geographic range of a species with a reduction of its population size down to zero. The factors that affect biogeographic <b>range</b> <b>and</b> population size include competition, predator-prey interactions, variables of the physical environment, and chance events.|$|E

5|$|In 1829 Hall J. Kelley led a {{campaign}} to rename the Cascade Range as the President's <b>Range</b> <b>and</b> also to rename each major Cascade mountain after a former President of the United States. In his scheme Mount St. Helens was to be renamed Mount Washington.|$|E
5|$|In horticulture, several species, cultivars and hybrids are used. Because {{of their}} wide <b>range</b> <b>and</b> many variations, the most {{important}} are those derived from E. gutatta and E. lutea. E. cuprea alone has at least 10 cultivars and hybrids.|$|E

When initially released in 2008, the DE421 ephemeris covered the years 1900 to 2050. An additional data release in 2013 extended the coverage to the year 2200.|$|R
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} found some {{traditional}} Russulaceae species to comprise several cryptic species (see Systematics and taxonomy: Species diversity). This may imply that distribution <b>range</b> <b>and</b> population size for each of such distinct species are smaller than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Rotational {{transitions}} {{of various}} isotopic forms {{of carbon monoxide}} (for example, CO, CO, and CO) are detectable in the submillimeter wavelength <b>range,</b> <b>and</b> {{are used in the}} study of newly forming stars in molecular clouds.|$|E

30|$|If the BS {{knows the}} numbers of BR, Initial <b>Ranging,</b> Periodic <b>Ranging,</b> <b>and</b> Handover <b>Ranging</b> sent by a MS next time, the BS can adjust the {{allocation}} of the ranging codes in each <b>ranging</b> code subgroup <b>and</b> improve the transmission success rate of a MS in sending the <b>Ranging</b> <b>and</b> BR messages. In the real world, however, we cannot know {{the exact number of}} the <b>Ranging</b> <b>and</b> BR messages sent by a MS next time. As a compromise, we consider that each network user has the feature of temporal locality [4] in transmitting data, that is, having a high probability to transmit data next time after successfully transmitting data this time. Based on the feature of temporal locality, accordingly, we forecast {{the numbers of}} BR, Initial <b>Ranging,</b> Periodic <b>Ranging,</b> <b>and</b> Handover <b>Ranging</b> sent by a MS next time.|$|R
