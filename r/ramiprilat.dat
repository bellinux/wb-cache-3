Plasma concentration and area under the concentration-time curve until the last measured concentration (AUCt) data of ramipril and its active metabolite <b>ramiprilat</b> (-diacid) were obtained from a randomised, cross-over bioequivalence study in 36 subjects (18 females and 18 males). Participants received a single 5 -mg oral dose of two different formulations of ramipril (Formulation I and II). Plasma ramipril and <b>ramiprilat</b> concentrations were determined according to validated methods involving liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total number of 2 � 34 available plasma concentration-time curves of both the parent drug and the metabolite could be analysed, and variations (50 � 100 % coefficient of variation [CV]) in plasma concentrations of both parent drug and metabolite were found. With both the formulations, the mean plasma concentrations-time curves of males and females were identical. The groups of female and male volunteers showed similar yields (AUCt = mg. h/L) of the metabolite <b>ramiprilat</b> (p = 0. 37); however, females showed a higher AUCt/kg than males (p = 0. 046). This difference was solely attributed to the difference in body weight between males and females (p = 0. 00049). In both male and female groups, a subject-dependent yield of active metabolite <b>ramiprilat</b> was demonstrated, which was independent of the formulation. There is a large variation in the <b>ramiprilat</b> t 1 / 2 β (50 � 60 % CV). There is a group of subjects who showed a t 1 / 2 β of approximately 80 h (15 % CV), and two apparent groups with a longer t 1 / 2 βfor each formulation (124 h, 22. 5 % CV; 166 h, 21. 6 % CV, respectively, p = 0. 0013). This variation in the terminal half-life of <b>ramiprilat</b> is not sex related. In all three groups of half-lives, the corresponding Cmax values (mean � SD) of <b>ramiprilat</b> in males and females were identical. Thus, with identical Cmax and half-lives, the difference found in the AUCt /kg of <b>ramiprilat</b> must be due to the difference in dose, as the consequence of the difference in body weight, following a standard dose of 5 mg in both males and females. This study showed clearly that despite subject-dependent hydrolysis of ramipril to the active metabolite <b>ramiprilat,</b> the variability in the rate of hydrolysis between males and females is similar.

40|$|Abstract Background The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have {{complicated}} and poorly characterized pharmacokinetics. There are two binding sites per ACE (high affinity "C", lower affinity "N") that have sub-nanomolar affinities and dissociation rates of hours. Most inhibitors are given orally in a prodrug form that is systemically converted to the active form. This paper describes {{the first human}} physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of this drug class. Methods The model {{was applied to the}} experimental data of van Griensven et. al for the pharmacokinetics of <b>ramiprilat</b> and its prodrug ramipril. It describes the time course of the inhibition of the N and C ACE sites in plasma and the different tissues. The model includes: 1) two independent ACE binding sites; 2) non-equilibrium time dependent binding; 3) liver and kidney ramipril intracellular uptake, conversion to <b>ramiprilat</b> and extrusion from the cell; 4) intestinal ramipril absorption. The experimental in vitro ramiprilat/ACE binding kinetics at 4 °C and 300 mM NaCl were assumed for most of the PBPK calculations. The model was incorporated into the freely distributed PBPK program PKQuest. Results The PBPK model provides an accurate description of the individual variation of the plasma ramipril and <b>ramiprilat</b> and the <b>ramiprilat</b> renal clearance following IV <b>ramiprilat</b> and IV and oral ramipril. Summary of model features: Less than 2 % of total body ACE is in plasma; 35 % of the oral dose is absorbed; 75 % of the ramipril metabolism is hepatic and 25 % of this is converted to systemic ramiprilat; 100 % of renal ramipril metabolism is converted to systemic <b>ramiprilat.</b> The inhibition was long lasting, with 80 % of the C site and 33 % of the N site inhibited 24 hours following a 2. 5 mg oral ramipril dose. The plasma ACE inhibition determined by the standard assay is significantly less than the true in vivo inhibition because of assay dilution. Conclusion If the in vitro plasma binding kinetics of the ACE inhibitor for the two binding sites are known, a unique PBPK model description of the Griensven et. al. experimental data can be obtained. </p...|$|E

ACE is not the only kinin degrading enzyme in the rat heart. Since aminopeptidase P (APP) has been shown to participate in myocardial kinin metabolism to the same extent as ACE, the aims of the present study were to investigate whether (a) inhibition of APP leads to a reduction of myocardial infarct size in a rat model of acute ischaemia and reperfusion, (b) reduction of infarct size is mediated by bradykinin, and (c) a combination of APP and ACE inhibition leads to a more pronounced effect than APP inhibition alone. Pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats were subjected to 30 [*]min left coronary artery occlusion followed by 3 [*]h reperfusion. The APP inhibitor apstatin, the ACE-inhibitor <b>ramiprilat,</b> or their combination were administered 5 [*]min before ischaemia. Rats receiving HOE 140, a specific B 2 receptor antagonist, were pretreated 5 [*]min prior to enzyme inhibitors. Myocardial infarct size (IS) was determined by tetrazolium staining and expressed as percentage of the area at risk (AAR).

40|$|Abstract—Inhibitors of {{angiotensin}} I–converting enzyme (ACE) {{are very}} efficacious in the potentiation {{of the actions}} of bradykinin (BK) and are able to provoke a B 2 receptor–mediated vasodilation even after desensitization of this receptor. Because this activity cannot be easily explained only by an inhibition of kinin degradation, direct interactions of ACE inhibitors with the B 2 receptor or its signal transduction have been hypothesized. To clarify the significance of degradation-independent potentiation, we studied the vasodilatory effects of BK and 2 degradation-resistant B 2 receptor agonists in the isolated rat heart, a model in which ACE and aminopeptidase P (APP) contribute equally to the degradation of BK. Coronary vasodilation to BK and to a peptidic (B 6014) and a nonpeptidic (FR 190997) degradation-resistant B 2 agonist was assessed in {{the presence or absence of}} the ACE inhibitor <b>ramiprilat,</b> the APP inhibitor mercaptoethanol, or both. <b>Ramiprilat</b> or mercaptoethanol induced leftward shifts in the BK dose-response curve (EC 5053. 4 nmol/L) by a factor of 4. 6 or 4. 9, respectively. Combined inhibition of ACE and APP reduced the EC 50 of BK to 0. 18 nmol/L (ie, by a factor of 19) but potentiated the activity of B 6014 (EC 5051. 9 nmol/L) only weakly without altering that of FR 190997 (EC 5050. 34 nmol/L). Desensitization of B 2 receptors was induced by the administration of BK (0. 2 mmol/L) or FR 190997 (0. 1 mmol/L) for 30 minutes; the vascular reactivity to <b>ramiprilat</b> or increasing doses of BK was tested thereafter.

The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the effects of pretreatment with non-hypotensive dose of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, <b>ramiprilat</b> and angiotensin type 1 (AT 1) receptor blocker, losartan on myocardial infarct size and arrhythmias in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Methods: Seventy male Wistar rats were divided into five groups. One group received saline as control. Other groups were given 10 mg/kg/day of losartan for one (L- 1 W) or ten weeks (L- 10 W) as well as 50 μg/kg/day of <b>ramiprilat</b> for one (R- 1 W) or ten weeks (R- 10 W) using a feeding needle. The rats were subjected to 30 minutes occlusion and 120 minutes reperfusion of the left coronary artery. Infarct size was determined using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias were analyzed in accordance with the Lambeth conventions. Results: Myocardial infarct size and the number of ventricular beats were significantly reduced in R- 1 W group, but the reduction was not significant in L- 1 W. After increasing the duration of pretreatment to 10 weeks in L- 10 W group, the infarct size, the number of ventricular beats and the episodes of ventricular tachycardia were significantly decreased. However in R- 10 W group the reduction of ventricular arrhythmias was not significant Conclusion: Based on the above mentioned results it could be concluded that losartan and <b>ramiprilat,</b> at a nonhypotensive dose, can reduce the induction of arrhythmias and infarct size following myocardial ischemia reperfusion.

40|$|Abstract—Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors elicit outside-in {{signaling}} via ACE in endothelial cells. This {{involves the}} CK 2 -mediated phosphorylation of ACE on Ser 1270 and the {{activation of the}} c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) /c-Jun pathway, resulting in an enhanced endothelial ACE expression. Because cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression {{is reported to be}} increased in subjects treated with ACE inhibitors, we determined the role of ACE signaling in this phenomenon and the transcription factors involved. In lungs from mice treated with the ACE inhibitor ramipril for 5 days, COX- 2 expression was increased. A similar (1. 5 - to 2 -fold) increase in COX- 2 protein was detected in primary cultures of human endothelial cells treated with <b>ramiprilat.</b> In an endothelial cell line stably expressing human somatic ACE, <b>ramiprilat</b> increased COX- 2 promoter activity, an effect not observed in ACE-deficient cells or cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable ACE mutant (S 1270 A). The ramiprilat-induced, ACE-dependent increase in COX- 2 expression and promoter activity (both 1. 5 - to 2 -fold greater than control) was prevented by the inhibition of JNK. <b>Ramiprilat</b> significantly enhanced the DNA binding activity of activator protein- 1 in cells expressing ACE but not S 1270 A ACE. Activator protein- 1 decoy oligonucleotides prevented the ACE inhibitor-induced increase in COX- 2 promoter activity and protein expression. As a consequence of the ramiprilat-induced increase in COX- 2 expression, prostacyclin and prostaglandin E 2, but not thromboxane A 2, production was increased and was inhibited by the COX- 2 inhibitor celecoxib.

Perfusion with <b>ramiprilat</b> increased the bradykinin concentration to 2. 8 +/- 0. 3 ng ml- 1 perfusate g- 1 wet weight.

Both ACEI and AT 1 A reduce myocardial IS by a bradykinin-mediated process. It is unclear, however, whether the combination of ACEI and AT 1 A produces a more pronounced IS reduction than each of these drugs alone. Forty-six enflurane-anaesthetized pigs underwent 90 [*]min low-flow ischaemia and 120 [*]min reperfusion. Systemic haemodynamics (micromanometer), subendocardial blood flow (ENDO, microspheres) and IS (TTC-staining) were determined. The decreases in left ventricular peak pressure by ACEI (by 9 ± 2 (s. e. mean) mmHg), AT 1 A (by 11 ± 2 [*]mmHg) or their combination (by 18 ± 3 [*]mmHg, P< 0. 05 vs ACEI and AT 1 A, respectively) were readjusted by aortic constriction prior to ischaemia. With placebo (n= 10), IS averaged 20. 0 ± 3. 3 % of the area at risk. IS was reduced to 9. 8 ± 2. 6 % with <b>ramiprilat</b> (n= 10) and 10. 6 ± 3. 1 % with candesartan (n= 10). Combined <b>ramiprilat</b> and candesartan (n= 10) reduced IS to 6. 7 ± 2. 1 %. Blockade of the bradykinin-B 2 -receptor with icatibant prior to ACEI and AT 1 A completely abolished the reduction of IS (n= 6, 22. 8 ± 6. 1 %). The relationship between IS and ischaemic ENDO with placebo was shifted downwards by each ACEI and AT 1 A and further shifted downwards with their combination (P< 0. 05 vs all groups); icatibant again abolished such downward shift.

40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert their {{cardiovascular}} effects {{not only}} by preventing the formation of angiotensin II (AII), but also by promoting the accumulation of bradykinin in or at the vessel wall. In addition, certain ACE inhibitors {{have been shown to}} augment the vasodilator response to bradykinin, presumably by an interaction {{at the level of the}} B 2 receptor. We have investigated whether this is a specific effect of the ACE inhibitor class of compounds in isolated endothelium-denuded segments of the rabbit jugular vein where bradykinin elicits a constrictor response which is exclusively mediated by activation of the B 2 receptor. Moexiprilat and <b>ramiprilat</b> (⩽ 3 [*]nM) enhanced the constrictor response to bradykinin three to four fold. Captopril and enalaprilat were less active by approximately one and quinaprilat by two orders of magnitude. Moexiprilat and <b>ramiprilat,</b> on the other hand, had no effect on the constrictor response to AII or the dilator response to acetylcholine. The bradykinin-potentiating effect of the ACE inhibitors was not mimicked by inhibitors of amino-, carboxy-, metallo- or serine peptidases or the synthetic ACE substrate, hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine, at a concentration which almost abolished the residual ACE activity in the vessel wall. In contrast, angiotensin-(1 – 7) (10 [*]μM), an angiotensin I metabolite, significantly enhanced the constrictor response to bradykinin. <b>Ramiprilat</b> did not alter the binding of [3 H]-bradykinin to a membrane fraction prepared from endothelium-denuded rabbit jugular veins or to cultured fibroblasts, and there was no ACE inhibitor-sensitive, bradykinin-induced cleavage of the B 2 receptor in cultured endothelial cells. These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitors selectively potentiate the B 2 receptor-mediated vascular effects of bradykinin. Their relative efficacy appears to be independent of their ACE-inhibiting properties and might be related to differences in molecule structure. Moreover, the potentiation of the biological activity of bradykinin by this class of compounds does not seem to be mediated by a shift in affinity of the B 2 receptor or a prevention of its desensitization, but may involve an increase in the intrinsic activity of unoccupied B 2 receptor molecules...|$|E

Tissue oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode in an airtight stirred bath containing Krebs solution buffered with HEPES at 37 °C (pH 7. 4). Rate of decrease in oxygen concentration was expressed as a percentage of the baseline, and results of the highest dose are indicated. Bradykinin (1024 mol/L, 22165 %), amlodipine (1025 mol/L, 21465 %), the ACE inhibitor <b>ramiprilat</b> (1024 mol/L, 22162 %), and the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor thiorphan (1024 mol/L, 21665 %) all caused concentration-dependent decreases in tissue oxygen consumption.

In vitro binding assays were performed to test the ability of bradykinin, angiotensin I, or various ACE inhibitors (enalaprilat, perindoprilat, quinaprilat, <b>ramiprilat,</b> and trandolaprilat) to displace a saturating concentration of [(125) I] 351 A, a radiolabeled lisinopril analogue, from ACE binding sites. The calculated IC(50) values for the ACE inhibitors were in the nanomolar range, while those for the natural substrates were in the micromolar range.

The ACE inhibitors generally had higher affinity for the bradykinin than the angiotensin I binding sites, supporting the idea that these agents are primarily inhibitors of bradykinin degradation, and secondarily inhibitors of angiotensin II production. Perindoprilat had the highest selectivity for bradykinin versus angiotensin I binding sites, and enalaprilat has the lowest.

40|$|Exercise {{training}} is well recognised {{as an effective}} treatment for intermittent claudication. The mechanism underlying exercise induced improvements is multi-factorial but remains poorly understood. Low angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity {{has been associated with}} enhanced responses to endurance training. Specifically, low ACE activity has been associated with improved muscle metabolism, endothelial function, and suppressed inflammatory responses; processes linked with exercise training benefits in claudicants. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of ACE has been associated with enhanced angiogenesis in animal models of ischaemia, secondary to increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this study, 11 claudicants were randomised to 8 weeks of supervised exercise training (n= 6) or exercise advice (n= 5). Walking ability was recorded before and after this period, and blood samples taken. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used {{to determine the effects of}} exercise training on ACE, VEGF and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) gene expression, and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA) measured changes in ACE and VEGF protein levels. In another experiment, a cell culture model of hypoxia, utilising ECV 304 cells and diethylenetriamine-nitric oxide (DETA-NO), was used to study the effects of the ACE inhibitor <b>ramiprilat</b> on ACE and VEGF responses to hypoxia, using RT-PCR and ELISA. Supervised exercise improved claudication distance by 105 metres (p < 0. 05) and maximum walking distance by 141 metres (p < 0. 05). ACE mRNA expression increased 30 %, VEGF 121 expression 43 % and VEGF 165 expression 70 % (all p < 0. 05). Soluble VEGFR- 1 mRNA expression increased by 63 % and VEGFR- 2 72 % (both p < 0. 05). ACE and VEGF protein levels remained comparatively stable. In the cell culture experiments, <b>ramiprilat</b> increased VEGF protein levels in hypoxia. Although a lack of experimental runs prevented statistical analysis, the results also suggest that <b>ramiprilat</b> has a stimulatory effect on ACE mRNA expression in hypoxia. Improvements in walking ability after exercise training are associated with increases in both VEGF and VEGF receptor expression. ACE inhibitors could play a role in improving claudication by potentiating increases in VEGF in addition to their known action of suppressing ACE activity. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{abilities}} of PC 12 cells to synthesize and degrade kinins were investigated. Kinin formation was assessed as kinin and kininogen content of cells and supernatants in serum-free incubations by use of a bradykinin-specific radioimmunoassay. Expression of kininogen mRNA was demonstrated by reverse-transcriptase PCR. Kinin degradation pathways of intact PC 12 cells were characterized by identification of the kinin fragments generated from tritiated bradykinin either in the absence or presence of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor <b>ramiprilat.</b> Kinin immunoreactivity in the supernatant of PC 12 cell cultures accumulated in a time-dependent fashion during incubations in serum-free media. This effect was solely due to de novo synthesis and release of kininogen (35 [*]pg[*]bradykinin[*][*]h− 1 [*]mg− 1 protein) since it could be suppressed by cycloheximide. Continuous synthesis of kininogen was a specific property of PC 12 cells, as it was not observed in cultured macro- or microvascular endothelial cells. PC 12 cells contained only minor amounts of stored kininogen. The rate of kininogen synthesis was not affected by <b>ramiprilat,</b> bacterial lipopolysaccharide, nerve growth factor or dexamethasone, but was stimulated 1. 4 fold when cells were pretreated for 1 day with 1 [*]μM desoxycorticosterone. By use of cDNA probes specific for kininogen subtype mRNAs, expression of low-molecular-weight kininogen and T-kininogen in PC 12 cells was confirmed. Expression of high molecular weight kininogen mRNA was also shown, though only at the lowest limit of detection of the assay. Degradation of tritiated bradykinin by PC 12 cells occurred with a half-life of 48 [*]min resulting in the main fragments [1 - 7]- and [1 - 5]-bradykinin. The degradation rate of bradykinin decreased to 15 % {{in the presence of}} <b>ramiprilat</b> (250 [*]nM). Apart from angiotensin I-converting enzyme direct cleavage of bradykinin to [1 - 7]- and [1 - 5]-bradykinin still occurred under this condition as a result of additional kininase activities. Along with previous findings of B 2 -receptor-mediated catecholamine release, these results now confirm the hypothesis that a cellular kinin system is expressed in PC 12 cells. The presence of such a system may reflect a role of kinins as local neuromodulatory mediators in the peripheral sympathetic system...|$|E
40|$|The {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme (ACE) {{is an important component}} of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and is crucially involved in the homeostasis of fluid and electrolyte balance and thus in the regulation of blood pressure. The zinc metallopeptidase is involved in the generation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor and in the degradation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. It is worth noting that ACE more readily hydrolyzes bradykinin than it does angiotensin I thus culminating in the net physiological effect of the production of a vasoconstrictor and the decrease in the availability of a vasodilator. ACE inhibitors have become one of the most successful therapeutic approaches as a first line of therapy in hypertension, and are also widely used in treating heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery disease and impaired left ventricular function. However, one unexpected clinically relevant finding related to ACE inhibitors is their ability to delay the onset of type II diabetes that was revealed by various large clinical trials. However, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor therapy are currently unclear and cannot be explained by the prevention of angiotensin II formation or the attenuated degradation of bradykinin. Thus the potential beneficial effects attributed to ACE inhibitors may occur independent of reductions in blood pressure paving way for new and/or unknown mechanism. Our group has recently redefined ACE as a signal transduction molecule which upon binding to ACE inhibitor turns on a signalling cascade leading to phosphorylation of Ser 1270 by CK 2, activation of JNK and changes in gene expression in endothelial cells. However the mechanism by which ACE inhibitor initiates the signalling cascade was not clear. It was hypothesized that ACE, which is anchored to the membrane with a single transmembrane domain should dimerize prior to initiating further downstream signalling events in endothelial cells. Therefore, we sought to explore whether or not ACE forms dimers in endothelial cells and whether ACE dimerization is essential for the initiation of ACE signalling in endothelial cells. Using native gel electrophoresis, we found that ACE forms dimers in endothelial cells and that there is an increase in the dimer formation upon treatment of endothelial cells with ACE inhibitors. ACE homodimerization was also demonstrated using the split-ubiquitin system and chemical cross-linking experiments. ACE dimers are also formed in endothelial cells overexpressing the non-phosphorylatable ACE, wherein ACE signalling was abolished indicating that dimerization process is not influenced by the phosphorylation of the serine residue residing in the cytoplasmic tail. Monosaccharides like glucose, galactose and mannitol did not have any influence on ACE-inhibitor induced dimerization. Making use of different monoclonal antibodies directed to the epitopes of N-domain which harbours carbohydrate recognizing domain, also did not affect dimerization. However, inactivation of the C-domain active site by introducing mutation of the key histidine residues in HEMGH consensus sequences, which complexes the zinc ions, abolished enzyme dimerization both in the basal state and in response to <b>ramiprilat.</b> Mutation of the C-domain also resulted in the loss of ACE inhibitor-induced ACE signalling, that is we failed to observe ramiprilat-induced increase in the phosphorylation of the Ser 1270 and the subsequent JNK activation. ACE-inhibitor induced dimerization precedes the phosphorylation of Ser 1270 and activation of JNK. Thus the ACE-inhibitor induced dimerization via the C-domain of ACE represents the initial step in the ACE signalling pathway which involves the activation of JNK/c-Jun pathway and leading to the changes in the gene expression in endothelial cells. Our group previously identified ACE itself as well as cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) as two “ACE signalling-regulated” genes. To screen for additional genes regulated in a similar manner we used DNA microarray technology, to assess ramiprilat-induced changes in the endothelial cell gene expression. 21 genes were identified to be differentially regulated of which, 7 were upregulated and 14 were downregulated by <b>ramiprilat.</b> However, when screened at the protein level, we found no significant differences between the untreated control cells and those treated with <b>ramiprilat.</b> As several other cells and tissues possess a fully functional RAS we screened plasma samples from healthy volunteers as well as from patients with coronary artery disease for the proteins identified in the microarray. We observed that the cellular retinal binding protein- 1 (CRBP- 1) was detectable at low levels in plasma from patients and that ramipril markedly increased serum levels of this protein. Endothelial cells overexpressing CRBP- 1 demonstrated increased RXRE and PPRE activity when stimulated with 9 -cis retinoic acid and rosiglitazone respectively suggesting that CRBP- 1 might affect gene expression via heterodimerization of PPAR elements with RXR elements by virtue of its function as a transport protein of retinoic acid. Studies aimed at determining the consequences of elevated CRBP- 1 expression on endothelial cell homeostasis are ongoing. Although the RAS has been described in many other tissues apart from endothelial cells, ACE signalling has not yet been addressed in tissues such as monocytes/macrophages, which have an increased ACE expression in an atherosclerotic setting. We observed that upon stimulation of cultured ACE expressing monocytes with <b>ramiprilat,</b> JNK is activated suggesting the occurrence of ACE signalling in human monocytes. It is worth noting that ACE inhibitors delay the onset of type II diabetes in spite of moderate decrease in blood pressure. To further elucidate the mechanism underlying this effect, we found that ACE inhibitors increase the PPARgamma levels in the nuclear extracts of ACE expressing monocytes which were also reproduced in human endothelial cells overexpressing human somatic ACE. However, <b>ramiprilat</b> did not have any direct effect on the activity of a luciferase-coupled promoter containing several copies of the PPRE in human endothelial cells. These results contrasted with the actions of the PPARgamma agonist suggesting that <b>ramiprilat</b> enhances PPARgamma levels through an indirect mechanism. We next hypothesized that <b>ramiprilat</b> might increase the levels of 15 -deoxy-D 12, 14 -prostaglandin J 2 (15 dPGJ 2) which is a natural ligand for PPARgamma via COX enzymes in monocytes. We observed that <b>ramiprilat</b> was able to decrease the diminution of COX- 2 levels upto 48 hours of treatment but the levels of 15 dPGJ 2 were too low to be detected by ELISA. However <b>ramiprilat</b> enhanced the plasma levels of adiponectin, a downstream target of PPARgamma, which is a anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory adipokine, in patients with coronary artery disease. Though adiponectin is a PPARgamma-regulated gene, the observed increase in adiponectin might be attributed to the increase in RXR rather than via PPARgamma. Taken together, the results of this investigation have revealed that ACE inhibitors initiate ACE signalling by eliciting the dimerization of the enzyme, more specifically via its C-domain active centers. The ACE signalling cascade when activated leads to the enhanced expression of ACE, COX- 2 and CRBP- 1 which in turn favours the heterodimerization of PPARgamma with RXR and thus results in the increased expression of “PPARgamma regulated” genes such as adiponectin. The latter results provide a molecular basis for the observation that ACE inhibitors can delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in as much as it was possible to link ramipril with CRBP- 1, RXR activity and the expression of adiponectin, an adipokine associated with improved insulin sensitivity. Further work is however required to elucidate the consequences of ACE inhibitors in monocytes and adipocytes as well as in intact animals. Das Angiotensin-konvertierende Enzym (ACE) ist eine zentrale Komponente des Renin-Angiotensin-Systems (RAS) und ist insbesondere für die Regulation des Wasser-Elektrolyt-Haushaltes sowie für die Kontrolle des Blutdrucks von großer Bedeutung. Das Enzym wandelt zum einen Angiotensin I in das stark vasokonstrikitorisch wirkende Hormon Angiotensin II um und hydrolysiert zum anderen das vasodilatorisch wirkende Hormon Bradykinin in inaktive Fragmente. Die Hemmung des RAS durch ACE-Inhibitoren ist zu einer wichtigen, erfolgreichen therapeutischen Maßnahme geworden, nicht nur zur Behandlung des Bluthochdrucks, sondern auch bei Myokardinfarkten, Diabetes mellitus Typ II, Schlaganfällen, koronarer Herzkrankheit (KHK) sowie bei Links-Herz-Insuffizienz. Interessanterweise lässt sich eine Reihe der positiven Effekte der ACE-Inhibitoren nicht allein durch Senkung des Angiotensin II-Spiegels bzw. Anstieg der Bradykinin-Konzentration erklären. Vielmehr scheint es noch andere Wege zu geben, mittels derer ACE-Inhibitoren ihre positiven Wirkungen entfalten. Im Hinblick darauf ist von besonderem Interesse, dass das Enzym ACE erst kürzlich als Signaltransduktionsmolekül identifiziert werden konnte. Die Bindung von ACE-Inhibitoren an ACE löst in Endothelzellen eine Signaltransduktionskaskade aus, bei der zunächst die ubiquitäte Proteinkinase CK 2 ACE an einem intrazellulären Serin-Rest (Ser 1270) phosphoryliert. Infolge dieser Phosphorylierung wird der c-Jun/JNK-Signalweg und der Transkriptionsfaktor AP- 1 aktiviert, was zur Steigerung der Expression von ACE und Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) führt. In Endothelzellen, die eine nicht-phosphorylierbare Mutante von ACE (S 1270 A) überexprimieren, findet das ACE-Signalling nicht statt. Da mittels der Technik inverser Micellen gezeigt werden konnte, dass ACE als Dimer vorliegen kann, sollte die physiologische Relevanz dieser Dimerisierung und deren Einfluß auf das ACE-Signalling in Endothelzellen untersucht werden. Mit Hilfe nativer Gelelektrophorese, sowie Experimenten mit dem Split-ubiquitin System oder chemischem „Cross-linking“ konnte im Rahmen dieser Doktorarbeit gezeigt werden, dass ACE in Endothelzellen als Dimer vorliegt und die Dimerisierung durch Gabe von ACE-Inhibitoren gesteigert wird. Da die nicht-phosphorylierbare, inaktive ACE-Mutante auch dimerisieren kann, konnte ein Einfluss der ACE-Phosphorylierung auf die Dimerisierung ausgeschlossen werden. Obwohl eine Dimerisierung des Enzyms über eine N-terminale Zucker-Seitenkette postuliert worden war, konnte im Rahmen dieser Arbeit die ACE-Inhibitor-induzierte Dimerisierung weder durch die Gabe von Monosacchariden wie Glukose, Galactose und Mannitol unterdrückt werden, noch durch die Inkubation der Endothelzellen mit verschiedenen N-terminalen, monoklonalen ACE-Antikörpern. Die basale und ACE-Inhibitor-induzierte Dimerisierung von ACE konnte jedoch durch die Inaktivierung des C-terminalen, aktiven Zentrums von ACE durch Mutation der Histidinreste in der HEMGH-Konsensussequenz verhindert werden. Dies führte zur völligen Aufhebung des ACE-Signaltransduktion weges, d. h. weder die Ramiprilat-vermittelte Phosphorylierung an Ser 1270 noch die JNK-Aktivierung erfolgte. Somit konnte die durch ACE-Inhibitoren induzierte Dimerisierung über die carboxyterminale Domäne des Enzyms als Initiationspunkt der ACE-Signaltransduktion bestätigt werden. Mittels DNA-Microarray Technologie wurde ferner der Einfluss der ACE-Dimerisierung und der dadurch initiierten Signaltransduktion auf die Expression weiterer Gene untersucht, wobei 21 durch <b>Ramiprilat</b> regulierte Gene identifiziert wurden. Sieben Gene wurden in ihrer Expression gesteigert, 14 abgeschwächt. Zahlreiche weitere Experimente zeigten jedoch, dass <b>Ramiprilat</b> keinen Einfluss auf die Menge der durch diese Gene kodierten Proteine in Endothelzellen hatte. Da eine Reihe anderer Zellen und Gewebe ein funktionelles RAS exprimieren, untersuchten wir auch das Blutplasma von gesunden Probanden und Patienten mit KHK. Interessanterweise fand sich im Plasma von Patienten unter Ramipril-Therapie eine erhöhte Konzentration des „Cellular retinol binding protein- 1 “ (CRBP- 1), welches auch mittels Microarray als durch Ramiprilat-hochreguliertes Gen ermittelt worden war. In Endothelzellen führte eine Überexpression von CRBP- 1 zu einem Anstieg der Promotoraktivität von RXRE und PPRE nach Stimulation durch 9 -cis Retinolsäure und Rosiglitazon, was möglicherweise auf das erhöhte, zelluläre Angebot von Retinol-Produkten und einer daraus resultierenden vermehrten Dimerisierung von PPAR und RXR zurückzuführen ist. Obwohl das RAS nicht nur in Endothelzellen, sondern auch in anderen Geweben eine Rolle spielt, konnte das ACE-Signalling bislang noch nicht in anderen Geweben nachgewiesen werden. Insbesondere die Untersuchung des ACE-Signallings in Monozyten bzw. Makrophagen könnte von besonderem medizinischem Interesse sein, da in diesen Zelltypen die ACE-Expression im Rahmen der Entwicklung einer Atherosklerose deutlich ansteigt. Es scheint jedoch ein ACE-Signalling in Monozyten zu existieren, da <b>Ramiprilat</b> in diesen Zellen eine Aktivierung der JNK sowie eine Erhöhung der COX- 2 Expression auslöst. Eine weiterer positiver Aspekt einer ACE-Inhibitor-Therapie ist, dass diese Medikamente die Ausbildung eines Diabetes mellitus Typ II verzögern. Experimente zur Ermittlung des zugrundeliegenden Mechanismus zeigten, dass die Behandlung von ACE-exprimierenden Monozyten oder Endothelzellen mit ACE-Inhibitoren zu einem erhöhten PPARgamma-Level in den Kernextrakten dieser Zellen führte. Allerdings scheint <b>Ramiprilat</b> die PPARgamma-Expression nur indirekt zu beeinflussen, denn die PPRE-Promotoraktivität wurde durch die Behandlung von Endothelzellen mit <b>Ramiprilat,</b> im Gegensatz zu der Inkubation mit dem PPARgamma-Agonisten Rosiglitazon, nicht beeinflusst. Eine Wechselwirkung zwischen ACE und PPARgamma scheint in der Tat naheliegend, da Patienten mit KHK infolge einer Ramipril-Behandlung eine erhöhte Plasmakonzentration von Adiponectin aufweisen, das in seiner Expression durch PPARgamma gesteigert wird und als Adipokin anti-inflammatorische und anti-atherogene Eigenschaften aufweist. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass das ACE-Inhibitor-vermittelte ACE-Signalling durch eine Dimerisierung des ACE initiiert wird und zum Anstieg der Expression von ACE, COX- 2 und CRBP- 1 führt. Die gesteigerte CRBP- 1 -Bildung erhöht vermutlich die Bildung von PPAR/RXR-Heterodimeren, was in der vermehrten Expression von PPAR-regulierten Genen (z. B. Adiponectin) resultiert...|$|E

40|$|Bradykinin (BK) {{has been}} shown to exert cardioprotective effects which are potentiated by inhibitors of {{angiotensin}} I-converting enzyme (ACE). In order to clarify the significance of ACE within the whole spectrum of myocardial kininases we investigated BK degradation in the isolated rat heart. Tritiated BK (3 H-BK) or unlabelled BK was either repeatedly perfused through the heart, or applied as an intracoronary bolus allowing determination of its elution kinetics. BK metabolites were analysed by HPLC. Kininases were identified by <b>ramiprilat,</b> phosphoramidon, diprotin A and 2 -mercaptoethanol or apstatin as specific inhibitors of ACE, neutral endopeptidase 24. 11 (NEP), dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV and aminopeptidase P (APP), respectively. In sequential perfusion passages, 3 H-BK concentrations in the perfusate decreased by 39 % during each passage. <b>Ramiprilat</b> reduced the rate of 3 H-BK breakdown by 54 % and nearly abolished [1 - 5]-BK generation. The ramiprilat-resistant kininase activity was for the most part inhibited by the selective APP inhibitor apstatin (IC 50 0. 9 [*]μM). BK cleavage by APP yielded the intermediate product [2 - 9]-BK, which was rapidly metabolized to [4 - 9]-BK by dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV. After bolus injection of 3 H-BK, 10 % of the applied radioactivity were protractedly eluted, indicating the distribution of this fraction into the myocardial interstitium. In samples of such interstitial perfusate fractions, 3 H-BK was extensively (by 92 %) degraded, essentially by ACE and APP. The ramiprilat- and mercaptoethanol-resistant fraction of interstitial kininase activity amounted to 14 %, about half of which could be attributed to NEP. Only the product of NEP, [1 - 7]-BK, was continuously generated during the presence of 3 H-BK in the interstitium. ACE and APP are located at the endothelium and represent the predominant kininases of rat myocardium. Both enzymes form a metabolic barrier for the extravasated fraction of BK. Thus, only interstitial, but not intravascular concentrations of BK are increased by kininase inhibitors to the extent that a significant potentiation of BK effects could be explained. NEP contributes less than 5 % to the total kininase activity, but is the only enzyme which is exclusively present in the interstitial space...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} of bradykinin (BK) labelled with tritiated proline at positions 2 and 3 ([3 H]-BK) was determined on the luminal surface of bovine tracheal epithelium, in supernatants obtained from incubations of the luminal tracheal surface, and in suspensions of isolated tracheal epithelial cells. Peptidase inhibitors and identification of peptide fragments {{were used for}} characterization of the metabolic pathways. On the luminal surface of intact bovine trachea, [3 H]-BK was degraded with a half life of 12. 8 [*]min. [1 - 7]-BK and [1 - 5]-BK were the major direct metabolites which were further degraded via [1 - 3]-BK and [2 - 3]-BK to proline. Metabolism of [3 H]-BK was unaltered {{in the presence of}} <b>ramiprilat</b> (250 [*]nM) or phosphoramidon (10 [*]μM). Phenanthroline diminished the formation of [1 - 7]- and [1 - 5]-BK and abolished the generation of proline. Supernatants obtained from incubations of tracheal epithelium contained kininase activities which steadily increased when tracheae were incubated for longer than 30 [*]min. After 60 [*]min contact with epithelium, the incubation medium contained higher kininase activities than the epithelium itself. The spectrum of kinin metabolites generated by kininases in the supernatant was comparable to that formed by intact epithelium. In suspensions of isolated epithelial cells, [3 H]-BK was degraded with a half life of 70 [*]min. The metabolites [1 - 3]- and [2 - 3]-BK were formed in parallel to [1 - 7]- and [1 - 5]-BK; however, proline was not generated. Degradation of [3 H]-BK was not influenced by <b>ramiprilat,</b> but was inhibited by 85 % in the presence of phosphoramidon. Phosporamidon markedly inhibited the generation of [1 - 7]- and [1 - 5]-BK and nearly abolished the formation of [1 - 3]- and [2 - 3]-BK. In conclusion, angiotensin I-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase 24. 11 are not significantly involved in [3 H]-BK degradation on the luminal side of intact tracheal epithelium. The spectrum of metabolites found may in fact reflect the combined activities of metalloendopeptidase 24. 15 and post-proline cleaving enzyme.

40|$|Background: Substantial {{evidence}} has accumulated for the intrarenal generation of func-tionally important quantities of angiotensin II (Ang II). To assess {{the possibility that}} Ang II generation occurs beyond a barrier to diffusion from the vascular compartment, six angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors varying widely in their lipid solubility were employed in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and their normotensive con-trols (WKY). The biological end points were renal blood flow and its response to Ang II. Results: Two ACE inhibitors, ramipril and captopril, induced a larger increase in renal blood flow and enhanced the renal vascular response to Ang II substantially more than did enalapril and lisinopril. The two prodrugs, enalapril and ramipril, which are substantially more lipophilic than the respective active drugs, enalaprilat and <b>ramiprilat,</b> showed equiva-lent responses. The partial agonist saralasin virtually abolished the renal vasodilator response to ramipril. The pattern of response was similar in WKY, but the responses were substantially smaller.

40|$|Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an {{established}} modulator of renal function. Although NPY reduces {{renal blood flow}} and does not alter glomerular filtration rate, it enhances diuresis and natriuresis. Although initial studies on natriuresis did not detect kaliuresis, we now report that a retrospective analysis of previous studies regarding natriuresis demonstrates NPY-induced kaliuresis under several experimental conditions. Kaliuresis was observed despite a marked reduction in urinary potassium concentrations, {{which may explain why}} it has not been noted in some initial studies. In a direct comparison of NPY-induced kaliuresis and natriuresis, both effects were slow in onset (requiring > 45 min to develop fully) and blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. While natriuresis occurred solely via a Y 5 receptor, kaliuresis involved a Y 1 receptor and an additional receptor subtype, possibly Y 2. The L-type Ca 2 + entry blocker nifedipine abolished natriuresis but did not inhibit kaliuresis. A combination of experiments with the bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist icatibant, the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan, and the converting enzyme inhibitor <b>ramiprilat</b> revealed that NPY-induced natriuresis involves bradykinin while kaliuresis involves angiotensin II. We conclude that NPY-induced kaliuresis is much less pronounced than natriuresis and is mediated by distinct mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there are}} 10 angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors {{available}} in the US.

In the present study, infusion of NPY (2 micrograms. kg- 1. min- 1) enhanced renovascular resistance by approximately 8 mmHg. ml- 1. min and enhanced urine and sodium excretion by approximately 450 microliter/ 15 min and approximately 60 - 85 micromol/ 15 min, respectively.

AIM: To test binding selectivity of various ACE-Ins - namely Enalaprilat (E), Perindoprilat (P), Quinaprilat (Q), <b>Ramiprilat</b> (R), Trandolaprilat (T) – for specific Ang-I and Bk binding sites of hsACE.

On plastic, AII induced only a 1. 6 -fold increase in [3 H]thymidine incorporation, but on fibronectin- or type I collagen-coated plastic, the response to AII was enhanced from two- to fourfold.

The synergy between AII and strain was completely eliminated by neutralizing antibodies to PDGF AB (3 micrograms/ml).

The most potent converting enzyme inhibitors toward aminopeptidase P were the carboxylalkyl compounds, cilazaprilat, enalaprilat, and <b>ramiprilat</b> (I 50 values of 3 - 12 /iM).

40|$|Summary: The {{effects of}} the angiotensin-converting enzyme {{inhibitor}} ramipril on thirteen endocrinological tests were evaluated. These tests comprised serum follitropin, lutropin, prolactin, thyrotropin, free thyroxine, total thyrox-ine, free triiodothyronine, parathyrin, cortisol, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate. Eleven hypertensive outpatients, 9 men and 2 women, treated {{at the department of}} internal medicine in Turku University Central Hospital, received 5 mg of ramipril once a day for the study period of four weeks. The above mentioned endocrinological tests were performed before {{and at the end of}} the ramipril treatment. Ramipril decreased the value of free thyroxine statistically significantly, p = 0. 011, from the mean value of 17. 1 pmol/ 1 to the mean value of 16. 0 pmol/ 1 when measured with Amerlex-MAB * free thyroxine kit. The mean within-subject difference was- 1. 10 pmol/ 1 with a 95 % confidence interval of- 1. 87 0. 33 pmol/ 1. With the AutoDELFIA ™ free thyroxine kit and with the reference method dialysis+RIA no effect was detected. Other endocrinological tests examined were not affected by ramipril. Since the decreasing effect of ramipril on free thyroxine was detected only with Amerlex-MAB * but neither with AutoDELFIA ™ nor with dialysis+RIA, the effect was concluded to be analytical. The underlying mechanism and the component ultimately interfering with the analysis is unknown. Introduction <b>ramiprilat,</b> in the liver (8). Even though ramipril wa...|$|E
40|$|Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a co-transmitter of the {{sympathetic}} nervous system including the renal nerves. The kidney expresses NPY receptors, which can also be activated by peptide YY (PYY), a circulating hormone released from gastrointestinal cells. Five subtypes of NPY receptors have been cloned, among which Y 1, Y 2 and Y 5 appear {{to be involved in}} the regulation of renal function. NPY produces potent renal vasoconstriction in vitro in isolated interlobar arteries and in the isolated perfused kidney and in vivo upon intrarenal or systemic administration via a Y 1 receptor. Nevertheless glomerular filtration rate is altered only little if at all by NPY, indicating a greater effect on the vas efferens than the vas afferens. NPY can inhibit renin release via Y 1 -like receptors. NPY can stimulate Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) in proximal tubules via Y 2 receptors and can antagonize the effects of vasopressin on isolated collecting ducts. It can also act prejunctionally to inhibit noradrenaline release via Y 2 receptors. Despite the profound reductions of renal blood flow, systemic NPY infusion can cause diuresis and natriuresis; this is largely independent of pressure natriuresis mechanisms and is possibly mediated by an extrarenal Y 5 receptor. Studies with the converting enzyme inhibitor <b>ramiprilat</b> and the bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant indicate that bradykinin mediates, at least partly, diuretic NPY effects. NPY antagonists enhance basal renal blood flow but do not alter basal diuresis or natriuresis indicating that renovascular, but not tubular, NPY receptors may be tonically activated by endogenous NP...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} how rapid changes {{in blood pressure}} can regulate Na-K-ATPase in the kidney cortex, we tested the hypothesis that a short-term (5 min) decrease in renal perfusion pressure will {{increase the amount of}} Na-K-ATPase in the plasma membranes by an angiotensin II-dependent mechanism. The abdominal aorta of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats was constricted with a ligature between the renal arteries, and pressure was monitored on either side during acute constriction. Left renal perfusion pressure was reduced to 70 ± 1 mmHg (n = 6), whereas right renal perfusion pressure was 112 ± 4 mmHg. In control (nonconstricted) rats (n = 5), pressure to both kidneys was similar at 119 ± 6 mmHg. After 5 min of reduced perfusion, femoral venous samples were taken for plasma renin activity (PRA) and the kidneys excised. The cortex was dissected, minced, sieved, and biotinylated. Lower perfusion left kidneys showed a 41 % increase (P < 0. 003) in the amount of Na-K-ATPase in the plasma membrane compared with right kidneys.

To test the role of angiotensin II in mediating the increase in Na-K-ATPase, we repeated the experiments (n = 6) in rats treated with <b>ramiprilat.</b> When angiotensin-converting enzyme was inhibited, the cell surface Na-K-ATPase of the two kidneys was equal (P = 0. 46).

40|$|Abstract: Aliskiren is an orally active direct renin {{inhibitor}} which inhibits {{the synthesis}} of angiotensin I by linking to active renin on a deep cleft of its molecular structure, the site of hydrolysis of the Leu 10 -Val 11 bond of angiotensinogen. At variance with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, aliskiren eliminates the main substrate for the ‘escape’ phenomenon (synthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I through alternative enzymatic pathways). The possibility that the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren {{differs from that of}} ACE inhibitors needs to be proved in specifically designed clinical trials. Over the past 2 years, three studies have been published which directly compared aliskiren with ramipril, in patients with hypertension. We made a pooled analysis of these studies. In order to avoid interference with additional drugs, analysis was restricted to trial periods when the two drugs were given as monotherapy. In each individual study, systolic blood pressure (BP) was slightly lower with aliskiren. Overall, systolic BP was lower with aliskiren than with ramipril (weighted mean dif-ference between the treatments 1. 84 mmHg; fixed effect model; p< 0. 0001; and 1. 87 mmHg; random effect model; p 0. 0055). The standardized mean difference between the treatments was 2. 58 (fixed effect model; p< 0. 0001) and 2. 92 (random effect model; p 0. 0017) in favor of aliskiren. Compared with ramipril, aliskiren may have induced a more complete ‘upstream’ inhibition of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system, with consequent greater suppression of angiotensin II. Another potential explanation may be the longer terminal elimination halflife of aliskiren (about 40 hours) compared with <b>ramiprilat</b> (1317 hours). These data provide further evidence that aliskiren monotherapy provides a sustained BP reduction over the 24 hours...|$|E

Study designPlacebo-controlled double-blind parallel group trial. Methods 32 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) received placebo, R 5 mg, ISDN 20 mg slow release b. i. d. or R+ISDN for one week. A 24 hour kinetic profile of ramipril and its metabolite, of ace activity (ACE-A) and of related hormones (renin and aldosterone), of endothelin and of prostaglandins (PG), thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2), PGF 2 a, 6 -keto PGF 1 a, the stable metabolite of prostacyclin (PGI 2 -M) was studied after the first dose. Measurements were repeated after 8 days of treatment before and 3 hours after the morning dose. ResultsHormone measurements are presented as means of percent difference of patients treated with R (n= 16) vs. those without ace-inhibitor (n= 16).
