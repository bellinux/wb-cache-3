2500|$|Bourdieu [...] "was, for many, {{the leading}} {{intellectual}} of present-day France... a thinker {{in the same}} rank as Foucault, Barthes and Lacan". His works have been translated into two dozen languages and have affected the whole gamut of disciplines {{in the social sciences}} and the humanities. [...] They have also been used in pedagogy. [...] Several works of his are considered classics, not only in sociology, but also in anthropology, education, and cultural studies. [...] (La Distinction) was named as one of the 20th century's ten most important works of sociology by the International Sociological Association. The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> has significantly affected sociology, history, literature and aesthetics.|$|E

He has often stated that the lack of musical Academy training was of course a disadvantage, but this was compensated by the advantage of being an actor who composes for fellow-actors and senses their need on the stage or on the screen: [...] "After all, if you had the right professors and they were good in a certain art (which was my case) they could teach you the rules of arts in a way to use them in another field of your muses. Because the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> are universal. For me there’s no difference if I play a character, compose music or write poetry for my songs, it’s all about telling stories, communication, sharing thoughts and emotions, about the ability to stretch and push the boundaries with visions of your own world".|$|E
