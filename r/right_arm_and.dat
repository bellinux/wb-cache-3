In 1952 the Shelby family cemetery was given to the state government and became the Isaac Shelby Cemetery State Historic Site.|$|E
5|$|Krueger came to {{feel that}} the {{prospects}} for promotion in the infantry were very poor, and in 1927 he tried to transfer to the United States Army Air Corps. He attended the Air Corps Primary Flying School at Brooks Field, Texas, but suffered an attack of neuritis in his <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> his flight instructor, Lieutenant Claire Lee Chennault, failed him. In December 1927, he was offered a position as an instructor at the Naval War College, where he taught classes on World War I, and on joint operations.|$|E

5|$|One of Bond's closest {{allies in}} both the novels and films is CIA {{operative}} Felix Leiter. Fleming wrote twelve novels, of which Leiter appears in six; in the second book, Live and Let Die, Leiter was attacked by a shark and lost his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> half his left leg and his subsequent appearances were with prosthetics. For the film series the shark attack occurred in Licence to Kill, the fifteenth instalment in the series. Following Licence to Kill, Leiter did not appear until the reboot of the franchise with Casino Royale.|$|E
5|$|Banks was {{determined}} to break the siege by a direct assault on the Confederate lines. Dow believed the attack to be a mistake, and delayed his units' participation until later in the day. In the assault, which was unsuccessful, Dow {{was wounded in the}} <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> left thigh and sent to a nearby plantation to convalesce. While in the hospital, he lobbied for a transfer to a theater where his chances of promotion would be greater. On June 30, having healed enough to mount a horse again, Dow visited his troops. As he returned to the hospital after dark, he was captured by Confederate cavalry operating behind Union lines.|$|E
5|$|Born in Castlemaine, Victoria, Peeler {{worked at}} various jobs {{in his home}} town and in the Melbourne area before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in February 1916. Posted to the 3rd Pioneer Battalion, he arrived on the Western Front during November. In June 1917, his {{battalion}} participated in the assault on Messines ridge, where he was lightly wounded. Eight days after his Victoria Cross action, Peeler was severely wounded in his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> spent the next seven months recuperating in the United Kingdom. Following the armistice with Germany, he was discharged from service with the rank of sergeant in December 1918.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat in}} Mile High Stadium {{proved to be}} the last of Cleveland's streak of playoff {{appearances}} in the mid- to late-1980s. Kosar played through numerous injuries in 1989, including bruising on his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> a bad knee. Strong defense had carried the Browns to the playoffs even when the offense faltered, but that all crumbled in 1990. Kosar threw more interceptions than touchdowns {{for the first time in}} his career, and the defense allowed more points than any other in the league. The Browns' 2–7 start cost Carson his job. Jim Shofner was named interim head coach, and the team finished 3–13. After the season Bill Belichick, the defensive coordinator of the then-Super Bowl champion New York Giants, was named head coach.|$|E
5|$|Due to her 2000 injury, Carter lost {{considerable}} mobility in her <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> {{required an}} elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine, and nine operations {{were required to}} treat the elbow. After her comeback in 2008, she played for the Dandenong Rangers in the Australian Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League (WNWBL), the team she had played for before her injury. That year she received a player award from the Dandenong Rangers and was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) in her 1-point disability classification in the WNWBL and {{was named to the}} league's All Star Five. The Rangers won back-to-back WNWBL titles in 2011 and 2012, and she was again named the WNWBL MVP 1 Pointer and to the league's All Star Five in 2012.|$|E
5|$|During the match, she {{was knocked}} onto her right side, and {{her right arm}} became trapped {{underneath}} her wheelchair, causing a tendon in her elbow to rupture. Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. Because she had a pre-existing condition, the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{straightening}} {{themselves as}} well as they were able, these two sorely hurt men lifted their <b>right</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> gave Benita the salute due to a chieftainess.

5|$|In Return of the Jedi, Jabba {{is portrayed}} by a one-ton puppet that took {{three months and}} {{half a million dollars}} to construct. While filming the movie, the puppet had its own makeup artist. The puppet {{required}} three puppeteers to operate, {{making it one of the}} largest ever used in a motion picture. Stuart Freeborn designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds, who were members of Jim Henson's Muppet group. Barclay operated the <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men (he also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes) was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. Tony Cox, who also played an Ewok, would assist as well. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by radio control.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test at Trent Bridge, Hassett hit 115 in a rain-affected {{match that}} ended in a draw. Over the next month, he {{struggled}} in the county matches, scoring only 30 runs in total. The Australians were to be frustrated {{in the next three}} Tests. In the Second Test at Lord’s, Hassett made 104, top-scoring in Australia’s 346 despite being hindered by a bandaged <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> cramps. England took a 26-run first innings lead, but Australia replied with 368. Hassett’s bowlers reduced England to 3/12 but they hung on to deny Australia victory. The Third Test was another wet affair. Hassett made 26 as Australia scored 318 and took a 42-run first innings lead, but they then collapsed to be 8/35. Australia was saved from defeat by the rain, which meant that less than 14 hours of play was possible.|$|E
5|$|On 4 June 2010, Drogba {{was injured}} in a {{friendly}} match with Japan. He received the injury in a high challenge from defender Túlio Tanaka. He fractured the ulna in his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> had an operation {{the next day in}} the hope of making the finals. On 15 June 2010, Drogba was cleared by FIFA to play in the Ivory Coast's first group game against Portugal wearing a protective cast on his broken arm. The match ended in a goalless draw at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium with Drogba coming on in the 65th minute. On 20 June 2010, Drogba became the first player from an African nation to score against Brazil in a World Cup match, scoring with a header in the 78th minute as the Ivory Coast were defeated 1–3. On 25 June 2010, the Ivory Coast went out of the competition despite winning 3–0 against North Korea in their final match.|$|E

5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly, Kabandha {{appeared}} before them. The demon blocked {{the path of}} the brothers, who tried to escape by taking a different route, but were finally caught by Kabandha. The demon grabbed Rama in his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> Lakshmana in his left. Finding themselves helpless in Kabandha's clutches, Lakshmana appeals to Rama to escape and find Sita, leaving him behind as a sacrifice to the demon. Rama consoled him. Kabandha declared that he was extremely hungry and asked them who they were who had come to sate his hunger. At this time, Lakshmana realized that the strength of the demon lay in his hands and suggested that they cut off the demon's hands. Annoyed by the brothers' conversation, Kabandha decided to eat them at once and drew them closer to his mouth. The brothers drew their swords and quickly cut off the arms of the demon, who fell down with a mighty roar.|$|E
5|$|Working together, the Autobots {{and human}} {{soldiers}} manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak, Starscream, Soundwave and Shockwave, with Optimus using Shockwave's arm-cannon to blast the Control Pillar, disabling the Space Bridge.

Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for betraying his own principles. With the Decepticons defeated, Carly and Sam are reunited and the Autobots accept that, with Cybertron gone for good, Earth is now their home.|$|E

5|$|The mercenaries pursue Zangurak to Lazulis Island. Lowell is fatally {{injured by}} a Gurak warrior. Zael finds Calista with Zangurak, who has used her Arganan {{blood and the}} Gurak half of the Outsider to anoint his right arm. After the group defeats Zangurak, he rips off his <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> sends it to use the full power of the Outsider to revive him. However, Dagran kills Zangurak's arm so he can use the Arganan blood and Outsider half on it for himself. He reveals that he murdered Asthar because he learned that Asthar had {{commanded}} the Lazulis knights who killed his family. He has been collaborating with Zangurak with {{the ultimate goal of}} using the Outsider to remake the world so the mercenaries have a better life. Finding he is still not powerful enough to defeat the group, Dagran tries to absorb the Lazulis half of the Outsider into the center of his body, giving Zael an opening to kill him. Dagran reconciles with the group before dying, then his spirit uses the Outsider's energy to resurrect Lowell. Zael and Calista reunite the two halves of the Outsider, which leaves the planet after explaining that its true purpose is to collect scattered energy in outer space and use it to create life on new worlds. Humans and Gurak begin coexisting, sharing their technology and using Lazulis as a neutral land where the two races freely interact. Therius decides to train new knights in the empire while leaving Lazulis in Zael's care, Zael and Calista are married in her ancient family home, the mercenaries hold a funeral for Dagran, and Zael is finally made a knight by Calista.|$|E
