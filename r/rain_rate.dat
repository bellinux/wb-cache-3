The mean <b>rain</b> <b>rates</b> {{over a two-year period}} (1998 - 1999) are calculated to be 3. 0, 2. 85, 2. 94 mm/day for SSM/I onboard the DMSP F- 13, F- 14 and TMI, respectively. Assuming that the non-systematic errors for each sensor are independent, the errors are calculated to be 22. 2 %, 22. 4 % and 19. 7 % for F- 13, F- 14 and for TMI, respectively. The non-systematic error for the TMI is smaller than that for either F- 13 or F- 14 SSM/I at the low <b>rain</b> <b>rates</b> but is comparable at <b>rain</b> <b>rates</b> higher than about 5 mm/day.

Rain events are separated into convective and stratiform types of rain using two methods: the Gamache-Houze method, a simple threshold technique, and the Atlas-Ulbrich method. In the Atlas-Ulbrich method, the variability of the rain integral parameters R, Z, Nw, D 0 and gamma model parameter µ are used for the classification of rain into convective, stratiform and transition. Z-R relations are derived {{for each type of}} rain after classification. The changes in the coefficients of the Z-R relations for different rain events are plotted and analyzed. The Z-R relations of the different methods using the Singapore data are compared and analyzed. It is concluded that the coefficient A of the Z-R relation is higher for the convective stage followed by the stratiform and transition stages. The coefficient b values are higher for the transition stage followed by the stratiform and convective stages. Reflectivities are extracted from RADAR data above NTU site for rain events and compared with the reflectivities derived from the distrometer data. <b>Rain</b> <b>rates</b> retrieved from RADAR data using the proposed relations from Singapore’s data set are compared with the distrometer <b>rain</b> <b>rates.</b> The RADAR extracted <b>rain</b> <b>rates</b> are found to be constantly lower than the distrometer derived <b>rain</b> <b>rates</b> but matches well...|$|R
