50|$|Flowers are yellow, {{often with}} red markings, and {{produced}} in racemes. The flowers {{are followed by}} <b>round</b> <b>pods,</b> up to 45 cm long.|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit of}} the catclaw brier is a long, slender, <b>rounded</b> <b>pod</b> that has a {{covering}} of dense prickles, typically about 3 - 7 cm long.|$|R
50|$|After fertilization, {{the flower}} stem coils tightly, {{starting}} at the end, and rests above the tuber. Seeds are amber, held in a <b>round</b> <b>pod,</b> which opens by 5-10 flaps at maturity.|$|R
50|$|After fertilization, {{the flower}} stem coils tightly, {{starting}} at the end. Seeds, amber when ripe, are held in a <b>round</b> <b>pod,</b> which ripens the summer a year after flowering and opens by 5-10 flaps.|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit is}} a <b>round</b> <b>pod</b> that opens by several flaps or teeth at {{maturity}} and contains numerous sticky seeds, brown at maturity. Natural seed dispersal is by ants (myrmecochory), which eat the sticky covering and then discard the seeds.|$|R
50|$|The peas are {{circular}} to oblong in shape, {{and have}} a greyish-brown colour. They grow within <b>rounded</b> <b>pods</b> in groups of 4 to 9. The pods are up to 8 cm in length and 6 mm wide. The ripened peas are released when the pod opens and then twists.|$|R
50|$|Seeds {{are tiny}} and bumpy, in a <b>rounded</b> <b>pod</b> 1 - 3 cm long, {{tapering}} {{to a point}} at both ends. They lack the elaiosomes present in many {{other members of the}} family. They do not easily germinate without being exposed to smoke. In cultivation, a liquid smoke extract is often used.|$|R
50|$|Seeds {{from open}} flowers {{are held in}} a flat pod, pointed at both ends, that dries when mature and twists to release the seeds. Seeds from closed flowers are held in <b>round</b> <b>pods</b> with a single seed each. The roots and seeds are edible. The seeds from {{underground}} flowers give it the name peanut.|$|R
25|$|New grilles and four-segmented {{taillights}} {{highlighted the}} facelifted 1966 LeSabre models. Also new was a revised instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer replacing the <b>round</b> <b>pod</b> instruments and new interior door handles. Both base and Custom level series were continued. New standard safety features included a padded instrument panel, outside driver-side {{rear view mirror}} and backup lights.|$|R
50|$|All models {{featured}} new Grand Prix-style wrap-around cockpit {{instrument panels}} that placed controls and instruments {{within easy reach}} of the driver along with two <b>round</b> <b>pods</b> for a speedometer {{and the other for}} warning lights, fuel gauge or optional gauges and electric clock. Interior trims were available in cloth and Morrokide vinyl or expanded Morrokide depending on model.|$|R

50|$|The {{prayer book}} is one of, {{and the best}} {{preserved}} of, three surviving books of hours attributed to Lochner. His books are similar in layout and colourisation, and extensively decorated with gold and blue. The borders of the Prayer book are ornamented in bright colours and contain acanthus scrolls, gold foliage, flowers, berry-like fruits and <b>round</b> <b>pods.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} had cloth {{bench seats}} and a metal dash sometimes with a simulated burle woodgrain. The radio {{was a simple}} mono vacuum tube type radio with integrated speaker. An ash tray was located in {{the right side of}} the dash, close to the clock Depending upon the year there were both choke and throttle cables on the dash. On the right side was the choke lever. In the earlier years the clock was integrated into the glove compartment door and was of a manual-wind seven-day type. In the 1949 and 1950 models the clock was next to the glove box and with the redesigned dash board, the clock was on the top of the dash, in a center pod. Also, this revised dash had two <b>round</b> <b>pods</b> for the speedometer and the other gauges while the 1949 and 1950 models had one large <b>round</b> <b>pod</b> directly in front of the steering wheel on the dash.|$|R
50|$|The {{plants have}} {{specialized}} roots for living in heavy wet soils. The scented, thick, white roots are adapted {{to live in}} environments low in oxygen. Blooming occurs in mid to late summer and after blooming long, relatively thin, <b>rounded,</b> <b>pods</b> are produced that grow uprightly. The pods split open in late summer to late fall, releasing seeds that are attached to silky hairs, which act as parachutes that carry the seeds on the currents of the wind.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{a revised}} {{instrument}} panel featured two <b>round</b> <b>pods</b> for {{the speedometer and}} other instruments, replacing the horizontal sweep speedometer of 1964-65 models, {{but the rest of}} the basic dashboard designed was unchanged. F-85 models had base interiors with bench seats and rubber floor mats while the more lavish Cutlass versions came with full carpeting and featured Strato bucket seats of a new design with higher and thinner seat backs, or a no-cost bench seat option. Head rests were a $52 option.|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit is}} a <b>rounded</b> legume <b>pod</b> 1 or 2 centimeters long which dries {{to a very}} thin papery texture and has a coat of hairs.|$|R
2500|$|Interiors {{were all}} new and {{featured}} a vastly improved instrument panel, that used ABS plastic {{for much of}} its construction. The standard instrument cluster featured five equally sized <b>round</b> <b>pods</b> and contained a speedometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gauge, along with various warning lights. The leftmost pod was a vent for the [...] "DirectAire" [...] ventilation system. A clock was optional with the standard instrument package. The [...] "Instrumentation Group", available on all V8 models, featured two large <b>round</b> <b>pods</b> centered on the steering wheel, containing the speedometer (with trip odometer) and a tachometer. A third equal sized pod on the left contained the DirectAire vent. The instrument cluster featured an ammeter, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge and clock in set of smaller stacked pods near {{the centre of the}} instrument panel. The seats were also new for 1972, the standard front bench seat had an integrated headrest for both outboard seating positions featuring, while the available high back buckets also featured integrated headrests. Ford continued to offer [...] "comfort weave" [...] vinyl seats as an option. These seats had the centre portion upholstered with a knitted vinyl material that allowed the upholstery to [...] "breathe" [...] unlike conventional vinyl. An optional 6-way power bench seat, replaced the 4-way seat offered in 1971.|$|R
50|$|The LT/RT-2000 uses {{three types}} of munitions: Mk15 (60 <b>rounds,</b> 3 <b>pods</b> of 20 <b>round</b> each, 15 km range), Mk30 (27 <b>rounds,</b> 3 <b>pods</b> of 9 <b>rounds</b> each, 30 km range) and Mk45 (12 <b>rounds,</b> 2 <b>pods</b> of 6 <b>rounds</b> each, 45 km range). While the Mk15 is the 117 mm rockets used by the Kung Feng VI that carries 6,400 6.4mm size steel balls, the Mk30 rocket is a bit larger than the Mk15 at 180mm caliber and can carry either 267 rounds of M77 Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) bomblets or 18,300 8mm size steel balls with range of 30 km. And Mk45 larger than the Mk30 at 227mm caliber as it can carry either 518 rounds of M77 bomblets or 25,000 8mm steel balls with range of 45 km. Other types of munitions also being {{developed}} by CSIST/ROC Army, including FAE bomblets.|$|R
50|$|Early UH-1B/UH-1C Gunships had the XM-3 Subsystem using paired 24 round {{rectangular}} launchers mounted {{near the}} back edge of the sliding side doors. These pods were ground reloadable and were semi-permanent aircraft parts. The mounting point {{had been used to}} mount booms for 3 SS-11 Launchers on each side for anti-tank missions. The co-pilot had a roof mounted sight and control box to fire these. Later UH-1C and D aircraft had a mount on each side to carry a 7 <b>round</b> <b>pod</b> coupled with paired M-60D machine guns. Some carried M-134 Miniguns with 3000 rounds per gun instead, though these aircraft were normally used by Air Cavalry units, not the Aerial Rocket Artillery (ARA) units.|$|R
50|$|Kwalikum Secondary is {{a medium-size}} {{high school that}} {{is located in the}} Oceanside {{community}} area on Vancouver Island. The school's areas of strength are its academic, technology and music programs. A unique feature of the school is its Honours Society, which provides incentives for a few academic students to excel. The school has a large woodwork shop, and well-equipped automotive and metal shop. The computer to student ratio is 1:3, and there are five large computer labs. All classrooms have a computer for the teacher, and many have small <b>round</b> <b>pods</b> of computers for student use. The school has over 25 display projectors, many of which are permanently installed. Kwalikum is also well known for its high achieving band/music programs.|$|R
50|$|A foetid, hairless annual plant plant up to 60 cm having <b>round,</b> flat, winged <b>pods</b> {{with a deep}} apical notch.|$|R
40|$|There are {{two major}} types of green beans: bush or pole. Bush are short, erect plants (determinate) with a uniform pod set {{resulting}} in a short harvest season. Pole beans are trained on poles, fence, or string, and grow 7 to 8 ft in height and bear fruit continuously (indeterminate) requiring only one field planting. Further, the consumer perceives pole beans, with its longer pod, to be of superior quality. Our objective was to evaluate two pole bean varieties: Fortex, an extra long pod (11 in.) 60 day maturity, and Blue Lake, a standard pole bean variety, 6 to 7 in. <b>round</b> <b>pod</b> with 55 -day maturity. Also, we wished to compare high tunnel production with field production and obtain two crops in the high tunnel by double cropping...|$|R
50|$|The artwork is in {{the form}} of an organic, <b>rounded</b> <b>pod</b> {{structure}} that is approximately 20’ in length and has a domed roof. The structure is made from expanded polystyrene foam, which is then coated with a fiberglass-resin matrix and a white Gelcoat mixture. After the Gelcoat cures, it functions as a protective shell for the initial foam layers as well as the interior living space. The artwork is complete with a wooden door, mounted with its own knob and lock hardware. The structure contains a circular front deck area where the fiberglass slopes at an angle, creating a built-in seating area. There is a rowboat that is brought out to the lake's shore seasonally to provide transportation to and from the island for the current resident(s) and his or her visitors.|$|R
50|$|Development {{began in}} 1979, with Boeing and Hughes Aircraft {{as the primary}} contractors. The {{specification}} called for a small missile which could be carried in large numbers by attack aircraft in multiple dispensers - the A-10 was able to carry several 12 <b>round</b> launcher <b>pods.</b> The Boeing design was unsuccessful, and the USAF selected the Hughes Wasp missile.|$|R
5|$|Lochner is {{associated}} with three surviving books of hours; in Darmstadt, Berlin and Anholt. The extent of his association in each is debated; workshop members were probably heavily involved in their production. The most famous is the early 1450s Prayer book of Stephan Lochner now at Darmstadt; the others are the Berlin Book of Prayers of c. 1444, and the Anholt Prayerbook, completed in the 1450s. The manuscripts are very small (Berlin: 9.3cm x 7cm, Darmstadt: 10.7cm x 8cm, Anholt: 9cm x 8cm) and similar in layout and colourisation and are each extensively decorated in gold and blue. The borders are ornamented in bright colours and contain acanthus scrolls, gold foliage, flowers, berry-like fruits and <b>round</b> <b>pods.</b> The Darmstadt book includes a complete cycle of the Martyrdom of the Apostles. Its illustrations contain Lochner's characteristic application of deep blue, reminiscent of his Virgin in the Rose Garden.|$|R

2500|$|The {{interior}} on the Fairlane/Torino was all new for 1968. A new dashboard featured four equally sized <b>round</b> <b>pods</b> centred {{around the}} steering wheel. However, the pods {{did not contain}} {{a full set of}} gauges; rather an assortment of warning lights along with the speedometer and fuel gauge. The fuel gauge and temperature warning lights were in the first pod, a [...] speedometer was located in the second pod from the left, alternator and oil pressure warning lights were in the third pod from the left and the fourth pod was blank. An optional tachometer was available, which would be located in the third pod, and an optional clock occupied the fourth pod. Ford offered many upholstery options, including a knitted vinyl option, called [...] "comfortweave." [...] This unique option allowed the vinyl to [...] "breathe" [...] unlike conventional vinyl, offering more comfort in hot weather. [...] Conforming to U.S. safety standards, there was much padding inside the Torino's interior, which also featured shoulder belts for front outboard passengers on all cars built after December 31, 1967.|$|R
25|$|New <b>round</b> {{instrument}} <b>pods</b> {{replaced the}} former linear layout. Chevelle options included headlight washers, power windows and locks, and a rear defroster. Chevy's midsize production rose this year. About {{seven percent of}} all Malibus had a six-cylinder engine, while about 86,000 came with the SS 396 option. All 1969 Chevelles had a new locking steering column. one year ahead of the Federal requirement, and headrests required for all cars sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1969.|$|R
50|$|Sainfoins {{are mostly}} {{subtropical}} plants, but their range extends throughout Europe {{as far north}} as southern Sweden. These plants grow on grassland, agricultural land and wasteland. The leaves are pinnate, alternate, with 6 to 14 pairs of oblong to linear leaflets. Sainfoins have pale pink flowers, typically blooming between June and September and pollinated by honey bees and solitary bees. The <b>rounded</b> single-seeded <b>pods</b> bear prominent spikes or similar protrusions in many species, enabling them to cling to the fur of large mammals and be thus distributed.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} a small {{perennial}} herb growing from a woody taproot. The caudex is clothed with the remains of previous seasons' leaves. The leaves are up to 7 centimeters long and are compound, made up of up to 15 leaflets. The herbage is coated in silvery hairs. The pinkish purple flowers occur in May and June. They are up to 2 centimeters long. They are bee-pollinated. The fruit is a <b>rounded</b> legume <b>pod</b> between 1 and 2 centimeters long. It is fleshy, hairy, and green, drying brown. It contains many smooth black seeds.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, the Fairlane {{line was}} {{supplemented}} {{by the new}} Torino, and the Ranchero followed suit, becoming the largest model since the full-sized 1959. Overall, the new Ranchero was not only bigger, but also more angular than before with its more horizontal grille and horizontal headlamps; Ford and other automakers were making a switch back to horizontal quad headlamps. The interior was all new, as well, sharing the Torino/Fairlane's distinctive four-pod instrument cluster. Though the four <b>round</b> <b>pods</b> gave the illusion of an engine-turned dash, viewed from left to right, they instead featured warning lights for coolant temperature (both cold and hot) and the left turn signal indicator in the left pod with the speedometer in the second pod {{directly in front of}} the driver. Warning lights for the charging system and oil pressure, as well as the right turn signal indicator, were located third from the left. In upscale models, this pod was supplanted by a tachometer. An optional clock filled the fourth pod; a decorative [...] "clock delete" [...] panel otherwise filled the space. A seat belt warning light was a new feature, too, lighting briefly in the far left pod whenever the engine was started. The model line also featured wraparound front side marker lamps which doubled as parking lights and rear side reflectors, newly mandated by US law for the 1968 model year.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, {{the tournament}} format was changed from double-elimination to round robin. The top six regular season {{finishers}} {{qualified for the}} tournament field, which consisted of two three-team [...] "pods." [...] Pod 1 included the 1st, 4th, and 5th seeds, and Pod 2 included the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th seeds. Each team played three preliminary games, two against its podmates and one against a team from the opposite group. The cross-group games matched up the seeds as follows: 1st vs. 6th, 2nd vs. 5th, and 3rd vs. 4th. The winner of each <b>round</b> robin <b>pod</b> advanced to a single-game final.|$|R

5000|$|The 1969 models {{showed only}} minor changes, led by more-rounded {{front-end}} styling. A single chrome bar connected quad headlights, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. New <b>round</b> instrument <b>pods</b> replaced the former linear layout. For the first time, the Chevrolet 350 V8 {{was used in}} an El Camino. The Super Sport group included a 265- or 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 beneath a double-domed hood, along with a black-out grille displaying an SS emblem. More potent editions of the 396 engine, developing 350 or [...] also made the options list. Options included power windows and locks. Curiously, back-up lights moved from the rear bumper to the tailgate, where they were ineffective when the gate was down.|$|R
50|$|It is an erect, suberect or trailing, densely hairy, annual herb. The {{tap root}} {{produces}} a branched root system with smooth, <b>rounded</b> nodules. The <b>pods</b> are narrow, cylindrical {{and up to}} six cm long. The plant grows 30-100 cm with large hairy leaves and 4-6 cm seed pods. While the urad bean was, along with the mung bean, originally placed in Phaseolus, it has since been transferred to Vigna.|$|R
