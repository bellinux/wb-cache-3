50|$|The {{museum was}} created on grounds {{which used to}} be a NATO rocket base. The {{building}} has double-skin volume and two half-buried temporary exhibition wings with a total area of 900 m2; the structure mainly consists of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete,</b> <b>glass</b> and steel. The museum offers three exhibition spaces totalling an area of 1,300 square metres. Situated within the ground-level concrete slab is the so-called Japan Room - an unusually long and narrow gallery conceptualised by Ando as a space of “tranquillity” especially for the Japanese segment of the Langen Collection. The two subterranean exhibition rooms, with a ceiling height of a surprising eight metres, were in turn designed to accommodate the modern part of the collection. The museum opened to the public in 2004.|$|E
50|$|The {{lobby of}} the store was {{originally}} decorated with terracotta wall tiling and oak flooring whilst the basement floor utilised <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> with <b>glass</b> and steel fittings; {{the use of these}} materials was then expanded to outfit the whole store. In addition to the standard fittings, a number of special pieces of art were commissioned for the interiors of the store, these included both sculpture and paintings, although they were usually of a distinctly modernist or post-modernist style.|$|R
40|$|Glass is {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} create transparent structural elements such as columns, beams, floors, etc. Especially in case of glass beams, {{a significant amount of}} investigations has been performed to improve the unsafe (brittle) failure behaviour of <b>glass.</b> Similar to <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete,</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>glass</b> beams have been developed in which stainless steel is added to the glass laminate to obtain a safe failure behaviour. The concept has been proven to be feasible when assuming statically determinate systems. However, the additional system safety of statically indeterminate systems has not been investigated yet.

50|$|The Art Deco {{architectural}} style (called Style Moderne in France), was modern, {{but it was}} not modernist; it had many features of modernism, including the use of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete,</b> <b>glass,</b> steel, chrome, and it rejected traditional historical models, such as the Beaux-Arts style and Neo-classicism; but, unlike the modernist styles of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, it made lavish use of decoration and color. It reveled in the symbols of modernity; lightning flashes, sunrises, and zig-zags. Art Deco had begun in France before World War I and spread through Europe; in the 1920s and 1930s it became a highly popular style in the United States, South America, India, China, Australia and Japan. In Europe, Art Deco was particularly popular for department stores and movie theaters. The style reached its peak in Europe at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in 1925, which featured art deco pavilions and decoration from twenty countries. Only two pavilions were purely modernist; the Esprit Nouveau pavilion of Le Corbusier, which represented his idea for a mass-produced housing unit, and the pavilion of the USSR, by Konstantin Melnikov in a flamboyantly futurist style.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: This {{research}} study presented the durability performance of glass fibre reinforced concrete. Approach: The influence of fiber content on the durability performance of glass fibre reinforced concrete specimens having different percentage of glass fibres with varying grades of concrete were investigated. Results: The parameter of investigation included rapid chloride permeability test {{for a period}} of 365 days. Specimens of 100 × 150 mm cylinders were cast and tested to study their parameters. The specimens incorporated with addition of 0. 03, 0. 06 and 0. 10 % of glass fibres in M 30, M 40 and M 50 grades of concrete. The durability performances of glass fibre reinforced concrete were compared with that of plain concrete.

40|$|Glass is {{generally}} considered to be an unsafe material to use in building structures. To limit the risk associated with glass structures, there has been a focus on the probabilistic approach. This is insufficient for structures in general and for glass structures in particular. Much more than common structural materials like steel and <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete,</b> <b>glass</b> is highly susceptible {{to a wide range of}} incidents causing glass breakage. Therefore, one should not (only) ask ‘when will the glass break?’ (probabilistic approach), but (also) ‘what will happen when is does?’ (consequence-based approach). Analysis of projects realized in practice show that structural engineers are aware of this, and use varying strategies to limit the consequences of glass failure. However, such strategies are applied to varying extent, depending on the engineer’s experience and opinion, location, structure type and probably on many more factors. Hence, an explicit consequence-based approach is proposed for structural glass members, in addition to the existing probabilistic approach. This approach sets specific requirements to the residual strength of structural glass members for a certain period of time, at prescribed levels of damage. The concept of Member Consequence Classes (MCC) is introduced, in order to be able to differentiate requirements for members based on their role within a structure and the function and accessibility of the structure at hand. The presented approach allows for an open discussion on the required level of residual strength at varying levels of damage. Furthermore, it provides a basis for comparing design options in terms of safety. Finally, because it sets requirements for the application of structural glass in any (building-) structural application, it provides a fundamental basis for the development of structural glass beyond the existing small scale glass structures like entrances, pavilions and conservatories...|$|E

The station building is circular with a flat projecting concrete roof.

The roof is actually supported, umbrella-like, from a central column within the ticket hall. The whole building is topped by an illuminated feature resembling a Tesla coil.|$|R

40|$|Calcium sulfoaluminate cement (CSA) is a {{potential}} low-carbon binder that has a markedly less alkaline matrix environment compared to traditional Portland cement. Investigations on its long-term chemical compatibility with different reinforcements (i. e. glass fibre and steel rebar) are necessary before widespread adoption could occur. In this project, studies mainly focus on the microstructural evolution at interfacial zones over time, which has {{a significant impact on}} the durability properties of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concretes.</b> <b>Glass</b> fibre <b>reinforced</b> composites made with two matrix formulations (OPC, and OPC plus calcium sulfoaluminate based matrices) aged for 10 years at 25 ℃ and steel <b>reinforced</b> CSA <b>concretes</b> aged for 28 days and 1. 5 years are studied. Optical transmitted microscopy and SEM/EDX on the thin section petrographic specimens of composites are employed to give a straightforward interfacial zone characterization. The results suggest that CSA cement is highly compatible with the embedded glass fibre and steel reinforcement in the long term. Aged GRC composite modified by calcium sulfoaluminate cement shows greatly retained toughness, accompanied by considerably flexible interfacial and interfilamentary areas around the glass fibres. This is in contrary to the aged OPC/GRC, which demonstrates significantly brittle behaviour with substantial densification of C-S-H/CH intermixture occurring around glass fibres. In the steel <b>reinforced</b> CSA <b>concrete,</b> elemental mappings clearly show that there is a non-continuous aluminium-rich layer at the steel/concrete interface; and the aluminium gel is slightly consumed over time by chemical reactions...|$|R

The ceiling was indirectly lit and the lighting was used in conjunction with the original orchestral scores in the early silent film era to add drama for the spectator. Thousands of coloured lamps producing light that changed through all the various coloured hues in the spectral range were hidden amongst the plaster panels creating a crystalline cave effect.|$|R
