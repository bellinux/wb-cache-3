The physically-based groundwater and surface water model SIMGRO was used to model the hydrology of the basins. The model was calibrated using discharges and groundwater levels.

For each inlet the head-discharge curve was measured and the two curves compared. The comparison indicated that for certain conditions an appreciable head-advantage was gained by using a rounded inlet. Observation and analysis of the flow characteristics indicated that this gain phenomenon occurred in the region where for the same head a square-edged inlet caused separation and inhibited full flow, while the rounded inlet promoted full flow in the culvert with a corresponding increase in discharge. In connection with measurements to establish friction factors and entrance losses in the model culvert for use in the analysis of the experimental, a few behavior curves were determined. An analysis of behavior curves is included in Appendix IV. The results obtained were compared with experimental curves and other published curves.

This study quantifies how these processes interact to influence stormwater runoff from the University of Utah’s Research Park into Red Butte Creek. We focused on two adjacent stormwater outlets, Dentistry and Connor Road, which have sewersheds of 129 acres and 67 acres respectively. From October 2015 to November 2016 we sampled precipitation, stormwater runoff from rooftops, parking lots, roads, and turf grass, and stormwater culverts during 11 storm events. Precipitation depth and <b>culvert</b> <b>discharge</b> data were collected at regular intervals via iUTAH in situ sensors. During storm events the first pulse of stormwater runoff from these urban land covers has 3 - 30 times higher dissolved organic carbon and 2 - 3 times higher total dissolved nitrogen concentrations than precipitation. Surprisingly, the first pulse signature observed from runoff directly from urban land covers differs between stormwater culverts. During storm events, stormwater at the Dentistry culvert has elevated levels of solutes during the first flush that decrease over time, presumably due to solute source limitation. Consistent with a quick flushing event, event stormwater <b>discharge</b> at Dentistry <b>culvert</b> ends within 0. 5 - 3 hours following cessation of precipitation. However, after a storm event stormwater <b>discharge</b> at Connor <b>Road</b> decreases to a baseflow rate observed even during long periods with no storm events. This causes the first flush to appear diluted and, as the storm wanes, solute concentrations increase towards concentrations measured in non-storm event. Concentration patterns in base cations suggest that stormwater runoff from Connor Road interacts with shallow subsurface water. These observations demonstrate that adjacent sewersheds with similar land use may exhibit very different hydrological and hydrochemical responses to rainfall. As a result, the amount and quality of stormwater is then affected by both urban land cover how runoff interacts with subsurface structure en route it to the stream...|$|R

From this research it was determined that only the catchment scale simulations and a few individual road locations could be used for change detection. The storm runoff volumes and peak flows from road ditchflow had linear relationships with storm sediment load. These relationships had to be developed by classes of road locations and types in an intensively managed forest due to variability in road design, hydrologic response, and road use. Sediment from roads estimated from field measurements used with SEDMODL 2 or WARSEM provided substantially lower estimates than without field measured adjustments.

Recent discussions emphasised the role of secondary flow motion, considerations of fish dimensions in relation to the spectrum of turbulence scales, and the benefitial role of turbulent structures provided that fish are able to exploit them.The current literature on culvert fish passage focused mostly on fast-swimming fish species, but a few studies argued for better guidelines for small-bodied fish including juveniles.|$|R

40|$|Corrugated {{steel pipe}} (CSP) {{culverts}} {{are widely used}} as an economical alternative for conveying streams and small rivers through road embankments. While passage of the design flow is generally the primary goal for culvert design, consideration must also be given to maintaining connectivity within the aquatic environment for fish and other aquatic organisms. In Canada, the design criteria for fish passage through culverts are generally specified {{in terms of a}} maximum mean flow velocity corresponding to the weakest swimming fish expected to be found at a specific location. Studies have shown, however, that the velocity distribution within a CSP culvert may provide sufficient areas of lower velocity flow near the culvert boundary to allow for fish passage, even when the mean flow velocity may exceed a fish’s swimming ability. Improved knowledge of the hydraulic conditions within CSP culverts, combined with research into fish swimming capabilities and preferences, may make it possible to better tailor culvert designs for fish passage {{while at the same time}} decreasing construction costs. To meet the requirements of regulators, various measures may be taken to reduce culvert flow velocities. Embedding, or setting the invert of a culvert below the normal stream bed elevation, is a simple and inexpensive method of increasing the flow area in a culvert flowing partially full, thereby decreasing flow velocity. Fish traversing through an embedded culvert benefit not only in terms of lower mean flow velocities, but also even lower flow velocities in the near boundary region. In the province of Saskatchewan culvert embedment is regularly used as a means to improve fish passage conditions. In this study, a laboratory scale model was used to study the velocity distribution within a non-embedded and embedded CSP culvert. An acoustic Doppler velocimeter was used to measure point velocities throughout the flow cross section at several longitudinal locations along the culvert. The hydraulic conditions were varied by changing the <b>discharge,</b> <b>culvert</b> slope and depth of embedment. The point velocity data were analyzed to determine patterns of velocity and turbulence intensity at each cross section, as well as along the length of the culvert. The results from the embedded culvert tests were compared with the results from the equivalent non-embedded tests, so that initial conclusions could be made regarding the use of embedment to improve conditions for fish passage. Analysis of the cross section velocity distributions showed that, even the non-embedded culvert had a significant portion of the flow area with flow velocity less than the mean velocity. The results from the embedded tests confirmed that embedding the culvert reduced the flow velocity throughout each cross section, although the effect was most significant for the cross sections located greater than one culvert diameter downstream from the inlet. This variation in effectiveness of embedment at reducing flow velocities is attributed to the length of the M 1 backwater profile relative to the culvert length, and thus the differential increase in flow depth that occurred at each measurement location along the culvert. For both the non-embedded and embedded culvert the peak point magnitudes of turbulence intensity were found to be located near the culvert inlet where the flow was contracting. In terms of the cross section average turbulence intensity, in the non-embedded culvert turbulence increased with distance downstream from the inlet and was highest at the cross sections located near the culvert outlet. Embedding the culvert was found to either have no impact, or to slightly increase, the cross section average turbulence intensity near the inlet. Again, a result that is attributed to the tapering out of the M 1 backwater profile at locations near the inlet under the flow conditions tested. However, beyond eight culvert diameters downstream from the inlet, embedment did result in lower cross section average turbulence intensity when compared to the non-embedded culvert. The measured velocity profiles for the non-embedded tests were found to compare well to the theoretical log-law velocity distribution using a ks value of between 0. 012 m and 0. 022 m, or approximately one to two times the corrugation amplitude, when the datum for analysis was considered to be located at the crest of the pipe corrugation. The cross section velocity distributions for the non-embedded tests compared very well to the model proposed by Ead et al. (2000). Based on this assessment, it appears that the Ead et al. model is potentially suitable for use in predicting the amount of the cross sectional area in a non-embedded culvert with flow velocity less than the design target for culvert fish passage design purposes. Overall, the results of the study confirm that, embedding a CSP culvert may be an effective way to improve fish passage conditions in terms of both flow velocity and turbulence intensity...|$|R
