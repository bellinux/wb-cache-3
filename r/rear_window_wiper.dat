50|$|The {{introduction}} of the UC Torana in March 1978 occasioned the demise of V8 power and the cessation of the sporting SL/R variant in the Torana range of cars. The UC series featured a significantly modernised frontal appearance and a completely new interior dash layout. Torana was now rationalised to a choice of two equipment levels and two six-cylinder engines, the 2.85-litre and the 3.3-litre. A 'Deluxe Pack' was an option that allowed the UC Torana SL to compete with Ford's TE Cortina Ghia, which comprised laminated windscreen, tinted side and <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> intermittent <b>wipers,</b> radio/cassette player, cloth trim, sports instrumentation, and bumper overriders. While the V8 was discontinued in the UC, a factory sanctioned dealer option of a turbo was offered. This was called the UC SL/T. These were mainly ordered through Suttons in NSW, but one {{is known to be}} ordered through Zupps in Queensland. These were produced in a mini production run of five cars and only 33 were built. Only one is known to exist today that was ordered through Zupps.|$|R
50|$|The music video, {{which was}} filmed in Sydney, Australia, shows a {{homeless}} man on a street moving his hands as if playing a piano. He observes a tattooed man washing a car window and then leaving the <b>window</b> <b>wiper</b> down on a bench. The homeless man {{picks it up and}} then waves it about like a conductor's baton while walking down the street before he stops in front of someone's car and waves the <b>window</b> <b>wiper</b> in sync with the <b>window</b> <b>wipers</b> on the driver's car, as the driver looks on.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} trim levels, the Normale now became the Junior, and the Elite version was added, a notch above the Elegant in the lineup. There were some very light {{modifications}} to the interior. A large, rollback canvas sunroof became available on the Junior, and a <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> <b>wiper</b> became optional across the range. Aside from the new transmission there were no notable mechanical changes. Power outputs remained at 42, 48, and 70 PS (31, 35.5, and 51.5 kW respectively). The Abarth also received the new five-speed gearbox, {{as well as new}} alloy wheels and foglights as standard.|$|E
5000|$|The 1981 {{model year}} AMC Spirits {{received}} a new crosshatch grille {{with a single}} crosshair element. New optional [...] "Noryl" [...] wheelcovers were added.

50|$|The driver {{drives off}} and the man is {{surrounded}} by cars with horns blaring, before he removes his jacket to reveal a scraggly suit. He continues to wave the <b>window</b> <b>wiper</b> like the conductor's baton before the place is surrounded {{in a blaze of}} light and he uses the baton to control everything around him, even rides at a carnival. Towards the end of the video, a man takes the <b>window</b> <b>wiper</b> away from the homeless man and the latter walks away until he reaches a cliffside. Again, he waves his hands like a conductor making the waves move in time until the song ends. He smiles.|$|R
50|$|Side {{windows were}} not {{existent}} in open cars, {{which may have}} detachable side screens, or manually or power-operated glass side windows as in a saloon or sedan. <b>Rear</b> <b>windows</b> have evolved similarly, with plastic <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> appearing {{as late as the}} first-generation Porsche Boxster. Contemporary convertibles and retractable hardtops feature heatable glass <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> to maximize visibility - though <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> often can compromise visibility by their size, as with the case of the very small <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and restricted visibility of the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder. Plastic windows can degrade, fade, yellow, and crack over time, diminishing visibility.|$|R
50|$|Priced {{considerably}} {{higher than the}} Escort, the EXP carried an ample list of standard equipment. It included power brakes, full instrumentation, full carpeting, map lighting, electric back window defroster, power hatchback release, a digital clock, a cargo area security shade , and rims that are noticeably wider than those of Escorts'. Models with a manual transmission had a sport-tuned exhaust. Automatic models had a wide-open throttle cutout switch for the optional air conditioning compressor clutch.

5000|$|Further model range updates {{have been}} in {{parallel}} with the Minica. In June 1984 the range was updated, becoming the fourth generation U11/12 series (2WD/4WD). Although improvements were made to enhance the Minicab's commercial applications, the most noticeable changes were made to support personal leisure activities. Angular headlamps {{played an important role}} in the Minicab's styling, along with larger windows to improve visibility. A <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> <b>wiper,</b> electronic locking rear gate and power brakes were adopted. Mitsubishi offered fifteen front- and four-wheel drive van model variations and ten truck variations. This was also when the [...] "Bravo" [...] name was added to better equipped van models. This generation (collectively referred to as the U10) was built until November 1990, eventually reaching the U19 chassis code. In total, 707,348 fourth generation Minicabs were built.|$|E

5000|$|They {{have also}} been {{extensively}} applied to <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> as well, where legislative measures have not banned such use.

5000|$|Assembly in South Africa {{began in}} late 1975, in Durban. The car {{was built in}} Toyota's local plant and sold through their network. The 5 was only {{available}} with one engine, the 1.3-liter unit used in the European R5 TS. Claimed output is [...] SAE. There was a base model, with vinyl seats and lap belts only, and the upmarket LS and LSS models. These received fabric interior, side stripes, a vinyl roof, and more sound deadening and other comfort details. The LSS also got a central console and a full length fabric sunroof. Many extras used in Europe, such as a <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> <b>wiper</b> and a tachometer, were not available in South Africa because {{it would make it}} impossible to meet local content regulations. Local content was 56% at introduction; this was to be increased steadily as production wore on.|$|E
50|$|The Alfa Sprint is a 2+2, {{with two}} seats {{in front and}} two in the rear. The two front seats came in two versions, an {{ordinary}} version and sport version with elongated thigh bolsters. An uncommon feature is the ignition key, {{which is on the}} left side of the steering wheel (instead of the more common right). On the middle console there are a few switches for the front and rear fog lamps, the rear window defroster and <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> <b>wiper.</b> Next to this is an analog clock by Jaeger instruments; until 1983, after which it was replaced with a digital one. Underneath are the ventilation control levers, one for hot, a second one for cold air intake, and a third to distribute flow to upper or lower vents. The rear cargo area has a capacity of 425 litres (15 cubic feet), largely due to the high-profile at the rear, and it has a leather cover to conceal items from view.|$|E
50|$|In 1970 a {{flow-through}} ventilation system, where vents {{were added}} towards {{the rear of}} the car (on the exterior under the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> on the 142 and 144 and as a grille next to the right side taillight of the 145) and electrically defrosted <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> were introduced.

5000|$|The GAZ-24 Volga was {{exported}} to many countries, from Indonesia and Latin America to Western Europe. Right-hand-drive export versions also existed. In Europe, {{one of the}} most popular Volgas were cars, both sedans and wagons, assembled in Belgium by Scaldia-Volga. These cars were shipped to Belgium without engines, where they were fitted with Indenor diesels (the same as in the Peugeot 404), a 2.1 litre unit with [...] until the 2300 D was introduced for 1980. The 2.3 litre XD2 has [...] Those models were called M24D and M24DB (Break, station wagon), and there was also a [...] "Luxe" [...] version. Standard Volgas with Soviet engines were sold as M24 and M24B (Break).
