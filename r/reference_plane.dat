5|$|The {{inclination}} of {{a planet}} tells how far above or below an established <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the sky plane or plane of the sky, is the plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth. The eight planets of the Solar System all lie {{very close to the}} ecliptic; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it. The points at which a planet crosses above and below its <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> are called its ascending and descending nodes. The longitude of the ascending node is the angle between the reference plane's 0 longitude and the planet's ascending node. The argument of periapsis (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.|$|E
5|$|Pluto's {{orbital period}} is {{presently}} about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially {{different from those}} of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> called the ecliptic. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately inclined relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and moderately eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies nearer the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came to perihelion on September 5, 1989, and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable plane of the Solar System. Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> of the Solar System out of convenience.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} spherical coordinate systems following other conventions are used outside mathematics. In a geographical coordinate system positions are measured in latitude, longitude and height or altitude. There are a {{number of different}} celestial coordinate systems based on different fundamental planes and with different terms for the various coordinates. The spherical coordinate systems used in mathematics normally use radians rather than degrees and measure the azimuthal angle counterclockwise from the -axis to the -axis rather than clockwise from north (0°) to east (+90°) like the horizontal coordinate system. The polar angle is often replaced by the elevation angle measured from the <b>reference</b> <b>plane.</b> Elevation angle of zero is at the horizon.|$|E
25|$|Further, from 1995 {{designs were}} {{required}} {{to be drawn from}} a <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> (template), and strict limitations were enforced as to the minimum and maximum tolerances for aspects of the vehicle such as the size of the cockpit opening (an idea well known in Champ Car for a decade) and of aerodynamic devices, commonly called wings. Further, maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.5 litres to 3 litres. Further changes were mandated as the FIA continued to try to curb the increase in speeds of Formula One cars as the years progressed. These changes included the increase in size of the cockpit opening (to ensure driver egress was easy and to minimise possible side head impacts), introducing grooved tyres (to reduce cornering speeds by reducing grip) and narrower bodywork (this would complicate cooling and also reduce cornering speed), raising and reducing wing sizes and elements (cutting aerodynamic downforce, thus reducing cornering speed), and introducing comprehensive checks on stiffness tolerances and measurements to ensure cars conformed completely with the regulations (for example, weight tests on wings and bodywork to ensure that they maintained integrity and did not flex to give an aerodynamic advantage in a straight line).|$|E
25|$|The first {{rounds of}} the season proved {{difficult}} for Coulthard; In the opening round in Australia, he retired from engine problems, and finished second in Brazil, before being disqualified as the front wing endplates on his car 7mm lower than the required 50mm above the <b>reference</b> <b>plane.</b> Coulthard overcame these setbacks and finished on the podium {{in the next five}} races, which included victories in Britain and Monaco. In June, Coulthard signed an extension to his contract, confirming he would remain at McLaren for 2001. A non-points scoring finish in Canada, followed victory in France, a victory which he later described as the most memorable of his career which also happened to be McLaren's only ever win at the Magny-Cours circuit. A hat-trick of podiums followed in the next three rounds and secured a fourth-place finish in Belgium. Coulthard was involved in a multi-car collision on the first lap in Italy. This would be marked by scoring points in the final three rounds, including podiums in Japan and Malaysia. Coulthard finished third in the Drivers' Championship, with 73 points, and McLaren finished second in the Constructors' Champions. For his efforts during the season, Coulthard was awarded his second Hawthorn Memorial Trophy.|$|E

40|$|Commonly used craniofacial <b>reference</b> <b>planes</b> such as Frankfort Horizontal (FH) and sella nasion (SN) have {{shortcomings}} {{including their}} variable inter-individual orientation when related to true horizontal (HOR). Therefore, {{the aim of}} this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of a range of craniofacial <b>reference</b> <b>planes</b> to HOR including those which have not been investigated before: Krogman-Walker line (KW line), neutral horizontal axis, foramen magnum line and posterior maxillary plane. A sample of 57 (38 female, 19 males) consecutive, pre-treatment orthodontic subjects aged 12 to 18 were photographically recorded in a standing mirror guided natural head position (NHP). Cephalograms taken at the same time were traced, oriented to a plumb line (true vertical) transferred from the photograph, and measured for statistical analysis. Thirty nine of these subjects were photographically recorded 2 months later to test the reproducibility of NHP. The results showed that the variability of the 11 selected craniofacial <b>reference</b> <b>planes</b> related to HOR was generally high. The planes illustrating lowest variability to HOR were FH and KW line with standard deviations of 4. 6 ° and 4. 7 °, respectively. These, however, showed about double the variation in NHP reproducibility (Dahlberg 2. 1 °). The KW line and palatal plane were also oriented closest to HOR on average. Therefore, KW line and palatal plane are potential substitutes for the commonly used <b>reference</b> <b>planes</b> in the absence of a reliable NHP.

40|$|Abstract—A fully model-based {{nonlinear}} embedding {{device model}} including low- and high-frequency dispersion effects is implemented for the Angelov device model and successfully demonstrated for load modulation power-amplifier (PA) applica-tions. Using this nonlinear embedding device model, any desired PA {{mode of operation}} at the current source plane can be pro-jected to the external <b>reference</b> <b>planes</b> to synthesize the required multi-harmonic source and load terminations. A 2 -D identifica-tion of the intrinsic PA operation modes is performed first at the current source <b>reference</b> <b>planes.</b> For intrinsic modes defined without lossy parasitics, most of the required source impedance terminations will exhibit a substantial negative resistance after projection to the external <b>reference</b> <b>planes.</b> These terminations can then be implemented by active harmonic injection at the input. It is verified experimentally for a 15 -W GaN HEMT class-AB mode that, using the second harmonic injection synthesized by the embedding device model at the input, yields an improved drain efficiency of up to 5 % {{in agreement with the}} simulation. A figure-of-merit is also introduced to evaluate the efficacy of the nonlinear embedding PA design methodology in achieving the targeted intrinsic mode operation given the model accuracy.
