40|$|Comparison {{results are}} {{obtained}} for the inclusion probabilities in some unequal probability sampling plans without replacement. For either successive sampling or Hájek's <b>rejective</b> <b>sampling,</b> the larger the sample size, the more uniform the inclusion probabilities {{in the sense of}} majorization. In particular, the inclusion probabilities are more uniform than the drawing probabilities. For the same sample size, and given the same set of drawing probabilities, the inclusion probabilities are more uniform for <b>rejective</b> <b>sampling</b> than for successive sampling. This last result confirms a conjecture of Hájek (Sampling from a Finite Population (1981) Dekker). Results are also presented in terms of the Kullback [...] Leibler divergence, showing that the inclusion probabilities for successive sampling are more proportional to the drawing probabilities.

40|$|Occasionally, a {{selected}} probability sample may appear undesirable {{with respect to}} the available auxiliary information. In such a situation, the practitioner might consider rejecting the sample and selecting a new set of sample elements. We consider a procedure in which the probability sample is rejected unless the sample mean of an auxiliary vector is within a specified distance of the population mean. It is proven that the large sample mean and variance of the regression estimator for the rejective sample are the same as those of the regression estimator for the original selection procedure. Likewise, the usual estimator of variance for the regression estimator is appropriate for the rejective sample. In a Monte Carlo experiment, the large sample properties hold for relatively small samples and the Monte Carlo results are in agreement with the theoretical orders of approximation. The efficiency effect of the described <b>rejective</b> <b>sampling</b> is o(n N-super- - 1, where n N is the expected sample size, but the effect can be important for particular samples. For example, <b>rejective</b> <b>sampling</b> can be used to eliminate those samples that give negative weights for the regression estimator. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{establishing}} exponential bounds for the probabilities of deviation of a sample sum from its expectation, when the variables involved in the summation are obtained by sampling in a finite population according to a rejective scheme, generalizing sampling without replacement, and by using an appropriate normalization. In contrast to Poisson sampling, classical deviation inequalities in the i. i. d. setting do not straightforwardly apply to sample sums related to rejective schemes, due to the inherent dependence structure of the sampled points. We show here how to overcome this difficulty, by combining the formulation of <b>rejective</b> <b>sampling</b> as Poisson sampling conditioned upon the sample size with the Escher transformation. In particular, the Bennett/Bernstein type bounds established highlight {{the effect of the}} asymptotic variance of the (properly standardized) sample weighted sum and are shown to be much more accurate than those based on the negative association property shared by the terms involved in the summation. Beyond its interest in itself, such a result for <b>rejective</b> <b>sampling</b> is crucial, insofar as it can be extended to many other sampling schemes, namely those that can be accurately approximated by rejective plans {{in the sense of the}} total variation distance...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{practical}} construction of asymptotic confidence intervals for smooth (i. e., path-wise differentiable), real-valued statistical parameters by targeted learning from independent and identically distributed data in contexts where sample size {{is so large}} that it poses computational challenges. We observe some summary measure of all data and select a sub-sample from the complete data set by Poisson <b>rejective</b> <b>sampling</b> with unequal inclusion probabilities based on the summary measures. Targeted learning is carried out from the easier to handle sub-sample. We derive a central limit theorem for the targeted minimum loss estimator (TMLE) which enables {{the construction of the}} confidence intervals. The inclusion probabilities can be optimized to reduce the asymptotic variance of the TMLE. We illustrate the procedure with two examples where the parameters of interest are variable importance measures of an exposure (binary or continuous) on an outcome. We also conduct a simulation study and comment on its results. keywords: semiparametric inference; survey sampling; targeted minimum loss estimation (TMLE...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Sampling is {{inevitable}} in epidemiological studies involving large cohorts. Designs such as case-cohort sampling and counter matching were originally developed in semi-parametric settings where {{individuals with a}} common base line hazard are followed over {{time in order to}} detect relationships between disease and exposure. Even when design performance is favorable when measured by asymptotic relative efficiency against situations where full cohort data is available, the use of sampling designs raises questions about their absolute efficiency. In addition, many sampling designs developed in the semi-parametric setting can be implemented in studies having no time dependence, and the usual martingale methods and counting process techniques can no longer be used in the study of estimator properties. In their place, to analyze the frequency matching design, local central limit theorems for independent but not identically distributed Bernoulli random variables must be developed, which by conditioning, allows for the study of asymptotic estimator properties. The analysis also provides results about the high correlation structure in the sampling proportional to size type scheme known as <b>rejective</b> <b>sampling...</b>|$|E

40|$|Sampling {{distinct}} {{units from}} a population with unequal probabilities without replacement {{is a problem}} often considered in the literature, e. g. Hanif and Brewer (1980). If we implement such a sampling design, we can estimate the total of an unknown characteristic by the Horvitz-Thompson estimator (1951). One of the aims of statistical inference in a sample survey {{is to have an}} asymptotic normal distribution for this estimator. Stenlund and Westlund (1975) examine this problem from an empirical point of view. In this paper, we give a theoretical framework where we show that this problem can be solved by maximizing entropy. Hajek (1981, p. 33) conjectured one of this fact but without a formal expression. Hajek (1964) gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the asymptotic normality of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator, if the <b>rejective</b> <b>sampling</b> is performed. In this work, we give a rate of convergence for any kind of sampling. We apply our results to the Rao (1965) and Sampford (1967) sampling and to the successive sampling (Hajek, 1964) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn certain {{situations}} that shall be undoubtedly {{more and more}} common in the Big Data era, the datasets available are so massive that computing statistics over the full samples is hardly feasible, if not unfeasible. A natural approach in this context consists in using survey schemes and substituting the ‘full data’ statistics with their counterparts based on the resulting random samples, of manageable size. It is the main purpose of this paper to investigate the impact of survey sampling on statistical learning methods based on empirical risk minimization through the standard binary classification problem, considered here as a ‘case in point’. Precisely, we prove that, in presence of auxiliary information, appropriate use of optimally coupled Poisson survey plans may not affect much the learning rates, while possibly reducing significantly the number of terms that must be averaged to compute the empirical risk functional with overwhelming probability. These striking results are next shown to extend to more general sampling schemes by means of a coupling technique, originally introduced by Hajek [Asymptotic theory of <b>rejective</b> <b>sampling</b> with varying probabilities from a finite population.
