2500|$|Repsold-Bessel pendulum: It was {{time-consuming}} and error-prone to repeatedly swing the Kater's pendulum {{and adjust the}} weights until the periods were equal. [...] Friedrich Bessel showed in 1835 that this was unnecessary. [...] As long as the periods were close together, the gravity could be calculated from the two periods {{and the center of}} gravity of the pendulum. [...] So the <b>reversible</b> <b>pendulum</b> didn't need to be adjustable, it could just be a bar with two pivots. Bessel also showed that if the pendulum was made symmetrical in form about its center, but was weighted internally at one end, the errors due to air drag would cancel out. Further, another error due to the finite diameter of the knife edges could be made to cancel out if they were interchanged between measurements. Bessel didn't construct such a pendulum, but in 1864 Adolf Repsold, under contract by the Swiss Geodetic Commission made a pendulum along these lines. [...] The Repsold pendulum was about 56cm long and had a period of about [...] second. It was used extensively by European geodetic agencies, and with the Kater pendulum in the Survey of India.

For about a century, until the 1930s, Kater's pendulum and its various refinements remained the standard method for measuring the strength of the Earth's gravity during geodetic surveys.

40|$|There {{exists a}} set of {{reversible}} primitive modules that may be combined according to {{a set of}} simple rules to create larger systems, which are themselves reversible primitive modules. These modules may be combined to create a fully reversible, universal computer. I describe techniques for creating reversible primitive modules from simple switches, such as conventional CMOS transistors, and the rules for combining these modules to maintain re-versibility. As an example of a complex system that can be constructed from these modules, a fully <b>reversible</b> microprocessor, <b>Pendulum,</b> is presented. This universal microprocessor has been fabricated in a 0. 5 pm CMOS process and tested. Pendulum has eighteen instructions, including memory access, branching instructions, and direction changing instructions. The datapath supports twelve-bit wide data and address values. The motivation for reversible computing research comes from an investigation of funda-mental limits of energy dissipation during computation. A minimum energy dissipation of kBT ln 2, where kB is Boltzmann's constant, is required when a bit is erased.

40|$|Energy {{dissipation}} {{in modern}} microprocessors is rapidly becoming a primary design concern. Microprocessors containing {{a few million}} transistors and dissipating tens of watts are commonplace, limiting their usefulness in portable applications and making heat removal in dense structures difficult. An expanding market for portable devices and increasing device density will continue to encourage low energy design. Computing engines can be designed {{that do not require}} energy dissipation, but only if the computation is logically reversible, a radical departure from both traditional logic design and traditional low energy design techniques. This thesis presents <b>Pendulum,</b> a logically <b>reversible</b> computer architecture that may operate without dissipating energy.

40|$|In 2001, Patrick P. Gelsinger, {{a senior}} vice {{president}} at Intel corp., predicts that one of the bottlenecks of modern chip design is heat dissipation and that the upper limits of power density will be reached within the next 15 years, provided that the current trends continue [Gel 01]. For the end of this decade he predicts a processor power consumption of over 1000 W and a processor power density of over 1000 W/cm 2 (as hot as a rocket nozzle). He concludes that “business as usual ” is not an option for chip design. Reversible computing holds the promise to reduce power consumption by recycling the energy used in the circuit in each computing process [Fra 99]. Part of the heat generated by the dissipated energy might be used for other productive purposes. Reversible computing is one of the potential solution to overcome the future limits of power density in microprocessors. The ideas have been around for many years [Lan 61,Ben 73] and recently found renewed interest. An example is the <b>reversible</b> microprocessor <b>Pendulum</b> [Fra 99]. To gain the highest reversibility profit, it is necessary to consider not only low-level hardware issues but also high-level logical reversibility on a software and programming language level. Reversible computation which is a deterministic forward and backward computation of a program is closely related to inverse computation. A reversible program allows a deterministic time-invertible computation where at any time not only the next machine state can be constructed given the current state, but the previous machine state can be constructe...|$|R

5000|$|As {{part of a}} {{committee}} appointed by the Royal Society in 1816 to reform British measures, Kater had been contracted by the House of Commons to determine accurately {{the length of the}} seconds pendulum in London. He realized Huygens' principle could be used to find the center of oscillation, and so the length L, of a rigid (compound) pendulum. If a pendulum were hung upside down from a second pivot point that could be adjusted {{up and down on the}} pendulum's rod, and the second pivot were adjusted until the pendulum had the same period as it did when swinging right side up from the first pivot, the second pivot would be at the center of oscillation, and the distance between the two pivot points would be L. Kater wasn't the first to have this idea. French mathematician Gaspard de Prony first proposed a <b>reversible</b> <b>pendulum</b> in 1800, but his work was not published till 1889. In 1811 Friedrich Bohnenberger again discovered it, but Kater independently invented it and was first to put it in practice.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} method for {{identification}} of axial moment of inertia of the mechanical system called reaction wheel pendulum with a viscous friction in the bearings of the suspension. The method {{is based on the}} <b>reversible</b> symmetric motions. <b>Pendulum</b> system motion includes a free measured motion and reverse symmetrical motion at the same angular interval. The pendulum includes a rod with a low-power DC motor with a flywheel attached {{to the end of the}} rod. The angle of rotation and velocity of the rod and the flywheel are measured by encoders. The paper introduces a new method,presents a design formula,a mathematical model of the pendulum system and a robust motor control law for it. The method is based on energy algorithm and control residing in electric motor operational changes by means of a flywheel. The mechanical system moves symmetrically that is provided by nonuniform controlled flywheel rotation. As a result, the influence of dissipative factors on identification results is eliminated. Dynamic modeling is carried out for the pendulum system and proves high accuracy of the method. The research results can be used for identification of complex mechanical systems under the action of resistance, dissipative and other forces...|$|R
50|$|As a scientist, Van der Willigen did {{significant}} work in {{the research}} on physical units - where he tried to use the wavelength of light to set a new and trustworthy standard for a unit of distance. In those days there was insufficient data on the reliability of measurement units because errors {{had been made in}} the standards based on the circumference of the earth. The Dutch Minister of the Interior had requested the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen in 1851 {{to come up with a}} new standard for both length and weight. Inspired by this discussion and a publication by the Swedish scientist Anders Ångström in 1855, Van der Willigen decided to dedicate himself first to the determination of the refractive index and the wavelength of light, in order to be able to more accurately define the unit of length. In the inner garden of the Museum, he had a small observatory built in 1866/1867, where he set up several precision instruments to determine the latitude (zenith telescope) and time (clock). There he also kept an astronomical regulator, heliostat, spectroscope, diffraction gratings, microscope with micrometer, balance, thermometers and barometers. He also ordered the standards of length (glass) and weight (copper). Combining these instruments he tried to determine a standard of length by use of a seconds pendulum (initially a Foucault pendulum, later he ordered a Repsold <b>reversible</b> <b>pendulum</b> which arrived shortly after his death). Besides his work on measurements, he also purchased acoustics instruments, on which he gave a series of lectures in the museum.|$|E
