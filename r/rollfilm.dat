50|$|Despite the {{advances}} in low-cost photography {{made possible by}} Eastman, plate cameras still offered higher-quality prints and remained popular well into the 20th century. To compete with <b>rollfilm</b> cameras, which offered {{a larger number of}} exposures per loading, many inexpensive plate cameras from this era were equipped with magazines to hold several plates at once. Special backs for plate cameras allowing them to use film packs or <b>rollfilm</b> were also available, as were backs that enabled <b>rollfilm</b> cameras to use plates.|$|E

50|$|The Mamiya C220 is a {{lightweight}} twin-lens reflex camera {{made in the}} early 1970s with interchangeable lenses ranging from 55 mm wide-angle to 250 mm telephoto. The camera accepts 120 and 220 <b>rollfilms.</b> The rack and pinion focusing system with a bellows {{makes it possible for}} close-up photography without attachments. The straight film path has no sharp turns for absolute flatness of the film.|$|R
50|$|Before World War II, each film {{manufacturer}} {{used its}} own {{system of numbering}} for the various sizes of <b>rollfilms</b> they made. The following sortable table shows the corresponding numbers. A blank space means that manufacturer did not make film in that size. Two numbers in one box refers to films available with different numbers of exposures, usually 6 and either 10 or 12. Spool length is measured between inner faces of the flanges; several films of the same image size were available on different spools to fit different cameras.|$|R

Prilikom obrade materijala koja je započela 2010. godine istaknula su se tri albuma s crno-bijelim negativima formata 6 x 6 cm označena natpisom „PRIVATNI“. Negativi pripadaju osobnoj zbirci akademika Ive Petriciolija i nastali su prilikom njegovih putovanja Francuskom i Italijom. Dr Ivo Petricioli {{left behind}} a large {{collection}} of material from his activity as a photographer. Although the majority of {{it is in the}} possession of the late Professor’s family, 85 black and white negatives on 6 x 6 <b>rollfilms</b> grouped in three albums are housed as part of the Petricioli Collection in the Department of History of Art of the University of Zadar. The collection was formed by Petricioli himself soon after he joined the Department as a lecturer. The collection contains different photographic material: exposures and negatives on various surfaces. The physical condition of the collection is, apart from minor mechanical and chemical damage sustained by some items, satisfactory. The initial sorting of the photographic material in the collection began in 2010. Three albums marked with the label ‘PRIVATE’ on the side attracted interest. They contain 85 black and white negatives created in the period between 1958 and 1965 during the Professor’s private travels in France and Italy. The negatives are well preserved: some have only minor scratches while some were stained through the action of residual chemicals after they were developed. Apart from excellent photographs of art-historical monuments in French and Italian towns with a pronounced note of the documentary, a number of interesting vedutes can be found among the negatives. Until now, the photographic oeuvre of Dr Ivo Petricioli had been unsorted and unpublished, leaving the public unfamiliar with his photographic works, which certainly merit attention...|$|R

50|$|Sheet film {{or glass}} plate holders for medium format <b>rollfilm</b> cameras can be found, but are of mainly {{historical}} interest. Some <b>rollfilm</b> cameras have interchangeable backs to accommodate different film types. Some 35mm cameras have motorised backs that hold longer than normal film lengths, with a mechanism that automatically advances the film after each exposure.|$|E
50|$|Rangefinder {{cameras were}} {{produced}} in half- and full-frame 35 mm and <b>rollfilm</b> (medium format).|$|E
50|$|When still cameras using 35 mm film, {{originally}} {{used for}} cinematography, were introduced they were widely known as miniature cameras to distinguish {{them from the}} then commonplace <b>rollfilm</b> cameras. While the term {{could be used for}} a camera larger than a subminiature and smaller than a <b>rollfilm</b> camera, it was mostly used for cameras taking 135 film cassettes, or other 35 mm cassettes.|$|E

50|$|Models 67 and 670 have Nikkor 80mm f/2.8 lenses. Both models take ten 6×7cm {{exposures}} on 120 <b>rollfilm,</b> {{while the}} 670 model also accepts 220 <b>rollfilm</b> (20 exposures per roll). Model W67 {{is similar to}} the 670 model, but with a wide-angle Nikkor 55 mm lens (roughly equivalent to a 28 mm lens in 135 format). The 55 mm was considered one of the sharpest and most flare-free of any produced during the analogue photography era.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} cameras {{folded into}} the body and used bellows to protect the light path. The film was put on two spools, one with the negative roll, and one with the positive paper and reagent pods. The film developed inside the camera. The exception to this is the Polaroid Swinger, a hardbody <b>rollfilm</b> camera whose film was {{pulled out of the}} camera body to develop outside the camera. The film for <b>rollfilm</b> cameras was discontinued in 1992.|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{introduction}} of <b>rollfilm,</b> folding plate cameras with limited movements as described here were often used. An example is the Goerz Taro-Tenax 9x12cm.|$|E

50|$|Rangefinder cameras {{have been}} made in all sizes and all film formats over the years, from 35mm through medium format (<b>rollfilm)</b> to large-format press cameras. Until the mid-1950s most were {{generally}} fitted to more expensive models of cameras. Folding bellows <b>rollfilm</b> cameras, such as the Balda Super Baldax or Mess Baldix, the Kodak Retina II, IIa, IIc, IIIc, and IIIC cameras and the Hans Porst Hapo 66e (a cheaper version of the Balda Mess Baldix), were often fitted with rangefinders.|$|E
50|$|Medium-format (<b>rollfilm)</b> {{rangefinder}} cameras {{continue to}} be produced. Recent models include the Mamiya 6 and 7I/7II, the Bronica RF645 and the Fuji G, GF, GS, GW and GSW series.|$|E
50|$|Kodak {{got into}} the market with the Retina I in 1934, which {{introduced}} the 135 cartridge used in all modern 35 mm cameras. Although the Retina was comparatively inexpensive, 35 mm cameras were still {{out of reach for}} most people and <b>rollfilm</b> remained the format of choice for mass-market cameras. This changed in 1936 with the introduction of the inexpensive Argus A and to an even greater extent in 1939 {{with the arrival of the}} immensely popular Argus C3. Although the cheapest cameras still used <b>rollfilm,</b> 35 mm film had come to dominate the market by the time the C3 was discontinued in 1966.|$|E
5000|$|Linhof is a German company, {{founded in}} Munich in 1887 by Valentin Linhof. The company {{is well known}} for making premium <b>rollfilm</b> and large format film cameras. Linhof {{initially}} focused on making camera shutters and developing the first leaf shutter, which became part of Compur.|$|E
50|$|The smaller {{variants}} of <b>rollfilm</b> stayed popular {{for a while}} after introduction of 35mm film in still photography. Thus at least the smaller frame formats for 127 film where also seen as miniature formats, a fact reflected in camera names like Topcon's Minion (4&times;5cm format) and Utility Manufacturing Company's Falcon Miniature (3&times;4cm format).|$|E
5000|$|High cost: {{there is}} limited demand for view cameras, {{so that there are}} no economies of scale and they are much more {{expensive}} than mass-produced cameras. Some are handmade. Even though the cost of sheet film and processing is much higher than <b>rollfilm,</b> fewer sheets of film are exposed, which partially offsets the cost.|$|E
50|$|Ihagee's most {{successful}} camera by far was the Exakta, which was produced between 1933 and 1976. The series began in 1933 with the Standard, or VP, Exakta, which used 127 <b>rollfilm.</b> This was followed in 1936 by the popular 35mm Kine Exakta. Ihagee {{also made a}} smaller, less complex, version of the Exakta called the Exa.|$|E
5000|$|The Diana {{camera is}} a plastic-bodied box camera using 120 <b>rollfilm</b> and 35 mm film. The camera has a simple plastic {{meniscus}} lens. Originally marketed as an inexpensive novelty gift item, the Diana {{has been used}} to specifically take soft focus, impressionistic photographs somewhat reminiscent of the Pictorialist Period of artistic photography, branded in contemporary times as lomography.|$|E
50|$|Pocket Kodak 1895-1896Pocket Kodaks {{were small}} (2 and 3/16 x 3 x 4 inches) and {{lightweight}} (6 ounces), and took roughly 2 inch exposures on 102 size <b>rollfilm.</b> This camera {{had a new}} feature, a small view box that told how many exposures of film were left. They were first available in 1895 with either black or red leather covering.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of films enabled the existing designs for plate cameras {{to be made}} much smaller and for the base-plate to be hinged {{so that it could}} be folded up compressing the bellows. These designs were very compact and small models were dubbed vest pocket cameras. Folding <b>rollfilm</b> cameras were preceded by folding plate cameras, more compact than other designs.|$|E
50|$|Virtually any lens can be fitted, {{and backs}} for sheet film, <b>rollfilm,</b> digital back and Polaroid backs. For some uses with long exposures, or flash lighting; a shutter is unnecessary; {{removing}} a lens cap {{to expose the}} film is sufficient. Extremely small apertures such as 64 can be used without issues of diffraction on the lenses, of much larger focal length than those used for smaller images (a small relative aperture is still a fairly large hole, reducing diffraction).|$|E
5000|$|The {{most popular}} <b>rollfilm</b> {{is the type}} 120 film format, which is used in most medium-format cameras and roll film {{magazines}} for large-format cameras. Until the 1950s, 120 roll film was also used {{in what was then}} the most simple of snapshot cameras, and box cameras. The use of roll film in consumer cameras was largely superseded by 135 and 126 cartridges, but 120 and 220 (double length) film are still commonly used in medium-format cameras.|$|E
50|$|Medium-format cameras have a film size {{between the}} large-format cameras and smaller 35mm cameras. Typically these systems use 120 or 220 <b>rollfilm.</b> The most common image sizes are 6×4.5 cm, 6×6 cm and 6×7 cm; the older 6×9 cm is rarely used. The designs {{of this kind}} of camera show greater {{variation}} than their larger brethren, ranging from monorail systems through the classic Hasselblad model with separate backs, to smaller rangefinder cameras. There are even compact amateur cameras available in this format.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} Japanese SLR for <b>rollfilm</b> {{was perhaps}} the Baby Super Flex (or Super Flex Baby), a 127 camera made by Umemoto and distributed by Kikōdō from 1938. This had a leaf shutter, but two years later came the Shinkoflex, a 6×6 camera made by Yamashita Shōkai, with a focal-plane shutter and interchangeable lenses. However, Japanese camera makers concentrated on rangefinder and twin-lens reflex cameras (as well of course as simpler, viewfinder cameras), {{similar to those of}} the Western makers.|$|E
5000|$|Several of {{the types}} of holders made for large format film, {{including}} darkslide sheet holders, Grafmatic multi-sheet holders, the Graflex bag mag, and film packs were also manufactured in medium format sizes, almost always 2"&times;3" [...] (6&times;9 cm). Press camera manufacturers often produced smaller versions of their 4&times;5 cameras in this size, often called [...] "23", and while later versions of these cameras could use <b>rollfilm</b> adaptors, these were not widely available until almost 1950, and were expensive in their first years of production.|$|E
50|$|Film holders that adapt <b>rollfilm</b> to {{sheet film}} cameras are usually called film backs. Film backs for 4&times;5 inch cameras are {{particularly}} common - {{there is little}} point in taking 6&times;9 cm pictures on a 20 x 25 cm camera. Horseman, Linhof, Graflex, and other manufacturers have made roll film holders in 6&times;7, 6&times;8, 6&times;9, 6&times;12, and 6&times;17 cm formats. Some models can slip under the ground glass like a normal sheet film holder, while others require that the photographer replace the ground glass with the roll holder.|$|E
5000|$|GS-1: Introduced April 1983, {{production}} discontinued June 2002. Lightweight, electronically controlled, modular 6x7 cm medium-format SLR camera system with leaf shutter lenses, four interchangeable viewfinders, speed grip, and optional film-backs for Polaroid Land pack film, 6x4.5 cm, 6x6 cm, and 6x7 cm <b>rollfilm.</b> 120 and 220 size film-backs available in 6x4.5, 6x6 and 6x7 cm. A 35mm film-back was {{listed in the}} camera's marketing materials, but never materialized. Dedicated Flash (G1). The GS-1 uses [...] "PG"-series lenses {{in a variety of}} focal lengths: 50mm, 65mm, 80mm, 100mm, 110mm macro, 150mm, 200mm, 250mm, and 500mm.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s August Nagel was {{developing}} a 35mm {{camera and a}} preloaded disposable 35mm film cartridge, which would also fit in Leica and Contax cameras. Nagel was an expert in miniature cameras; his Vollenda miniature folder, along with the Ranca and Pupille collapsible cameras were smaller than the Leica and Contax cameras, but could use 50mm f:3.5 Elmar and other similar Tessar formula lenses in Compur shutters to create a larger 30mm x 40mm image on 127 <b>rollfilm.</b> The advantage of 35mm would be {{the elimination of the}} paper-backer allowing more images per roll of film.|$|E
5000|$|The Fotron was {{a camera}} {{manufactured}} in Glendale, California by the Traid Corporation and sold door-to-door during the 1960s. Aimed primarily at women, it was marketed as a simpler alternative to [...] "complicated" [...] traditional cameras. The Fotron {{had a number}} of innovative features, including a built-in electronic flash, rechargeable battery, motorized film advance, and push-button exposure control. It used standard 828 <b>rollfilm</b> packaged in a proprietary snap-in cartridge. However, due to its high price (ranging from $150 USD to almost $500) and the fact that film had to be returned to the manufacturer for processing, the Fotron is often regarded as something of a scam.|$|E
