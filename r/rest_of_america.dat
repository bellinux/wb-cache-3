Running from Great Falls, Montana, to Fairbanks, the road was the first stable link between Alaska and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>America.</b> The construction of military bases, such as the Adak base, contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities. Anchorage almost doubled in size, from 4,200 people in 1940 to 8,000 in 1945.|$|E

A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E
25|$|The Philadelphian cricketing {{establishment}} had {{strict rules}} for maintaining an American feel in their cricket. Wood {{was not allowed}} to play on the representative Philadelphian cricket team until he had satisfied a 5-year residency requirement. In 1881 Wood accepted at offer to coach the Belmont Cricket Club and took a position with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in Philadelphia in 1882. Though he had come to Philadelphia to manage and play for Belmont, his first-class debut in Philadelphia was between the American born cricketers in the city and those Englishmen that were resident there. Playing for the English Residents, Wood scored only 5 runs in the match and his side lost. He played in this match each year until 1884 when he first played against the Philadelphians with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>America.</b> He scored 32 runs in the second innings of this loss. His debut for the Philadelphian side came on 5 September 1892 against the remaining US players. In this match, Wood led his new team with a career high 182 runs before being stumped. The Philadelphian side won by an innings and 281 runs. He played {{for the next five years}} against touring foreign sides before joining the Philadelphians on their tour of England in 1897. He also took part in the tours of 1903 and 1908. Wood died in Philadelphia on 25 August 1947.|$|E

[...] Throughout the trek participants have lessons rooted in environmental science, visits from guest speakers, and the opportunity to work on conservation projects with the Philmont Conservation Department and the U.S. Forest Service in the Valle Vidal Unit of the Carson National Forest. While on the trail participants learn about ecology, botany, dendrology, geology, hydrology, forestry, soil science, fire ecology, environmental policy, leave no trace principles, environmental ethics, conservation techniques, and wildlife, range, and land management practices. Participants tackle conservation projects ranging from trailbuilding to meadow encroachment to timber stand improvement to erosion control to streambed restoration. [...] Participants are exposed to the land management challenges facing the West, as well as the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>America.</b> The program focuses on empowering participants so that they may transfer what they learn on the trail to their lives back home.|$|E

60|$|And {{while the}} great {{states of the}} {{continent}} of Europe are hammering down their obstructions of language and national tradition or raising the educational level above them until a working unity is possible, and while the reconstruction of Eastern Asia--whether that be under Russian, Japanese, English, or native Chinese direction--struggles towards attainment, will there also be a great synthesis of the English-speaking peoples going on? I am inclined {{to believe that there}} will be such a synthesis, and that the head and centre of the new unity will be the great urban region that is developing between Chicago and the Atlantic, and which will lie mainly, but not entirely, south of the St. Lawrence. Inevitably, I think, that region must become the intellectual, political, and industrial centre of any permanent unification of the English-speaking states. There will, I believe, develop about that centre a great federation of white English-speaking peoples, a federation having America north of Mexico as its central mass (a federation that may conceivably include Scandinavia) and its federal government will sustain a common fleet, and protect or dominate or actually administer most or all of the non-white states of the present British Empire, and in addition much of the South and Middle Pacific, the East and West Indies, the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>America,</b> and the larger part of black Africa. Quite apart from the dominated races, such an English-speaking state should have by the century-end a practically homogeneous citizenship of at least a hundred million sound-bodied and educated and capable men. It should be the first of the three powers of the world, and it should face the organizing syntheses of Europe and Eastern Asia with an intelligent sympathy. By the year 2000 all its common citizens should certainly be in touch with the thought of Continental Europe through the medium of French; its English language should be already rooting firmly through all the world beyond its confines, and its statesmanship should be preparing openly and surely, and discussing calmly with the public mind of the European, and probably of the Yellow state, the possible coalescences and conventions, the obliteration of custom-houses, the homologization of laws and coinage and measures, and the mitigation of monopolies and special claims, by which the final peace of the world may be assured for ever. Such a synthesis, at any rate, of the peoples now using the English tongue, I regard not only as a possible, but as a probable, thing. The positive obstacles to its achievement, great though they are, are yet trivial in comparison with the obstructions to that lesser European synthesis we have ventured to forecast. The greater obstacle is negative, it lies in the want of stimulus, in the lax prosperity of most of the constituent states of such a union. But such a stimulus, the renascence of Eastern Asia, or a great German fleet upon the ocean, may presently supply.|$|E
