40|$|A {{comparison}} of platinum-based and non-platinum-based chemotherapy <b>regimens</b> {{for the treatment}} of small cell lung cancer Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a very aggressive form of cancer due to early metastasis. As a result, chemotherapy forms the mainstay of treatment. This review compared platinum-based chemotherapy <b>regimens</b> and non-platinum-based chemotherapy <b>regimens</b> {{for the treatment of}} SCLC. The results show that there is no significant difference between platinum-based and non-platinum-based chemotherapy <b>regimens</b> in terms of survival and overall (complete and partial) tumour response. However, platinum-based <b>regimens</b> did have better complete tumour response rates. Platinum-based <b>regimens</b> also had higher levels of nausea and vomiting, anaemia and thrombocytopenia toxicity.

Our analysis suggests that antidepressant monotherapy continues to be the most widely used drug treatment approach, accounting for 84 percent of depression treatment <b>regimens.</b> Antidepressant monotherapy is more prevalent among primary care physician-prescribed treatment <b>regimens</b> (92 %) than psychiatry-prescribed <b>regimens</b> (73 %). Combination treatment <b>regimens</b> have become increasingly more common as physician perception of disease severity increases, with antidepressant combination therapy accounting for eight percent, 17 percent, and 27 percent of treatment <b>regimens</b> for mild, moderate, and severe depression, respectively. The most commonly used agents in addition to an antidepressant in combination treatment <b>regimens</b> include another antidepressant (40 % of combination <b>regimens),</b> an anxiety agent (40 %), and/or atypical antipsychotics (18 %).

Between 2007 and 2012, a total of 394 mCRC patients, in whom 169 KRAS mutant and 225 KRAS wild-type, were enrolled. In KRAS mutant patients who had used oxaliplatin-based <b>regimens</b> (N = 131), the OS was significantly longer than that in KRAS mutant patients who had never-used oxaliplatin-based <b>regimens</b> (N = 38). The OS was 28. 8 months [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 23. 2 - 34. 4] in KRAS mutant patients who had used oxaliplatin-based <b>regimens</b> versus 17. 8 months [95 % CI: 6. 5 - 29. 1] in KRAS mutant patients who had never-used oxaliplatin-based <b>regimens</b> (P = 0. 026). Notably, OS in KRAS wild-type mCRC patients who had used oxaliplatin-based <b>regimens</b> (N = 185) was not significantly longer than that in KRAS wild-type mCRC patients who had never-used oxaliplatin-based <b>regimens</b> (N = 40) (P = 0. 25).

In multivariate analyses, patients who had used oxaliplatin-based <b>regimens</b> remains an independent prognostic factor for longer OS in KRAS mutant mCRC patients.
