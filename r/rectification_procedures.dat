Higher order polynomials do not appear to improve the rectification accuracy. A subscene area of 256 x 256 pixels was rectified with a 1 st degree polynomial to yield an RMSE sub xy value of + or - 40 m, indicating that USGS 1 : 24, 000 scale quadrangle-sized areas of LANDSAT- 4 data can be fitted to a map base with relatively few control points and simple equations. The errors in the rectification process are caused by the spatial resolution of the MSS data, by errors in the maps and GCP digitizing process, and by displacements caused by terrain relief.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the counter-force of prosthetic screws {{before and after}} the rectification procedure of the seating base of prosthetic framework screws. Methods: With a metal matrix containing three replicas of conical abutments (Micro-Unit; Conexão) placed at 10 mm from center to center, ten multiple cast structures were made of a titanium monoblock. The multiple cast structures were fastened onto the metal matrix abutments with a torque of 10 NCm. The screwing sequence was performed from the central pillar towards the distal ones. The force (Ncm) necessary for counter-torque was evaluated using a digital torque meter (TQ 3000; Lutron, Taipei, Taiwan). This procedure was carried out before and after rectification of the seating base of the prosthetic screws, by means of a manual rectifier tip (Conexão Sistemas de Prótese, São Paulo, Brazil). The mean counter-torque values were calculated for each structure before and after rectification. The t-Test for paired samples was used to compare the evaluated situations.

40|$|Distortion is a {{potential}} problem with all welded fabrications. To a large extent, industrial control of weld induced distortion is achieved by reliance on past experience, simple empirical formulae or <b>rectification</b> <b>procedures.</b> Rectification can be costly, whilst in large complex structures, empirical formulae are rarely applicable. Classical approaches to the modelling of welding distortion and residual stress, whilst accurate, have not been readily useable within industry. The time and cost associated with running such models appear to be the main reasons contributing to this situation. Nevertheless, the use of computer simulative techniques has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of welded fabrications by allowing for predictions to be made long before a single weld bead is put down on the workshop floor. Therefore, computer models that are aimed at predicting welding phenomena not only need to be accurate, but must also be affordable and capable of making predictions within industrial time frames {{if they are to be}} used by fabricators. This paper presents one such strategy. The Shrinkage Volume Method is a linear elastic finite-element modelling technique that has been developed to predict post-weld distortion. By assuming that the linear thermal contraction of a nominal shrinkage volume is the main driving force for distortion, the need to determine the transient temperature field and microstructural changes is eliminated. In so doing, the model solution times are reduced significantly and the use of linear elastic finite-element methods permits large, highly complex welded structures to be modelled within a reasonable time frame. Verification of the modelled results was carried out by an experimental program that investigated the distortion of plain carbon steel plates having differing vee-butt preparations. The initial models, which had assumed the edge preparation to be representative of the overall shrinkage volume, were in reasonable agreement with the experimentally determined distortion values. Further improvements to these results were made by using a thermal model to define better the effective weld shrinkage volume. A. Bachorski, M. J. Painter, A. J. Smailes, M. A. Waha...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is the photogrammetric study of the geometric properties of aircraft multispectral scanner data. The research involves three areas; the use of Gauss-Markov processes in single strip <b>rectification</b> <b>procedures,</b> the use of spatial block adjustment techniques with multiple sidelapping strips, and the implementation of object space geometric constraints into aircraft MSS restitution algorithms. ^ The research into Gauss-Markov processes involves {{the study of the}} theoretical nature of the processes and their application in a rigorous and efficient manner to aircraft MSS data restitution. Comparisons of the results using first and second order Gauss-Markov processes show that the second order process gives results equal to or slightly worse than those of the first order, while taking more execution time. The first order Gauss-Markov is therefore chosen as the optimum method. ^ The spatial block adjustment algorithm was implemented using the collinearity technique, constrained segmentation of strips, a priori weighting of parameters and constraints, and complete editing and evaluation statistics. Tests were conducted, using three sidelapping strips of data, to compare single and multiple strip adjustments, to determine the effect of constrained segmentation of the strips, and to evaluate the determinancy of the (omega) and (phi) orientation parameters. It is concluded that constrained segmentation does have a beneficial effect and that the determination of points by the use of multiple sidelapping strips, is more accurate than using only one ray. Inclusion of the (omega) parameter improves the accuracy, although high correlations result among the orientation parameters. Due to the lack of terrain relief in the data set used, the (phi) parameter was not recoverable. ^ The mathematical basis for the use of object space straight line constraints is developed and their application outlined. Tests using single strips show that accuracy and precision of points on the line are greatly improved, with some improvements for other points in the adjustment. It is possible to use the straight line constraints in place of elevation assignment for single ray points. The use of straight line constraints also improved the results of multiple strip adjustments. ...|$|E

40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET) and {{sensible}} heat (H) flux {{play a critical}} role in climate change; micrometeorology; atmospheric investigations; and related studies. They are two of the driving variables in climate impact(s) and hydrologic balance dynamics. Therefore, their accurate estimate is important for more robust modeling of the aforementioned relationships. The Bowen ratio energy balance method of estimating ET and H diffusions depends on the assumption that the diffusivities of latent heat (KV) {{and sensible}} heat (KH) are always equal. This assumption is re-visited and analyzed for a subsurface drip-irrigated field in south central Nebraska. The inequality dynamics for subsurface drip-irrigated conditions have not been studied. Potential causes that lead KV to differ from KH and a <b>rectification</b> <b>procedure</b> for the errors introduced by the inequalities were investigated. Actual ET; H; and other surface energy flux parameters using an eddy covariance system and a Bowen Ratio Energy Balance System (located side by side) on an hourly basis were measured continuously for two consecutive years for a non-stressed and subsurface drip-irrigated maize canopy. Most of the differences between KV and KH appeared towards the higher values of KV and KH. Although it was observed that KV was predominantly higher than KH; there were considerable data points showing the opposite. In general; daily KV ranges from about 0. 1 m 2 ∙s− 1 to 1. 6 m 2 ∙s− 1; and KH ranges from about 0. 05 m 2 ∙s− 1 to 1. 1 m 2 ∙s− 1. The higher values for KV and KH appear around March and April; and around September and October. The lower values appear around mid to late December and around late June to early July. Hourly estimates of KV range between approximately 0 m 2 ∙s− 1 to 1. 8 m 2 ∙s− 1 and that of KH ranges approximately between 0 m 2 ∙s− 1 to 1. 7 m 2 ∙s− 1. The inequalities between KV and KH varied diurnally as well as seasonally. The inequalities were greater during the non-growing (dormant) seasons than those during the growing seasons. During the study period, KV was, in general, lesser than KH during morning hours and was greater during afternoon hours. The differences between KV and KH mainly occurred in the afternoon due to the greater values of sensible heat acting as a secondary source of energy to vaporize water. As a result; during the afternoon; the latent heat diffusion rate (KV) becomes greater than the sensible heat diffusion rate (KH). The adjustments (rectification) for the inequalities between eddy diffusivities is quite essential at least for sensible heat estimation, and can have important implications for application of the Bowen ratio method for estimation of diffusion fluxes of other gasses...|$|R

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of many {{tropical}} marine fish relies on the shelter and nutritional benefit gained from being a coral reef inhabitant. Prokaryotic organisms, that are pathogenic to corals, threaten reef ecology because they infect essential shelter-providing scleractinians that build the reef through calcium deposition. The reef would cease to exist without these organisms. The incidence of bacterial coral disease has escalated {{over the past three}} decades and several aetiologies have been elucidated but no, "ecologically friendly" methods of control are known. Therefore the use of wild virulent bacteriophage (viruses) for therapy of bacterial cnidarian infections is appealing. The aim of this project was to perform the preliminary research necessary, to explore the possibility of using bacteriophage therapy, to control coral disease. This novel research has found that the current techniques, used to screen marine bacterial population& for lysogeny, are flawed. The residual presence of a mutagen (mitomycin C, MC) throughout the screening regime is incongruous, and is accountable for the manufacture of artefacts. The presence of MC in putative 'phage suspensions, intended for challenging coral pathogens m vitro, introduces further variables, particularly when the pathogen is a lysogen.

40|$|A classificação de imagens de satélites subsidia na identificação e extração de informações possibilitando a produção de novos mapas contendo informações específicas, que auxiliam em pesquisas ambientais relacionadas às distintas linhas de pesquisas. Toda classificação executa uma generalização espacial, no entanto, a generalização temporal, aonde um classificador é treinado com amostras distantes no tempo é pouco conhecido e pode ser bastante útil na irrigação, análise de ciclos da cultura, análise do uso e ocupação do solo, dentre outros. Neste contexto, este trabalho teve o objetivo de testar o desempenho da generalização espaço-temporal de redes supervisionadas MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) para classificar o uso e ocupação do solo, especificamente as culturas agrícolas no município de Miguelópolis - SP. Foram utilizadas 20 cenas ETM+/ Landsat 7 e TM/Landsat- 5 do ano de 2001 e do ano de 2002, onde as imagens de 2001 foram retificadas com a cena base do ano de 2002. Foram separados dois grupos, um destas imagens retificadas e o outro destas imagens apenas com reflectância para ambos os testes serem feitos. Os processamentos de registro, retificação, geração do NDVI e imagens reflectância foram realizados no {{software}} de Sistemas de Informações Geográficas - SPRING e para estabelecer a arquitetura da rede e treinamento foi utilizado o software Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator - SNNS empregando o algoritmo de retropropagação do erro, esperando erro de saída de 0, 01. Primeiramente foi feita a classificação das cenas de 2001, com amostras coletadas na mesma cena; logo em seguida a classificação foi feita pela abordagem espectro-temporal, classificando as cenas de 2001 com uma rede treinada a partir de amostras de 2002 e depois a classificação foi feita através das cenas do ano de 2002 com uma rede treinada a partir de amostras do ano de 2001. Foram utilizados como parâmetros de entrada as bandas 3, 4 e 5 e o Índice de Vegetação da Diferença Normalizada - NDVI, procurando distinguir nas imagens oito classes: feijão de primeira safra, feijão de segunda safra, milho, sorgo, cana de ano e meio, cana colhida no ano, água e outros usos, que englobam edificações, áreas de florestas que são poucas no retângulo que envolve a área de estudo. As avaliações das classificações foram feitas por meio da estatística Kappa (K) e da estatística Z (Z) para analisar através destes valores a necessidade da retificação radiométrica na classificação espectro-temporal nas imagens retificadas e nas imagens reflectância, verificando se a calibração é o suficiente na uniformização radiométrica das cenas nas classificações. A retificação foi capaz de normalizar a resposta espectral dos alvos nas imagens, entretanto, os valores do (K) foram baixos em todas as classificações, principalmente na classificação espectro- temporal fato que pode estar relacionado à complexidade da área de estudo em identificar as culturas agrícolas que apresentam diferentes estádios fenológicos e grande variação nas épocas de cultivos. Através do NDVI, foi possível traçar em relação aos dias do ano de 2001, o ciclo produtivo das culturas, evidenciando a complexidade destes que influem na classificação no espaço e no tempo. Os testes (Z) mostraram uma queda significativa na exatidão da rede treinada com dados de 2001 para classificar as cenas do ano de 2002 e na treinada com dados de 2002 para classificar as cenas de 2001, mas a classificação com dados treinados e classificados em uma mesma data apresentou resultados aquém das classificações no tempo. A utilização de imagens refletância do ano de 2001 resultou em uma classificação que não diferiu estatisticamente das imagens retificadas, logo o procedimento de retificação neste trabalho não seria necessário, visto que ele requer tempo e é complexo. Na área de estudo, é possível verificar diante das classificações, a grande quantidade de pivôs para irrigação. A agricultura irrigada, geralmente substitui a mata ciliar, relacionada diretamente com a qualidade da água, gerando inúmeros problemas, portanto, análises neste tocante são necessárias, já que as classificações das imagens auxiliam na aquisição de informações para possíveis tomadas de decisões. The images {{classification of}} satellites subsidizes {{in the information}} identification and extraction making possible the production of new maps with specific information that assists in environmental researches related to distinct research lines. All classification executes a spatial generalization, however, the temporal generalization, where a classifier is trained with distant samples in time, is little known {{and it can be}} sufficiently useful in the irrigation, analysis of culture cycles, use analysis and land occupation, among others. In this context, this study aimed to test the performance of the spectral- temporal generalization of supervised networks MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) to classify the use and land occupation, especially the agricultural crops in Miguelópolis-SP. 10 scenes ETM +/Landsat 7 and TM/Landsat- 5 of 2001 and 2002 were used, where the images of 2001 were rectified to the base scene of 2002 corrected atmospherically. Two groups had been separated, one of these images rectified and another one only with reflectance with the objective that both tests were done. The register processes, rectification, NDVI generation and reflectance images were performed in SPRING - Geographical Information Systems software, and to establish the network architecture and training was used SNNSStuttgart Neural Network Simulator software, using a multilayer perceptron, that was trained with the algorithm of backpropagation error, expecting exit error of 0. 01. First the classification of the 2001 scenes was done, with s collected samples in the same scene; immediately afterwards the classification was done by the spectral-temporal approach, classifying the 2001 scenes with a trained network from the 2002 samples and then the classification was done through the 2002 scenes with a trained network from the 2001 samples. The bands 3, 4 and 5 and NDVI - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index had been used as entrance parameters, trying to distinguish in the images eight classes: beans of first crop, beans of second crop, corn, sorghum, sugarcane of year and a half, sugarcane harvested in the year, water and other uses, which include constructions, forests areas that are few in the rectangle that involves the study area. The evaluations of the classifications had been made by Kappa (K) statistic and Z statistic (Z) to analyze through these values the necessity of the radiometric rectification in the spectral-temporal classification in the rectified images and in the reflectance images, being verified if the calibration is sufficient in the scenes radiometric standardization in the classifications. The rectification was capable to normalize the spectral response of the targets in the images, however, (K) values had been low in all classifications, mainly in the spectral-temporal classification, fact that can be related to the complexity of the study area in identifying the agricultural crops that present different phenological stadiums and a great variation in cultivate periods. By NDVI, it was possible to trace according to the days of 2001, the productive cycle of the crops, evidencing the complexity of these that influences in the classification of the space and time. (Z) tests had shown a significant decrease in the accuracy of the trained network with data of 2001 to classify the scenes of 2002 and in the trained one with the data of 2002 to classify the scenes of 2001, but the classification with trained and classified data in a same date presented results over the time classifications. The use of reflectance images of 2001 resulted in a classification that did not differ statistically from the rectified images, so the <b>rectification</b> <b>procedure</b> in this work would not be necessary because it requires time and it is complex. In the study area, it is possible to verify ahead of the classifications, the great amount of pivots for irrigation, the irrigated agriculture generally substitutes the ciliar forest, directly related to the water quality, causing innumerable problems, therefore works for these analyses are necessary and the classification of the images helps in the information acquisition for possible taking of decisions...|$|R
