Views expressed are those of the authors. The American Psychiatric Association defines these guidelines of practice as applicable to psychiatrists functioning as medical directors and medical reviewers working for managed care organizations (MCOs). Psychiatric reviewers working in medical review, pre-certification, retrospective review, necessity of ancillary service utilization, and diagnostic test utilization are bound by sound clinical principles and judgment. * Psychiatrists who render judgments that deny patient care recommended by their treating psychiatrist or other mental health clinicians should do so only after obtaining a full and complete medical understanding of the facts and situation of the patient by reviewing appropriate <b>records,</b> <b>tests,</b> and procedures, and consulting with the patient’s treating physician. (1) Reviewers should not selectively entertain data to support their decisions while eliminating contradictory data from discussion and consideration. (2) Their decision should be based on sound medical principles embraced by the medical community and should not be arbitrary or capricious. If patients are seriously ill and there is a dispute concerning judgement that relates to the patient’s immediate safety and security, the attending physician’s judgment should prevail. (3) The managed care medical directors or reviewing physicians should understand that some court...|$|E
40|$|As {{introduced}} by Naroll {{in his book}} (1962) by that title, “data quality control ” refers to the systematic evaluation of reliability among written reports of human behavior and social phenomena. In Naroll’s words: Data quality control deals not with individual reports but instead with groups of reports compiled by various authors under various conditions. It depends upon the assumption that some records are made under conditions of higher apparent trustworthiness than others. (p. 2) For {{more than a century}} the only systematic method of evaluating the reliability of reports has been the method of internal and external criticism developed by classical historians. (pp. 1 - 2) To evaluate report reliability, I propose instead to apply the general spirit and philosophy of statistical production quality control, as widely used in industry. The general spirit of such quality control is to test regularly, by sampling methods, the hypothesis that something is seriously wrong with production methods. (p. 10) In data quality control the behavioral scientist working with written <b>records</b> <b>tests</b> Indications of unreliability to see if something is seriously wrong with the statements in the records. To be sure, there is an essential difference in the position of the comparativist and the industrial quality control engineer. (p. 11) [...] . Therefore I propose to use the term “control ” somewhat more broadly than it is used in industry. By “control of errors ” I shall mean not only their detection but also the methods taken to counteract their effect on the results of the study. (p. 12...|$|E

40|$|Information on {{accuracy}} of milk-sampling devices used on farms with automated milking systems (AMS) {{is essential for}} development of milk recording protocols. The hypotheses {{of this study were}} (1) devices used by AMS units are similarly accurate in estimating milk yield and in collecting representative milk samples compared with devices used by certified milk recording providers on farms with conventional milking systems (CMS) and (2) devices used on both AMS and CMS comply with accuracy criteria described by the New Zealand Standard and by the International Committee of Animal Recording (ICAR). Milk recording data from 5 AMS farms were collected during 13 milk <b>recording</b> <b>test</b> days between December 2011 and February 2013. Milk yield was estimated by ICAR-approved milk meters on AMS units. Milk samples were collected over a 48 -h period and submitted to an off-site certified laboratory for milk composition analysis. Data were also collected manually from 5 to 10 cows per AMS unit; a complete milking of a cow was weighed to serve as gold standard for milk yield, and 3 milk samples per cow milking were collected and analyzed in the laboratory to serve as gold standards for milk composition. A similar procedure was used during 6 milk recording occasions with devices used during conventional milk recording at a CMS research farm. Farm type, breed, season, and region did not appear to affect accuracy of devices used on AMS units. Milk meters used by AMS units complied with ICAR limits in 12. 5 and 25 % of the milk <b>recording</b> <b>test</b> days for test bucket weights between 2 and 10 kg and for test bucket weights > 10 kg, respectively. These percentages were 52 and 42 %, respectively, for devices used on CMS. Analyzing all samples as one milk <b>recording</b> <b>test</b> day, 1. 4 % fell outside the 20 % difference band for AMS compared with 1. 1 % of the milk samples for CMS. Devices used by AMS complied with ICAR in 73 % of the milk <b>recording</b> <b>test</b> days for fat percentage, compared with 42 % of the milk <b>recording</b> <b>test</b> days by devices used at the CMS farm. When analyzing all milk samples as one milk <b>recording</b> <b>test</b> day, 3. 5 % of the milk samples fell outside the 99 % ICAR limit for AMS compared with 17. 2 % of the milk samples for CMS. Applying the ICAR standards for fat percentage to crude protein percentage and SCC, devices used on AMS were accurate in estimating crude protein percentage but not in estimating SCC. Thus, devices on AMS units did not comply with national nor ICAR standards with regard to milk yield and fat percentage. However, devices used on AMS were similarly or more accurate compared with devices used during conventional milk recording. It is proposed that devices used on AMS units, when calibrated regularly and when set up according to the manufacturer’s instruction, have similar or improved accuracy compared with CMS devices. Because the New Zealand industry accepts data from devices currently used by certified providers for milk recording on CMS farms, results imply that the AMS devices should also be permitted to be used for milk recording...|$|R
