Publicly organised collection by volunteers and economical <b>railway</b> <b>transport</b> logistics started {{as early as}} 1865 {{under the leadership of}} the notable industrialist Hans Caspar Escher (Escher Wyss AG) when the first modern Swiss paper manufacturing plant was built in Biberist.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin arrived off Songjin, Korea on 15 March and {{concentrated}} her gunfire on enemy <b>railway</b> <b>transport.</b> Early that morning, she destroyed a communist troop train trapped outside a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, {{when one of}} four shells from a North Korean 152mm gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40mm mount; Although little material damage resulted, three men were injured. Wisconsin subsequently destroyed that battery with a full 16-inch (406mm) salvo before continuing her mission. After lending a hand to support once more the 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles, the battleship returned to Japan on 19 March.|$|E
5|$|In Stjørdal, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} route. The river of Stjørdalselva creates a barrier {{just north of}} Hell, which made it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river to Hegra. However, the major population center was located at Stjørdalshalsen, {{on the north shore}} of the river. Locally, there were many protests against the line bypassing such a large town, but the cost of the bridge made Parliament choose the southern alternative. This gave residents in the town a considerably longer route to the train, since they had to cross the river to get access to the railway. This decreased the railway's ability to compete with the steam ships and thus the overall profitability of the line. With the arrival of the <b>railway,</b> <b>transport</b> to Trondheim became much easier than to Stjørdalshalsen and Levanger, helping Trondheim grow as a regional center.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Railways' Southern Railway line {{runs through}} the state {{connecting}} {{most of the major}} towns and cities except those in the highland districts of Idukki and Wayanad. The railway network in the state is controlled by two out of six divisions of the Southern Railway; Thiruvananthapuram Railway division and Palakkad Railway Division. Thiruvananthapuram Central (TVC) is the largest railway station in the state. Kerala's major railway stations are Thiruvananthapuram Central (TVC), Ernakulam Junction (South) (ERS), Kozhikode (CLT), Shornur Junction (SRR), Kochuveli Railway Station (KCVL), Palakkad Junction (PGT), Kollam Junction (QLN), Kannur (CAN), Thrissur Railway Station (TCR), Ernakulam Town (North) (ERN), Alappuzha railway station (ALLP), Kottayam (KTYM), Kayamkulam Junction (KYJ), Chengannur (CNGR), and Tirur railway station (TIR). Major <b>railway</b> <b>transport</b> between Beypore–Tirur began on 12 March 1861, from Shoranur–Cochin Harbour section in 1902, from Kollam–Sengottai on 1 July 1904, Kollam–Thiruvananthapuram on 4 January 1918, from Nilambur-Shoranur in 1927, from Ernakulam–Kottayam in 1956, from Kottayam–Kollam in 1958, from Thiruvananthapuram–Kanyakumari in 1979 and from the Thrissur-Guruvayur Section in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Included {{were nine}} Australians—three {{officers}} and six sergeants—who {{had been selected}} by AIF Headquarters in April 1918. All were experienced soldiers, with three having served at Gallipoli {{as well as in}} France. Sailing on the SS City of Marseilles on 17 June 1918 the Australians arrived in Murmansk and most were immediately sent out on patrol. Later they were switched to the Archangel section. The men were then broken into small advisory groups and attached to White Russian and White Finnish units, being engaged in a range of administrative, instructional and advisory tasks. Due to their isolation, it is difficult to make generalisations about the nature of service experienced by the Australians at this time. Captain P.F. Lohan served in a variety of administrative positions both in Murmansk and Archangel, whilst Sergeant R.L. Graham was commissioned in the field and became <b>railway</b> <b>transport</b> officer on the Archangel-Vologda railway. Several other sergeants were involved in the various training roles, while Captain Allan Brown was attached to the North Russian Rifles based at Onega—a White Russian battalion.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the company}} managed {{to cover it}} costs, and the company stated that it hoped to have a revenue of NOK 30 million the {{following}} year, through an ambitious expansion plan. A private offering for NOK 8 million was issued to allow this expansion. Among the purchasers was the Municipality of Narvik and Narvik Port Authority. In March, Chair Rune Arnøy was forced to withdraw after accusations of conflict of interest, since he was both chair of Ofotbanen and harbormaster at the Port of Narvik. CargoNet, a freight competitor of Ofotbanen, had {{felt that they were}} being unfairly treated by the port after the municipality had bought shares in Ofotbanen and appointed Arnøy as chair. The legality of the port's purchase of the shares was considered by the Norwegian Coastal Administration; though deemed legal, the port authority was required to sell the shares within three years. In April, Ofotbanen received a permit to operate in Sweden, and started offering charter trains between Narvik and Kiruna in Sweden, primarily for cruise ship passengers. It also announced {{that it was going to}} bid for the public service obligations for subsidized passenger <b>railway</b> <b>transport</b> that the government was planning to conduct in 2006. In June, Ofotbanen received permission to operate freight trains throughout the entire railway network in Norway. This was the first time such permission was granted to a different company than NSB or its subsidiaries.|$|E

The railway served several lumber and pulp mills in the province. Between 1983 and 2003, the railway hauled coal in unit trains from the Teck and Quintette mines near Tumbler Ridge to Prince George, from where CN would haul the trains to Prince Rupert for shipment to Japan.

25|$|The tunnel {{was opened}} on 13 March 1988, having cost {{a total of}} ¥538.4billion (US$3.6 billion) to construct. Once the tunnel was completed, all <b>railway</b> <b>transport</b> between Honshu and Hokkaido used it. However, for {{passenger}} transport, 90% of people use air due to the speed and cost. For example, to travel between Tokyo and Sapporo by train takes more than nine hours, with several transfers. By air, the journey is three hours and thirty minutes, including airport access times. Deregulation and competition in Japanese domestic air travel has brought down prices on the Tokyo-Sapporo route, making rail more expensive in comparison.|$|E

25|$|In 1754, the Dorfold Estate {{was sold}} to Nantwich lawyer James Tomkinson, {{originally}} from Bostock.
