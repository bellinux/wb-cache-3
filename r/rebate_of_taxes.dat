The plan's supporters argue that it would decrease tax burdens, broaden the tax base, be progressive, increase purchasing power, and tax wealth, while opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently regressive and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals.|$|R

50|$|The news {{section is}} {{primarily}} {{made up of}} corporate, financial and economic stories, {{as well as political}} and regulatory stories relevant to its readership. The paper regularly runs interviews of business leaders. The news pages also contain a variety of corporate and economic comment. The business features section is primarily dominated by investment, trading and wealth management pieces but also includes a range of articles on other business topics. The lifestyle pages cover a vast range of subject matters, including travel, restaurant reviews, food, fashion, technology, books, arts, entertainment, motoring and property. The sport section reports and comments on all the major events and games, with a bias towards sports of interest to London-based professionals.The paper's philosophy is broadly supportive of the free-market economy, of capitalism, of private enterprise and of the City of London and those who work in it. It endorsed the Conservative Party at the 2010 general election but was critical of several of the coalition's policies subsequently. Former editor Allister Heath argued that London and the south-east should be entitled to a greater <b>rebate</b> <b>of</b> UK <b>tax</b> revenue and has approved of the principle of London's becoming an independent city state. He also proposed a libertarian tax policy abolishing all personal and corporation taxes and introducing a single income <b>tax</b> rate <b>of</b> 30% on personal earnings, dividends, rent and interest. Heath's stance reflected the paper's classic liberal / libertarian philosophy, with a focus on capitalism and market forces as the drivers of economic and social progress.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{taxation}} {{on the general}} price level have traditionally been regarded as reflecting monetary policy, rather than fiscal factors. This view abstracted from the possible endogeneity of monetary expansion with respect to tax hikes, and from the effects which taxation may have on the reserve price of entrepreneurial labor. An analysis of Purchasing Power Parity data for 51 countries from stage IV of the ICP project supports the hypothesis that domestic indirect taxes tend to raise the general price level. In contrast to the accepted view, other prices {{do not seem to}} decline to offset the effect <b>of</b> such <b>taxes</b> on the price of tradables.

The patterns of responses across different donors that emerge from the survey cannot be readily explained by the presence of administrative costs or differential warm-glow effects, nor from the match being a more "shrouded" attribute in comparison with the rebate. Rather, we argue that these patterns are consistent with the predictions of a model of rational inattention, whereby a majority of individuals deliberately choose to process changes in the rebate while forgoing to process changes in the match. rational inattention; salience; subsidies for giving; tax incentives...|$|R
