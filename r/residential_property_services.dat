40|$|In Hong Kong, the {{responsibility}} for building management falls on property owners. To assist in building management, most property owners would appoint a property management company. Fulfilling relevant statutory requirements is mandatory for property management companies; however, it is debatable if meeting the basic statutory requirements is equivalent to providing quality <b>property</b> management <b>services</b> for <b>property</b> owners. In fact, property owners usually have more requests than minimum statutory requirements and it is therefore a multi-factor evaluation system for quality of <b>residential</b> <b>property</b> management <b>services</b> is proposed in this research project. To develop the assessment system, quality <b>property</b> management <b>services</b> criteria, including dimensions and performance items, are identified through desk research and focus group interviews with owners’ representatives and property management practitioners. Interval score and ranking are then assigned to the identified assessment criteria by distributing questionnaires with pilot test to owners’ representatives, property management practitioners and building management team of Home Affairs Department of HKSAR. Data collected from the questionnaire are analyzed with weight assessment method: Reliability Interval Method (RIM) in which importance weightings of the criteria can be developed and statistical analysis is allowed. “Repair and Maintenance (excluding clubhouse facilities, if applicable) ” and “Effectiveness of emergency repair and maintenance services”, which are not statutory requirements for managing <b>residential</b> <b>properties,</b> are respectively weighted {{as the most important}} dimension and performance item. As far as application of the developed quality assessment system is concerned, services quality provided by major property management companies are measured and compared with questionnaires to students pursuing Housing Management in University of Hong Kong. The correlation between quality of <b>property</b> management <b>services</b> and numbers of properties managed by the company is not statistically significant; however, this is likely due to a small samples size, as the visual display of data suggests a relationship. One interesting finding in this research is the high factor weight of assessment criteria which are not statutory requirements for managing <b>residential</b> <b>properties.</b> Such a result implies that meeting basic statutory requirements is not equivalent to providing quality <b>property</b> management <b>services</b> in the eyes of property owners. Besides, this research provides a framework for future development of a classification system to indicate how good a property is for meeting specific overall grading. This research is important because quality of <b>property</b> management <b>services</b> in <b>residential</b> <b>properties</b> can be quantified and closely monitored with the developed quality assessment system in a performance-based, simple and standard way from the perspective of property owners. As far as the benefits of property management companies, which sell services in keen market, are concerned, it is expected that the system could keep supervising and thus improving the quality of services; delivery of high quality services is a profitable way to differentiate ones from the competitors. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R

In addition a further analysis is carried out to identify the risk reduction benefits of adding properties to an investment portfolio through diversification. The results show {{that in terms of}} <b>residential</b> <b>property</b> type, detached houses provide higher capital appreciation compared to other forms of housing. But the higher returns are associated with higher risks. The best states to invest in <b>residential</b> <b>properties</b> are Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor. In terms of regions, investment performance is highest in Johor Bahru followed by Penang Island and Klang Valley. On an inter-asset comparison basis, the best risk-adjusted performance comes from detached and semi-detached houses in Kuala Lumpur which have outperformed shares represented by the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index. For individual investors, the better direct <b>residential</b> <b>property</b> performance over shares clearly identifies the <b>residential</b> <b>property</b> sector as a comparatively attractive investment option.

40|$|This thesis has the {{intention}} to investigate the risk situation for small investors in the domestic <b>residential</b> <b>property</b> market in Sweden, and discuss some alternatives for reducing that risk. Focus will be on risk reduction by diversification. <b>Residential</b> <b>property</b> {{is considered to be}} a rather safe investment for the long term investor. The return is determined by the change of value for the property (capital growth), and the direct return through net rental income. When investments in <b>residential</b> <b>property</b> are compared with other types of investments, they have high returns compared to their stan-dard deviation. Diversification gains are described in the frame of the Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM). The CAPM shows that portfolios based on <b>residential</b> <b>property</b> can reduce their risk and maintain the same level of returns through diversification. To get the best effect out of this diversification this should be done with assets that are least correlated with <b>residential</b> <b>property.</b> This thesis has tested with other <b>residential</b> <b>property,</b> other real estate and equities/bonds. Of which equities/bonds gave the best results. An optimal portfolio based on historical data from 1984 – 2003 suggests a portfolio with 40 - 60 % <b>residential</b> <b>property,</b> 30 – 60 % bonds and 0 – 10 % equities.
