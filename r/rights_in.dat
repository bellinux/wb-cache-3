Was it <b>right</b> <b>in</b> driving this country to the verge of revolution in its effort to defeat the passage of reform? Was it <b>right</b> <b>in</b> resisting the Ballot Bill?

Was it <b>right</b> <b>in</b> endeavouring to prevent the abolition of purchase in the Army? Was it <b>right</b> <b>in</b> 1880, when it rejected the Compensation for Disturbance Bill? I defy the Party opposite to produce a single instance of a settled controversy in which the House of Lords was right.|$|R
