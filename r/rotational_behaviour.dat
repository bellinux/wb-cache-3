In the present study, we determined the clearance of Mn from rat substantia nigra after its nigral injection and correlated it with the establishment of apomorphine-induced <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> and loss of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity. Our results suggest that Mn is slowly cleared from the substantia nigra, following a first-order kinetics with a t(1 / 2) of 3 days. Appearance of apomorphine-induced <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> and loss of TH immunoreactivity within the striatum follows metal clearance were both detected 24 hours after intra-nigral Mn microinjection and maximal 72 hours after injection. The present data suggest that the cellular mechanisms induced by Mn and leading to dopaminergic cell death, occurred shortly after its injection and that the metal concentration needs to reach a threshold value to induce neurotoxic effects. This would indicate that nigral damages are a direct consequence of Mn accumulation. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} motion generation of differential-drive mobile robots. The parameters of the dynamic model allow adjusting the robot translational and <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviours</b> separately. The model {{takes into account the}} robot kinematic and dynamic constraints, making the velocities and accelerations bounded and compatible with those the robot can perform. The main contribution of the paper is to use the model itself as a motion controller: under soft hypothesis on the velocities and accelerations, this approach allows an easy tuning of the controller parameters. A system stability and parameters sensitivity analysis is developed, in order to get guidelines for controller tuning. The clear physical sense of the parameters make this tuning easy and intuitive. Experimental results involving a real mobile robot show the performance of this approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{utility of}} amphetamine and amphetamine analogues has been jeopardized {{by a number}} of side effects and toxicity, partly due to complex mechanisms of action. While some of the analogues have been individually characterised, there is still need for comparative studies, in particular, on their efficacy to release dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine, further enlightening some of the synaptic mechanisms conveying their actions. Thus, we have compared four alkoxyamphetamine derivatives, i. e., p-methoxyamphetamine; p-methoxymethamphetamine; methylenedioxyamphetamine, methylene-dioxymethamphetamine, using methamphetamine, and D-amphetamine, as reference substances, on <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> and releasing mechanisms studied with in vivo microdialysis in rats. All alkoxylated-derivatives produced a long-lasting <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> at 10 mg/kg s. c., but the reference substances produced a strong rotation already at 2 mg/kg s. c. in 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats. At the concentration of 100 mu M, the alkoxylated-derivatives were equipotent to evoke dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine release in rat neostriatum, while D-amphetamine and methamphetamine were more efficient on dopamine release. Pre-treatment with methamphetamine or the alkoxylated-derivatives produced a remarkable decrease of the effect of K+-depolarisation on both dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine release. The insertion of a methoxy or a methylenedioxy group on the benzene ring of D-amphetamine or methamphetamine, or N-methylation of the D-amphetamine molecule alters the selectivity of the compounds. The efficacy of the alkoxylated-derivatives on dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptamine release was similar, but stimulated less dopamine release and produced less <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> than D-amphetamine and methamphetamine. The lower efficacy of K+-depolarisation following pre-treatments with the derivatives suggests an impairment of releasable monoamine stores.

Specialist and dedicated equipment is often needed, unless the rotational degree-of-freedom is synthesised based upon translational data.

A key challenge with this approach is choosing the measurement spacing between the data points, an issue which has often been overlooked in the published literature. The present contribution will {{for the first time}} prove that the use of a finite difference approach can be unstable when using non-exact measured data and a small measurement spacing, for beam-like structures. Then, a generalised analytical error analysis is used to propose an optimised measurement spacing, which balances the numerical error of the finite difference equation with the propagation error from the perturbed data. The approach is demonstrated using both numerical and experimental investigations.

40|$|Spider aciniform (wrapping) silk is a {{remarkable}} fibrillar biomaterial with outstanding mechanical properties. It is a modular protein consisting, in Argiope trifasciata, of a core repetitive domain of 200 amino acid units (W units). In solution, the W units comprise a globular folded core, with five α-helices, and disordered tails that are linked to form a ~ 63 -residue intrinsically disordered linker in concatemers. Herein, we present nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based 15 N spin relaxation analysis, allowing characterization of backbone dynamics {{as a function of}} residue on the ps–ns timescale {{in the context of the}} single W unit (W 1) and the two unit concatemer (W 2). Unambiguous mapping of backbone dynamics throughout W 2 was made possible by segmental NMR active isotope-enrichment through split intein-mediated trans-splicing. Spectral density mapping for W 1 and W 2 reveals a striking disparity in dynamics between the folded core and the disordered linker and tail regions. These data are also consistent with <b>rotational</b> diffusion <b>behaviour</b> where each globular domain tumbles almost independently of its neighbour.

In order to define the role of dopamine receptors in the mediation of this behaviour, we have evaluated the influence of previous exposure to a dopamine receptor agonist and the importance of the time elapsed from the 6 -hydroxydopamine lesion on the <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> induced by caffeine. Separate groups of rats lesioned with 6 -hydroxydopamine 2 weeks previously were exposed to four administrations of the D 1 /D 2 receptor agonist apomorphine (0. 3 mg/kg s. c.) (primed) or vehicle (drug-naive). Three days later, all rats received caffeine (30 mg/kg s. c.). Drug-naive 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats did not rotate in response to caffeine, while rats primed with apomorphine rotate contralaterally in response to caffeine. When apomorphine priming was paired to the same environment (hemispherical bowls) where rats received caffeine, <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> was significantly higher than that obtained in rats primed in an unpaired environment (cylinders). Repeated priming with the D 2 /D 3 receptor agonist quinpirole (0. 2 mg/kg s. c.) induced a totally context-dependent contralateral rotation in response to caffeine, while caffeine contralateral rotation was not dependent from the context after repeated priming with the D 1 agonist SKF 38393 [1 -phenyl- 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrahydro-(1 H) - 3 -benzazepine- 7, 8 -diol hydrochloride, 3 mg/kg s. c. ]. Caffeine-mediated contralateral rotation was also evaluated in rats lesioned with 6 -hydroxydopamine 12 weeks previously and exposed to four administrations of apomorphine or vehicle. As for rats repeatedly exposed to vehicle or apomorphine 2 weeks after 6 -hydroxydopamine lesioning, caffeine failed to induce contralateral rotation in drug-naive rats, while it did induce a partially context-dependent contralateral rotation in apomorphine-primed rats. Different from rats receiving apomorphine priming 2 weeks after 6 -hydroxydopamine lesioning, in 12 week-lesioned rats, caffeine also induced contralateral rotation after one priming with apomorphine (0. 3 mg/kg s. c.), a condition which fails to induce context-dependent rotation. Administration of selective antagonists of A 1 (8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine), (DPCPX) or A 2 A (5 -amino- 2 -(2 -furyl) - 7 -(3 -phenylpropyl) -pyrazolo[4, 3 -e]- 1, 2, 4 -triazolo[5 c]pirimidine), (SCH 58261) adenosine receptors failed to induce contralateral rotation either alone or in combination in 12 week- 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats repeatedly primed with apomorphine. All together, the results indicate that: (i) caffeine does not induce any contralateral rotation in drug-naive 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats; (ii) priming with a dopamine agonist enables caffeine to induce contralateral rotation, this rotation is, however, context independent only after priming with a selective D 1 agonist; (iii) contralateral rotation in response to caffeine is dependent on the time from the 6 -hydroxydopamine lesion; (iv) blockade of A 1 and A 2 A adenosine receptors with selective antagonists does not induce contralateral <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> in 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats...|$|E

The 2 mm cold-formed bracket and 6 mm hot-rolled angle are used to connect the members. The results were collected from different beam depth ranged 150 mm, 200 mm and 250 mm. The rotational stiffness and strength obtained from the numerical modelling are then compared to the design requirements from BS EN 1993 - 1 - 8 and experimental data.

This proposition is intrinsic for the magnetic {{as well as}} the electric circuit and depicts that significant enhancements of electrical machines are difficult to achieve {{in the absence of a}} detailed understanding of underlying effects. In order to improve the properties of electrical machines the accurate determination of the locally distributed iron losses based on idealized model assumptions solely is not sufficient.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} properties to derive for stars is their age. For cool main-sequence stars, gyrochronology relations can be used to infer stellar ages from measured rotation pe- riods and HR Diagram positions. These relations have few calibrators with known ages for old, long rotation period stars. There is a significant sample of old Kepler objects of inter- est, or KOIs, which have both measurable surface rotation periods and precise asteroseismic measurements from which ages can be accurately derived. In this work we determine the age and the rotation period of solar-like pulsating KOIs to both compare the rotation properties of stars with and without known planets and enlarge the gyrochronology calibration sample for old stars. We use Kepler photometric light curves to derive the stellar surface rotation peri- ods while ages are obtained with asteroseismology using the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal in which individual mode frequencies are combined with high-resolution spectroscopic pa- rameters. We thus determine surface rotation periods and ages for 11 planet-hosting stars, all over 2 Gyr old.

We investigate the rotational evolution of young VLM stars and BDs using Monte Carlo simulations under {{the hypothesis of}} disk locking and stellar angular momentum conservation. Methods. We built a set of objects with masses ranging from 0. 01 Mo to 0. 4 Mo and considered models with single- and double- peaked initial period distributions with and without disk locking. An object {{is considered to be}} diskless when its mass accretion rate is below a given threshold. Results. Models with initial single-peaked period distributions reproduce the observations well given that BDs rotate faster than VLM stars. We observe a correlation between rotational period and mass when we relax the disk locking hypothesis, but with a shallower slope compared to some observational results. The angular momentum evolution of diskless stars is flatter than it is for stars with a disk which occurs because the moment of inertia of objects less massive than 0. 2 Mo remains pratically constant for a time scale that increases with decreasing stellar mass. Conclusions. Comparing our results with the available observational data we see that disk locking is not as important in the low-mass regime and that the <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> of VLM stars and BDs is different from what is seen in their solar mass counterparts.

40|$|Steel beam-to-column {{connections}} are vulnerable structural elements when a fire strikes a building, as observed in fire incidents and full-scale fire tests. Existing techniques allow researchers {{to model the}} behaviour {{of different types of}} connections in fire but are difficult to use when conducting simulations on full-scale frames with multiple connections due to time and computation requirements. Therefore a need for a simplified connection modelling approach that can significantly reduce the computational time required without compromising on the accuracy of the simulation results so that large-scale simulations of structures with multiple connections in fire can be performed. A simplified spring connection modelling approach for steel flush endplate beam-to-column connections in fire has been developed in this research project so that the realistic behaviour of connections can be incorporated into full-scale frame analyses at elevated temperature. The proposed modelling approach divides the connection into two or three (depending on the connection size) T-stubs and employs ABAQUS as a pre-processor to generate the force-displacement characteristics for each T-stub by detailed finite element modelling. These characteristics are then input into specialised software (VULCAN) to simulate the behaviour of structure in fire including realistic representation of the steel beam-to-column connections. As a result of its simplicity and reliability, the proposed approach permits full-scale frame analysis in fire to be conducted efficiently. The proposed simplified spring connection modelling approach has been used to investigate the influence of connection ductility (both axial and <b>rotational)</b> on frame <b>behaviour</b> in fire. 2 D steel and 3 D composite frames across a range of spans were modelled to aid the understanding of the differences in frame response in fire when the beam-to-column connections have different axial and rotational ductility assumptions. The research study highlights that adopting the conventional rigid or pinned connection assumptions does not permit the axial forces acting on the connections to be predicted accurately, since the axial ductility of the connection is completely neglected when the rotational ductility is either fully restrained or free. By including realistic axial and rotational ductility of the beam-to-column connections, the frame response in fire can be predicted more accurately, which is advantageous in performance-based structural fire engineering design...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Artificial surfaces are increasingly more common {{in a number of}} sports including football, rugby and hockey. Each specific sport has mechanical properties designed to suit the requirements of the sport which can be achieved through appropriate selection of surface specification, as well as the appropriate selection of footwear. In player-surface interactions, traction is a key system property that needs to be measured for comfort, performance and any potential injury risk. Many of the current industry tests used to measure traction are simplistic and have limitations when used in tests. The aim of the thesis was to make a contribution to knowledge with regard to the mobilisation of traction and apply this to the understanding of shoe-surface interactions. This was achieved by completing a number of objectives. These included reviewing current knowledge of player-surface interaction behaviour in relation to traction and obtaining relevant human boundary conditions for biofidelic mechanical test development. The mechanisms of traction were then investigated and the variables in the mobilisation of traction identified. The traction forces developed were quantified with appropriate measurement systems. Mechanical test equipment was then developed along with protocols to replicate the translational and <b>rotational</b> lower limb <b>behaviour</b> during sport specific behaviour. This included the standard FIFA rotational device being modified to include two sensors which record continuous data throughout a trial to allow for more than a peak torque value to be analysed. In addition, a piece of equipment to measure translational traction was developed and constructed to support the rotational traction device and help to understand the mobilisation of traction. The device pulled a tray containing a surface sample, with a shoe/plate placed on the sample. The horizontal force was measured, as well as the amount of stud penetration into the surface. It was also necessary to characterise the state of the surface and the effects that any changes may have on the traction that is mobilised. Testing completed involved repeated testing on both the rotational and translational to allow for comparison. Changes in the surface properties were made such as the number of fibres in a set area and the rubber infill density as well as shoe properties such as stud spacing, stud type and number of studs. In the results, the initial stiffness response of the surface was often focussed on as it was stated that this may be a better indicator of the mechanisms involved in the traction mobilised by subjects, compared to peak torque. This is due to actual foot rotation measured in subject testing being observed to be much smaller than the rotation/distance required to produce the peak force. The larger angles/displacements were also considered to help inform the mechanisms of traction. The final objective was to refine the mechanisms based on the experimental design. This all adds to the contribution of knowledge regarding the mobilisation of traction. A key outcome from the thesis is the effect the surface and shoe properties have on traction, therefore it is essential to state the specification when reporting results otherwise comparisons are not able to be made. The mechanism of traction has not previously been fully understood, with this thesis beginning to understand the details of how the change in surface or shoe properties affect how the surface reacts during shoe-surface interactions...|$|R

A series of resonance tongues are distributed along the non-dimensionalied frequency axis in the parameter space plots. Different kinds of rotations, together with oscillations and chaos, are found to be located in regions within the resonance tongue...|$|E
40|$|The European {{approach}} for predicting the joint behaviour {{is based on}} the so-called compo-nent method, which starts from the identification of a number of components used to assem-bly a mechanical model able to predict the joint <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In this work, the atten-tion is focused on the behaviour of the T-stub proposing a new mechanical model including all the physical effects involved in the deformation mechanism: the change of position of the point of contra-flexure during the loading process, the compatibility between flange and bolt and the cracking of the materials constituting the flange plate and the bolt. At the end of the work a comparison versus twelve experimental tests is proposed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a detailed {{investigation of the}} <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> of young pre-main sequence (PMS) stars {{in order to achieve}} a better understanding of their angular momentum evolution during this evolutionary stage. For that purpose I have carried out an extensive photometric monitoring program which enabled me to identify a total of 405 periodic and 184 irregular variable PMS stars in the young open cluster NGC 2264 (age: 2 - 4 Myr). Hence, I could increase the number of known PMS stars in NGC 2264 by more than a factor of three and the number of published periods by more than a factor of ten. Apart from the Orion Nebular Cluster (ONC, age: 1 Myr), with about 370 known rotation periods, NGC 2264 is therefore the only cluster for which a statistically significant number of rotation periods of PMS stars is known. For the first time it was possible to compare the <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> of stars of two young clusters with each other. I have shown that the period distribution of stars in NGC 2264 strongly depends on mass and quantitatively agrees with that of the ONC. However, the stars in NGC 2264 rotate with shorter rotation periods on average. A quantitative analysis which took into account the age ratio and the different stellar radii showed that a large fraction of stars spin up with conserved angular momentum while increasing in age. However, I also found that some stars clearly rotate with longer rotation periods even though they are aging. Apparently, these stars lose angular momentum, which is interpreted as a result of magnetic coupling to their circumstellar disk ("disk-locking"). The resulting locking period is about 8 days. My analysis further showed that "disk-locking" in NGC 2264 or the ONC is important only for higher mass stars (M >= 0. 3). There is evidence that also the lower mass stars (M <= 0. 3) interact magnetically with their disks, but this interaction is in most cases not strong enough to remove angular momentum with sufficiently high rates to lock the star with a constant rotation period. These findings are closely connected with a surprising result. The typical brightness variations of the stars in NGC 2264 (caused by star spots) differ for the two mass regimes considered here. While the peak-to-peak variation of the higher mass stars is typically up to 0. 2 mag, the lower mass stars show brightness modulations only up to 0. 06 mag. I argue that this is evidence for a different magnetic field structure, caused by different dynamo processes, and could be the decisive factor for the different <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the lower mass stars...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: We {{have shown}} that ginsenoside Rg 1 is a novel class of potent {{phytoestrogen}} and activates insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) signalling pathway in human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells. The present study tested {{the hypothesis that the}} neuroprotective actions of Rg 1 involved activation of the IGF-IR signalling pathway in a rat model of Parkinson's disease, induced by 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA). Experimental approach: Ovariectomized rats were infused unilaterally with 6 -OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle to lesion the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and treated with Rg 1 (1. 5 h after 6 -OHDA injections) in the absence or presence of the IGF-IR antagonist JB- 1 (1 h before Rg 1 injections). The <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> induced by apomorphine and the dopamine content in the striatum were studied. Protein and gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter and Bcl- 2 in the substantia nigra were also determined. Key results: Rg 1 treatment ameliorated the <b>rotational</b> <b>behaviour</b> induced by apomorphine in our model of nigrostriatal injury. This effect was partly blocked by JB- 1. 6 -OHDA significantly decreased the dopamine content of the striatum and treatment with Rg 1 reversed this decrease. Treatment with Rg 1 of 6 -OHDA-lesioned rats reduced neurotoxicity, as measured by tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter and Bcl- 2 protein and gene level in the substantia nigra. These effects were abolished by JB- 1. Conclusions and implications: These data provide the first evidence that Rg 1 has neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons in the 6 -OHDA model of nigrostriatal injury and its actions might involve activation of the IGF-IR signalling pathway.
