50|$|The rear {{two-thirds of}} the tender's length was {{taken up by the}} water tanks and eight large {{radiators}} on each side, cooled by five exhaust steam-driven <b>roof-mounted</b> <b>fans</b> which drew air from outside through the radiators. The 5000 imp gal water capacity consisted of two tanks, a 4400 imp gal fresh water tank in the centre of the tender between the radiators and a 600 imp gal condensate tank under the tender belly between the bogies. Feedwater for the engine's boiler was taken directly from the condensate tank's hot contents rather than from the main tank's cold contents.|$|R
50|$|The tender was {{designed}} for a Deutsche Reichsbahn Class 52 condensing locomotive. It was modified slightly and was equipped {{with a pair of}} Buckeye three-axle bogies instead of the German arrangement of one six-wheeled and one four-wheeled bogie. It had an 11 lt t coal capacity, a 3900 imp gal water capacity which included the underbelly condensate tank, and a 13 lt 17 lcwt 3 qtr kg maximum axle load. The tender was capable of condensing 27000 lb of exhaust steam per hour in maximum operating temperatures of between 100 and 110 F. The tender had six large radiators on each side, cooled by three exhaust steam-driven <b>roof-mounted</b> <b>fans</b> which drew air from outside through the radiators.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{one third}} of the total length of the Type CZ {{condensing}} tender was taken up by the coal bunker, which included the oil separator equipment to remove oil from spent steam and the mechanical stoker equipment which had a maximum delivery rate of 12000 lb of coal per hour. The rear two-thirds was taken up by eight large radiators on each side, cooled by five steam-driven <b>roof-mounted</b> <b>fans.</b> The 5000 imp gal water capacity consisted of two tanks, a 4400 imp gal fresh water tank in the centre of the tender between the radiators and a 600 imp gal condensate tank under the tender belly between the bogies. Feedwater was taken directly from the condensate tank's hot contents rather than from the main tank's cold contents.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the detailed airflow pattern and pollution {{level for the}} westbound Melbourne City Link tunnel under severely congested traffic conditions. The time averaged equations for velocity, pressure, temperature and mass fraction of emissions were solved using the CFD software FLUENT 6. 0. Under severely traffic jam conditions, the mass fractions of O 2, CO 2 and CO {{were found to be}} in the ranges of 0. 1 - 0. 16, 0. 05 - 0. 14 and 0. 0005 - 0. 002, respectively. These high levels of pollutants were detected despite the fact that <b>roof-mounted</b> <b>fans</b> pushed exhaust fumes out the exit and sucked fresh air in from the inlet of the tunnel. The emissions from the vehicles posed a threat to human health...|$|R
50|$|The Type CZ {{condensing}} tenders {{were slightly}} longer than their engines. One-third {{of the total}} length of the tender was {{taken up by the}} water tank and coal bunker, while the rest was taken up by eight large radiators on each side, cooled by five steam-driven <b>roof-mounted</b> <b>fans.</b> Roller bearings were used throughout on all these locomotives, including the coupling and connecting rods, the crosshead gudgeon pins as well as the three-axle bogies of both the standard and condensing tenders. The leading bogies and coupled wheels had Cannon-type axle boxes. The cylinders and frames were cast in one piece, while the steel cylinders and steam chests were fitted with cast iron liners. The tender frames of both locomotive types were also one-piece steel water-bottom castings. Since they were entirely mounted on roller bearings, very little effort was required to move these big locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, {{which still}} travels America by rail, uses special stock cars to haul its animals. When a Ringling Brothers train is made up, these cars are placed {{directly}} behind the train's locomotives, to give the animals a smoother ride. The cars that Ringling Brothers use to haul elephants are custom-built with extra amenities for the animals, including fresh water and food supply storage, heaters, <b>roof-mounted</b> <b>fans</b> and water misting systems for climate control, treated, non-slip flooring for safety and easy cleaning, floor drains that operate whether the train is moving or not, backup generators for when the cars are uncoupled from the locomotives, and specially designed ramps for easy and safe loading and unloading. Some of the cars also have built-in accommodation for animal handlers so they can ride with and tend to the animals.|$|R
50|$|The Type CL tender was {{designed}} {{in such a}} way that it could also be used on a modified Class 19D or Class 24, but this was never done. The tender was capable of condensing 27000 lb of exhaust steam per hour in maximum operating temperatures of between 100 and 110 F. As on the later Class 25 condensing locomotives, the pipe to feed spent steam back to the condensing tender was mounted on the left side of the engine. It was run back from the smokebox above the running board to a box that contained a centrifuge and filters to remove cylinder lubricant from the exhaust steam, then below the running board and underneath the cab to the tender. The tender had six large radiators on each side, cooled by three exhaust steam-driven <b>roof-mounted</b> <b>fans</b> which drew air from outside through the radiators.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical exhaust {{ventilation}} from bathrooms (24hr) via <b>roof-mounted</b> exhaust <b>fans.</b> (3 No. fans serving A & B flats; C, D, E & F flats and G & H flats. Duty fans replaced 2007). Redundant standby fans were removed {{and the remaining}} duty fans serving A & B and G & H flats were relocated into fire rated plantrooms for improved maintenance service life in 2016 to reduce noise nuisance on the accessible rooftop. Kitchen ventilation is via the fa√ßade.|$|R
40|$|Computer {{simulations}} {{were carried}} out to study airflow patterns and pollution levels due to emissions from vehicles for the westbound Melbourne City Link tunnel under severely congested traffic jam conditions. The time averaged equations for velocity, pressure, temperature and mass fraction of emissions were solved using CFD software FLUENT 6. 0. The maximum mass fractions of O 2, CO 2 and CO {{were found to be}} 0. 16, 0. 14 and 0. 002, respectively. These high levels of pollutants were detected despite the fact that <b>roof-mounted</b> <b>fans</b> pushed exhaust fumes out the exit and sucked fresh air in from the inlet of the tunnel. During another condition of power failure, when the fans were not in operation, the flow inside the tunnel was mainly driven by buoyancy and the concentration levels of O 2, CO 2 and CO were then found to be 0. 05, 0. 18 and 0. 0028, respectively. Theses emissions from the vehicles for both cases posed a threat to human health. To avoid this dangerous situation a multi-pronged approach is needed that includes having alternative sources of power for the fans, ensuring faster evacuation of passengers and drivers, as well as switching-off engines during prolonged traffic standstill...|$|R
50|$|A typical <b>roof-mounted</b> solar attic <b>fan</b> will be {{effective}} in removing excessive heat from the attic. When mounted near the peak the solar fan forces hot air out while pulling fresh air in via eave/soffit vents. This exchange of air keeps the attic space from overheating.|$|R
2500|$|As the SD38, SD39, SD40, and SD45 {{shared a}} common frame, so too did the SD38-2, SD40-2, and SD45-2. It was [...] longer than the {{previous}} models, giving a length of [...] over the coupler pulling faces. The SD38-2 and SD40-2 shared the same basic superstructure, since they used the same 16-645 engine (in Roots-blown and turbocharged form respectively); the long hood was [...] longer than the SD38 and SD40, but since the increase in frame length was even greater, the SD38-2 and SD40-2 had even larger front and rear [...] "porches" [...] than the earlier models. These empty areas at front and rear are spotting features to identify the Dash 2 models of both units. The SD40-2 can be distinguished from the SD38-2 by its three <b>roof-mounted</b> radiator <b>fans</b> instead of two, and a single large exhaust stack instead of two smaller stacks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ventilation}} was {{the area}} in which the Mark V suffered its largest weakness. The previous Marks I-IV drew cooling air from inside the tank, through the radiator, and then expelled the air through a vent, which provided a constant supply of moving air for the crew. In contrast, the Mark V, drew air from outside the tank, across the radiator, and then expelled the air though a vent, which left the air inside the crew compartment stagnant. [...] The only ventilation for the crew compartment, other than the driver and gunner view-ports, located on all sides of the tank, was a <b>roof-mounted</b> Keith <b>fan.</b> [...] This fan was inadequate for maintaining a stable supply of clean air for the crew of a Mark V; exhaust and gun-smoke were trapped with the crew, which caused many crewmen to grow ill, and in the most extreme cases, was enough to render them unconscious, either way the crew was practically unfit for combat within a few hours.|$|R
