Key findings Agencies reported 39, 223 contracts (totalling $ 156. 5 billion) in their 2011 contract listings, 2391 of which were reported as containing confidentiality provisions. The Australian National Audit Office examined 132 of the 2391 contracts from the four audited agencies. 42 of the 132 contracts (32 per cent) did not contain specific confidentiality provisions and 39 contracts (29 per cent) were assessed as including specific confidentiality provisions that were not justified having regard to the Confidentiality Test. These 81 contracts were incorrectly listed in the Senate Order as containing confidentiality provisions.

40|$|Audit {{objectives}} and scope The objective of the audit {{was to assess the}} appropriateness of the use and reporting of confidentiality provisions in a sample of Australian Government contracts. The criteria were: 	entities published contract listings on their websites and Ministers’ letters were tabled in accordance with the content and timing requirements of the Order; 	confidentiality provisions were used appropriately in a sample of contracts which were reported to contain confidentiality provisions by the selected entities; and 	the selected entities accurately reported contract information, including the use of confidentiality provisions, in the contract listings and on AusTender. The selected entities for the audit were: Department of Finance (Finance); Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C); Department of Social Services (DSS); and Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA). The sample of contracts was taken from the selected entities’ Senate Order listings for the 2014 calendar year and AusTender. Two entities DSS and PM&C had significant machinery of government changes during 2014. Overall conclusion The Senate Order was introduced to improve public access to information about government contracting. The results of this audit indicate that while the reported use of confidentiality provisions is low, entities’ reporting practices are not always adequate or reliable enough to meet the requirements of the Order. Transparency of contract information can be affected as a result. The 2014 Senate Order listings contained 41   469 contracts for goods and services totalling $ 216. 3  billion, of which 1   855 contracts (4. 5  per cent) valued at $ 30. 1  billion (13. 9 %), were reported as containing confidentiality provisions. The reported use of confidentiality provisions by entities was in keeping with 2013 levels, and continues to reflect a significant decline from the 24  per cent of contracts reported in 2001, the year the Order was introduced. Entities are expected to support their Ministers to comply with the Senate Order though publishing contract listings in accordance with content and timing requirements. This audit found that entities did not always meet these requirements and Ministers could be better supported through entities publishing lists by the due date and verifying that contract details are accurately reported. In this respect in 2014, the ANAO observed: 	overall entity performance in meeting the content requirements of the Order had declined in comparison to 2013 —only 24  per cent of entities were fully compliant; 	for the four entities examined in detail by the ANAO, none of the contract listings fully complied with the Order’s publishing requirements. The main reason for non-compliance was the reporting of contracts outside the relevant contract period; and 	a small number of entity listings (15  per cent) were published late (within one month of the due date), and as at 30 June 2015 one entity, had not published a listing or a notice that no relevant contracts had been entered into. Despite the low proportion of contracts reported as containing confidentiality provisions, specific confidentiality provisions in contracts continue to be incorrectly used and reported in 2014. The ANAO’s examination of a sample of 101 contracts reported to contain confidentiality provisions, found that for 80  per cent of the contracts the use of confidentiality provisions did not comply with the Guidance or was misreported. The level of inappropriate use has increased by 17  per cent compared to the 2013 Senate Order compliance audit. Confidentiality provisions in government contracts can impede accountability and transparency in government purchasing. A request for specific information to be kept confidential must be assessed against the Confidentiality Test criteria and entities should make sure decisions to include confidentiality provisions are documented. In this respect, the audited entities were not able to provide documentation supporting their assessment of suppliers’ claims against the Confidentiality Test, and reasons for agreeing for the information to remain confidential. The results of this audit indicate that processes to capture information about basic contract details and the reporting of existence of confidentiality provisions needs to improve. Entities currently must report on procurement contracts {{for the purposes of the}} Senate Order and separately on AusTender to meet requirements of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. Of the 2   171 procurement contracts listed in the audited entities’ Senate Order listings, 1   936 (89  per cent) had a corresponding entry in AusTende In the ANAO’s sample only 17  per cent of contracts were found to be accurately reported, taking into account the basic contract information and the correct type and <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>confidentiality</b> provisions. The ANAO has previously observed shortcomings both in the application of the Confidentiality Test and in the accuracy of Senate Order and AusTender reporting. The results of this audit show that there continues to be scope for entities to improve their assessment of suppliers’ claims for confidentiality of contractual information and implement more rigorous quality assurance processes for reporting confidentiality provisions in contracts. The Department of Finance supports entities to comply with the Senate Order through providing whole-of-government procurement guidance and communicating the key requirements of the Order. Opportunities exist for Finance to improve advice through direct reference to the Confidentiality Test in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, and disseminating better practice examples of entity assurance mechanisms. The ANAO has made three recommendations to assist improving the use and reporting of confidentiality provisions...|$|E

The case study belongs to the last one category and regards a particular good produced by an important Italian food company, with several branches all over the world, operating in the field of snacks, biscuits and bread substitutes. Currently the data in the simulation model are assumed by the authors due to a delay on the provision, but the real company data should be available, properly modified <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> of <b>confidentiality,</b> <b>for</b> the extended version of the paper. In the following sections a simulation model, implemented using the System Dynamics methodology, will be described. System Dynamics approach is suitable for complex dynamic systems like the one object of this work; this methodology considers in fact time delays and feedback loops, which heavily affect the system structure and behavior. The model has been implemented using one of the most known System Dynamics commercial software: Powersim Studio™, because of its flexibility and completeness, allowing also integration with databases, external files and ERP systems. The aim of the simulation is to identify and focus on the criticalities along the supply chain in order to minimize the total costs and, consequently, maximizing the company profits. “What If” analysis have been carried out in order to show which is the best policy to adopt in terms – for instance – of safety stock or demand planning. Moreover, the concepts of vulnerability and resiliency applied to these kinds of supply chains have been analyzed. After a short classification of threats and risks for supply chains, the case in which an environmental risk (an earthquake) occurs, striking the raw material supplier, is modeled and simulated with the System Dynamics methodology. The obtained results show that with a more resilient supply chain, characterized by the procurement from two different suppliers (instead on only one) located in different geographical areas, business continuity is guaranteed even {{in the case of a}} natural catastrophe...|$|R
