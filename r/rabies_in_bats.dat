The Bayesian inference approach enables model averaging {{over a number}} of potential diffusion predictors and estimates the support and contribution of each predictor while marginalizing over phylogenetic history.

One study on <b>rabies</b> <b>in</b> <b>bats</b> showed geographical range overlap is a modest predictor for CST, but not for host shifts.

Since 1998 cases of <b>rabies</b> <b>in</b> <b>bats</b> have been recorded in the northwest region of São Paulo State, predominantly in urban areas. The objective of this study was to investigate the circulation of <b>rabies</b> <b>in</b> <b>bats</b> in the northwestern region of São Paulo by searching of the virus in different species and the presence of rabies neutralizing antibodies in vampire bats. A total of 1, 490 brain samples from bats were sent to the Laboratory of Rabies and 125 serum samples of vampire bats from four shelters in the region were examined from 2008 to 2012. The virus presence was determined by fluorescent antibodies test (FAT) and mouse inoculation test (MIT) while neutralizing antibodies were determined by the simplified microneutralization (SFIMT) in BHK 21 cells. Rabies virus was detected in 26 (1. 97 %) out of 1, 314 non-hematophagous bats and in none of the 176 vampire bats examined. Only 7 % (9 / 125) of vampire bats had antibody titers above 0. 5 UI/ml, 65 % (81 / 125) had low titers (0. 10 to 0. 5 UI/ml) and 28 % (35 / 125) were negative.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: This paper {{presents}} {{the first report}} of <b>rabies</b> <b>in</b> three <b>bat</b> species, Molossus molossus, Molossops neglectus and Myotis riparius {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: Bats were diagnosed as positive for rabies using the fluorescent antibody test and mouse inoculation test. The isolates were characterized antigenically using a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies. The samples were also genetically analyzed by partial sequencing of the portion of nucleoprotein gene between positions 1157 and 1445 nt. RESULTS: Analysis of the results verified that the sample isolated from the species M. molossus presented antigenic variant 6, while the other two samples showed a different profile from that established in the panel, one not previously reported in the literature. The results of genetic analysis revealed that the M. molossus sample segregated with Lasiurus sp. isolates, M. neglectus segregated with a subgroup of Eptesicus furinalis isolates and the Myotis riparius sample segregated with Myotis sp. isolates.

Eighty-nine samples obtained from rabid livestock, cats, (logs, and humans in Mexico were studied by antigenic typing and partial sequence analysis. Samples were further compared with enzootic rabies associated with different species of <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> the Americas. Patterns of nucleotide variation allowed the definition of at least 20 monophyletic clusters associated with 9 or more different bat species. Several lineages associated with distinctive antigenic patterns were found <b>in</b> <b>rabies</b> viruses related to <b>rabies</b> <b>in</b> vampire <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> Mexico. Vampire <b>bat</b> <b>rabies</b> virus lineages associated with antigenic variant 3 are widely spread from Mexico to South America, suggesting these lineages as the most likely, ancestors of vampire bat rabies {{and the ones that}} have been moved by vampire bat populations throughout the Americas.

40|$|Bats are {{important}} reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases, yet the mechanisms that allow highly virulent pathogens to persist within bat populations remain obscure. In Latin America, vampire-bat–transmitted rabies virus represents a key {{example of how}} such uncertainty can impede efforts to prevent cross-species transmission. Despite decades of agricultural and human health losses, control efforts have had limited success. To establish persistence mechanisms of vampire-bat–transmitted <b>rabies</b> virus <b>in</b> Latin America, we use data from a spatially replicated, longitudinal field study of vampire <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> Peru to parameterize a series of mechanistic transmission models. We find that single-colony persistence cannot occur. Instead, dispersal of bats between colonies, combined with a high frequency of immunizing nonlethal infections, is necessary to maintain rabies virus at levels consistent with field observations. Simulations show that the strong spatial component to transmission dynamics could explain the failure of bat culls to eliminate rabies and suggests that geographic coordination of control efforts might reduce transmission to humans and domestic animals. These findings offer spatial dynamics as a mechanism for <b>rabies</b> persistence <b>in</b> <b>bats</b> that might be important for the understanding and control of other bat-borne pathogens...|$|R

This study {{aimed at}} describing {{the detection of}} <b>rabies</b> virus <b>in</b> <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> the state of São Paulo. METHODS: A total of 7, 393 bats from 235 municipalities of the north and northwestern areas {{of the state of}} São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, were assessed according to their morphological and morphometric characteristics from 1997 to 2002. Fluorescent antibody test and mice inoculation were used for viral identification. RESULTS: Of all samples examined, 1. 3 % was rabies virus positive, ranging from 0. 2 % in 1997 to 1. 6 % in 2001. There were found 98 <b>bats</b> infected, 87 <b>in</b> the urban area. Fluorescent antibody test was detected in 77 positive samples, whereas 92 produced <b>rabies</b> signs <b>in</b> mice; incubation period ranging from 4 to 23 days. In 43 cities at least one rabid bat was observed. The highest proportion (33. 7 %) of rabies virus was found in Artibeus lituratus. Eptesicus and Myotis were the most frequent positive species (24. 5 %) of the Vespertilionidae family. The species Molossus molossus and Molossus rufus showed 14. 3 % positive bats.

40|$|Two new rabies-related viruses were {{discovered}} in Russia during 2002. Viruses were isolated from bats in Eastern Siberia near Baikal Lake and in the western Caucasus Mountains.

40|$|<b>Rabies</b> <b>in</b> <b>bats</b> is {{considered}} enzootic throughout the New World, but few comparative {{data are available}} for most countries in the region. As {{part of a larger}} pathogen detection program, enhanced bat rabies surveillance was conducted in Guatemala, between 2009 and 2011. A total of 672 bats of 31 species were sampled and tested for rabies. The prevalence of rabies virus (RABV) detection among all collected bats was low (0. 3 %). Viral antigens were detected and infectious virus was isolated from the brains of two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). RABV was also isolated from oral swabs, lungs and kidneys of both bats, whereas viral RNA was detected in all of the tissues examined by hemi-nested RT-PCR except for the liver of one bat. Sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene showed that both viruses were 100 % identical, whereas sequencing of the glycoprotein gene revealed one non-synonymous substitution (302 T,S). The two vampire bat RABV isolates in this study were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in the eastern states of Mexico and El Salvador.

40|$|Rabies is {{an acute}} viral {{infection}} that is typically fatal. Most rabies modeling {{has focused on}} disease dynamics and control within terrestrial mammals (e. g., raccoons and foxes). As such, <b>rabies</b> <b>in</b> <b>bats</b> has been largely neglected until recently. Because bats have been implicated as natural reservoirs for several emerging zoonotic viruses, including SARS-like corona viruses, henipaviruses, and lyssaviruses, understanding how pathogens are maintained within a population becomes vital. Unfortunately, {{little is known about}} maintenance mechanisms for any pathogen in bat populations. We present a mathematical model parameterized with unique data from an extensive study of rabies in a Colorado population of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) to elucidate general maintenance mechanisms. We propose that life history patterns of many species of temperate-zone bats, coupled with sufficiently long incubation periods, allows for rabies virus maintenance. Seasonal variability in bat mortality rates, specifically low mortality during hibernation, allows long-term bat population viability. Within viable bat populations, sufficiently long incubation periods allow enough infected individuals to enter hibernation and survive until the following year, and hence avoid an epizootic fadeout of rabies virus. We hypothesize that the slowing effects of hibernation on metabolic and viral activity maintains infected individuals and their pathogens until susceptibles from the annual birth pulse become infected and continue the cycle. This research provides a context to explore similar host ecology and viral dynamics that may explain seasonal patterns and maintenance of other bat-borne diseases...|$|E
