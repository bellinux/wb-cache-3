5|$|Demographers or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and {{change over time}} of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study {{of population}} is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or <b>rural</b> <b>sociology.</b> Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} human geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, <b>rural</b> <b>sociology</b> and the sociology of disaster.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to his experimental approach, Rainer is remembered as a talented pedagogue and public speaker, who took public stances in defense of his social and cultural ideals. Vilified by the far-right for his left-wing stances, he blended progressivism with genetic determinism, and, although an adept of eugenics, condemned scientific racism. He was notably involved with Dimitrie Gusti's project of <b>rural</b> <b>sociology,</b> contributing an anthropological record of several isolated villages on the Carpathian slopes. During his lifetime, Rainer also set up a large collection of craniums and skeletons, which became the centerpiece of his Bucharest anthropology department.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, Rainer {{mainly focused}} on anthropological {{work and the}} popularization of anthropological science. Alongside sociologists such as Dimitrie Gusti, Henri H.

Between 1928 and 1932, Rainer was also involved in Gusti's <b>rural</b> <b>sociology</b> project in the Carpathians. Joining the Gusti team as an anthropometrist, he earned kudos from the scientific community of his day with Enquêtes anthropologiques dans trois villages roumains des Carpathes ("Anthropological Queries in Three Romanian Villages of the Carpathians").

500|$|Often grouped {{with urban}} and <b>rural</b> <b>sociology</b> {{is that of}} {{community}} sociology or the sociology of community. Taking various communities—including online communities—as the unit of analysis, community sociologists study the origin and effects of different associations of people. For instance, German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies distinguished between two types of human association: Gemeinschaft (usually translated as [...] "community") and Gesellschaft ("society" [...] or [...] "association"). In his 1887 work, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tönnies argued that Gemeinschaft {{is perceived to be}} a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a [...] "unity of will". The 'development' or 'health' of a community is also a central concern of community sociologists also engage in development sociology, exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of social capital.|$|E
500|$|Urban {{sociology}} {{involves the}} analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making. After the industrial revolution, works such as Georg Simmel's The Metropolis and Mental Life (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The Chicago School produced a major body of theory {{on the nature of}} the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilizing symbolic interactionism as a method of field research. Contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of globalization, for instance, in Saskia Sassen's study of the [...] "Global city". <b>Rural</b> <b>sociology,</b> by contrast, is {{the analysis of}} non-metropolitan areas. As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists.|$|E

The paper starts with a brief sketch {{of the history of}} the field. When compared to earlier approaches, current thinking about ‘communication, innovation and development’ pays greater attention to limitations in the potential of orchestrating change and innovation in pre-planned directions, and to political and institutional dimensions of both communication and innovation. In relation to this, new lines of questioning are discussed. The article ends with a reflection on the usefulness of the thinking from different historical periods today. It is argued that approaches to science and technology communication need to be matched with the level of complexity of the issue at hand...|$|R

Despite his Guard affiliation and his approval of the death squads, for which he was denounced by Stancu in Azi, Herseni was also taken on board. Drafting him into the Social Service, Gusti assigned him to teach a specialized course in <b>rural</b> <b>sociology</b> at the Bucharest sociology department, making him a referent and {{director of research at the}} ISR.

2500|$|From 1924, Herseni was {{a student}} at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Law, {{studying}} under Gusti, Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Nicolae Iorga, Ovid Densusianu, and Vasile Pârvan. Passionate about Gusti's attempts to restructure Romanian social science around <b>rural</b> <b>sociology</b> and participant observation, Herseni was taken on board for Gusti's field trips to Nereju (1927) and Fundu Moldovei (1928). Another one of Gusti's students, Henri H. Stahl, first met and befriended him at Nereju, and was impressed by the encounter. Herseni, he writes, [...] "appeared quiet, withdrawn; and yet not lonesome", [...] "ready to take on whoever would oppose him, whether friend or rival". He grasped complex social issues with [...] "rapidity", and [...] "imposed himself as one one of the team leaders, obtaining for himself a rank that he would never lose".

40|$|This paper characterises {{children}} orphaned by AIDS in the Couffo {{region of}} Benin. A 2006 census {{conducted for the}} research revealed a total of 315 such orphans, aged 0 to 14 years, within 88 households. Seventy-one percent of these children were {{under the care of}} their mothers or grandmothers, 68 % were fatherless, 58 % were between the ages of 7 and 12, and 68 % were in primary school. An in-depth study of the orphans’ lives, undertaken to complement the census, revealed that these orphans were highly mobile between households, with almost 50 % of them moving homes within a six-month period. An analysis of this phenomenon found that orphan mobility was a deliberate household strategy to manage orphanhood. Tensions arising out of care arrangements and resource allocation were among the main reasons for the high degree of orphan mobility. The context of orphan mobility also highlighted the practical role the orphans were able to fulfil within the affected households. The findings show that orphan mobility is a social phenomenon with two functions: on one hand, it may help HIV/AIDS-affected households to manage {{the increase in the number}} of orphans; on the other, it can provide an opportunity for orphans to move to a ‘safer’ environment anytime they do not feel secure. The implications for institutions providing care to orphans were also identified. Among other things, we recommend that a distinction be made between the main caregiver and the ‘endorser’ of an orphan as this was found to be an important difference. We also recommended that a distinction be made between orphans under and over the age of 10. For instance, children in the age group 10 – 14 years should be defined as ‘pre-adults,’ as their position within the household and their needs for services are different from those of orphans under age 10.
