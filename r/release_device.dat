When an obstruction is encountered the spring release mechanism in the hitch permits the plow to uncouple from the tractor.

The re-set mechanism allows each body to move rearward and upward to pass over obstacle (e.g. rocks hidden below soil surface) without damage. A heavy leaf or coil spring mechanism, which holds the body in its working position under normal conditions, resets the plough after the obstruction is passed.|$|E
50|$|Biofix is {{used with}} weather data to run degree day models (see below) which predict with {{excellent}} accuracy the phenology {{of the population}} in the field, thereby allowing growers to time their management actions to target codling moth when they are most susceptible. A kairomone, which is a feeding attractant, can be used to capture males and females (DA lure). Mating disruption can be used to effectively manage codling moth populations in many cases. Mating disruption involves the use of a pheromone-impregnated <b>release</b> <b>device,</b> typically made of plastic or rubber. Dispensers are distributed throughout the orchard and emit female pheromone at a high, relatively constant rate. The mechanism by which mating disruption affects males is poorly understood; it may increase the time required for males to find females, thus reducing fecundity, or it may simply mask the position of females to searching males, reducing mating substantially.|$|E

40|$|March 5 - 6, 2009, Bangkok, ThailandTo reduce {{incidental}} {{mortality of}} sea turtles in a pound net, a new releasing system {{was developed to}} allow turtles {{to escape from the}} bag net. The turtle <b>releasing</b> <b>device</b> with flapped vent has already been developed for small-scaled pound nets, but seems ineffective for large-scaled pound nets because the turtles rarely encounter the device in a large bag net. This study examined the validity of the sloping upper panel for guiding sea turtle to the <b>releasing</b> <b>device</b> in the bag net. Tank experiments were performed with three types of experimental bag nets: a box-shaped net with horizontal upper panel, one with square-pyramid shaped upper panels of 10 degrees (10 degrees slope net), and square-pyramid shaped bag net with upper panel of 20 degrees (20 degrees slope net). Five loggerheads in captivity (SCL: 42. 8 cm- 50. 0 cm) were prepared. The turtle swam around after entering the bag net, and about five minutes later it started to push its head up against the upper panel. In the 20 degrees slope net, the turtle moved to the shallowest space of the net. This suggested that the sloping upper panel guided the loggerhead turtle to the <b>releasing</b> <b>device</b> in the bag net of a largescaled pound net...|$|R

40|$|The use of fixed-time {{artificial}} insemination (IATF) in cows is {{possible by the}} use of drugs that aim at the synchronization of the folicular wave pool, the estrus and ovulation. In trading cattle the costs of these drugs must stablish a profitable relation with the benefits. The present study meant to compare the pregnancy rates in Nelore (Bos taurus indicus) cows inseminated at fixed-time, treated with new (IN) or once used (IR; reused) auricular <b>releasing</b> <b>devices</b> with 3 mg of norgestomet (CrestarÂ®), associated with the administration of norgestomet (NG) and estradiol valerate (VE) or progesterone (P 4) and estradiol benzoate (BE). Pure breed Nelore cows (n= 241), on lactation with calf received one of the four treatments: new CrestarÂ®during 10 days administrated with 3 mg of NG and 5 mg of VE (group IN/NG+VE; n= 61); new CrestarÂ®inserted during 8 days with 50 mg of P 4 and 2 mg of BE (group IN/P 4 +BE; n= 61); reused CrestarÂ®inserted during 10 days in association with 3 mg of norgestomet and 5 mg of VE (group IR/NG+VE; n= 58) or reused CrestarÂ®inserted during 8 days in association with 50 mg of P 4 and 2 mg of BE (group IR/P 4 +BE; n= 61). On the day the <b>releasing</b> <b>devices</b> were removed the animals received 7, 5 mg of Luprostiol and after 24 hours 1 mg of BE. A fixed-time {{artificial insemination}} was done 54 to 56 hours after the removal of the <b>releasing</b> <b>devices.</b> Cows detected in estrus after the insemination at fixed-time were observed during a period of 49 days and reinseminated. The pregnancy diagnosis was done by ultrassonography 35 days after the IATF and {{after the end of the}} breeding season. The pregnancy rates of IATF (TP IATF) and at the end of the breeding season (TP EM) were estimated. There was no interaction between the characteristics of the (new or reused) <b>releasing</b> <b>devices</b> and the treatment given at the day the <b>releasing</b> <b>devices</b> were inserted (NG+VE e P 4 +BE). The use of new or used CIDRÂ®had no effect on TP IATF (48, 3 % vs 48, 7 %) and on TP EM (85, 2 % vs 86, 5 %). The treatments with NG+VE e P 4 +BE did not have effect on TP IATF (49, 5 % vs 47, 5 %) and TP EM (86, 5 vs 85, 2 %). There was a effect on the number of parturition (primipara and multipara) on the TP IATF (35 % vs 52, 7 %; P< 0, 01) and on TP EM (71, 9 % vs 90, 2 %; P< 0, 01). It can be concluded that the new or once used <b>releasing</b> <b>devices</b> with norgestomet when associated with NG+VE or P 4 +BE promote highly satisfatory pregnancy rates in Nelore cows, being the better rates obtained in multipara females...|$|R
