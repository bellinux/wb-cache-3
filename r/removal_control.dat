40|$|Motivation: We {{propose a}} method for {{studying}} the stability of biomarker lists obtained from functional genomics studies. It is common to adopt resampling methods to tune and evaluate marker-based diagnostic and prognostic systems {{in order to prevent}} selection bias. Such caution promotes honest estimation of class prediction, but leads to alternative sets of solutions. In microarray studies, the difference in lists may be bewildering, also due to the presence of modules of functionally related genes. Methods for assessing stability are needed to understand how the markers depend on the data or on the predictor’s type and help selecting solutions. Results: A computational framework for comparing sets of ranked biomarker lists is presented. Notions and algorithms are based on concepts from permutation group theory. We introduce several algebraic indicators and metric methods for symmetric groups, including the Canberra distance, a weighted version of Spearman’s footrule. We also consider distances between partial lists and an aggregation of sets of lists into an optimal list based on voting theory (Borda count). The stability indicators are applied in practical situations to several synthetic, cancer microarray and proteomics datasets. The addressed issues are predictive classification, presence of modules, comparison of alternative biomarker lists, outlier <b>removal,</b> <b>control</b> of selection bias by randomization techniques, enrichment analysis.

In this study, adsorption control performance of phosphorus removal from agricultural non-point source pollution by manual nano-aperture Lanthanum-modified active alumina was a great inspiring from urban-rural-integration-area. About 10 to 30 nanometers aperture on granule surfaces from the active alumina (&gamma-Al 2 O 3 which average sphere diameters is 3 mm, was formed after modification from Lanthanum (III) chloride. Results show that the adsorption performance of phosphorus removal by using nano-aperture Lanthanum-modified active alumina was much higher percent 50 % than active alumina under the optimum condition of pH (pH = 4), adsorption time (12 h) and adsorption dosage of Lanthanum-modified active alumina (0. 2 g/ 50 mL). The adsorption performance of phosphorus removal by nano-aperture Lanthanum-modified active alumina can reach the percentage of 96 from water samples in agricultural non-point source pollution. The adsorption kinetic accorded with the Pseudo-Second-order Kinetic Equations (R 2 = 0. 9955). The isothermal adsorption property was described by the Langmuir Equation (R 2 = 0. 9982) which the biggest adsorption capacity was 0. 257 mg/g. The average removal efficiency of phosphorus from general farmland, corn field, paddy field, vegetable land was above 92 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that elevated temperature decouples anthocyanins and total soluble solids (TSS) in developing berries and explored the effects of fruit load and water supply on the putative decoupling. METHODS AND RRESULTS: We established three 22 factorial experiments where two thermal regimes (elevated temperature, control) where combined with varieties (Shiraz, Cabernet Franc), fruit loads (bunch <b>removal,</b> <b>control)</b> or water regimes (irrigated, water deficit). The relationship between anthocyanins and TSS had a lag phase where TSS increased with no change in anthocyanins and an approximately linear phase where both traits increased in parallel for TSS > 11. 4 °Brix. Mean residuals in the linear phase were 0. 065 mg/g in controls compared with − 0. 064 mg/g in the heated treatment, hence demonstrating the thermal decoupling of anthocyanins and TSS across varieties fruit loads and water regimes (P < 0. 0001). Delayed onset of anthocyanin accumulation at elevated temperature explained the decoupling. Water deficit increased the anthocyanin : TSS ratio. CONCLUSION: Elevated temperature decoupled anthocyanins and sugars in berries by a relative shift in onset rather than rate of accumulation of these berry components. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Warming trends are likely to disrupt the anthocyanin : sugar ratio in berries with consequences for colour : alcohol balance in red wines. Water deficit established shortly before veraison could partially restore these ratios. V. O. Sadras and M. A. Mora...|$|E
40|$|Mercury {{partitioning}} from {{monoethylene glycol}} (MEG) during natural gas production {{is a highly}} complicated process. Understanding this process will help determine the distribution of mercury species within a given industrial process so that appropriate mercury <b>removal</b> <b>control</b> systems can be effectively managed. In this study, the partitioning of elemental mercury (Hg 0) from the gaseous phase into MEG solutions is investigated under standard laboratory conditions. Additionally, the partitioning of dissolved ionic mercury (Hg 2 +) from MEG solutions into the gaseous phase is also investigated under atmospheric pressure and room temperature conditions. It {{was found that the}} solubility of Hg 0 in MEG ranged from 0 to 60 ppb (ng/mL) with slight increase to ∼ 80 ppb when the pH was reduced from ∼ 9 to ∼ 6 at room temperature. On the other hand oxidized mercury (Hg 2 +) was found to be retained in the laboratory grade MEG and industrial samples of MEG (industrial-MEG). However, {{in the case of the}} industrial-MEG, the dissolved mercury (HgCl 2 salt) was found to be unstable with approximately 3. 6 % and 10 % converting within the solution and leaving in the gas phase as Hg 0 and Hg 2 +, respectively, while the balance was retained in the MEG solution. The distribution was found to be highly pH dependent and was not observed when the experiments were repeated using laboratory grade MEG solutions. These findings help in better understanding the type and ratio of mercury species that are partitioned in and out of MEG in the gas processing facilities...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado Vinifera EuroMaster - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the optimal timing of fruit-zone leaf removal for red wine grape cultivars, specifically Vitis vinifera ‘Merlot’, in the Yakima Valley, Washington using four different timings of fruit-zone leaf removal, (i) pre-bloom, (ii) full-bloom, (iii) 3 weeks post-bloom and (iv) no leaf <b>removal</b> (<b>control).</b> Fruit-zone leaf removal is a common canopy management technique, with increasing focus on early (pre-fruit set) timing. Little research exists on the impacts of early fruit-zone leaf removal in semiarid viticultural regions like the inland Pacific Northwest, USA. Shoot growth after leaf removal in the pre-bloom treatment temporarily decreased relative to the no leaf removal treatment (control). The incidence of summer lateral shoot development within the fruit-zone indicates that only pre-bloom fruit-zone leaf removal recovered to control levels by véraison. Percent fruit set was lowest in the pre-bloom treatment. Sunburn, powdery mildew and Botrytis bunch rot did not develop to any significant level in any treatment. Though not statistically significant, fruit-zone leaf removal increased surface temperatures of clusters and compound buds. The scope of this report does not provide adequate data for firm conclusions about the effects of early fruit-zone leaf removal on grapevine development and fruit quality. Outside of the summer lateral shoot data, the fruit-zone leaf removal treatments in this experiment were statistically similar to the no leaf removal treatment. However, trends in the data suggest fruit-zone leaf removal may impact vine vigor, fruit set, and fruit-zone microclimate providing ample cause for further research on this canopy management techniqu...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{clarify the}} fine {{structure}} of the avian choroid and thus help explain the mechanisms for normal and abnormal eye function and growth. METHODS: Eyes from normal chickens and from experimental chickens subjected to unilateral paracentesis were fixed either by perfusion or in situ, with or without post-fixation by microwave irradiation, and then processed for light and electron microscopic analysis. RESULTS: The avian choroid contains thin-walled lacunae, whose fine structure is identical to that of lymphatic vessels. The lacunae are much smaller toward the anterior chamber and the Schlemm's canal than posteriorly in the eye bulb. Large lacunae are situated primarily in the suprachoroidea, and their blind-ended capillary branches enter the choriocapillaris and the walls of large veins. The walls of the large veins contain villous structures that protrude into their lumina and are penetrated by thin lacunar branches and by side lines of the venous lumen. In normal chickens, the lacunae usually are devoid of blood cells. After paracentesis of the anterior eye chamber, the lacunae become filled with erythrocytes on the side that was operated on, {{but not on the}} contralateral side. CONCLUSIONS: The authors propose that the lacunae of the avian choroid represent a system of posterior short lymphatic vessels, which drain intraocular fluids directly into the eye's venous system, and that the villous structures are sites of communication between lacunae and veins. The demonstration of a choroidal lymphatic system opens new insights into the processes of fluid <b>removal,</b> <b>control</b> of intraocular pressure, and regulation of choroidal thickness in the avian eye under normal and experimental conditions...|$|E

Franco were {{undertaken}} to investigate known constraints to low-cost afforestation of depleted short grasslands of the South Island high country. In field trials mycorrhizal development of Ps. menziesii seedlings was enhanced by drilling seed with soil collected under an existing stand. Seed inoculation with mycorrhizal fungal spores {{appeared to be}} more successful than soil inoculation in promoting pine mycotrophy. Seed inoculation was less effective for Pinus nigra Arn. than for P. radiata D. Don, possibly because the method used resulted in attachment of more spores to the larger P. radiata seed. Inoculation of pine seed with spores ofRhizopogon rubescens Tul. was more effective than inoculation with R. luteolus Fr. or Suillus luteus (L. ex Fr.) S. F. Gray. Exclosure trials at two Mackenzie Basin sites showed that browsing of seedlings was due to rabbits.

In the absence of rabbits, turf removal may improve seedling establishment in drier areas. Fertiliser application decreased tree seedling numbers through increased competition from the herbaceous sward.

On less drought-prone soils forest establishment by seeding is possible if rabbits are controlled. Further experimentation with mycorrhizal inoculation is required...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{many parts}} of the world, roadsides are {{regularly}} managed for traffic-safety reasons. Hence, there are similarities between roadsides and certain other managed habitats, such as wooded pastures and mown or grazed grasslands. In contrast to roadsides, the latter habitats have declined rapidly in Europe during the last century, and today only a fraction of their former extent remains. For many species historically associated with these habitats, roadsides may therefore function as new primary habitats or as dispersal corridors in fragmented landscapes. Current recommendations for roadside management to promote conservation values are largely based on studies of plants in semi-natural grasslands, although such areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental factors and impacts. Moreover, roadsides provide habitats not only for plants but also for many insects, especially if they are sandy and exposed to the sun. For these reasons, stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted management recommendations, based on actual studies of roadside biodiversity. Methods: The proposed systematic map is intended to provide an overview of the available evidence on how biodiversity is affected by various forms of roadside management, and how such management influences the dispersal of species along roads or roadsides. Relevant interventions include e. g. mowing, shrub <b>removal,</b> <b>control</b> of invasive/nuisance species, sowing or planting, burning, grazing by livestock, scraping and ditching. Non-intervention or alternative forms of roadside management will be used as comparators. Relevant outcomes include measures of species or genetic diversity, the abundance of individual species or groups of organisms, species distribution patterns, and movement rates of individuals or propagules. Searches will be made for peer-reviewed and grey literature in English and several other languages. No geographical restrictions will be applied, and all species and species groups will be considered. ...|$|E

PLSS 2. 0 was developed in 2012, with extensive functional evaluations and system performance testing through mid- 2014. In late 2014, PLSS 2. 0 was integrated with the Mark III space suit in an ambient laboratory environment to facilitate manned testing, designated PLSS 2. 0 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) testing, in which the PLSS prototype performed the primary life support functions, including suit pressure regulation, ventilation, carbon dioxide control, and cooling of the test subject and PLSS avionics. The intent of this testing was to obtain subjective test subject feedback regarding qualitative aspects of PLSS 2. 0 performance such as thermal comfort, sounds, smells, and suit pressure fluctuations due to the cycling carbon dioxide removal system, as well as to collect PLSS performance data over a range of human metabolic rates from 500 - 3000 Btu/hr. Between October 27 and December 18, 2014, nineteen two-hour simulated EVA test points were conducted in which suited test subjects walked on a treadmill to achieve a target metabolic rate. Six test subjects simulated nominal and emergency EVA conditions with varied test parameters including metabolic rate profile, carbon dioxide <b>removal</b> <b>control</b> mode, cooling water temperature, and Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (state of the art or prototype). The nineteen test points achieved more than 60 hours of test time, with 36 hours accounting for simulated EVA time.

40|$|The basic {{ecology of}} well-researched {{earthworm}} species, such as Lumbricus terrestris, remains relatively unknown. In order {{to contribute to}} the limited body of knowledge, the present work aimed to investigate if specific behaviours could be detected between an adult and the cocoons it produced by comparison with a non-parental adult and cocoons. Modified Evans’ boxes (0. 8 × 0. 2 × 0. 008 m) with recently mated adults allowed observation of their habits under what was essentially a 2 -D system. Experimental manipulation (at 81 days) involved four treatments: (1) L. terrestris removal (LtRm); (2) L. terrestris replacement (LtRp), where individuals were replaced by others; (3) control, with no manipulation and (4) L. terrestris <b>removal</b> <b>control</b> (CLtRm) where individuals were removed and then reintroduced in the same box, to account for any effects of the removal method. Burrowing patterns of adults and later, hatchlings, were recorded throughout the duration of the experiment (191 days). Cocoon production across treatments did not differ significantly (p> 0. 05) and averaged 26 ± 6. 4 cocoons worm− 1 over a 26 week period. In the LtRm treatment mean cocoon production was 12. 6 ± 2. 7 cocoons worm− 1 over 11 weeks. Forty one percent of cocoons were deposited in the upper 0. 05 m of the soil profile. Cocoons below that depth were found deposited in side burrows (1 – 4 cm in length) and were coated with earthworm casts. Hatchling number and survival rate did not differ significantly across treatments (p> 0. 05) with means±s. d. of 2 ± 2. 2 and 62 ± 29 %, respectively. Hatchling mass in the LtRm treatment (0. 4 ± 0. 38 g), was found to be significantly greater (p< 0. 01) than that of all other treatments (0. 12 ± 0. 12 g).

Four removal treatments— 1) no <b>removal</b> (<b>control),</b> 2) grazing at 2. 5 animal unit month (AUM) / ha, 3) grazing at 5. 0 AUM/ha, and 4) baling—were applied to a center pivot–irrigated corn field (53 ha). The field was divided into eight 6. 6 -ha paddocks to which replicated treatments were assigned. Samples of residue were collected in October and March (before and after residue removal) using ten 0. 5 -m 2 quadrats per treatment replication. Residue was separated into 5 plant parts—stem, cob, leaf, husk, and grain—and analyzed for nutrient content. Esophageally fistulated cattle were used to measure diet quality. Cattle assigned to the 2. 5 AUM/ha stocking rate treatment gained more BW (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and BCS (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) than cattle assigned to the 5. 0 AUM/ha treatment. Leaf contained the most (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) CP and husk had the greatest (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) in vitro OM disappearance (IVOMD) but the CP and IVOMD of individual plant parts did not differ (P 3 ̆e 0. 69) between sampling dates. Amount of total residue was reduced (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) by baling and both grazing treatments between October and March but was not different (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) in control paddocks between sampling dates. As a proportion of the total residue, stem increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and husk decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) between October and March. Diet CP content was similar (P = 0. 10) between sampling dates for the 2 grazing treatments but IVOMD was greater after grazing in the 2. 5 AUM/ha grazing treatment (P = 0. 04). Subsequent grain yields were not different (P = 0. 16) across all 4 residue removal treatments.
