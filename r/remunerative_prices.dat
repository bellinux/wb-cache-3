40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to estimate and compare the costs and returns in deep litter and cage systems of poultry rearing and also to identify the constraints, which affect the poultry production in India. Results of this study reveal that the fixed investment per farm is found to be more on cage system of rearing for all the three size groups. In both systems, the feed cost decrease gradually when the stock size increases except in medium size group in deep litter system and accounts for more than 84 % of the total cost of production irrespective of stock size and system of rearing. The cost of production per bird reveal that the cost of permanent and family labor and electricity increase with increase in stock size in case of deep litter system whereas in cage system, it is found to decrease with increase in flock size. The cage system appears to be more efficient than the deep litter system in producing eggs and the feed efficiency increases with decrease in stock size in both the system of rearing. Further, the net returns per farm increase as the size of the farm increases in both the systems and the returns per farm is, however, higher in cage system than in deep litter system in all the three groups. The major constraints in egg production are identified and ranked by using Garrett’s Ranking Technique and are in the order of high cost of feed, high cost of medicine and vaccine, supply of poor quality feed and feed ingredients, non <b>remunerative</b> <b>price</b> for eggs, lack of disease control facilities and higher rate of electricity tariff...|$|R

Step one in commercialisation of smallholder agriculture is participation, which is significantly influenced by yield; {{the second step}} is selling at remunerative sources (market centres), which is influenced by these three variables (yield, FBOs and price). This implies that incentivising smallholders to incur transaction costs to reach remunerative markets lies in measures that would increase yield (as discussed already), well-functioning farmer associations and offering <b>remunerative</b> <b>prices</b> for produce.

There {{have been few}} systems / models in which farmers are assured of a market for their produce, leave alone a <b>remunerative</b> <b>price.</b> However, farmers have on occasions had to throw their produce away for want of buyers. This is {{one side of the}} coin. The PAR (Poverty Analysis Report) 2004, based on the BLSS (Bhutan Living Standard Survey) 2003, estimated that 31. 7 percent of the Bhutanese population (or about 173, 500 of the 547, 000 extrapolated total number of persons from the sample) belonged to households who were consuming less than the national poverty line of Nu. 740. 36 per person per month. Further, the PAR 2004 indicated that poverty in Bhutan was more of a rural phenomenon, i. e. 97. 4 percent of the poor reside in rural areas   Contract farming usually involves certain basic elements viz., pre-agreed price, quantity, quality or acreage (min/max) and time. According to the contract the farmer is required to plant the contractor’s crop on his land, and to harvest and deliver to the contractor a quantum of produce, based on the anticipated yield and contracted acreage. This could be at a pre-agreed price. Towards these ends the contractor supplies the farmers with selected inputs, including the required technical advice. To be successful, it requires a long term commitment from both parties. And to safeguard the interests of both the farmers and the contractors, it becomes necessary that the contracts are made in writing and duly backed up by appropriate legislative measures.

If wrongly handled it becomes a weapon of destruction which destroys all their cherished hope and dreams for a better living. </p...|$|R

40|$|Community forest {{management}} (CFM) {{is considered an}} alternative way to protect forests while providing income for smallholders. Since the mid- 1990 s, the number of CFM projects has rapidly increased in the Brazilian Amazon, although most of them still face several difficulties. In this paper, we discuss the obstacles to the financial viability of CFM in this region and propose some ways to overcome them. Based on evidence from five case studies, we assess {{the extent to which}} sustainable {{forest management}} for commercial timber production contributes to smallholder income. We show that harvesting timber only provides a limited cash income to smallholders, even though forest covers 80 % of their landholding. Market access to timber is very uncertain and smallholder communities often fail to make a profit from their timber. Minimum <b>remunerative</b> public <b>prices</b> and support for timber marketing are thus needed. Simpler and more flexible procedures are required to reduce the high transaction costs of obtaining a permit and increase smallholder involvement in legal forest management for commercial purposes. Finally, a better assessment of timber potential in smallholder forest reserves through systematic inventories would be useful to avoid arousing false expectations. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
