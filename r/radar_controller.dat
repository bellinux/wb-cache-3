25|$|Shortly after, the <b>radar</b> <b>controller</b> {{who handled}} flight 240 {{noticed that the}} {{aircraft}} was turning right beyond its assigned heading; however, his attempts to contact the crew proved futile. Approximately three minutes after the last distress message, reports began to reach ATC from the police of an aircraft crash.|$|E
25|$|The plane made {{radio contact}} with {{approach}} control at Prestwick shortly before 11:00p.m. At {{this point the}} cross-wind over the main runway had, unknown to Parmentier, dropped to 14knots which made it within limits to attempt a landing on the main runway. Instead, he decided to attempt an overshoot of the main runway guided by the ground <b>radar</b> <b>controller,</b> followed by a left-hand turn that would bring the plane downwind of the alternate runway. He would then overfly the runway before looping round for his final approach. While it might sound complicated, Parmentier {{expected to be in}} visual contact with the ground which would make such an attempt relatively easy.|$|E
500|$|At that point, First Officer Klotz radioed the controller, saying, [...] "ah well I {{think we}} need {{priority}} we're passing [...]" [...] The controller inquired as to how long the flight could hold {{as well as what}} their alternate airport was. Klotz replied at 20:46:03 that they could hold for five more minutes. The controller once again inquired as to their alternate airport and Klotz replied at 20:46:24, [...] "It was Boston but we can't do it now we, we, don't, we run out of fuel now." [...] A handoff controller listening in on the conversation called the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (NY TRACON) at 20:46:24 and advised the TRACON controller that Avianca Flight 52 could only hold for five more minutes. The handoff controller asked whether NY TRACON could take the flight or whether to send Avianca to its alternate airport. The NY TRACON controller replied, [...] "Slow him to one eight zero knots and I'll take him." [...] The handoff controller later testified that he had not heard Flight 52 say that they could no longer reach their alternate airport. At 20:46:47, the NY ARTCC <b>radar</b> <b>controller</b> cleared the flight to proceed to JFK at [...] and to slow to [...] Flight 52 departed the CAMRN holding pattern at 20:47.|$|E
50|$|Another, {{but no less}} {{important}} mission was {{the control of the}} Southern Air Corridor between West Germany and West Berlin. <b>Radar</b> <b>controllers</b> of the 616th Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron at Wasserkuppe guided both military and civilian aircraft though the negotiated air corridor over East Germany to and from Tempelhof Central Airport.|$|R
50|$|The {{air traffic}} control radar beacon system (ATCRBS) is a system used in {{air traffic control}} (ATC) to enhance {{surveillance}} radar monitoring and separation of air traffic. ATCRBS assists ATC surveillance radars by acquiring information about the aircraft being monitored, and providing this information to the <b>radar</b> <b>controllers.</b> The controllers can use the information to identify radar returns from aircraft (known as targets) and to distinguish those returns from ground clutter.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth floor}} held the {{administrative}} offices and its dependencies which accounted {{through to the}} fifth floor. The sixth floor contained mainly the dependencies of meteorology and power station of air navigation aids of the ECA. The seventh floor held the route control facilities for the runways and taxiways and the eighth floor contained air traffic <b>radar</b> <b>controllers.</b> The ninth floor contained the airport's electrical maintenance and offices, and the tenth floor held the control tower and air traffic controllers.|$|R
2500|$|Under these stresses, {{the crew}} {{continued}} their approach pattern and readied the aircraft for final descent. Radios were {{tuned to the}} two Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs) present at the field, and the autopilot {{was set up to}} use waypoints from the Flight Management System (FMS) units for navigation. The crew used their second radio to contact the Yak-40 which had landed earlier, inquiring as to the weather conditions. The Yak-40 crew replied, [...] "Well, generally it's absolute shit here," [...] and that, [...] "(we) were lucky to land at the last moment." [...] The Yak-40 crew estimated visibility was , but told PLF 101, [...] "you might try...(to make an approach)." [...] The crew of PLF 101 acknowledged this information and continued their approach. As the aircraft approached the outer marker, the crew issued pitch commands (via the CLIMB-DESCEND wheel) to the autopilot. This is not recommended for the Tu-154, as the autopilot cannot maintain vertical speed accurately enough for the approach phase of flight; manual flight mode is instead recommended. Although the crew had not requested it, the <b>radar</b> <b>controller</b> began issuing reports to PLF 101 concerning their distance from the runway {{and whether or not they}} were on the glidepath. The Polish report noted that on multiple occasions the <b>radar</b> <b>controller</b> stated the airplane was on the glidepath when it was not.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Beauvais at 15:51 UTC (16:51 local time) carrying 4 {{crew and}} 48 passengers. The weather at Lympne {{at the time}} the aircraft departed Beauvais indicated that visibility was , with wind at [...] from 220° and a cloudbase of [...] After passing Abbeville, an updated weather report was sent to the aircraft which showed a visibility of [...] in drizzle, cloudbase [...] and winds of [...] from 220°, gusting to [...] The visibility was below the minimum requirement of [...] for landing, although the captain was later informed that visibility had [...] "improved slightly". At [...] from touchdown, an IFR approach was initiated under the guidance of the <b>radar</b> <b>controller</b> at Lympne. When the aircraft was [...] from the airport, it was at an altitude of [...] above airport level. The captain reported that he could see the end of Runway 20 through the drizzle. At [...] from touchdown, the aircraft ran into severe turbulence and drifted {{to the right of the}} runway centre-line. Full flap was applied and power was reduced. The aircraft crossed the airfield boundary at , reducing to [...] as the flare was begun at a height of [...] As the throttles were closed, the starboard wing dropped and the rate of descent of the aircraft increased. The captain attempted to keep the aircraft level, with the result that it landed heavily. The nose wheel dug into the grass runway, which flipped the aircraft onto its back. The aircraft spun through 180°, ending up facing in the direction from which it had approached. The upside-down aircraft then slid for , ripping off both wings and the starboard tailplane, and crushing the tail.|$|E
2500|$|At , the [...] "terrain ahead!" [...] warning again sounded on {{the flight}} deck. The crew {{continued}} the descent. According to MAK's report, at [...] (Decision Height) there was no [...] "landing" [...] or [...] "go-around" [...] call by the captain. If this happens, the first officer is supposed to overrule the captain, {{take control of the}} airplane, and initiate a go-around. Poland suggests that at this point the captain said [...] "Go around", and 8 seconds later the first officer confirmed by saying [...] "go around". (only the second of these two statements is recorded in the official transcripts by MAK; the first one may have been obscured by a simultaneous report by TAWS). Despite these calls, neither pilot initiated a go-around, and the descent continued. [...] One second after the 100 m altitude was reached, the TAWS alert [...] "PULL UP" [...] activated and continued to sound {{for the remainder of the}} flight. [...] "PULL UP" [...] only activates when the TAWS computer believes a collision with terrain is imminent. Therefore, when [...] "PULL UP" [...] sounds, the crew is supposed to begin an immediate, maximum performance emergency climb (full power and angle of attack to the maximum permissible without stalling) and continue climbing until the warning stops. However, the crew continued the descent. In a typical situation with an airport in the TAWS database, the [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning might not have sounded at this point. There is a method of setting up the TAWS to prevent false warnings when flying into airports not in the database, known as [...] "terrain inhibit" [...] mode; however, the crew did not utilize it. Even if they had, an excessive rate of descent and excessive airspeed can cause the TAWS to issue a [...] "SINK RATE" [...] warning followed by a [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning. This point (10:40:40 local time, approximately 20 seconds before the collision with terrain) is also notable because this was the moment when the aircraft had crossed the minimum allowed approach slope for this airport (2°10'). Prior to this moment, the <b>radar</b> <b>controller</b> had no reason to think that the landing attempt was not proceeding normally. The behavior of the controller was later the subject of some criticism by the Polish media. The controller remained silent for about 12 seconds after the aircraft passed the 100 m mark, and, even at that point, he did not order a go-around, but, rather issued an instruction to transit from a descent to a horizontal flight. (The decision to go around was apparently reached in the cabin of the aircraft within a few seconds of that instruction.) In addition, according to some interpretations of the radio exchange between the ground and the aircraft, the crew was instructed by the ground control to descend to [...] and either to wait for clearance to land or request one explicitly, or to inform the ground control regarding their decision whether to land or to go around. (According to MAK's report, it meant that the crew was supposed to inform the ground control of their decision to land before passing the decision altitude, and that the ground control was supposed to allow the landing as long as the runway and the airspace were clear.) None of this ever happened, with the aircraft continuing the descent through the 120 m mark while the ground control remained silent. It is unknown whether the crew really understood the ground control instruction (literally, [...] "landing additionally, 120, 3 m"), which was issued in Russian and used a relatively recent expression that was only codified in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|At its busiest, each sector {{will have}} a radar {{controller}}.When it is quieter sectors are [...] "bandboxed" [...] with one controller operating multiple sectors, until at night there may only be one controller operating the whole bank. Each bank will also have up to two further supernumerary controllers acting as co-ordinators (to liaise with other sectors and other units, and generally assist the <b>radar</b> <b>controllers),</b> and up to two assistants to prepare flight progress strips, operate computer systems and assist with flight data duties.|$|R
50|$|The Air Force 635th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron worked {{jointly with}} Army <b>radar</b> <b>controllers</b> at the station. The site used an FAA ARSR-1C search radar and two Air Force AN/FPS-6A height-finder radars. (The Army also had 2 AN/FPS-6 variant height-finder radars of their own.) On 11 June, Fort Lawton AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-12 at McChord AFB. After joining, the {{squadron}} was re-designated as the 635th Radar Squadron (SAGE).

5000|$|Aircraft departing Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton and Stansted mostly depart on a free-flow principle: the <b>radar</b> <b>controllers</b> do {{not release}} each {{individual}} flight for departure, they just receive a pre-note via {{a computer system}} that the flight is pending. This cuts down on inter-unit co-ordination and allows the tower controller at the airport to decide the most efficient departure order. In many cases the aircraft's Standard Instrument Departure (SID) routing does not conflict with the [...] approach sequence of aircraft arriving at the airport, so the airport's approach control {{does not need to}} handle the aircraft and it is transferred straight to the TMA controller on departure. The TMA controllers then climb the departures through the arrivals to the airports that they are also working.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was cleared to Quito International Airport via the Girardot 1 (GIR1) departure, {{which consisted of}} a right turn after takeoff (over the Romeo/R NDB), for noise abatement, and for transitioning (via VIOTA) to a south-west route. The flight crew failed to execute the maneuver properly (the First Officer, acting as Pilot in Command, didn't make the initial turn), and forgot to turn the Transponder on after takeoff, which prohibited the <b>radar</b> <b>controllers</b> from assisting them. The FDR showed a departure profile with a low vertical speed, and an airspeed of 260 knots, designed to decrease fuel consumption. Unfortunately, the procedure was also planned to prevent transit ahead of the 19 DME arc of the Bogotá VOR, a mountainous zone whose minimum altitude increases drastically to 14,000 feet.|$|R

5000|$|Within the tower, {{a highly}} disciplined {{communications}} process between air control and ground control {{is an absolute}} necessity. Air control must ensure that ground control is aware of any operations that will impact the taxiways, {{and work with the}} approach <b>radar</b> <b>controllers</b> to create [...] "gaps" [...] in the arrival traffic to allow taxiing traffic to cross runways and to allow departing aircraft to take off. Ground control need to keep the air controllers aware of the traffic flow towards their runways in order to maximise runway utilisation through effective approach spacing. Crew resource management (CRM) procedures are often used to ensure this communication process is efficient and clear. Within ATC, it is usually known as TRM (Team Resource Management) and the level of focus on TRM varies within different ATC organisations.|$|R
