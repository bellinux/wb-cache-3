50|$|Because <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> need to {{maintain}} a clearance between the lobes, a single stage Roots blower can pump gas across only a limited pressure differential. If the pump is used outside its specification, the compression of the gas generates so much heat that the lobes expand {{to the point that}} they jam, damaging the pump.|$|R
50|$|Stothert & Pitt {{commenced}} <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> manufacture with a licence in 1919. Molasses {{and other}} viscous liquids were handled in heated pumps. Up until 1937, installed <b>lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> {{were still in}} use unloading molasses tank ships.A further licence to make twin screw pumps was acquired from Houttuin pumps of Utrecht, the Netherlands in 1935, with manufacturing starting in 1936. Just {{a few years later}} about 1100 twin screw pumps were supplied to the RAF for use in RAF stations all over the world during World War II.Stotherts were the leading in multiphase pump technology in the 1980s but the R&D expenditure did not lead to many pump sales and Stothert & Pitt, a company quoted on the London Stock Exchange, lost its independence and shut in 1989.In 1999 Albany took over the manufacture of Stothert & Pitt Twin Screw, Centrifugal and <b>Lobe</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{frequently}} used in food applications because they handle solids without damaging the product. Particle size pumped {{can be much}} larger in <b>lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> than in other positive displacement types. Since the lobes do not make contact, and clearances are not as close as in other Positive displacement pumps, this design handles low viscosity liquids with diminished performance. Loading characteristics are {{not as good as}} other designs, and suction ability is low. High-viscosity liquids require reduced speeds to achieve satisfactory performance. Reductions of 25% of rated speed and lower are common with high-viscosity liquids.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{time-dependant}} {{calculation of}} flow in a <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> is presented. Calculations are performed using the arbitrary Lagrangean Eulerean (ALE) method. A grid manipulator {{is needed to}} move the nodes between time steps. The used grid manipulator {{is based on the}} pseudo-force idea. This means that each node is fictitiously connected with its 8 neighbours via fictitious springs. The equilibrium of the resulting pseudo spring forces defines the altered position of the nodes. The grid manipulator was coupled with a commercial flow solver and the whole was tested on the flow through a three-lobe <b>lobe</b> <b>pump.</b> Results were obtained for a rotational speed of 460 rpm and incompressible silicon oil as fluid...|$|R

50|$|A {{slurry pump}} {{is a type}} of {{centrifugal}} <b>pump,</b> <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> or peristaltic hose pump in physics principle that increases the pressure of liquid and solid particle mixture (aka slurry), through centrifugal force (a rotating impeller) and converts electrical energy into slurry potential and kinetic energy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are similar}} to {{external}} gear pumps in operation in that fluid flows around {{the interior of the}} casing. Unlike external gear <b>pumps,</b> however, the <b>lobes</b> do not make contact. Lobe contact is prevented by external timing gears located in the gearbox. Pump shaft support bearings are located in the gearbox, and since the bearings are out of the pumped liquid, pressure is limited by bearing location and shaft deflection.|$|R

This design produces a continuous flow with equal volume and no vortex. It can work at low pulsation rates, and offers gentle performance that some applications require.|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} {{performance}} results {{and analysis of}} a novel <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander device. This {{is part of a}} larger research effort into the analysis and design of a small-scale solar system that would compete with available distributed technologies for heat and electricity generation. To choose an appropriate working fluid and components for a distributed concentrating solar combined heat and power (DCS-CHP) system, we compared many different working fluids, collectors, and expander choices. Of the expanders analyzed, including piston expanders, radial inflow turbines, Tesla turbines, screw expanders, and scroll expanders, the <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander shows the greatest promise in small-scale power applications due to its high efficiency in expanding fluids over large pressure ratios and its low cost to manufacture. This article focuses on testing of a prototype small-scale expander that was chosen because, to date, no suitable commercial product of less than 10 kW has been found for this application. Initial testing was completed with air to get results that should be indicative of future testing with steam. The test system consists of a compressed air expander (a prototype designed by Katrix, Inc. of Australia) connected to an induction motor driven by a variable frequency drive (VFD) that enables expander testing at varying shaft speeds. Results of the expander testing are reported isentropic efficiencies of 22 – 25 %, thermomechanical efficiencies of 80 – 95 %, and pressure ratios of 6 – 11 at the tested speeds. Despite mixed results from this particular expander, future refinements could lead to a new class of expanders with low cost and high performance for use in solar combined heat and power and waste-heat recovery...|$|R
40|$|The {{result of}} several years of {{analysis}} of Distributed Concentrating Solar Combined Heat and Power (DCS-CHP) systems is a design that is predicted to convert sunlight to heat at 8 - 10 % solar-electric efficiency while simultaneously capturing ~ 60 % of that initial sunlight as usable heat (at 100 ºC). In contrast to similarly sized photovoltaic systems in the U. S. that cost ~$ 7. 90 /Watt of generator rated peak electrical output, in mass production the proposed collector and generator system sized at 1 - 10 kW would cost ~$ 3. 20 /Watt electricity and ~$ 0. 40 /Watt-thermal, allowing adjustment of heat and electrical output on demand. The proposed system would revolutionize distributed energy generation in several ways: 1) by enabling rapid dissemination via avoidance of production limitations of photovoltaics such as expensive and limited materials, 2) by efficient local production of both heat and power to offset more greenhouse gases {{at a lower cost}} than other renewable energy technologies, and 3) by democratizing the means of electricity production; putting the {{power in the hands of}} the consumer instead of large utilities. With over 5. 4 GW of photovoltaics added globally in 2008 and 20 GW of solar thermal, there is a large proven market for solar energy. With widespread market penetration, this system would reduce greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions from electricity generation and heating for a significant portion of the developed and developing world, including those in remote locations with no connection to an electric grid. Chapter 1 begins with analysis of the relative demand for electricity and heat in California, showing that, on average, demand matches production of a theoretical solar CHP system. Then, we explore the economic and technological impetus for a solar powered combined heat and power Rankine cycle, showing cost and performance modeling in comparison to photovoltaics across varying conditions, and concluding that solar CHP generated electricity is comparable to PV electricity in terms of cost "per peak watt". Chapter 2 shows results of a life cycle analysis of DCS-CHP in comparison to other renewable and non-renewable energy systems including its global warming potential (80 gCO 2 eq/kWh electric and 10 gCO 2 eq/kWh thermal), levelized electric and thermal energy cost ($ 0. 25 /kWh electric and $ 0. 03 /kWh thermal), and cost of solar water purification/desalination ($ 1. 40 /m 3). Additionally the utilization of water for this technology is shown to be much less than fossil-fuel based thermal power plants. Chapter 3 explores the expander as an enabling technology for small solar Rankine cycles and presents results of physical testing and characterization of a <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander prototype developed by a small Australian company, Katrix, Inc. Testing of this expander using compressed air yields an impressive isentropic efficiency of 80 - 95 % at pressure ratios of 6 - 11 making the <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander a leading choice for DCS-CHP systems, if operation on steam is successful and reliability issues can be addressed. Chapter 4 concludes with a description and analysis of a DCS-CHP system using simulation software developed in Matlab for the purpose of system analysis and optimization. This chapter focuses on the selection of an appropriate expander and collectors, the two key enabling technologies for DCS-CHP. In addition to discussion of the <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander, we present a novel collector device appropriate for solar CHP systems that eliminates high pressure articulate joints, a typical failure point of solar concentrating systems. Given the results of the <b>rotary</b> <b>lobe</b> expander testing, comparison to previous expander modeling work, and comparison of the predicted cost and efficiency of the collectors analyzed, an appropriate technology version of the DCS-CHP system is selected and overall system performance is predicted across 1020 sites in the US...|$|R

The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in their Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation are discretized on a triangular grid using a finite volume method. Fully implicit time integration makes the method stable for any time step. Central differencing is used for the diffusive fluxes while upwind differencing based on flux-difference splitting for incompressible fluids is used for the convective fluxes.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the method of}} the discretization of the gear tooth flank in involute segments for the determination of conjugate gear tooth profiles. Instead of following a point-to-point analytical approach {{to the problem of}} determining the path of contact and the geometry of the generating rack and the mating wheel, the actual tooth flank is considered to be composed of infinitesimal local involutes and therefore a closed solution can be achieved. Due to its simplicity, the method is faster than the standard theory of gearing and this is particularly useful in problems requiring iterative calculations of the tooth geometry such as gear optimization. The method is implemented on modified involute as well as loboid gears used in <b>lobe</b> <b>pumps</b> and it is verified against existing theories. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Despite the {{tremendous}} development in CNC programming facilities, linear and circular cuts {{parallel to the}} coordinate planes {{continue to be the}} standard motions of modern CNC machines. However, the increasing industrial demand for parts with intricate shapes cannot be satisfied with only these standard motions. The proportion of parts which are not covered by the standard CNC motions is certainly growing, due to the increasing industrial demand for intricate shapes. So for that we have decided to develop a new CANNED cycle with the help of MACRO (parametric) programming on Hypo cycloid, combined EP-hypo cycloid curve and last for Bezier surface also. we found that this canned cycle would be useful for different application such as cycloidal speed reducer, <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> rotor and surface milling without requiring external arrangement like CAD modeling, CNC interpolator etc...|$|R
40|$|An {{internal}} <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> (ILP) {{is suitable}} for machine tool oil hydraulics, automotive engines, compressors, and vari-ous other devices. In particular, the ILP is {{an essential component of}} an automotive engine, used to feed lubricant oil through the system. The main components of an ILP are its rotors. The outer rotor is typically characterized by lobes with an elliptical shape, and the inner rotor profile is a conjugate to the outer profile. This paper describes a theoretical analysis of an ILP and the development of an integrated automated system for rotor design. This system is composed of three main modules and has been developed using AutoLISP for the AutoCAD program.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{theoretical}} analysis of the internal <b>lobe</b> <b>pump</b> which is a particular type of positive displacement rotary pump. The main components of the pump are the rotors: usually the outer one is characterised by lobes with circular shape, while the inner rotor profile is determined as conjugate to the other. For this reason the first topic presented here is the definition of the geometry of the rotors starting from the design parameters. The choice of these parameters is subject to some limitations in order to avoid inner rotor undercutting and to limit the pressure angle between the rotors. Now we will consider the design optimisation. The first step is the determination of the instantaneous flow rate in function of the design parameters. This allows us to calculate two performance indexes commonly used for the study of positive displacement pumps: the flow rate irregularity and the specific flow rate. These indexes are used to optimise the design of the pump and to obtain the sets of optimum design parameters. Finally further considerations are presented regarding the calculation and the use of other performance indexes, the specific slipping and the rotor curvature, which are particularly suitable for giving more elements for the analysis of this case...|$|R

40|$|The National Advanced Biofuels Consortium {{is working}} to develop {{improved}} methods for producing high-value hydrocarbon fuels. The development of one such method, the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process, is being led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The HTL process uses a wet biomass slurry at elevated temperatures (i. e., 300 to 360 °C [570 to 680 °F]) and pressures above the vapor pressure of water (i. e., 15 to 20 MPa [2200 to 3000 psi] at these temperatures) to facilitate a condensed-phase reaction medium. The process has been successfully tested at bench-scale and development and testing at a larger scale is required to prove {{the viability of the}} process at production levels. Near-term development plans include a pilot-scale system on the order of 0. 5 to 40 gpm, followed by a larger production-scale system on the order of 2000 dry metric tons per day (DMTPD). A significant challenge to the scale-up of the HTL process is feeding a highly viscous fibrous biomass wood/corn stover feedstock into a pump system that provides the required 3000 psi of pressure for downstream processing. In October 2011, PNNL began investigating commercial feed and pumping options that would meet these HTL process requirements. Initial efforts focused on generating a HTL feed and pump specification and then providing the specification to prospective vendors to determine the suitability of their pumps for the pilot-scale and production-scale plants. Six vendors were identified that could provide viable equipment to meet HTL feed and/or pump needs. Those six vendors provided options consisting three types of positive displacement pumps (i. e., diaphragm, piston, and <b>lobe</b> <b>pumps).</b> Vendors provided capabilities and equipment related to HTL application. This information was collected, assessed, and summarized and is provided as appendices to this report...|$|R

40|$|The {{pulmonary}} vasopressor {{response to}} acidemia was studied in intact dogs in a hemodynamically separated <b>lobe</b> which was <b>pump</b> perfused with systemic arterial or venous blood {{at a fixed}} rate. The magnitudes of the lobar vasopressor responses to perfusion with blood rendered acidic by infusions of hydrochloric lactic, and acetic acids, and by hypercapnia (membrane oxygenator) were significantly different. Although the PH of the perfusing blood in each group fell to similar extents (pH 7. 1 - 7. 0), the lobar pressor response was greatest with hydrochloric acid (HCl), smaller with lactic and acetic acids, and absent with hypercapnia. A lobar vasopressor response also occurred during lobar perfusion with blood which had been extracorporeally acidified with HCl or acetic acid, but then returned to control pH by infusions of sodium bicarbonate and Tris before reaching the lung. A lobar vasopressor response also resulted from pump perfusion of the lobar artery with femoral venous blood during perfusion of the isolated ipsilateral femoral artery with similarly treated aortic blood. However, no lobar vasopressor response resulted from pump perfusion of the lobar artery with blood removed transseptally from a right pulmonary vein during acidification (HCl) of the right pulmonary artery (to pH 7. 0) ...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{technology}} to deliver foreign gene(s) to a specific organ/tissue {{is one of the}} major challenges in gene therapy. Here, we show liver- and lobe-specific gene transfer following the continuous microinstillation of plasmid DNA (pDNA) onto the liver surface in mice. Naked pDNA was continuously instilled onto the right medial liver <b>lobe</b> using syringe <b>pump</b> in male ddY mice. Our previous studies showed liver- and lobe-selective gene expression after instillation of 30 m l of pDNA solution onto the liver surface, but gene expression was also found in the other liver lobe, kidney and spleen. To improve target site selectivity of gene expression, the instillation volume was decreased; however, non-specific gene expression in the other liver lobe and diaphragm was still detected. To prevent immediate diffusion of the pDNA solution, we performed continuous microinstillation of pDNA using a syringe pump; as a result, target site selectivity was greatly improved. As for instillation speed, 5 min infusion was enough to prevent diffusion of pDNA solution. Furthermore, transfection efficiency in the target site was maintained when instillation speed was slowed. Wiping off residual pDNA solution from the applied liver lobe resulted in a further improvement in selectivity, suggesting not only immediate diffusion, but also gradual diffusion, are important factors for successful target site-specific gene transfer. Information in this study will be useful for further development of an effective gene delivery system targeted to a specific organ/tissue by use of other non-viral or viral vectors...|$|R
