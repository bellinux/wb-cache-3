For normal emplacement, one single-axle bogie was detached from the front outrigger and one from the rear, side outriggers were then hinged from the vertical position to the ground; the total time to set up was estimated at {{two and a half}} minutes.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a dual {{articulation}} acetabular cup was developed by Prof. Bousquet in 1974. This concept {{has been shown to}} provide high stability after revision and primary total hip arthroplasty. The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of prosthetic instability in a consecutive homogeneous series of 384 primary dual mobility cups. Incidence of instability and implant survival were evaluated. Mean follow-up was 15. 3  years (range, 12 – 20). There was no early or late instability. On the acetabular side there were 13 aseptic loosenings, 14 intraprosthetic dislocations, and seven polyethylene wear cases that required <b>replacement</b> of the <b>liner.</b> The cumulative survival rate of the dual-articulation acetabular cup using surgical revision for aseptic loosening as the endpoint was 95. 9 %[*]±[*] 4. 1 % at 18  years postoperatively. Our series proves the good long term behaviour of dual-articulation acetabular components in primary arthroplasty. Their excellent survivorship rate and the absence of episodes of prosthetic instability increase our confidence in this concept...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{milk quality}} after the {{introduction}} of automatic milking systems (AM-systems) on dairy farms in The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark were examined and the data were compared with milk quality results of farms with conventional milking technology. After introduction, a small, but significant increase in total bacterial count, somatic cell count, freezing point and free fatty acids was observed. The highest levels for total plate count and cell count {{are found in the}} first six months after introduction. After this period the milk quality slightly improves to a more stable level. Risk factors related with milk quality concern general farm characteristics, animal health, AM-system, cleaning and cooling, housing, management skills of the farmer and the hygiene on the farm. Total plate count was significantly related to milk yield of the herd, cleaning of the area around the AM-system and the overall hygiene on the farm. Bulk milk somatic cell count appeared to be significantly related to milk yield of the herd and the number of milkings before <b>replacement</b> of the <b>liners.</b> An increased milking frequency is not the only explanation of increased free fatty acid levels. Technical factors related to free fatty acids mainly concerned the air inlet in the teat cups, bubbling (excessive air inlet) and a too long post run time of the milk pump. However, several questions regarding the causes of increased free fatty acid levels remained unclear...|$|R
40|$|Hip {{simulators}} {{are designed}} to reproduce the forces and motion patterns of normal walking. In vivo demands on total hip replacements, however, are varied and often more severe than normal walking conditions. It is these severe conditions that often lead to implant failure. This is clinically based research aimed at understanding {{some of the more}} severe conditions in hips and the effect that these have on the performance of the total hip <b>replacement.</b> The polyethylene <b>liner</b> can act as a pump in an acetabular component, forcing fluid and wear particles through the holes to the retroacetabular bone causing osteolysis. Ten patients were studied at revision surgery. Pressures were measured in retroacetabular osteolytic lesions while performing pumping manouvers with the hip. Two laboratory experiments were then designed to study pumping mechanisms in vitro. In patients with contained osteolytic lesions, fluid pressure fluctuations could be measured in the lesion in association with the pumping action. Patients with uncontained osteolytic lesions showed no such pressure fluctuations. In the laboratory we identified 3 distinct mechanisms whereby fluid can be pumped from the hip joint to the retroacetabular bone. These pumping effects could be mitigated by improved implant design. Loading of the femoral head against the edge of the acetabular component produces dramatically increased contact pressures particularly in hard-on-hard bearings. In an analysis of 16 retrieved ceramic-on-ceramic bearings we were able to characterise the mechanism of edge loading based on the pattern of edge loading wear on the bearing surface. Finally in a radiographic study of patients with squeaking ceramic-on-ceramic hips. Squeaking was found to be associated with acetabular component malposition. It seems that edge loading or impingement may be an associated factor in these cases...|$|R
40|$|The present work aims {{to design}} and {{analysis}} of Ball mill inlet chute along with the truck assembly for Roller press circuit UMS (Unidan Mill S) type FLS Ball mill which {{are used in the}} Cement industry for grinding clinker material. The present mill inlet chute can be used for the two compartment ball mills only in which primary and finish grinding both are takes place. It may be a closed or open circuit grinding systems. In recent days, the Ball mill grinding systems are used with the Roller press and it is developing very fastly. The primary grinding is done by the Roller press and finish grinding takes place in Ball mill. Because of this, we can increase the Ball mill capacity as well as the Cement production. Also the feed materials which are coming from roller press to the ball mill are powdery form instead of Clinker material. The feed chute for this application requires more area to direct the material and more air allowing area to achieve the required air flow inside the mill to transmit the grounded material. The <b>replacement</b> of the <b>liner</b> plates/mill components and access during maintenance is difficult in the present UMS mills since the mill inlet is fixed with the foundation. This can be avoided by implementing the new designed movable truck assembly at inlet chute.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of large Off-the-Road (OTR) tires is {{an increasingly important}} concern. These tires can weigh up to 8, 450 pounds with an overall diameter and width of approximately 140. 7 inches and 45. 1 inches respectively. OTR tires are used for mining vehicles such as haul trucks, wheel loaders, backhoes, graders, and trenchers. [1] These new tires cost between $ 38, 000 and $ 50, 000 each, depending on multiple factors including oil prices and the cyclical nature of the industry. Haul trucks contain six tires per vehicle, and mines replace these tires around every 9 - 12 months. [2] Statistics regarding discarded OTR tires are not provided by the industry as they are for other types of tires. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} approximate the number and location of waste OTR tires not only in individual states, but in the U. S. in general. [3] Currently, Minnesota and Arizona are the only states that place regulations and fees on OTR tires. However, Minnesota is the only state that actually tracks them. [3] The Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) roughly estimates that OTR tires account for 1 % of scrap tires by number and 15 % by weight. When the tires are replaced, the old tires can be discarded with the waste rock in stockpiles at the mining site but more often are landfilled without documentation by an appropriate agency due to lack of federal regulations. Their low density and hollow centers cause them to float to the top of landfills, disrupting the compactness. [4] Also, tires have a heat content 20 - 40 % greater than that of coal which can be very dangerous on the rare occasions that tires catch fire in stockpiles. [5] Furthermore, burning tires release hazardous substances including pyrolytic oil, ash, and smoke, which contain carcinogens, heavy metals, and other toxic compounds. [6] Due to the large size of OTR tires, there are few facilities that can accommodate their recycling. [3] This leads to increased costs in transporting them to such sites. Transportation costs for a tire taken out of service can be up to $ 1000. In addition to the freight costs, recycling an OTR tire can cost up to $ 1500 because of their rugged construction compared to passenger tires which cost around $ 1 to recycle. [3] In response to the waste OTR tire problem, the Ball Hogs from the University of Arkansas have designed a solution that recycles OTR tires by using old tires as liners in ball mills for hard rock mines. Ball mills are large cylindrical vessels consisting of an outer shell, an inside liner and a load of metal balls. A motor turns the ball mill using a transmission system causing the metal balls to move in a cascading motion to grind the material fed into the ball mill. Ball mills require liners that are constructed from materials such as steel or rubber. For a 30 ft long ball mill with a Task # 2 5 University of Arkansas 20 ft diameter, a hard rubber liner reinforced with steel can cost $ 150, 000. These liners are replaced at least once a year, creating a substantial upkeep cost for these ball mills. Metal mines in Bolivia are already using tractor tires to line many ball mills. This technique has been effective for over twenty years. The high import costs of new liners and the low cost of labor has led many Bolivian metal processors to use truck and tractor tires as liners in their ball mills. This construction normally occurs on site using tools like handsaws, drills, torches and knives to cut up tires and manpower to mount these tire-made liners onto mills. However, this is not always the case in the U. S. where labor costs are much higher and the mills are generally larger. Many mines in the U. S. do not have the means to fabricate and install these liners on site; therefore, a third-party solution is proposed that will take a mine’s discarded tires and make ball mill liners out of them. The Ball Hogs’ solution provides an environmentally and economically feasible process of increasing the life of OTR tires beyond their typical use. This alternative would utilize the engineering and technology that makes these tires strong enough to hold a 400 ton truck. Mining companies would save yearly an average of $ 70, 000 per ball mill <b>liner</b> <b>replacement,</b> and over 780, 000 kg of CO 2 per liner. Furthermore, mining companies would earn positive PR, goodwill, and tax breaks. We recommend all mining companies use their OTR tire treads as ball mill liners...|$|R
