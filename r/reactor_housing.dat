40|$|The {{treatment}} of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) in Sweden has changed during the past decades due to national legislation and European Union directives. The former landfills have more or less been abandoned in favour of material recycling and waste incineration. On a yearly basis approximately 2. 2 million tonnes waste are incinerated in Sweden with heat recovery {{and to some extent}} also with electricity generation, though at a low efficiency. It is desirable to alter this utilisation and instead employ MSW as fuel in a fluid bed gasification process. Then electrical energy may be produced at a much higher efficiency. However, MSW contain about 1 % chlorine in the form of ordinary table salt (NaCl) from food scraps. This implies that the tar cracking catalyst, dolomite, which is normally employed in gasification, will suffer from poisoning if applied under such conditions. Then the tar cracking capacity will be reduced or vanish completely with time. Consequently, an alternative catalyst, more resistant to chlorine, is needed. Preliminary research at KTH has indicated that iron in its metallic state may possess tar cracking ability. With this information at hand and participating in the project “Energy from Waste” an experimental campaign was launched. Numerous experiments were conducted using iron as tar cracking catalyst. First iron sinter pellets from LKAB were employed. They were reduced in situ with a stream of hydrogen before they were applied. Later iron-based granules from Höganäs AB were tested. These materials were delivered in the metallic state. In all tests the KTH atmospheric fluidised bed gasifier with a secondary catalytic <b>reactor</b> <b>housing</b> the catalytic material was deployed. Mostly, the applied fuel was birch. The results show that metallic iron possesses an intrinsic ability, almost in the range of dolomite, to crack tars. Calculations indicate that iron may be more resistant to chlorine than dolomite. The exploration of metallic iron’s excellent tar cracking capacity led to the innovative manufacture of an iron catalytic tar cracking filter as well as a general knowledge of its tar cracking capacity. This filter with dual functionality would be a general improvement of the gasification process since it among other things would make the process denser. QC 2011042...|$|E

Microbial CaCO 3 mineral {{formation}} {{and stability in}} an experimentally simulated high pressure saline aquifer with supercritical CO 2. International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, 15, 86 - 96. The use of microbiologically induced mineralization to plug pore spaces is a novel biotechnology to mitigate the potential leakage of geologically sequestered carbon dioxide from preferential leakage pathways. The bacterial hydrolysis of urea (ureolysis) which can induce calcium carbonate precipitation, via a pH increase {{and the production of}} carbonate ions, was investigated under conditions that approximate subsurface storage environments, using a unique high pressure (? 7. 5 MPa) moderate temperature (32 ?C) flow <b>reactor</b> <b>housing</b> a synthetic porous media core. The synthetic core was inoculated with the ureolytic organism Sporosarcina pasteurii and pulse-flow of a urea inclusive saline growth medium was established through the core. The system was gradually pressurized to 7. 5 MPa over the first 29 days. Concentrations of NH 4 +, a by-product of urea hydrolysis, increased in the flow reactor effluent over the first 20 days, and then stabilized at a maximum concentration consistent with the hydrolysis of all the available urea. pH increased over the first 6 days from 7 to 9. 1, consistent with buffering by NH 4 + ? NH 3 + H+. Ureolytic colony forming units were consistently detected in the reactor effluent, indicating a biofilm developed in the high pressure system and maintained viability at pressures up to 7. 5 MPa. All available calcium was precipitated as calcite. Calcite precipitates were exposed to dry supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2), water-saturated scCO 2, scCO 2 -saturated brine, and atmospheric pressure brine. Calcite precipitates were resilient to dry scCO 2, but suffered some mass loss in water-saturated scCO 2 (mass loss 17 ? 3. 6 % after 48 h, 36 ? 7. 5 % after 2 h). Observations in the presence of scCO 2 saturated brine were ambiguous due to an artifact associated with the depressurization of the scCO 2 saturated brine before sampling. The degassing of pressurized brine resulted in significant abrasion of calcite crystals and resulted in a mass loss of approximately 92 ? 50 % after 48 h. However dissolution of calcite crystals in brine at atmospheric pressure, but at the pH of the scCO 2 saturated brine, accounted for only approximately 7. 8 ? 2. 2 % of the mass loss over the 48 h period. These data suggest that microbially induced mineralization, with the purpose of reducing the permeability of preferential leakage pathways during the operation of GCS, can occur under high pressure scCO 2 injection conditions. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{generation}} of synthesis gas from methane is currently performed by conventional steam reforming or by partial oxidation (POX) in fixed-bed reactors using nickel or noble metal based catalysts at temperatures around 900 °C. In {{the last years}} several new reactor concepts were suggested to intensify the heat exchange, e. g. auto thermal reformers, catalytic coated wall reactors, fluidised bed or membrane reactors [1]. Improved POX of methane is currently the most promising direction for better {{generation of}} synthesis gas, in particular if oxygen is fed in a distributed manner separated from air using O 2 -selective mixed conducting membranes. The industrial applicability of this concept depends {{on the availability of}} suitable selective tubular membranes characterised by thin walls to intensify the mass and heat transfer. In addition to the desired slightly exothermic partial oxidation in such reactors also the highly exothermic total oxidation can take place. The related heat generation can be exploited by coupling with conventional steam reforming to realise a potential auto thermal operating mode. Based on experimental results characterising a new type of mixed conducting hollow fibre membranes (BaCoxFeyZrzO 3 -δ,BCFZ, produced by spinning) the operating behaviour of a membrane reactor integrating the process steps air separation, selective O 2 transfer in the BCFZ and oxidation of methane with simultaneous steam reforming was evaluated. The estimation and validation of mass transfer parameters for characterisation of the membrane was based on systematic experiments [2]. The derived equations describing the mass transport in the membrane as well as kinetic approaches for the rates of oxidation and steam reforming of methane coming from the literature [3, 4, 5] were implemented in a detailed two dimensional pseudo homogeneous reactor model. Comparing with predictions of a reduced 1 -D model this model was found necessary for a detailed analysis of the pronounced concentration, temperature and velocity fields. The fibre membrane is placed in the <b>reactor</b> <b>housing</b> and separates the reactor in air providing side (tube) and synthesis gas side (shell). The following arrangements of the used catalyst in the membrane reactor were investigated: a) catalyst bed, b) catalyst coated hollow fibre c) structured catalyst bed, d) hollow fibre and catalyst separated by an additionally Al 2 O 3 membrane. Depending on the catalyst arrangement the obtained hot spot can be located directly on the membrane, which leads under unfavourable operation conditions to an inactivation or melting of the hollow fibre. It will be shown, that the essential temperature effects and the performance of the investigated concept can be described only using a more detailed two dimensional reactor model.

The pyrolytic vapors produced at 450 oC were passed through zeolite catalysts maintained at 425 oC at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 12 h- 1. Five zeolites, including ZSM- 5, mordenite, ferrierite, Zeolite-Y, and Zeolite-beta (all in H form), were used to study the effect of catalyst properties such as acidity, pore size, and pore structure on catalytic cracking of pinewood pyrolysis vapors. Product bio-oils were analyzed for their chemical composition using GC-MS, water content, density, viscosity, acid value, pH, and elemental compositions. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to analyze the extent of coking on zeolite catalysts. Application of catalysis to biomass pyrolysis increased gas product yields at the expense of bio-oil yields. While all the zeolites deoxygenated the pyrolysis vapors, ZSM- 5 was found to be most effective. The ZSM- 5 catalyzed bio-oil, rich in phenolics and aromatic hydrocarbons, was less viscous, had relatively lower acid number and high pH, and possessed oxygen content nearly half that of un-catalyzed bio-oil.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} {{influence}} of H 2 O, HCl, and H 2 S on the condensation and release of zinc. The condensation behavior of the zinc vapors was investigated in a heated flow channel <b>reactor</b> <b>housed</b> in a furnace with a gas cooling zone, where eight glass filters were placed on different cooling stages. The metal species deposited in the filters were determined by means of ion chromatography (IC) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Experiments on the release of the inorganic vapors were carried out in a heated flow channel reactor coupled to a molecular beam mass spectrometer (MBMS). The experiments were carried out under two typical gasification conditions (H 2 /H 2 O/He or Ar) and atmospheric pressure with 50 and 500 ppmv of HCl and H 2 S. Hot gas analysis was done at 900, 800, 700, and 500 °C. The condensation experiments showed that zinc condensed as ZnO, ZnCl 2, and ZnS under the conditions considered. The species detected in the gas phase were Zn, ZnO, ZnCl 2, and ZnS. The experimental results were compared with Scheil–Gulliver cooling calculations carried out with FactSage 6. 3 software. This model was proven to be an excellent tool for the prediction of the behavior of zinc under gasification conditions. Furthermore, the global kinetics of the condensation experiments was clarified with the thermodynamic pseudoequilibrium model recently developed by researchers of Chubu University (Japan). With this work, not only a good understanding of the behavior of the zinc under gasification conditions was obtained, but also the finding and evidence of a powerful tool for predicting fast and easily the behavior of trace metals under gasification conditions...|$|R
