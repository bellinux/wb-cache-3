5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with {{another aspect of}} general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, {{it turns out to}} be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police districts {{see it as a}} waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer (2000), on {{the other}} hand, reacts against this {{commonly}} held view and comments {{that the vast majority}} of the runestones were raised in memory of people who are not reported to have died abroad. She argues that few men who went abroad were honoured with memorials and the <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> runestones were mainly raised because of concerns at home, such as inheritance issues. Such concerns would have arisen when a family knew that a relative would not return from abroad.|$|E
25|$|A second <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French {{government}} {{wanted to}} limit {{the use of the}} kepi to military and paramilitary units only.|$|R
30|$|We don’t want {{to share}} <b>the</b> data, <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> test {{material}} used Ganken 5 is an undisclosed hulless barley variety.|$|R
50|$|Another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Jospin {{government}} {{took advantage of}} the changes introduced with the 35-hour working week to relax other workforce legislation.|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{reasons why the}} Cynics are so named. First because of the {{indifference}} of their way of life, for they make a cult of indifference and, like dogs, eat and make love in public, go barefoot, and sleep in tubs and at crossroads. The second <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dog is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to it. The third <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them.|$|E
25|$|After {{his release}} from questioning, Raja Petra gave his reason on why Muhammad Taib made a police report against him, stating the <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} wished to silence the nations bloggers before the Malaysian general election.|$|E
25|$|The {{turnout was}} {{relatively}} low according to Al Jazeera, one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Egyptians <b>were</b> not given {{a day off}} as they were given on 28–29 November.|$|R
5|$|Ministers in the Madras {{government}} and ruling party members supported the strike. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire and killed {{six of the}} workers on the spot. Top Justice Party leaders like O. Thanikachalam Chetti severely censured the police for the measures they adopted. <b>The</b> main <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police <b>was</b> {{under the control of}} the governor and the government was looking for an opportunity to harass the executive. Another probable <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> striking workers had the caste sympathies of the Justice Party government whose ministers and chief whips were caste Hindus like themselves.|$|R
50|$|He made a {{professional}} debut in 1806 and {{was promoted to}} the top makuuchi division in 1810. In April 1814, he was ranked at maegashira 1, but in the very next November 1814 tournament, he was ranked at ōzeki. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> banzuke (the sumo wrestlers' hierarchy) <b>was</b> changed to <b>that</b> based on real ability.|$|R
25|$|Levites, {{including}} Kohanim, do not redeem {{their children}} through the Pidyon HaBen ceremony. The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Levites, as substitutes for the first-born, are pledged to minister and assist the kohanim in Divine service, and cannot be redeemed from this service obligation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> phrase {{well-defined}} is {{not very}} well-defined. It was important to free set theory of these paradoxes because nearly all of mathematics was being redefined in terms of set theory. In an attempt to avoid these paradoxes, set theory was axiomatized based on first-order logic, and thus axiomatic set theory was born.|$|E
25|$|The {{most obvious}} <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> list of simple groups is quite complicated: with 26 {{sporadic}} groups there {{are likely to}} be many special cases that have to be considered in any proof. So far no one has yet found a clean uniform description of the finite simple groups similar to the parameterization of the compact Lie groups by Dynkin diagrams.|$|E
50|$|A third <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{collaboration}} with <b>the</b> supplier meant <b>that</b> supplier's expertise {{about the market}} could be drawn upon, and also that {{a considerable amount of}} workload in developing the category could be delegated to the supplier.|$|R
50|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Peterborough United on a two-year contract on 6 April 2010.With the club lying outside the playoff positions, Johnson left Peterborough on 10 January 2011. <b>The</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> manager {{and the chairman}} could not agree future policy.|$|R
30|$|The mad {{system of}} its {{ideology}} swept its followers into Nazism. It became a key {{source of the}} regime’s appeal, converting people into faithful Nazis. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> madness of the ideology resonated with a momentous distortion {{in the minds of}} those faithful.|$|R
25|$|When {{the land}} needs a {{subsurface}} drainage system, but saline groundwater is present at great depth, {{it is better}} to employ a shallow, closely spaced system of pipes or ditches instead of a deep, widely spaced system. The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deeper systems produce a more salty effluent than the shallow systems. Environmental criteria may then prohibit the use of the deeper systems.|$|E
25|$|In other dimensions, the {{constant}} B changes, {{but the same}} constant appears both in the t flow and in the coupling flow. The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> derivative with respect to t of the closed loop with a single vertex is a closed loop with two vertices. This means that {{the only difference between}} the scaling of the coupling and the t is the combinatorial factors from joining and splitting.|$|E
25|$|Gaspra's surface lacks {{unambiguous}} craters {{of a size}} {{comparable to}} its radius, like those seen for example on 253 Mathilde. A probable <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> collision that produced the Flora family and Gaspra was relatively recent on an astronomical timescale, so that Gaspra has not yet {{had the opportunity to}} acquire many large craters since. Analysis of cratering rates suggests the age of the surface is between about 20 to 300 million years.|$|E
30|$|It should <b>be</b> noted here <b>that</b> <b>the</b> TPH <b>is</b> {{lower than}} <b>the</b> SWL. <b>The</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> head loss <b>is</b> very small {{as shown in}} Fig.  3 {{and the effect of}} the {{drawdown}} of water during pumping which decreases with head increase. In addition to <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> water <b>is</b> not replenished.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> third <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> at <b>the</b> time <b>that</b> Turkic Muslims <b>were</b> waging ...|$|R
2500|$|One of Todurov’s <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{procurement}} {{of medical}} supplies through international intermediaries became the outdated practice. During three years upon Maidan, {{it was developed}} the Prozorro electronic procurement system. It gives the public much more transparency, does not have many months of delays, and does not cost any service commission ...|$|R
25|$|One-third of the prefecture's {{population}} {{is concentrated in}} the Izumo-Matsue area. Otherwise, over two-thirds of the {{population is}} on the coastline. The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chugoku mountains make the land inland harder to inhabit. The capital, Matsue, has the smallest population out of all the 47 prefectural capitals. Shimane has also the largest percentage of the elderly. The province had an estimated 743 centenarians per million inhabitants in September 2010, the highest ratio in Japan, overtaking Okinawa Prefecture (667 centenarians per million).|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} contribution to the decline of Swedish speakers in Finland {{during the second half}} of the 20th century was that many Swedish speakers emigrated to Sweden. An estimated 30% – 50% of all Finnish citizens who moved to Sweden were Swedish-speaking Finns. Reliable statistics are not available, as the Swedish authorities, as opposed to their Finnish counterpart, do not register languages. Another <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> natural increase of the Finnish-speakers has been somewhat faster than that of the Swedish-speakers until recent times, when the trend has reversed.|$|E
25|$|Fingerprint {{processing}} {{has three}} primary functions: enrollment, searching and verification. Among these functions, enrollment which captures fingerprint {{image from the}} sensor plays an important role. A <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> way people put their fingerprints on a mirror to scan can affect to the result in the searching and verifying process. Regarding to verification function, there are several techniques to match fingerprints such as correlation-based matching, minutiae-based matching, ridge feature-based matching and minutiae-based algorithm. However, the most popular algorithm was minutiae based matching algorithm due to its efficiency and accuracy.|$|E
50|$|In 1906, the ACP {{gave the}} job of organising brevet rides - so called after the card, or brevet, that riders had signed along the route to show they had ridden the {{distance}} - to Desgrange. There came a row, however, that led Desgrange {{to take over the}} Audax movement for himself. <b>The</b> first <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ACP ran an event called the Polymultipliée de Chanteloup, one of several competitions popular at the time to show whether a derailleur gear, then not in wide use, or a single gear was superior over a range of courses. The ACP formed a partnership for its competition with LEcho des Sports, a rival to Desgranges LAuto. <b>The</b> second <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> road captains <b>were</b> accused of no longer respecting the 18 km/h average demanded by the rules.|$|R
50|$|He {{was never}} {{selected}} for the German national football team, one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> outstanding Franz Beckenbauer fulfilled the role of libero there at the time. Johan Cruijff asked him {{to play for the}} Netherlands in the 1974 World Cup but Blankenburg refused, he was still hoping for his homeland selection.|$|R
50|$|By 1980, Group Lotus was {{in serious}} {{financial}} trouble. Production had dropped from 1,200 units {{per year to}} a mere 383. <b>The</b> combined <b>reasons</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world <b>was</b> {{in the middle of}} an economic recession, sales in the key United States market had virtually collapsed and there had been limited development of the then model range.|$|R
25|$|At low momenta (infrared limit) the {{question}} has been more involved to settle. The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> theory becomes strongly coupled {{in this case and}} perturbation theory cannot be applied. The only reliable approach to get an answer is performing lattice computation on a computer powerful enough to afford large volumes. An answer to this question is a fundamental one as it would provide an understanding to the problem of confinement. On the other side, it should not be forgotten that propagators are gauge-dependent quantities and so, they must be managed carefully when one wants to get meaningful physical results.|$|E
25|$|Some {{textbooks}} mistakenly {{state that}} {{the speed of sound}} increases with increasing density. This is usually illustrated by presenting data for three materials, such as air, water and steel, which also have vastly different levels compressibilities which more than make up for the density differences. An illustrative example of the two effects is that sound travels only 4.3 times faster in water than air, despite enormous differences in compressibility of the two media. The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> larger density of water, which works to slow sound in water relative to air, nearly makes up for the compressibility differences in the two media.|$|E
25|$|The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{logarithm}} of {{the stock}} price is undergoing a random walk, so over time its probability distribution will {{get more and more}} broad and smooth (see above). (More technically, the central limit theorem says that multiplying more and more random variables will create a log-normal distribution with larger and larger variance, so eventually it covers many orders of magnitude almost uniformly.) To be sure of approximate agreement with Benford's Law, the distribution has to be approximately invariant when scaled up by any factor up to 10; a lognormally distributed data set with wide dispersion would have has this approximate property.|$|E
50|$|For example, Philando Castile had 52 police {{stops in}} 14 {{years prior to}} the last fatal stop. Half his charges were dismissed, and none of his {{convictions}} were for dangerous offences. The pretext for the fatal stop was a broken tail light, but <b>the</b> real <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police officer thought Castile resembled a robbery suspect.|$|R
40|$|Other {{states have}} elected not {{to adopt the}} 75 Blow Marshall Mix Design for their heavy traffic roads. Their <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 75 blow design cracks the larger aggregates. Therefore, a limited study was done during December, 1985, to try to {{determine}} what amount of cracking took place, and in what condition the cracks are in the mix...|$|R
50|$|Devrim {{was never}} mass-produced. One <b>reason</b> for <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> cars were crafted prototypes and the {{production}} process was not well-documented, with almost no technical drawings remaining from the production phase. Another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> demand <b>was</b> not high enough to make mass production feasible. Conversely Anadol factory has been founded {{just a few years}} after (1966) and started serial production of passenger vehicles. The founder of Anadol automobile factory Vehbi Koç was a Ford dealer and before the Devrim project, he did not believe <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> possible to produce cars in Turkey.|$|R
