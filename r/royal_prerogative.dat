5|$|A {{judgment}} {{delivered in}} the Court of Appeal in 1988 (ex parte Everett), and re-stated in a ruling of the High Court delivered in July 2016, confirmed that granting or withdrawing British passports {{has always been an}} exercise of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogative,</b> and continues to be exercisable in the Secretary of State's discretion.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Ferens {{attempted}} to intervene on behalf William George Smith, a ship's painter {{who had been}} sentenced to death for murder at York Assizes. A telegram addressed to the King was sent {{in the early hours}} of 9 December appealing for the exercise of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogative.</b> But the appeal was unsuccessful and Smith was executed at Hull Gaol later that morning.|$|E
50|$|When the {{successor}} to the throne reaches age 21, or when the King resumes the exercise of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogatives,</b> notice must be given by Proclamation. However, when the King regains the ability to exercise the <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogatives,</b> notice is given to that effect by resolution of Parliament.|$|R

5|$|The Civil Service is {{formally}} {{governed by}} Privy Council Orders, {{as an exercise}} of the <b>Royal</b> <b>prerogative.</b> One such order implemented HM Government's ban of GCHQ staff from joining a Trade Union. Another, the Civil Service (Amendment) Order in Council 1997, permitted the Prime Minister to grant up to three political advisers management authority over some Civil Servants.|$|E
5|$|Today the <b>royal</b> <b>prerogative</b> is {{available}} in the conduct of the government of the United Kingdom, including foreign affairs, defence, and national security. The monarchy has a significant constitutional presence in these and other matters, but limited power, because the exercise of the prerogative {{is in the hands of}} the prime minister and other ministers or other government officials.|$|E
5|$|In early 1926, {{the general}} was again named Premier, and {{approached}} the PNR and its close ally, the Peasants' Party, proposing a merger around his leadership. This met with a stiff refusal, as {{it seemed that the}} two were about to win the elections with additional support, but the king, suspicious of the left-wing credentials of the Peasants' Party, used his <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogative</b> and nominated Averescu as premier (with PNL support).|$|E
5000|$|Under the Constitution, the King, in {{exercise}} of his <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogatives</b> (and as Head of State), promotes goodwill and {{good relations with}} other countries by receiving state guests and undertaking state visits to other countries. The King may also award titles, decorations, dar for Lhengye and Nyi-Kyelma (conferring a red scarf of rank and honour with the title of [...] "Dasho") in accordance with tradition and custom.Also among the <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogatives</b> are the grants of citizenship, amnesty, pardon and reduction of sentences; and land [...] "kidu" [...] and other [...] "kidus" [...] (benefits).|$|R
50|$|The Constitution {{provides}} substantive {{and procedural}} law for two paths of abdication for reigning monarchs: voluntary and involuntary. As stated above, the King may relinquish {{the exercise of}} <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogatives,</b> and such relinquishment may be temporary.|$|R
50|$|An oligarch or provincial lord (tartományúr; {{formerly}} the term petty king was also used) {{was a powerful}} lord who administered huge contiguous territories through usurping <b>royal</b> <b>prerogatives</b> in the Kingdom of Hungary in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.|$|R
5|$|In the end {{the fines}} were never paid, and the lands were soon restored. Edward had {{nevertheless}} demonstrated an important point. After the conquest of Wales, the strategic position of the Marcher lordships was less vital to the English crown, and the liberty awarded to the Marcher lords could be curtailed. For Edward this was therefore {{a good opportunity to}} assert the <b>royal</b> <b>prerogative,</b> and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{point of}} the Dictum was the {{re-establishment}} of royal authority. The Provisions of Oxford, that had been forced on the king, were repudiated, and it was {{made clear that the}} appointment of ministers was entirely a <b>royal</b> <b>prerogative.</b> King Henry in turn reconfirmed Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest. Measures were taken to renounce the increasing veneration of the fallen Simon de Montfort, whom some were already starting to consider a martyr and a possible saint.|$|E
5|$|In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the <b>royal</b> <b>prerogative</b> of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St. John's, Newfoundland, as {{the first}} North American English colony. French {{explorer}} Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana. The Beaver Wars {{broke out in the}} mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many of the}} Sovereign's {{prerogative}} {{powers are}} still legally intact, constitutional conventions have removed the monarch from day-to-day governance, with ministers exercising the <b>royal</b> <b>prerogatives,</b> leaving the monarch in practice with three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise, and to warn.|$|R

5|$|In {{political}} terms, {{the practical}} benefits were minimal, the dangers considerable. Less than 2% of Scots were professed Catholics {{who already had}} considerable freedom to practice in private, a point made by James himself. The opening of Catholic chapels in Edinburgh allowing public celebration of the Mass led to riots and made private worship more difficult. Attempts to build support by expanding the measures benefitted dissident Presbyterians while undermining his Episcopalian base. When James failed to get Parliament's approval, he confirmed popular prejudice linking Catholicism and arbitrary rule by using the <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogative</b> to promote Catholics to key government positions.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII ruled as king for {{slightly}} less than a decade. The Bourbon Restoration regime was a constitutional monarchy (unlike the ancien régime, which was absolutist). As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's <b>royal</b> <b>prerogative</b> was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. Louis had no children; therefore, upon his death, the crown passed to his brother, Charles, Count of Artois. Louis XVIII was the last French monarch to die while reigning, as his successor Charles X (1824–1830) abdicated and both Louis Philippe I (1830–1848) and Napoléon III (1852–1870) were deposed.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{had been}} limited {{to a maximum of}} seven years under the Septennial Act 1716, but the Parliament Act 1911 amended the Septennial Act to limit Parliament to five years, {{beginning}} the first meeting of Parliament after the election. In practice, no election was absolutely forced by that limitation; until the Septennial Act was repealed by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, all parliaments were dissolved by the Monarch under the <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogative</b> on request of the Prime Minister. It should be noted, however, that the five-year maximum duration in the amended Septennial Act referred to the lifetime of the Parliament, and not to the interval between general elections. For example, the 2010 general election was held five years and one day after the 2005 general election, whilst the 1992 general election was held on 9 April 1992 and the next general election was not held until 1 May 1997. The reduction in Parliament length was seen as a counterbalance to the new powers granted to the Commons. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, in contrast, calls for general elections every five years (unless called sooner, as in 2017), and provides for dissolution of Parliament only by operation of law prior to each election; it abolished dissolution under the <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogative.</b>|$|E

50|$|A crowned {{republic}} {{is a form}} of Parliamentary Democracy {{where the}} monarch's role is predominantly ceremonial in practice, and where all of the monarch's <b>royal</b> <b>prerogatives</b> are prescribed by custom and law {{in such a way that}} the monarch has limited discretion over governmental and constitutional affairs.|$|R
5000|$|As in France, so in Germany: {{the impetus}} for encastellation was provided, not by a strong monarch, but by the {{weakening}} of royal authority. During the eleventh-century Investiture Controversy in Germany and the resulting decline of the royal power, castle-building exploded as local warlords staked claims to formerly <b>royal</b> <b>prerogatives</b> in their petty states.|$|R
5|$|Prerogative {{powers were}} {{formerly}} exercised by the monarch acting {{on his or}} her own initiative. Since the 19th century, by convention, the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet—who are then accountable to Parliament for the decision—has been required in order for the prerogative to be exercised. The monarch remains constitutionally empowered to exercise the <b>royal</b> <b>prerogative</b> against the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet, but in practice would only do so in emergencies or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question.|$|E
5|$|R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex p Bancoult (No 2) {{was a case}} in the House of Lords {{concerning}} {{the removal of the}} Chagos Islanders and the exercise of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogative.</b> The Chagos Islands, acquired by the United Kingdom in 1814, were reorganised as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) in 1965 for the purpose of removing its inhabitants. Under a 1971 Order in Council, the Chagossians were forcibly removed, and the central island of Diego Garcia leased to the United States for use as a military outpost.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was said}} to have been tall, good-looking and intelligent. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought {{to bring an end to}} the Hundred Years' War that Edward III had started. He was a firm believer in the <b>royal</b> <b>prerogative,</b> which led him to {{restrain}} the power of the aristocracy, and to rely on a private retinue for military protection instead; in contrast to the fraternal, martial court of his grandfather, he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.|$|E
25|$|In 1610 {{the fourth}} session of James's first {{parliament}} met. Despite Bacon's advice to him, James and the Commons found themselves at odds over <b>royal</b> <b>prerogatives</b> and the king's embarrassing extravagance. The House was finally dissolved in February 1611. Throughout this period Bacon {{managed to stay}} in the favour of the king while retaining the confidence of the Commons.|$|R
50|$|Even {{during the}} long {{personal}} union of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary, the Habsburg Emperor had to be crowned King of Hungary in order to promulgate laws there or exercise his <b>royal</b> <b>prerogatives.</b> The only Habsburg who reigned without being crowned in Hungary was Joseph II, who was called kalapos király in Hungarian ("the hatted king").|$|R
50|$|However, {{the monarch}} does retain some <b>royal</b> <b>prerogatives.</b> He may issue pardons for prisoners (Article 20) {{and engage in}} war (Article 26), {{although}} {{it is unlikely that}} any of these two prerogatives would be put into use today. However, during the German occupation, Haakon VII said he would abdicate rather than appoint a collaborationist government led by Vidkun Quisling.|$|R
5|$|The Privy Council {{formally}} {{advises the}} sovereign on {{the exercise of}} the <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogative,</b> and corporately (as Queen-in-Council) it issues executive instruments known as Orders in Council, which among other powers enact Acts of Parliament. The Council also holds the delegated authority to issue Orders of Council, mostly used to regulate certain public institutions. The Council advises the sovereign on the issuing of Royal Charters, which are used to grant special status to incorporated bodies, and city or borough status to local authorities. Otherwise, the Privy Council's powers have now been largely replaced by the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Royal</b> <b>Prerogative</b> {{includes}} the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers, regulate the civil service, issue passports, declare war, make peace, direct {{the actions of}} the military, and negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The monarch is commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces (the Royal Navy, the British Army, and the Royal Air Force), accredits British High Commissioners and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between king and magnates {{was caused by}} dissatisfaction with the influence of foreigners at court, and Henry's high level of taxation. In 1258 Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford, that essentially left royal government {{in the hands of}} a council of magnates, but this document went through a long series of revocations and reinstatements. In 1263, as the country was on the brink of civil war, the two parties agreed to submit the matter to arbitration by the French king. Louis was a firm believer in the <b>royal</b> <b>prerogative,</b> and decided clearly in favour of Henry.|$|E
