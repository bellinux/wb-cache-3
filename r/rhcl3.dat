[...] The sodium salt is converted to H3RhCl6 by ion exchange chromatography. [...] Recrystallization of this acidic salt from water affords the hydrated trichloride, sometimes called [...] "soluble rhodium trichloride." [...] Anhydrous <b>RhCl3</b> is prepared by reaction of chlorine with rhodium sponge metal at 200–300°C. Above 800°C, the anhydrous chloride reverts to Rh metal and chlorine.|$|E

5000|$|For many salts, {{the exact}} bonding {{of the water}} is {{unimportant}} because the water molecules are labilized upon dissolution. For example, an aqueous solution prepared from CuSO4•5H2O and anhydrous CuSO4 behave identically. Therefore, knowledge {{of the degree of}} hydration is important only for determining the equivalent weight: one mole of CuSO4•5H2O weighs more than one mole of CuSO4. In some cases, the degree of hydration can be critical to the resulting chemical properties. For example, anhydrous <b>RhCl3</b> is not soluble in water and is relatively useless in organometallic chemistry whereas RhCl3•3H2O is versatile. Similarly, hydrated AlCl3 is a poor Lewis acid and thus inactive as a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts reactions. Samples of AlCl3 must therefore be protected from atmospheric moisture to preclude the formation of hydrates.Crystals of hydrated copper(II) sulfate consist of Cu(H2O)42+ centers linked to SO42− ions. Copper is surrounded by six oxygen atoms, provided by two different sulfate groups and four molecules of water. A fifth water resides elsewhere in the framework but does not bind directly to copper. [...] The cobalt chloride mentioned above occurs as Co(H2O)62+ and Cl−. In tin chloride, each Sn(II) center is pyramidal (mean O/Cl-Sn-O/Cl angle is 83°) being bound to two chloride ions and one water. The second water in the formula unit is hydrogen-bonded to the chloride and to the coordinated water molecule. Water of crystallization is stabilized by electrostatic attractions, consequently hydrates are common for salts that contain +2 and +3 cations as well as −2 anions. In some cases, the majority of the weight of a compound arises from water. Glauber's salt, Na2SO4(H2O)10, is a white crystalline solid with greater than 50% water by weight.|$|E
40|$|A new {{route for}} the {{indirect}} conversion of methane that {{makes use of}} the latest advance in methyl chloride production is reported. Acetic acid was produced from the carbonylation of methyl chloride by carbon monoxide over a variety of catalysts. The presence of promoters was crucial for the carbonylation reaction. The yield of acetic acid reached 84. 7 % with <b>RhCl(3)</b> as catalyst and PPh(3) /KI as promoters. The effects of reaction temperature, carbon monoxide pressure, and reaction time were investigated. The possible reaction mechanism was discussed...|$|E
40|$|Direct metalation of C 2 -protected diimidozolium salts with <b>RhCl₃</b> or [RhCl(cod) ]₂ and KI afforded {{a series}} of new rhodium(III) {{complexes}} with abnormally C 4 -bound, cis -chelating NHC ligands. The complexes were isolated as dimetallic species containing two (μ²-I) ₃-bridged rhodium(III) centers. In the presence of coordinating ligands such as CH₃CN, PPh₃, or dppe, the dimeric structure is readily cleaved and yields monometallic complexes. Crystallographic analysis of representative structures indicates a higher trans influence of abnormally C 4 -bound carbenes as compared to normal NHCs. The exceptionally strong donor ability of carbenes in such a C 4 coordination mode increases the catalytic activity of the rhodium center and allows for efficient transfer hydrogenation of ketones in i PrOH/KOH...|$|E
40|$|The {{two-phase}} rhodium-tri(m-sulfonatophenyl) phosphine (Rh-TPPTS) {{system for}} the hydroformylation of 1 -octene, 1 -decene, and 1 -dodecene to the corresponding aldehydes, has been investigated. Due to the two distinct phases - the catalytic species in the aqueous phase and the products and reactants in the organic phase - {{the separation of the}} catalyst was easily facilitated. A comparison was made of the activity, selectivity towards linear aldehydes, and catalyst lifetime of two systems where i) the active catalytic species were generated in situ from rhodium trichloride (<b>RhCl₃.</b> 3 H₂O) and excess phosphine ligand (TPPTS) under mild hydroformylation conditions (5 MPa H₂/CO (1 : 1); 100 °C); and ii) where the rhodium(I) complex, RhH(CO) (TPPTS) ₃ is used as the catalyst precursor. The former system was found to be superior in activity and selectivity to that of the latter, achieving fairly high conversions of ca. 60 % for the hydroformylation of 1 -octene, with n:iso ratios of up to 16 : 1 for a catalyst composition a Rh:P ratio of 1 : 30. Unfortunately low conversions of ca. 10 % for the hydroformylation of 1 -decene and ca. 4 % for that of 1 -dodecene resulted under the same conditions. While the reasons for the drastic decrease in conversion for C₁₀ and C₁₂ alkenes is not completely clear, this poor conversion is attributed to the extremely low solubility of the long-chain 1 -alkenes in the aqueous phase. Under certain optimum conditions (Rh:P ≥ l : 20), virtually no leeching of rhodium into the organic phase was detected. A ³¹P NMR spectroscopic study was undertaken in an attempt to ascertain the nature and distribution of rhodium tertiary-phosphine complexes in the aqueous phase before and after the mixture was subjected to standard hydroformylation conditions...|$|E
