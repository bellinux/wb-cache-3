Time constants were derived for {{the slopes of}} the inner ear pressure recovery curves after middle ear pressure change. A "single exponential" function did not fit well and therefore more complicated functions were used for this purpose. For middle ear pressure increasing from <b>zero</b> <b>to</b> a few centimetres of water, <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> again, decreasing from <b>zero</b> <b>to</b> minus a few centimetres of water and then <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> again, time constants for the inner car pressure recovery curves were on average 15. 0, 8. 6, 2. 5 and 2. 5 s, respectively. The results could not be described using a linear model with constant window membrane compliance and cochlear aqueduct flow resistance. A possible explanation for the large difference in time constants for positive or negative middle ear pressure changes is a dependence on aqueduct flow resistance or round window membrane position...|$|R

5000|$|Matt Roush of TV Guide called <b>Return</b> <b>to</b> <b>Zero,</b> [...] "A delicately etched and intimately {{powerful}} {{portrait of}} grief and bitter loss. <b>Return</b> <b>to</b> <b>Zero</b> stars a fearless Minnie Driver and the ever-affable Paul Adelstein as a couple rocked to their emotional core {{by the loss of}} their unborn child, discovered to have died in the womb shortly before the delivery date. We follow them through the wrenching procedure and recovery process with a stark realism in which husband and wife are often seen at their worst, as their once-solid relationship frays when Maggie plummets into depression and neither seem able to say or do the right things to be able to heal and move on. Though sometimes hard to watch, Zero is a compelling and beautifully acted character study that will make you care as it dramatizes a domestic tragedy with a minimum of melodrama, so rare for TV and TV-movies." ...|$|E
