50|$|In the factory, car {{bodies are}} {{protected}} with special chemical formulations, typically phosphate conversion coatings. Some firms galvanize part {{or all of}} their car bodies before the primer coat of paint is applied. If a car is body-on-frame, then the frame (chassis) and its attachments must also be <b>rustproofed.</b> Paint is the final part of the rustproofing barrier between the body shell (apart from on the underside) and the atmosphere. On the underside, an underseal rubberized or PVC-based coating is sprayed on. These products will be breached eventually {{and can lead to}} unseen corrosion that spreads underneath the underseal. Old 1960s and 1970s rubberized underseal can become brittle on older cars and is particularly liable to this.|$|R
25|$|Materials : Early {{windlasses}} were individually hand forged from {{a single}} piece of wrought iron by a blacksmith. More modern techniques include casting of iron or bronze, drop forging and (the most common technique) welding. Some boatmen had their windlasses 'silvered' (or chrome plated) for increased comfort and to prevent rusting. Windlasses are now only rarely plated, but a popular modern choice of metal is aluminium, whose smooth and <b>rustproof</b> surface has the same advantages of longevity and blister-reduction, and is also very light. One type of these, the Dunton Double, has only a single eye, but by clever tapering it will operate either size of spindle.|$|E

50|$|Blocking {{can be done}} {{in several}} {{different}} ways. Depending on the method, the crafter may use <b>rustproof</b> pins, blocking wires, a steamer, or a steam iron.

Cold blocking uses no heat and less water to achieve the same result by spraying water upon the material instead of immersing the fabric. Steam blocking uses a steamer or steam iron, but without applying direct pressure to the item.|$|E

50|$|Using {{weathering}} steel in construction presents several challenges. Ensuring that weld-points weather {{at the same}} rate as the other materials may require special welding techniques or material. Weathering steel is not <b>rustproof</b> in itself. If water is allowed to accumulate in pockets, those areas will experience higher corrosion rates, so provision for drainage must be made. Weathering steel is sensitive to humid subtropical climates. In such environments, it is possible that the protective patina may not stabilize but instead continue to corrode. For example, the former Omni Coliseum, built in 1972 in Atlanta, never stopped rusting, and eventually large holes appeared in the structure. This was a major factor in the decision to demolish it just 25 years after construction. The same thing can happen in environments laden with sea salt. Hawaii's Aloha Stadium, built in 1975, is one example of this. Weathering steel's normal surface weathering can also lead to rust stains on nearby surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{companies}} now offer hand-painted finishes for metalwork, {{as well as}} a more permanent look that can be achieved with powder-coated finishes. For {{the low end of the}} market, imitation panels are pressed from plastic or aluminum. Tin is now fashionably used for art work, back splashes, cabinet faces, wainscoting and much more. For over 100 years the tin panel was made with nail rails around the outside of the panel, designed to overlap each other. Panels were nailed into wood furring strips which were prevalent prior to the invention of plywood. Today, nail up panels can be easily brad nailed or hand nailed, into plywood without the need for the original 1 x 2 in furring strips. There is also a patented interlocking tin panel that will screw directly into existing drywall/popcorn/plaster ceilings, without the need for extensive plywood installation. Tin panels today are made in 24 x 24 in and 24 x 48 in sizes for easier handling and one-person installation. Today, most tin ceiling manufacturers actually use recycled blackplate steel in a thickness of only [...]010 or 1/100th of an inch. There are some manufacturers who also use actual tin plated steel, which is simply the blackplate steel with a thin coating of bright tin plate adhered to the base metal. Other manufacturers utilize aluminum, as it is <b>rustproof</b> and will last a lifetime.|$|E
50|$|As {{the roof}} was completed, the {{reflecting}} pool was constructed on top of it. The landscape architects Clarke and Rapuano designed the 22 in deep, 80 by 300 ft pool. The pool walls were 4 ft thick at the base, and tapered as they rose. A sheet of monel (a <b>rustproof</b> nickel alloy metal) was embedded in the wall, rising to within 5 in {{of the top of}} the wall. The entire wall was coated in epoxy as a waterproofer. Nine 118.5 ft steel girders acted both to support the pool above and the ceiling of the main exhibition hall below. These steel girders were nearly 8 ft below ground to accommodate the pool's construction. On top of the girders were double-tongued, prestressed, precast concrete T-beams. The tongue of each T-beam was 3 in thick, and the height of the T-beam 19 in. A 2 in thick layer of concrete was laid atop the T-beams, forming the floor of the pool. Five layers of roofing felt were laid atop the concrete floor, followed by a 6 in layer of perlite. A grid of concrete beams, each 6 by 13 in and over 30 ft long, was laid in the perlite to support the layers above. Inverted U-shaped drainage tiles were inserted between the beams to help remove any water which leaked from above. A 0.006 in thick sheet of polyethylene formed a moisture barrier above the perlite, and 6 in thick layer of concrete laid atop the moisture barrier. The bottom of the pool consisted of another five layers of roofing felt, on top of which were laid a 1.5 in thick layer of gravel. The gravel-impregnated grout was laid down in alternating grey and white sections (each section separated by a brass rail), to add visual distinctiveness {{to the bottom of the}} pool. The granite for the lip of the pool was imported from West Germany. The granite, which was shaped to wrap around the exterior, top, and interior of the lip, was about 2 in thick.

The size and shape of the cages are very important for the growth and production of the fishes/ shell fishes living inside it. The design will vary depending on the selected site. The constructed cage must withstand the force of wind and wave while holding the stock safely. The cage must be safe, secure and easy to manage. Circular cage bags make the most efficient use of materials, and thus have the lowest costs per unit volume. Shape is likely to influence effective stocking densities and swimming behaviour, which in turn can influence production. Fish cages can be constructed from a variety of materials.
