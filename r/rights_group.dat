5|$|Argentina was {{the first}} Latin American country with a gay <b>rights</b> <b>group,</b> Nuestro Mundo (NM, or Our World), created in 1969. Six mostly secret {{organizations}} concentrating on gay or lesbian issues were founded around this time, but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the Dirty War. Lesbian rights groups have gradually formed since 1986 to build a cohesive community that works to overcome philosophical differences with heterosexual women.|$|E

The pro-coursing campaign, Stop2110 says that open field coursing is legal in all US states with a huntable population of jackrabbits. Washington state lists jackrabbits as a protected species, due to an unusually low population for a western state, and bans all forms of hunting them.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Soviet government's efforts, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people {{rallied to}} commemorate the victims of Soviet deportations. This event, {{organized}} by the human <b>rights</b> <b>group</b> Helsinki-86, {{was the first time}} after the Soviet occupation that the flower-laying ceremony took place, as the practice was banned by the Soviet authorities. In response the Soviet government organized a bicycle race at the monument at the time when the ceremony was planned to take place. Helsinki-86 organized another flower-laying ceremony on August 23 in the same year {{to commemorate the}} anniversary of the Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact, at which the crowd was dispersed using jets of water. Yet the independence movement grew in size, amounting in some events to {{more than half a million}} participants (about one quarter of Latvia's population) and three years later, on May 4, 1990, the re-establishment of the independence of Latvia was declared.|$|E

5|$|On January 31, 2004, a victim's <b>rights</b> <b>group,</b> the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed {{a lawsuit}} in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, against several U.S. {{companies}} for liability in causing personal injury, by developing, and producing the chemical, and claimed {{that the use of}} Agent Orange violated the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, 1925 Geneva Protocol, and the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military, and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Eastern District â€“ who had presided over the 1984 U.S. veterans class-action lawsuit â€“ dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs' claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under international law {{at the time of its}} use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government. Weinstein used the British example to help dismiss the claims of people exposed to Agent Orange in their suit against the chemical companies that had supplied it.|$|E

5|$|With {{the ending}} of the oppressive State Security Law period in 2000, Rajab was able to begin working openly in the field of Human rights as {{one of the founders of}} the Bahrain Human Rights Society, one of the first human rights {{organizations}} in Bahrain. He subsequently fell out with some of the other founders. In 2002, following wide ranging political reforms by the Bahraini government which allowed independent human rights groups to operate, Rajab worked with Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and others to found the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), a nonprofit non-governmental organization which works to promote human rights in Bahrain. Rajab was Training Program Officer and Senior Researcher at BCHR. He later became Vice President and Head of International Relations until he later took over from Abdulhadi Alkhawaja as BCHR president, a position he still held as of August 2012. In 2011 he along with other found the Gulf Center for Human Rights. Rajab became the president of the newly found <b>rights</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, Nesbitt {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the American talent agency United Talent Agency, as the global financial crisis was restricting roles in British television. He continued to be represented in the United Kingdom by Artists <b>Rights</b> <b>Group.</b> The next year Nesbitt played the hunter Cathal in the low-budget British horror film Outcast, which was a departure from his previous character types. After screening at major international film festivals in early 2010, the film had a general release {{in the latter part of}} the year. Nesbitt had previously worked with the film's director and co-writer Colm McCarthy on Murphy's Law, which was one reason he took the role. He researched the mythical aspects of the character by reading about Irish folklore and beliefs. He also starred alongside Minnie Driver and his Welcome to Sarajevo co-star Goran ViÅ¡njiÄ‡ in the Tiger Aspect television serial The Deep. In the five-part drama, Nesbitt played submarine engineer Clem Donnelly. The serial was filmed over 12 weeks at BBC Scotland's studios in Dumbarton. August 2010 saw the release of Nadia Tass's film Matching Jack, in which Nesbitt plays the leading role of Connor. He became involved in the film after reading an early script draft in 2006. In 2008, the global financial crisis severely reduced the budget of the film, and Nesbitt volunteered a reduction in his salary so the film could still be made. The film was shot over eight weeks in Melbourne in 2009 and released in 2010.|$|E
