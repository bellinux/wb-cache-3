In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it.

In his autobiography, Franklin writes: [...] "In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the smallpox taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly and still <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had not given it to him by inoculation.

The loss of Akagi and the three other IJN carriers at Midway, comprising two thirds of Japan's total number of fleet carriers and the experienced core of the First Air Fleet, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war. In an effort to conceal the defeat, Akagi was not immediately removed from the Navy's registry of ships, instead being listed as [...] "unmanned" [...] before finally being struck from the registry on 25 September 1942.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it three-and-a-half stars out of {{four and}} called it [...] "an {{astonishing}} achievement in imaginative filmmaking" [...] and said [...] "Lucas tells a good story." [...] Ebert also wrote that [...] "If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable" [...] {{because it is the}} opening film in the new trilogy. He concluded his review by saying that rather than Star Trek films, filmmakers could [...] "ive me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] grade and complimented Liam Neeson's performance and the action scenes. In an Entertainment Weekly review for the DVD release, Marc Bernardin gave the film a [...] "C-", calling it [...] "haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile". ReelViews' James Berardinelli wrote:Looking at the big picture, in spite of all its flaws, The Phantom Menace is still among the best [...] "bang for a buck" [...] fun that can be had in a movie theater. It isn't as fresh as the original Star Wars nor does it have the thematic richness and narrative complexity of The Empire Strikes Back, but it is a distinct improvement over Return of the Jedi. In fact, after Return of the Jedi, I didn't have a burning desire to return to this galaxy 'far, far away', but, with The Phantom Menace, Lucas has revived my interest.

2500|$|Both {{supporters}} {{and opponents of}} the Iraq War widely viewed it {{within the context of}} a postâ11 September world, where the U.S. has sought to make terrorism the defining international security paradigm.

Some critics of the war, particularly within the U.S. military community, argued pointedly against the conflation of Iraq and the war on terror, and criticized Bush for losing focus on the more important objective of fighting al-Qaeda.
