5|$|Meanwhile, Chris sneaks into Meg's {{bedroom and}} reads her diary. Discovering him, Meg chases after Chris while Stewie walks by the staircase. Accidentally bumped by them, Stewie tumbles {{down the stairs}} and becomes unconscious, {{suffering}} a severe head wound. Chris and Meg hide the wound with a hat. Continuing the charade, they are approached by Peter, who asks how long Stewie has been unconscious. Peter reveals that he has knocked both of them out plenty of times, and wants to continue hiding Stewie's injury from Lois until he can frame her for it. The next day, noticing Lois pulling out of the driveway, Peter throws Stewie behind her car, making it appear as if Lois has <b>run</b> <b>him</b> over. Lois suggests they frame someone else, but Peter professes his love for her and suggests they take Stewie to the hospital. At the end of the show, Stewie walks in on the family with his head wrapped in bandages, revealing that many months have passed since his accident, he asks what happened to him.|$|E

5|$|The {{secondary}} rivalry {{was between}} The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy. On the September 8, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy {{announced that he}} was looking for a new opponent, one that he had never faced before. Long informed Kennedy that he knew a SmackDown! superstar that had never faced Kennedy, The Undertaker. A match was made between the two for No Mercy, in which Kennedy defeated Undertaker by disqualification. At Survivor Series, Kennedy once again defeated Undertaker in a First Blood match. On the December 1 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker fought Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a match where neither wrestler won. During the match, MVP was scripted to attempt escaping from the ring, but Kennedy caught him during the process and tried to throw him back into the ring. MVP instead threw Kennedy in. Undertaker then kicked Kennedy in the face, and Kane attacked MVP at ringside. The following week as Kennedy was in the ring, the hearse, appearing to have nobody in the driver's seat, drove into the arena; suddenly, The Undertaker appeared from the back of the hearse, as Kennedy sprung from the ring. Later that night, Kane defeated Kennedy by disqualification after MVP interfered on Kennedy's behalf. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker and Kane teamed together to face Kennedy and MVP in a tag team match, which ended in neither team winning. Kennedy knocked Kane down in the aisle and jumped into the driver's seat of the hearse that had been at ringside for the match, and threatened to <b>run</b> <b>him</b> over with it however the Undertaker appeared in the passenger side seat scaring Kennedy off.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} some hostility between players and management, {{not the least}} of which came to a head when Carmine Isacco was sent home by the team for no {{apparent}} reason. Speculation was that management was unhappy with how much they were paying him, and were trying to <b>run</b> <b>him</b> out of town. While not public, there was a series of disturbing occurrences behind the scenes that reinforce that speculation.|$|E

He’s lived {{his life in}} darkness {{from the day he}} was born, but one fateful day everything changes — Ayreon can see images. The minstrel believes these visions are sent to him by the Lords of Time. Unaware of how much time there is left before Earth is destroyed Ayreon sets out to tell the tale of Earth’s demise singing songs of wars, natural disaster, and computer technology. The terrifying tales frighten the villagers who <b>run</b> <b>him</b> out of town.|$|E
25|$|Compton's absent-mindedness was legendary. Colin Cowdrey {{writes that}} Compton turned {{up for the}} Old Trafford Test of 1955 against South Africa without his kitbag. Undaunted, he sauntered into the museum and, {{borrowing}} an antique bat off the display, went on to score 158 and 71. Nevertheless, England lost by three wickets. This absent-mindedness was particularly obvious in his tendency to run out his partners at the crease: Trevor Bailey declared that 'a call for a run from Compton {{should be treated as}} no more than a basis for negotiation.' Typically, at his brother Leslie's benefit match in 1955, he managed to <b>run</b> <b>him</b> out before he had faced a single ball.|$|E
25|$|As {{the tide}} ebbed, Recalde's ships held their {{anchorage}} {{in the more}} sheltered part of the sound, while Santa Maria de la Rosa drifted and then simply sank — perhaps on striking Stromboli Rock — leaving one survivor for the English to interrogate. The survivor's information was that the captain of Santa Maria de la Rosa had called the pilot a traitor and <b>run</b> <b>him</b> through with a sword just as the ship began to sink; he also asserted that the Prince of Ascoli, son of the king of Spain, had gone down with the ship — this information was false, but proved useful propaganda for the English.|$|E

25|$|Mark's {{feud with}} Nick Cotton (John Altman) resurfaces after he discovers that Nick gave his brother, Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou), ecstasy. Mark snaps, spikes Nick's drink, leads {{him up to}} the Walford viaduct, and watches delightedly as the {{intoxicated}} Nick falls. He survives but he is severely crippled, and he vengefully enlists his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald) to take revenge on Mark. Ashley steals Mark's motorbike and attempts to <b>run</b> <b>him</b> over but Nick had drained the brake fluid from the bike the night before. Ashley crashes into the launderette and is killed. Nick leaves the Square shortly afterwards and never sees Mark again.|$|E
25|$|Second time {{round the}} {{tourists}} started badly and were 99/6. A useful partnership of 149 in 80 {{minutes for the}} seventh wicket between Harold Austin and Bertie Harragin enabled them to set Lord Brackley's XI a target of 244. Harragin made 86 in 90 minutes. When the home side batted Morrison took quick wickets and the score was 80/4 at the close. Wynyard, who had opened in the first innings, batted down the order because of injury and used a runner. He was again the top scorer with 70* in 125 minutes and led the team to an exciting two wicket victory. Ollivierre was no-balled when, seeing Wynyard out of his ground, he threw at the stumps {{in an attempt to}} <b>run</b> <b>him</b> out.|$|E
25|$|In April 1930, Capone {{was arrested}} on {{vagrancy}} charges when visiting Miami Beach; the governor had ordered sheriffs to <b>run</b> <b>him</b> out of the state. Capone claimed that Miami police had refused him food and water and threatened to arrest his family. He was charged with perjury for making these statements, but was acquitted after a three-day trial in July. In September, a Chicago judge issued a warrant for Capone's arrest on charges of vagrancy, and then used the publicity to run against Thompson in the Republican primary. In February 1931, Capone was tried on the contempt of court charge. In court, Judge James Herbert Wilkerson intervened to reinforce questioning of Capone's doctor by the prosecutor. Wilkerson sentenced Capone to six months, but he remained free while on appeal of the contempt conviction.|$|E

25|$|The next year, in 1993, Haile won {{the first}} of what would {{eventually}} be four consecutive world championships titles in the men's 10,000 metres at the 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999 World Championships. His win at the 1993 was however his most infamous as he accidentally stepped on the heel of Moses Tanui's shoe at the bell, causing it to fly off his foot. After the contact, with just one shoe, an angered Tanui moved out to a 10-meter lead, only to have Haile <b>run</b> <b>him</b> down on the final straight. Also at the 1993 World Championships he ran in the 5,000-metre race to finish a close second behind Ismael Kirui of Kenya. In 1994 he won a bronze medal at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. Later that year he set his first world record by running a 12:56.96 in the 5,000-metres, breaking Saïd Aouita's record by two seconds.|$|E
25|$|BRM's {{fortunes}} did {{not improve}} in 1967, despite closely contesting the Tasman Series with Jim Clark who probably raced closer and harder with Jackie {{than at any time}} in their careers. While Clark usually won, Stewart won a classic victory in the New Zealand Grand Prix with Clark attempting to <b>run</b> <b>him</b> down in the last laps with bodywork flying off his Lotus. In F1 the BRMs were still struggling with reliability problems and Stewart came no higher than second at Spa, despite having to drive one-handed while holding the car in gear with the other. In F2 he won events at Karlskoga, Enna, Oulton Park, and Albi in a Tyrrell-entered Matra MS5 or MS7. He also placed 2nd driving a works-entered Ferrari driving with Chris Amon at the BOAC 6 Hours at Brands Hatch, the 10th round of World Sportscar Championship at the time.|$|E
