25|$|The tangle net, or tooth net, {{originated}} in British Columbia, Canada, as a gear specifically developed for selective fisheries. Tangle nets have smaller mesh sizes than standard gillnets. They {{are designed to}} catch fish by their nose or jaw, enabling bycatch to be resuscitated and released unharmed. Tangle nets as adapted to the mark-selective fishery for spring Chinook salmon on the lower Columbia River have a standard mesh size of 4-1/4inches (10.8cm.). Short net lengths and soak times are used {{in an effort to}} land fish in good condition. Tangle nets are typically used in situations where the release of certain (usually wild) fish unharmed is desirable. In a typical situation calling for the use of a tangle net, for instance, all fish retaining their adipose fins (usually wild) must be returned to the water. Tangle nets are used in conjunction with a live <b>recovery</b> <b>box,</b> which acts as a resuscitation chamber for unmarked fish that appear lethargic or stressed before their release into the water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —The {{abundance}} of coho salmon Oncorhyn-chus kisutch has declined dramatically {{over much of}} the southern part of its range along the Pacific Coast of North America. This decline has created the need to reduce fishing mortalities, including bycatch mortalities in fisheries that are targeting other species. Traditional gill-net fishing causes an estimated 35 – 70 % mortality rate on incidentally caught coho salmon. A reduction in this high mortality rate is necessary if gill nets continue to be used in fisheries that inadvertently intercept de-pressed coho salmon stocks while fishing other species. By using modified gear, short net soak times, careful handling of fish on removal from the gill net, and a newly designed <b>recovery</b> <b>box,</b> the short-term mortality rate on incidentally caught coho salmon can be reduced to as little as 6 %, possibly even lower in some circumstances. This substantial reduction in mortality on nontargeted species expands the possible role of gill nets in the de-velopment of selective fisheries. The {{abundance of}} coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch has declined drastically {{over much of the}} southern part of its range in North America (Weit-kamp et al. 1995). In 1996, coho salmon on the central California coast were formally declared as threatened under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (National Marine Fisheries Service 1996).

40|$|A 64 -year-old {{woman who}} had never {{consumed}} alcohol presented to hospital with a several-day history of vomiting and severe diarrhoea, secondary to Clostridium difficile colitis. She had suffered a similar episode 3 months earlier. Her symptoms settled after 7 days’ treatment with vancomycin and metronidazole, but her admission was complicated by nosocomial pneumonia and her oral intake was poor. Fifteen days into her stay, she became drowsy and less communicative and developed generalised weakness. Clinical examination revealed signs of encephalopathy. She had slowed mentation, paucity of facial expression and slow limb movements. She could follow one-stage commands but only slowly and with significant prompting. Her eye movements were normal. She had mild generalised weakness in all four limbs, but her deep tendon reflexes were intact and plantar responses were downgoing. Ataxia could not be assessed reliably due to impaired consciousness. Electroencephalography showed generalised slowing without focal features. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient’s brain revealed symmetrical changes of high signal in the periaqueductal grey matter, superior colliculi and medial thalami, most evident on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences (Box 1, A–C). These symmetrical periventricular changes were consistent with typical findings recently described for Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Given the clinical history of dietary deprivation and colitis, together with the typical radiological changes, a diagnosis of Wernicke’s encephalopathy was strongly suspected. Hence, intravenous thiamine 500 mg {{three times a day}} was administered, after which the patient made a dramatic clinical and radiological <b>recovery</b> (<b>Box</b> 1, D–F) over a period of about 7 days.

25|$|Given the {{selective}} properties of gillnet fishing, alternative methods of harvest {{are currently being}} studied. Recent WDF reports suggest that purse seine is the most productive method with having highest catch per unit effort (CPUE), but has little information {{on the effectiveness of}} selectively harvesting hatchery-reared salmon. More conclusive research has been conducted jointly between the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and Bonneville Power Administration on a 10-year study on selective harvest methods of hatchery origin salmon in the Upper Columbia River by purse seine and tangle net. Their 2009 and 2010 findings show that purse seines have a higher percentage of survivability and higher CPUE than does tangle nets. A Colville Tribe biologist reports that during these two years the tribe harvested 3,163 hatchery Chinook while releasing 2,346 wild Chinook with only 1.4% direct or immediate mortality using purse seines, whereas the tangle net was far less productive but had an approximate 12.5% mortality. Researchers commented that the use of <b>recovery</b> <b>boxes</b> and shortened periods between checking the nets would have likely decreased mortality rates. While there is data that shows success of selective methods of harvest at protecting wild and ESA listed salmon, there still must be social acceptance of new methods of fishing.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{benefits}} of manipulating task constraints (e. g. court dimensions and ball compression) in tennis {{for the purpose}} of enhancing young participants’ skill development have been well-documented (Buszard et al., 2016). Despite this, modified versions of the sport, such as the Lawn Tennis Association’s Mini Tennis Red, may not afford participants sufficient opportunities to perform and develop the backhand groundstroke (Fitzpatrick et al., 2016). The aim {{of this study was to}} afford backhand development during Mini Tennis Red coaching by introducing an 8 -week intervention, during which constraints-based adaptations were applied to the experimental group’s learning environment aimed to develop backhand groundstrokes. Method: Two groups; control (n = 8, age = 7. 2 ± 0. 6 years, tennis playing experience = 1. 9 ± 0. 6 years) and experimental (n = 8, age 7. 4 ± 0. 4 years, tennis playing experience = 2. 1 ± 0. 6 years) underwent an 8 -week coaching intervention, during which constraints-based adaptations (manipulating internal court dimensions, the location of participants’ <b>recovery</b> <b>boxes</b> and practice match-play rules) were applied to the experimental group’s learning environment. Pre- and post-test match-play characteristics (e. g. forehand and backhand percentages, winner and error percentages) and Tennis-Specific Skills Test results (e. g. forehand and backhand technical proficiency, rally performance with a coach) were analysed. Results: Following the intervention, both groups improved their ability to maintain a rally during match-play (Control: pre 4. 5 ± 1. 6, post 5. 2 + 1. 9; Experimental: 5. 3 ± 1. 9, post 5. 9 ± 1. 2, p < 0. 001). However, the experimental group performed a greater percentage of backhands out of total shots (46. 7 ± 3. 3 %) and a greater percentage of backhand winners out of total backhands (5. 5 ± 3. 0 %) than the control group during match-play (backhands = 22. 4 ± 6. 5 %, p < 0. 001; backhand winners = 1. 0 ± 3. 6 %, p < 0. 01). The experimental group also demonstrated superior improvements in backhand technical proficiency (experimental group, 4. 0 points improvement; control 0. 8 points improvement, p < 0. 001). Finally, the experimental group improved their ability to maintain a rally with a coach (control group improved by 2. 9 strokes compared to 7. 6 stokes improvement for the experimental group, p < 0. 05). Conclusion: The manipulations implemented here elicited more representative emergent behaviour than standard Mini Tennis Red constraints. Coaches may wish to utilise these adaptations during their coaching sessions, to augment players’ technical and tactical development, and negate the disparity between the number of forehands and backhands typically performed during training and match-play...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{concurrent}} programs {{raising an}} exception in one thread does not prevent others from operating on an inconsistent shared state. Instead, exceptions should ideally be handled in coordination by all the threads that are affected by their cause. In this paper, we propose a Java language extension for coordinated exception handling where a named abox (atomic box) is used to demarcate a region of code that must execute atomically and in isolation. Upon an exception raised inside an abox, threads executing in dependent aboxes, roll back their changes, and execute their recovery handler in coordination. We provide a dedicated compiler framework, CXH, to evaluate experimentally our atomic box construct.

A brief report proposes a system, somewhat like a commercial aircraft "black box," for retrieving these data. A microspacecraft attached to the prime spacecraft would continually store recent critical data from that spacecraft. If either spacecraft detected certain serious conditions of the prime spacecraft, the microspacecraft would separate from the prime spacecraft and independently transmit the stored data to Earth. Supplemental data, acquired from sensors onboard the microspacecraft, could be added to this transmission. For example, the orientation and angular rates of the prime spacecraft immediately before separation as well as pictures taken of the prime spacecraft after separation could be included. Functional enhancements over aircraft black boxes include the separation from the prime vehicle (which gains independence from the fate of that vehicle), wireless transmission of data (making physical black <b>box</b> <b>recovery</b> unnecessary), and the optional acquisition of supplemental sensor data...|$|R

The aim of this research was to assess the effect of landscape parameters on breeding success of barn owls throughout the Rother and Arun River catchments, Sussex, UK. We used a Geographic Information System to describe the habitat mosaic and landscape structure within an estimated home range area of 3 km 2 around 85 artificial nest box sites. Results showed that land cover was less heterogeneous at successful sites, with home ranges dominated by a few habitat types of regular patch shapes. Unsuccessful nesting sites had significantly more improved grassland, suburban land and wetlands than successful sites. Cluster analysis and Principle Components Analysis was used to assess the similarity of the habitat mosaic within these areas and pellet analysis was undertaken to assess barn owl diet and prey availability. Ten prey species were recovered from pellets, field vole (Microtus agrestis), common shrews (Sorex araneus) and house mice (Mus musculus) making up nearly 90 % of <b>recoveries.</b> However <b>box</b> sites varied in relative proportions of small mammal, and hence prey availability.

In 2013, multistate {{outbreaks of}} salmonellosis were {{traced back to}} exposure to live poultry, {{some of which were}} purchased at a national chain of farm stores (Farm store chain Y). This study was conducted at 36 stores of Farm store chain Y and was concurrent with the timing of exposure for the human outbreaks of salmonellosis in 2013. We used environmental swabs of arriving shipment boxes of hatchling poultry and shipment tracking information to examine the distribution, diversity and anti-microbial resistance of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) across farm stores and hatcheries. Isolates recovered from shipment boxes underwent serotyping, anti-microbial resistance (AMR) testing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Postal service tracking codes from the shipment boxes were used to determine the hatchery of origin. The PFGE patterns were compared with the PFGE patterns of NTS causing outbreaks of salmonellosis in 2013. A total of 219 hatchling boxes from 36 stores in 13 states were swabbed between 15 March 2013 and 18 April 2013. NTS were recovered from 59 (27 %) of 219 hatchling <b>boxes.</b> <b>Recovery</b> was not significantly associated with species of hatchlings, number of birds in the shipment box, or the presence of dead, injured or sick birds. Four of the 23 PFGE patterns and 23 of 50 isolates were indistinguishable from strains causing human outbreaks in 2013. For serotypes associated with human illnesses, PFGE patterns most frequently recovered from shipment boxes were also more frequent causes of human illness. Boxes positive for the same PFGE pattern most frequently originated from the same mail-order hatchery. Only one of 59 isolates was resistant to anti-microbials used to treat Salmonella infections in people.

40|$|R/V POSEIDON cruise P 457 aimed further {{development}} of detailed marine tephrochronology of Iceland by sediment coring {{in order to improve}} our knowledge of the spatio-temporal evolution of Icelandic volcanism and related hazards. In addition, the marine record contains paleoclimatic information, which may relate recurrent glacier advances and land degradation periods to ocean and atmospheric circulation changes. A minor sub-project should contribute {{to a better understanding of}} Surtsey volcanism by investigations of marine Surtsey tephra. P 457 conducted extensive sediment echosounding (11 surveys with a total length of c. 425 nm) in order to identify undisturbed sediment sequences for coring. At 20 appropriate sites, P 457 deployed gravity and/or gaint box corers to recover ultra-high resolution sediment cores from < 100 m to 1, 600 m water depth at the south-western, southern and eastern sectors of the Icelandic shelf and slope. Of these deployments, 9 gravity corers yielded altogether 59. 5 m core <b>recovery</b> and 11 <b>box</b> corers recovered surface sediment samples. Additionally 7 CTD/rosette water sampling stations have been performed at shallow sites close to Iceland and at deep sites further offshore in order to determine the REE distributions and the Nd and Hf isotope compositions of the sea water. No equipment was lost or significantly damaged. Cruise P 457 was particularly successful in the working areas southwest and south of Iceland but failed to recover long sediment cores in the eastern working areas and at Surtsey.

Preliminary studies of selected sedimentary records along the Iceland margin from ca. 24 °W to 12 °W on both sides of Reykjanes Ridge suggest that a correlation of these cores is possible, implying that sedimentary records are undisturbed and of high quality.

40|$|In the study, {{the effects}} of {{repeated}} anaesthesia on selected parameters of general clinical examination (body weight, body temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate, cranial nerve tests), the blood pressure, fitness (heart rate on defined ergometric load), haematological parameters and clinical chemistry (particularly liver and renal function tests) and the recovery behaviour were investigated in 1 - to 2 -year old Beagle-dogs. The effect of anaesthetic intervals and anaesthetic frequency on the investigated body functions and their significance {{for the well-being of}} the animal were of particular interest. The investigations presented here were conducted in dogs in which pharmacological investigations of ultrasound contrast agents from Schering AG diagnostics research were taking place in parallel over a prolonged period. The dogs repeatedly received premedication with Xylazine and Polamivet® and inhalation anaesthesia using Isoflurane. To evaluate the effect of the anaesthetic interval, a crossover experimental model was selected with 2 groups each consisting of 3 female Beagle-dogs and 2 different experimental phases. The animals in the first group were anaesthetised twice at an interval of 8 weeks in the first experimental phase, and the animals in the second group were anaesthetised 5 times at an interval of 2 weeks. In the second experimental phase this sequence was reversed between the groups. There was a 3 -month break between the experimental phases. All other experimental data were described exploratively. The general clinical examination parameters, blood pressure and fitness were each recorded 1 day before anaesthesia and 24 hours, 7 and 14 days after anaesthesia. To examine renal and hepathic function in addition, 3 blood samples were taken during the anaesthesia (after premedication, 2 hours after induction of the inhalation anaesthesia {{and at the end of}} the anaesthesia). Furthermore, haematological and clinical chemistry investigations were each performed before and 2 weeks after each experimental phase. The recovery behaviour of the dogs following the anaesthesia was observed for up to 1 hour. The results of the crossover model showed a statistically significant difference in only one parameter with regard to the different anaesthetic intervals (liver enzyme ALP higher with anaestheisa at an interval of 8 weeks). The number of anaesthesia procedures had no effect on the parameters. However, some of the individual anaesthesia procedures had an effect on the recorded parameters predominantly 24 hours after the end of anaesthesia. These were apparent as weight loss, a rise in body temperature, an increase in liver enzyme activity (AST, ALT, ALP) and a reduced fitness. An effect on renal function cannot be fully excluded as 2 animals showed a temporary increase in serum urea or creatinine concentration over the reverences. The blood pressure remained unaffected. The effect of the anaesthesia procedures on the respiratory and heart rate was slight and not important. All of {{the effects of}} the anaesthesia were reversible and were usually no longer observable after 7 but at the latest after 14 days. All the other recorded parameters of haematology and clinical chemistry and the recovery behaviour remained unaffected. Independent of the experimental phase, nearly all the animals demonstrated obvious tremor in the <b>recovery</b> warming <b>box.</b> The results of the general clinical examination suggest a temporary deterioration in well-being.

40|$|Ground based {{observations}} of NO_ 2 and O_ 3 using visible spectrometers {{have been made}} at Syowa Station (69 °S) since March 1990. The NO_ 2 slant column amounts observed at the solar zenith angle of 90 °(sunrise and sunset) exhibit a large seasonal variation, decreasing with shortening daylight hours in fall, reaching a minimum of about 1 ×(10) ^ (cm) ^ in midwinter and increasing {{to a maximum of}} about 16 ×(10) ^ (cm) ^ in midsummer. The recovery of NO_ 2 in spring is 2 - 3 times slower than the fall decay, because the heterogeneous chemistry on PSCs, the conversion of NO_x into HNO_ 3,is effective from midwinter to early spring, and NO_y is removed from the stratosphere through gravitational sedimentation of PSCs particles. In late spring the PSCs decrease and NO_ 2 increases because of the transport of air from lower latitudes. Following the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo (15 °N) in June 1991,the NO_ 2 amounts in midsummer of 1991 were lower by 20 - 30 % than those in 1990. The NO_ 2 amount in midsummer increased year after year and recovered to the 1990 level by 1994. The NO_ 2 amount in fall also recovered since 1992; however, the rate of recovery is smaller than in summer. The NO_ 2 level in fall of 1993 was as low as those in 1992. On the other hand, the rate of <b>recovery</b> in the <b>box</b> model using the observed aerosol surface areas by SAGE (S. SOLOMON et al., J. Geophys. Res., 99, 3509, 1994) is larger than that observed at McMurdo and Syowa Stations. This may suggest that another factor delays the NO_ 2 recovery in fall. NO_ 2 levels in winter have a positive correlation with temperature at 20 and 70 hPa (about 25 and 18 km, respectively). In colder winters such as 1990 and 1993,the NO_ 2 levels were lower than those in other years. This {{may be due to the}} difference in the location of the polar vortex boundary relative to Syowa Station. The NO_ 2 amount and the temperature are considered to be lower deep inside the vortex as compared to near the boundary. In spring, the NO_ 2 and O_ 3 amounts and the temperature largely change when the vortex boundary crosses over Syowa Station. The vortex boundary can be clearly seen in the total O_ 3 maps obtained by TOMS. The monthly mean O_ 3 values suggest that Syowa Station was located deep inside of the vortex in October 1992 when the NO_ 2 level was lower than in other years. In contrast, Syowa Station was located near the edge of the vortex in October 1991 when the NO_ 2 level was much higher...|$|R
