5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum.

Retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the ipsilateral caudal portion of the rostral entopeduncular nucleus and bilaterally in the rostral half of the lateral zone of area dorsalis of the telencephalon. The following diencephalic cell groups were also labeled following tectal injections: the ipsilateral anterior, ventrolateral, and ventromedial thalamic nuclei, the periventricular pretectal nucleus, and the central pretectal nucleus (bilaterally); the ventromedial thalamic and central pretectal nuclei revealed {{the largest number of}} labeled cells. At midbrain levels, retrogradely labeled cells were seen in the ipsilateral torus longitudinalis, nucleus isthmi, and accessory optic nucleus; cells were labeled bilaterally in the torus semicircularis and a rostral tegmental nucleus. Only a few cells were labeled in the contralateral optic tectum, suggesting that few of the fibers of the intertectal commissure are actually commissural to the tectum. At hindbrain levels, retrogradely labeled cells were seen bilaterally in the locus coeruleus, the superior, medial, and inferior <b>reticular</b> <b>formations,</b> the eurydendroid cells of the cerebellum, and the nucleus of the descending trigeminal tract; the contralateral dorsal funicular nucleus also exhibited labeling.

Infected neurons were localized throughout the cervical and thoracic spinal cord with a concentration of labeling in the vicinity of the phrenic nucleus where diaphragm motoneurons are known to reside. Infection was also found throughout the medulla and pons particularly around the regions of the dorsal and ventral respiratory groups and the medial and lateral <b>reticular</b> <b>formations</b> but also in several other areas including the caudal raphe nuclei, parabrachial nuclear complex, vestibular nuclei, ventral paratrigeminal area, lateral reticular nucleus, and retrotrapezoid nucleus.

Diencephalic labeling was most concentrated within the regions of the perifornical area and the medial parvocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus but was also found in several other areas. Infected neurons were also observed in the cruciate sulcus of the cerebral cortex as well as in prefrontal and insular cortices.

Under a cybernetics point view all the structures, peripheral and central, that contribute to the BOR and BSR constitute a system. A System is a network of different structures interconnected, interacting to reach a common goal. In this case the goal is human balance. The structures that provide the BOR and the BSR consitute the so-called Equilibrium System. Lackner remembered that the so-called vestibular nuclei are real polisensorial relays and that they are not only correlated to the activity of the vestibule. Thus it is uncorrected to define those nuclei as vestibular nuclei. They are true Balance nuclei that act together cerebellum and <b>reticular</b> <b>formations</b> to provide the sub-cortical component of human Equilibrium.

From dynamical point of view, not only the morphological aspects of teeth and arcades, but also sensitive-sensorial mechanisms connected to masticatory muscles, periodontal structures and oral structures, should be considered. The ideal bite and perfect morphology of tooth arcades are not enough for reconstitution of correct occlusion, if there are no neuromuscular system, temporomandibular joint, and especially central nervous system.

Verbal working memory appeared mildly impaired while nonverbal working memory was not. Scores on the Advanced Clinical Solution’s Social Perception battery were all in the normal range as were academic skills measured by the Wide Range Achievement Test—Fourth Edition. Performance was impaired on the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System’s counterpart of the Trail-Making Test: Part B. Similarly, on the Draw-A-Person Test there was a discrepancy in that our patient’s standard score was 76 compared to her estimated premorbid FSIQ in the average range. She also displayed bilateral motor coordination slowing on the Finger Tapping task collectively suggesting damage to pontine motor tracts.

40|$|Endothelial cell (EC) {{junctions}} {{are critical}} for angiogenesis, the sprouting and growth of new blood vessels from existing vessels. Sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) is a proangiogenic factor that potently stimulates sprouting, fortifies EC junctions, and work by others has shown it stimulates VE-cadherin, ?-catenin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin junction localization among others. Annexin A 2 (ANXA 2), a calcium-regulated membrane-binding and adapter protein, has a known role in angiogenesis. Previously, we showed that ANXA 2 is required for barrier integrity by binding to vascular endothelial (VE) -Cadherin and preventing its phosphorylation. Thus, we tested whether ANXA 2 silencing in human endothelial cells alters localization of junctional and focal adhesion proteins with immunofluorescence staining. Removal of the ANXA 2 protein in ECs resulted in the <b>formation</b> of wide <b>reticular</b> junctions in 2 D, affecting localization of adherens junction proteins such as VE-cadherin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1), filamin A, and ?- and ?-catenin. Additionally, when ANXA 2 was silenced, neither FAK, paxillin, nor vinculin formed large focal adhesions near the cell-cell junctions, particularly, near the reticular cell-cell junctions. Reticular junctions were {{reported in the literature}} in non-transduced cells seeded on fibronectin coated glass coverslips. We showed that these reticular junctions were present in ECs seeded on collagen I-, collagen IV-, and Matrigel-coated glass coverslips in addition to fibronectin. We characterized these reticular junctions temporally, showing the number of reticular junctions increased over time, particularly after 8 hours in low serum culture medium. Levels of VE-cadherin and zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) were also regulated over time in cells forming reticular junctions, upregulated at 4 hours and 12 hours, respectively. Most striking was the affect S 1 P had on <b>reticular</b> junction <b>formation.</b> The addition of S 1 P to ECs abrogated the <b>formation</b> of <b>reticular</b> junctions in 2 D. Upon comparison of the proteins involved, the shANXA 2 reticular junctions and the non-transduced EC reticular junctions appeared similar. In both groups only adherens junctions proteins participated in reticular localization while focal adhesion proteins and tight junction proteins did not localize in a reticular pattern. The junctions differed, however, in that the shANXA 2 reticular junctions formed in the presence of S 1 P while the non-transduced reticular junctions did not, indicating ANXA 2 is required for proper junctional response to S 1 P. Finally, we show the presence of reticular junctions in EC monolayers on 3 D collagen matrices, reticular junctions contributing to EC sprout initiation, and reticular junctions present in mouse uterine tissue from pregnant mice 7. 5 days after implantation. The discoveries detailed in this thesis illustrate the importance of ANXA 2 in EC junctional response to S 1 P as well as the potential for future discoveries concerning the role of reticular junctions in sprouting angiogenesis...|$|R
