40|$|The boiler {{flue gas}} furnace exit {{temperature}} (FET) {{is a key}} operating parameter of coal fired steam boilers. From the design perspective, the FET is vital for materials selection and sizing of heat transfer surfaces. From an operating perspective, {{it is a major}} indicator of the rate of combustion and heat transfer that is occurring within the furnace. Downstream of the furnace, the FET has a significant impact on both the performance and reliability of the boiler heat exchangers, which ultimately impacts on both boiler efficiency and availability. Monitoring of the FET can advise operating and engineering corrective actions which will ultimately result in better efficiency, reliability and availability together with the associated economic benefits. Therefore, methods of determining FET are investigated. Two methods are focused on for this study, one indirect and one direct. The indirect method studied is a mass and energy balance method which begins with a global boiler mass and energy balance to calculate the major boiler flow rates of coal, air and flue gas which are difficult to measure online. These parameters are then used as inputs into a furnace or backpass mass and energy balance to calculate the furnace exit temperature. The method is applied to a case study, and is evaluated in terms of the measurement uncertainties which are propagated on the intermediate parameters calculated, {{as well as on the}} final calculated FET. The main conclusions are that this indirect method contains various uncertainties, due to parameters which have to be assumed such as (i) the distribution of ingress air (also called tramp air) in the different sections of the boiler and (ii) the estimation of the share of water evaporation heat transfer occurring in the water walls of the furnace part of the boiler. The method is however still useful and can be easily applied to any boiler layout and can be used as a reference tool to verify other measurements. The direct method studied is acoustic pyrometry. The work specifically focuses on the sources of error in determining the temperature from the measurement of the time of flight of sound, the impact of particle concentration on the speed of sound through a gas-particle mixture, and the temperature profile reconstruction from acoustic time of flight measurements. A limited set of physical testing was also carried out using one acoustic generator and receiver to take measurements on a real coal power plant. As part of this physical testing, the detection of time of flight from acoustic signals was explored. Already installed <b>radiation</b> <b>pyrometers</b> were also used as a reference for interpreting the acoustic measurements. The indications are that the acoustic pyrometer provides a more representative temperature measurement than the <b>radiation</b> <b>pyrometers.</b> The uncertainty of the acoustic measurement for the same case study as the indirect method was determined and compared with the calculated result. While many aspects still need to be researched further, this initial study and experimental testing produced very promising results for future application of acoustic pyrometry for better monitoring of the coal combustion processes in power plant boilers...|$|R

In this study, tool temperature was estimated by simultaneous temperature measurement employing both a K-type thermocouple and an infrared <b>radiation</b> (IR) <b>pyrometer</b> to measure the tool-chip interface temperature. Due to the complexity of the machining processes, the integration of different measuring techniques was necessary in order to obtain consistent temperature data.

40|$|This {{project was}} awarded under U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Program Solicitation DE-PS 26 - 02 NT 41422 and {{specifically}} addresses Technical Topical Area 2 -Gasification Technologies. The project team includes Enertechnix, Inc. {{as the main}} contractor and ConocoPhillips Company as a technical partner, who also provides access to the SG Solutions Gasification Facility (formerly Wabash River Energy Limited), host for the field-testing portion of the research. Since 1989 the U. S. Department of Energy has supported development of advanced coal gasification technology. The Wabash River and TECO IGCC demonstration projects supported by the DOE have demonstrated the ability of these plants to achieve high levels of energy efficiency and extremely low emissions of hazardous pollutants. However, a continuing challenge for this technology is the tradeoff between high carbon conversion which requires operation with high internal gas temperatures, and limited refractory life which is exacerbated by those high operating temperatures. Attempts to control internal gas temperature so as to operate these gasifiers at the optimum temperature have been hampered {{by the lack of}} a reliable technology for measuring internal gas temperatures. Thermocouples have serious survival problems and provide useful temperature information for only a few days or weeks after startup before burning out. For this reason, the Department of Energy has funded several research projects to develop more robust and reliable temperature measurement approaches for use in coal gasifiers. Enertechnix has developed a line of acoustic gas temperature sensors for use in coal-fired electric utility boilers, kraft recovery boilers, cement kilns and petrochemical process heaters. Acoustic pyrometry provides several significant advantages for gas temperature measurement in hostile process environments. First, it is non-intrusive so survival of the measurement components is not a serious problem. Second, it provides a line-of-sight average temperature rather than a point measurement, so the measured temperature is more representative of the process conditions than those provided by thermocouples. Unlike <b>radiation</b> <b>pyrometers,</b> the measured temperature is a linear average over the full path rather than a complicated function of gas temperature and the exponential Beer's law. For this reason, acoustic pyrometry is well suited to tomography allowing detailed temperature maps to be created through the use of multiple path measurements in a plane. Therefore, acoustic pyrometry is an attractive choice for measuring gas temperature inside a coal gasifier. The objective of this project is to adapt acoustic pyrometer technology to make it suitable for measuring gas temperature inside a coal gasifier, to develop a prototype sensor based on this technology, and to demonstrate its performance through testing on a commercial gasifier. The project is organized in three phases, each of approximately one year duration. The first phase consists of researching a variety of sound generation and coupling approaches suitable for use with a high pressure process, evaluation of the impact of gas composition variability on the acoustic temperature measurement approach, evaluation of the impact of suspended particles on sound attenuation, evaluation of slagging issues and development of concepts to deal with this issue, development and testing of key prototype components to allow selection of the best approaches, and development of a conceptual design for a field prototype sensor that can be tested on an operating gasifier. The second phase consists of designing and fabricating a series of prototype sensors, testing them in the lab and at a gasifier facility, and developing a conceptual design for an engineering prototype sensor. The third phase consists of designing and fabricating the engineering prototype, testing it in the lab and in a commercial gasifier, and conducting extended field trials to demonstrate sensor performance and investigate the ability to improve gasifier performance through the use of the sensor...|$|R

Relatively large temperature gradient arises along the ball cutting-edge at higher spindle revolution because cutting speed depends on the local tool radius. Depth of cut and feed per tooth, at the same time, affect the overall temperature at the ball cutting edges. The cooling characteristics in air cutting reveals that the temperature difference during one cycle of intermittent cutting increases as spindle speed decreases. The relationship between the peripheral cutting speed and the tool temperature varies from tool shank to ball tip because the interactions between cutting edge and workpiece change along the ballnose...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} a control scheme by which {{it is possible to}} reproducibly reheat steel billets into the semi-solid state. Usually a heating program is used to reheat the billet into the semi-solid state. Our experiments showed that this control scheme leads to varying semi-solid fractions from one experiment to the next. To gain information about the billet’s state its temperature is often used since there is a known relationship between the temperature and the liquid fraction. Direct measurement of the temperature via thermocouples is not feasible in a production environment, therefore a <b>radiation</b> <b>pyrometer</b> {{has been used as a}} contact-less measurement device. The accuracy of the pyrometer depends heavily on the exact knowledge of the radiation coefficient, which can vary from billet to billet due to different surface properties and which is subject to change during the heating process. These uncertainties prohibit the implementation of a closed-loop control scheme since the exact temperature cannot be measured with the required accuracy. In order to be independent of the measurement errors the proposed control scheme only relies on the slope of the temperature. By detecting the distinct change of slope which occurs when the solidus temperature is crossed, the beginning of the melting process can be determined. The energy fed to the billet from this point onward determines the resulting liquid fraction. By detecting the entry into the solidusliquidu...|$|E
40|$|An {{optical system}} has been {{developed}} which can determine time-resolved temperatures in shocked materials by measuring the spectral radiance of light emitted from shocked solid samples in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range (0. 5 – 1. 0 µm). It can measure temperatures as low as 1500 K and has been successfully used to observe shock-induced chemical reactions in powder samples. The high sensitivity of this <b>radiation</b> <b>pyrometer</b> {{can be attributed to}} the large angular aperture (0. 06 sr), the large bandwidth per channel (up to 0. 1 µm), the large photodiode detection areas (1. 0 cm^ 2), and the small number of calibrated channels (4) among which light is divided. Improved calibration techniques, as well as the layout of the instrument, eliminate certain sources of error encountered in previous shock-temperature experiments. Errors in the measured spectral radiance were reduced by: (1) recalibration before every experiment to account for changes in optical components; (2) direct calibration of voltage recorded at each digitizer to prevent transfer error by an intermediate step; (3) use of a spectral irradiance calibration lamp to exclude errors due to spatial inhomogeneities associated with spectral radiance sources; and (4) obtaining a large spatial average of light at each wavelength from the same portion of the sample to eliminate errors from possible inhomogeneities in the sample. The magnitude each of these errors could previously contribute was 1 %– 2 % of the total signal. Absolute temperature uncertainties, determined from the standard deviation of the measured spectral radiances from the least-squares-fit values, are typically about 5 %. Emissivities are poorly constrained by spectral radiance data because of a weak functional dependence, and uncertainties can easily exceed 50 % for temperatures of around 2000 K...|$|E
