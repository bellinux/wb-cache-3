40|$|The anxious rearing {{model of}} perfectionism {{development}} proposes that children develop perfectionism {{in response to}} parental worry about their children being imperfect and parental behaviors such as overprotection from mistakes {{and focus on the}} negative consequences of mistakes. In the current study, perfectionistic rearing behaviors were experimentally manipulated during a copy task in clinically anxious children (n=. 42) and non-anxious children (n=. 35). Children were randomized to receive high or non-perfectionistic rearing behaviors from their parents during the copy task designed to elicit child perfectionistic behaviors. Results showed that self-reported self-oriented perfectionism (SOP) was significantly higher in the anxious group compared with the non-anxious group. All children showed an increase in observed SOP in response to high perfectionistic rearing behaviors. Despite this increase in SOP in the high perfectionistic <b>rearing</b> <b>condition,</b> it was children in the non-perfectionistic <b>rearing</b> <b>condition</b> that improved significantly in task accuracy performance.

40|$|These {{experiments}} {{explore the}} role of preweaning experience in learning during the juvenile period. Pups that had been reared with many nipples available reached criterion on an 8 -arm radial maze in a few trials; conversely, pups reared {{with only a few}} nipples required 3 times the number of trials to reach criterion (Experiment 1). Pups that had been reared with relatively few nipples available rarely nipple-shifted, while those that had been reared with a particularly high density of nipples shifted more frequently (Expt 2). A rearing procedure was devised that allowed precise experimental control of all phases of the suckling experience (Expt 3). Allowing or preventing a single behavior, nipple-shifting, while holding all other variables constant, was sufficient to affect acquisition of the maze task. In Experiment 4, the specificity of the early experience for later tasks was explored using a variety of nonspatial, lever-pressing operants. <b>Rearing</b> <b>condition</b> did not affect acquisition of a leverpressing operant or of a visual discrimination task.
