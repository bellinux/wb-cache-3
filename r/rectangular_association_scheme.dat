The set of subspaces {{of a given}} {{dimension}} in an attenuated space has a structure of a symmetric <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> and this <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> is called an <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> based on an attenuated space. <b>Association</b> <b>schemes</b> based on attenuated spaces are generalizations of Grassmann schemes and bilinear forms schemes, and also q-analogues of nonbinary Johnson schemes. Wang, Guo, and Li computed the intersection numbers of <b>association</b> <b>schemes</b> based on attenuated spaces. The aim {{of this paper is}} to compute character tables of <b>association</b> <b>schemes</b> based on attenuated spaces using the method of Tarnanen, Aaltonen, and Goethals.

40|$|An <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> {{which is}} {{associated}} to a height t presuperscheme {{is said to}} be extensible to height t. Smith (1994, 2007) showed that an <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> X=(Q,Γ) of order d:=|Q| is Schurian iff X is extensible to height (d- 2). In this work, we formalize the maximal height t_max(X) of an <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> X as the largest positive integer such that X is extensible to height t (we also include the possibility t_max(X) =∞, which is equivalent to t_max(X) > (d- 2)). Intuitively, the maximal height provides a natural measure of how close an <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> is to being Schurian. For the purpose of computing the maximal height, we introduce the <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> extension algorithm. On input an <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> X=(Q,Γ) of order d:=|Q| and an integer t such that 1 < t< (d- 2), the <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> extension algorithm decides in time d^(O(t)) if the scheme X is extensible to height t. In particular, if t is a fixed constant, then the running time of the <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> extension algorithm is polynomial in the order of X. The <b>association</b> <b>scheme</b> extension algorithm is used to show that all non-Schurian <b>association</b> <b>schemes</b> up to order 26 are completely inextensible, i. e. they are not extensible to a positive height. Via the tensor product of <b>association</b> <b>schemes,</b> the latter result gives rise to a multitude of examples of infinite families of completely inextensible <b>association</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|R
