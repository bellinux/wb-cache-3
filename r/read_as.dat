5|$|Tennyson {{originally}} {{blocked out}} the poem in four paragraphs, broken before lines 6, 33 and 44. In this structure, {{the first and}} third paragraphs are thematically parallel, but may be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> interior and exterior monologues, respectively. However, the poem is often printed with the first paragraph break omitted.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{reception}} amongst literary reviewers was mixed; while {{writers such}} as George Eliot professed profound admiration, others such as Thomas Carlyle were harshly critical. Although no longer widely <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a literary work, it remains significant in intellectual history for its accounts of Victorian scepticism and the Oxford Movement.|$|E
40|$|Many reading {{education}} authorities (i. e. Smith 1978; Stauffer 197 b; Thorndike 1973) discuss <b>reading</b> <b>as</b> a meaning identification {{process in which}} the reader actively thinks about what s/he reads. Similarly, most classroom teachers include this relationship between reading and meaning in their definitions of reading (Green, Macaui, & Wood 1978). Little research. however, has been done on children’s perceptions of reading (Tovey 1976). How do children view reading? Do they also view <b>reading</b> <b>as</b> a process emphasizing meaning. or do they view <b>reading</b> <b>as</b> something else? The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate children’s def-initions of reading. with a special concern for their view of <b>reading</b> <b>as</b> a meaning identification process...|$|R

5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} <b>read</b> <b>as</b> {{a work of}} {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues.

5|$|Fleming had a long-held {{interest}} in pirates, from the novels he <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a child, through to {{films such as}} Captain Blood (1935) with Errol Flynn, which he enjoyed watching. From his Goldeneye home on Jamaica's northern shore, Fleming had visited Port Royal on {{the south of the}} island, which was once the home port of Sir Henry Morgan, all of which stimulated Fleming's interest. For the background to Mr Big's treasure island, Fleming appropriated the details of Cabritta Island in Port Maria Bay, which was the true location of Morgan's hoard.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi {{was ready}} now for an {{offensive}}. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invested Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Abéché, assuming {{control of the}} main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, {{and most of these}} were artillery and logistic units. This may have been due to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a Chadian internal affair.|$|E
5|$|Gilligan {{wrote the}} episode after being {{inspired}} by stories of serial killers he <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a child.

The episode received a generally positive reception, though critics criticized the plotline featuring Scully being kidnapped. Critical attention also expressed a positive opinion of how scary the episode was in nature. Guest actor Taylor Vince received positive reviews as the episode's antagonist.|$|E

5|$|Historia Plantarum {{was written}} some time between c. 350 BC and c. 287 BC in ten volumes, of which nine survive. In the book, Theophrastus {{described}} plants by their uses, and attempted a biological classification {{based on how}} plants reproduced, a first {{in the history of}} botany. He continually revised the manuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death. The condensed style of the text, with its many lists of examples, indicate that Theophrastus used the manuscript as the working notes for lectures to his students, rather than intending it to be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a book.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} <b>read</b> <b>as</b> being set in India, though it gives no {{details of the}} actual situation. Some {{research has suggested that}} the poem was written with a specific incident in mind, the execution of one Private Flaxman of The Leicestershire Regiment, at Lucknow in 1887. A number of details of this execution correspond to the occasion described by Kipling in the poem, and he later used a story similar to that of Flaxman's as a basis for the story Black Jack.|$|E
5|$|Laozi is {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} author of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), though the identity of its author(s) or compiler(s) has been debated throughout history. It {{is one of the most}} significant treatises in Chinese cosmogony. As with most other ancient Chinese philosophers, Laozi often explains his ideas by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. In fact, the whole book can be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> an analogy – the ruler is the awareness, or self, in meditation and the myriad creatures or empire is the experience of the body, senses and desires.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Tenniel drew {{a famous}} {{illustration}} of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, c. 1865. The caterpillar is {{seated on a}} toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image can be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. Eric Carle's children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and {{the days of the}} week.|$|E
5|$|The 64 {{original}} notations of the hexagrams in the IChing {{can also}} be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a meditation on how change occurs, so it assists Taoists with managing yin and yang cycles as Laozi advocated in the Tao Te Ching (the oldest known version of this text was dated to 400 BCE). More recently as recorded in the 18th century, the Taoist master Liu Yiming continued to advocate this usage.|$|E
5|$|The {{story has}} been <b>read</b> <b>as</b> an {{analysis}} of race relations, not {{between black and white}} but within the black community, exploring its own color and class prejudices. The main character dreams of becoming white but ultimately seems to accept being black and the full history of African Americans in the United States. The ending of the story, however, has been called ambiguous and leaves several questions unanswered.|$|E

Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and so it must exist. This can be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|E
5|$|Trollope leapt {{into the}} fray {{somewhat}} belatedly, {{in the pages of}} Saint Paul's in October 1869, with an article on the Formosa controversy that can be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> a defence of and an advertisement for The Vicar. He took exception to several of the arguments in The Times: young women of the 1860s, he wrote, were not unaware of the existence of prostitution; and attempting to keep them in ignorance would not conduce to virtue. Rather than promoting vice, an accurate depiction of the squalid and miserable life of a woman of the streets would arm young people to resist temptation.|$|E
