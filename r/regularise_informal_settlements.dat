The case study of Ocho Rios involves mapping, charting, and defining this resort town’s island tourism space. The paper questions the effectiveness of broad government programmes aimed at addressing <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> {{at a time when}} governance actors and Jamaica’s tourism policy agenda prioritise land use that accommodates a diversified and spatially growing tourism industry. Findings show that government programmes have been insufficiently responsive to <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> located in the Ocho Rios tourism space {{for a number of reasons}} and that attempts to address the <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> are often beset by corruption and a lack of trust between residents and the government. Under the current tourism policy agenda, regularisation of existing <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> is not feasible in light of the high real estate value of lands surrounding tourist resort towns.

The reasons for this dynamical behaviour are manifold and are not matter of this article. Nevertheless, <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> represent a status quo of housing and living conditions which is from a humanitarian point of view in the most cases below acceptable levels. Sub-standard sanitary situations and high crime rates are only a few of attributes which go aside with the phenomenon <b>informal</b> <b>settlement.</b> Due to their informal character, reliable and accurate data about <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> and their inhabitants is rarely available. On the other side there is a strong need to transform <b>informal</b> into formal <b>settlements</b> and to gain more control about the actual spatial development of <b>informal</b> <b>settlements.</b> Consequently, reliable procedures for detecting and monitoring the spatial behaviour of <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> are required in order to react at an early stage to changing housing situations.

Underlying this choice of methodology is the realisation that current <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> intervention in Brazil differs considerably from South Africa, despite broad parallels in socio-political process throughout the 20 th century. I introduce the contrast between <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> intervention in South Africa and Brazil, by situating the debates and practice {{in each of the}} two countries in relation to those presented in the international literature. I then explore the causes of this contrast through a socio-political comparison of the emergence of <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> in the two countries throughout the 20 th century, and of·the responses to <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> from the various sectors of society, as portrayed in the South African and Brazilian literature respectively.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} expected that <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> {{in developing countries}} have a smaller ecological footprint than more economically advantaged areas because they consume fewer resources and use less energy. In this paper we examine this idea by comparing material consumption of two <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> to one moderate socio-economic status (SES) neighbourhood in Suva, Fiji. We use {{the concept of the}} Ecological Footprint (EF) as a metric of comparison. Using a component-based EF approach we administered a questionnaire to 150 respondents from two <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> and one adjacent planned neighbourhood. Total EF and separate EF components (water, food, transport, energy, clothing, and material assets) were analysed through graphs, by examination of descriptive statistics, and through the use of non-parametric inferential statistics. We found differences between the adjacent planned neighbourhood and the <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> for several EF components, but found no difference for other EF components (e. g. water consumption). Through questionnaires and interviews we also examined perceived level of concern for environmental threats of <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> dwellers and residents of an adjacent moderate SES neighbourhood who share the same geographic space, but have very different living conditions. We found that concerns about sewage, deforestation, clean water and poor sanitation were of particularly high concern in one <b>informal</b> <b>settlement,</b> but not the other, suggesting that perceptions of threat can be very different even among <b>informal</b> <b>settlements.</b> We conclude that {{a better understanding of the}} social characteristics of <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> is valuable for <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> urban planning decisions in developing countries...|$|R

Using a case study strategy, the study was conducted in Dar es Salaam city focusing on Makongo mixed <b>informal</b> <b>settlement.</b> The results show that mixed <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> are as a result of several factors including uncoordinated energies of people. The urban development forces that bring change in the development of the city are stronger than the public states capacity to coordinate and manage them. <b>Informal</b> <b>settlements</b> also offer user-friendly land tenure, flexibility in house construction and proximity to livelihoods. Other factors include the nature of socio-economic living patterns and extension of urban boundaries. Community members operate using social norms. Advantages of mixed <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> include availability of plots according to needs and affordability while a disadvantage is, people of different socio-economic groups perceive problems differently.

Likely, the paper provides viable options on how community initiated land regularisation process can be enhanced within public-private management domains for improving the livelihoods of the poor in <b>informal</b> <b>settlements.</b> The paper concludes by providing the future outlook on how cities can adopt land regularisation process and therefore enhancing community development and growth process in rapidly urbanising cities of Sub-Saharan Africa with the same contexts...|$|R
40|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>settlements</b> come in {{many forms}} and there are {{different}} expressions to describe them – illegal settlement or squatter settlement is some examples. Definitions of <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> emphasize lack of ownership or non-compliance with the authorities’ regulations. However they are tolerated to some degree by the authorities and {{are unlikely to be}} evicted or tested in court, which gives a sense of tenure security but no actual rights. This report aims to create a better understanding for the issue “informal settlements” from the perspective of spatial planning. “Informal settlements” is an issue that can be discussed from a numerous of different angles, such as failure of planning, economy and the state role in poverty reduction strategies. The research question is formulated with the intention of fulfilling the aim and goal with this report - How does Kosovo deal with <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> and why is there need for actions? The characteristics and function of <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> vary depending on where it is located in the country and world. For a greater understanding of the phenomenon history is important, because every place has its special story to how and why <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> has developed. In Kosovo the <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> has developed overtime, during wars and changes of governance. Weakness in governance has also contributed to the situation, which can be explained by poor economy. Kosovo has been struggling with week governance for decades which has resulted in: ineffective planning, unenforceable regulation and demanding registration procedures. <b>Informal</b> <b>settlements</b> and illegal buildings are wide spread. Although in 2005 Kosovo signed the Vienna Declaration, which obliges them to act on <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> – securing a sustainable development and the human rights. <b>Informal</b> <b>settlement</b> is an issue that needs to be dealt with for many reasons such as clarifying ownership and getting the areas included in the city’s development, but also to create security of tenure for the people living in these settlements. How to approach the issues concerning <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> vary and is depending on the conditions of the settlements – there is no one-fit-all solution. The approaches can be legalization, regularization, upgrading or relocation. However, to get in order with the issue a stable and powerful government is needed, since economical and political strength is essential...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa {{there are}} many <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> {{experiencing}} worsening socio-economic living conditions, along with associated environmental and urban open space degradation. These socio-spatial problems have increasingly attracted attention and responses from the South African government and researchers. Urban designers and architects as design professionals can make use of their visual-spatial skills to play a leading role towards developing sustainable and enabling urban open spaces in <b>informal</b> <b>settlements.</b> This study employed visual assessment {{as a tool for}} urban designers and architects to address socio-spatial problems in <b>informal</b> <b>settlements.</b> A visual research methodology was explored, using Khutsong Section <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> as a vehicle so as to formulate a generalised approach to the upgrading of <b>informal</b> <b>settlements.</b> The study area, Khutsong Section, is located in Ivory Park township within the City of Johannesburg. The visual-spatial design process gained from the context of the study, visual analysis and interpretation of precedents as well as the analysis and understanding of the study area. The context-informed and -driven urban open space design process resulted in an integrative and consolidated spatial solution for Khutsong Section. The understanding obtained of specific socio-economic activities imbedded in prevailing spatial elements and features in <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> has a broader applicability in the urban design and architecture professions. Therefore, the application of the visual research method in this study contributes towards positioning urban designers and architects to be visionaries and pioneers in the sustainable upgrading of <b>informal</b> <b>settlements.</b> Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 ArchitecturePhDUnrestricte...|$|R
