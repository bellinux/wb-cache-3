25|$|The Acorn Archimedes version, ArcElite (1991), {{written by}} Warren Burch & Clive Gringras and {{regarded}} by Stuff magazine {{as the best}} conversion of the original game, added intelligent opponents who engage in their own private battles and police who take an active interest in protecting the law. As well as such gameplay enhancements, the version also exploited the more modern hardware by using polygon mesh graphics {{in place of the}} wire-frames. The game world no longer seems to be centred around the player; freighter fleets with escorts go about their own business, pirate formations patrol lawless systems looking for cargo to loot and mining ships can often be found breaking up asteroids for their mineral content. Unlike the mythical Generation Ships of the original, rare occurrences of other non-pirate entities mentioned in the manual <b>really</b> <b>can</b> be found in the Archimedes version: geometric formations of space beacons; hermits living among the asteroids; abandoned ships towed by police (although Dredgers and Generation Ships are confirmed not to exist in Archimedes Elite). The Archimedes version of Elite was originally written to be a space trading game called Trojan - however the obvious similarities eventually meant that to avoid a potential lawsuit Trojan had to become an official Elite conversion. ArcElite was {{one of a number of}} games released for free by The Icon Bar website in 2006.|$|E

As the music video continues, Kills repeatedly reenters the set {{with her parents}} as their relationship starts to [...] "spiral". The video ends with a Christmas home movie of Kills' family. Various suggestions of domestic abuse, illegal business, problems with the law and drug addiction [...] are presented throughout the video. Bradley Stern from MuuMuse thought the music video was a metaphor for Kills' personal life, commenting: [...] "As much as she escapes the room, she always winds up walking back inside. She never <b>really</b> <b>can</b> escape her past." ...|$|E

Comparing his accompaniments on piano and Fender Rhodes, he said that: I play some of the same chords on the piano, but there are definitely things I would do on the piano because it's a more transparent instrument that I wouldn't do on the Rhodes. [...] The Rhodes is so strong that when you play something on it, it <b>really</b> <b>can</b> dictate, because it's louder and the timbre is much more opaque. So you leave more holes. On the piano, I would maybe play more sustain chords.|$|E

[...] 'Borderline' was out at that time and I said, 'Excuse me? This is for Madonna? <b>Really?</b> <b>Can</b> she sing a song like this?' Jon and I were surprised at the choice of artist at the time, {{if you want to know}} the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Fix a Heart" [...] is a pop piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is composed in the key of C major and has a tempo of 54 beats per minute. Lovato's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. The singer performs the verses in a low register, while the chorus is sang in a higher note. Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu noted that the singer's voice [...] "never go full power, only for the chorus". Similarly, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that the artist [...] "breaks from a whisper into [...] stadium-size refrain". The track {{has been described by}} some critics and the singer herself as a break-up song, which is demonstrated in the chorus, [...] "Baby, I just ran out of bandaids / I don't even know where to start / 'Cause you can bandage the damage / You never <b>really</b> <b>can</b> fix a heart". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy wrote that Lovato [...] "openly admits her weaknesses, including an ability to move on from a broken heart left behind by a former love". Regarding the line [...] "You never <b>really</b> <b>can</b> fix a heart", the artist told Glamour that, [...] "I think every time you get your heart broken, there's a little piece of it that chips away, and I don't think you ever get that piece back. But I think you're able to bandage it with time and with new people and other things that make you happy".|$|E

The music video for the single was directed by Vaughan Arnell and filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood. [...] "Morning Sun" [...] peaked at number 45 on the UK Singles Chart, making it Williams' first single not to enter the top 40. Jude Rogers from The Quietus said that the song features a vocal [...] "that shows what his voice <b>really</b> <b>can</b> do" [...] and that [...] "Even a middle-eight that nods towards the trippy oompah of 'I Am the Walrus' can't change a mood that is both grand but melancholy, epic but reflective." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Ike's Wee Wee" [...] {{raises the}} {{question}} of who <b>really</b> <b>can</b> be considered one's family. At first, Kyle's implicit idea is that family consists of [...] "those for whom we care that are related by blood". Based on this viewing of family, he no longer feels the need to help Ike when he learns that they are not related by blood. As the story progresses, Kyle questions his initial beliefs, and forms the episode's central moral by saying that [...] "Family isn't about whose blood you have. It's about who you care about." [...] Thus, Kyle's reformed view of family not only includes his adopted brother, but his friends as well. Kyle's questioning of his own morals has been likened to engaging in the dialectical Socratic method of inquiry.|$|E
500|$|Laurence Green of musicOMH said, [...] "'Fix a Heart' and 'Skyscraper' {{achieve the}} {{maturity}} the album's opening moments were {{crying out for}} – trembling, beautiful creations built on sweeping, rhapsodic interplays of piano chords and strings". Adam R. Holz of Plugged In included the song among the [...] "objectionable content" [...] on the record because of its [...] "sad" [...] themes. In 2015, singer Sam Smith wrote on Twitter, [...] "You never <b>really</b> <b>can</b> fix a heart", to which Lovato replied, [...] "let's do a remake of that song together". After this, the hashtag #DemiLovatoFeatSamSmith became a trending topic on the website. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that releasing a remix of the track alongside Smith would be a [...] "wise" [...] idea. The collaboration, however, never materialized.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer lent {{her voice}} for the {{character}} of goddess of chaos Eris in [...] (2003), an animated film featuring Brad Pitt {{as the voice of}} Sinbad the Sailor. She had struggles with finding the character's villainies. Initially the character was [...] "too sexual," [...] then she lacked fun. After the third rewrite, Pfeiffer called producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him [...] "You know, you <b>really</b> <b>can</b> fire me.", but he assured her that this was just part of the process. Following the release of the film, she took a four-year hiatus from acting, during which she remained largely {{out of the public eye}} to devote time to her husband and children. At the time, she turned down the role of the White Witch in the fantasy film [...] (2005), which went to Tilda Swinton.|$|E

500|$|Director Vallée {{used his}} {{background}} as a DJ to [...] "create a structure for a film using music with the right rhythm and balance. I wanted to combine classical pieces with a rock spirit". During filming Vallée often played rock music, such as the Rolling Stones, to create the right [...] "mood" [...] before a scene. Executive producer Colin Vaines knew composer Ilan Eshkeri, and hired him for the film. Sinéad O'Connor performed [...] "Only You", which O'Sullivan described as [...] "very much in line {{with one of the}} overriding aims of the film, which was to be hopeful and tell people that these amazing love stories <b>really</b> <b>can</b> happen, it’s not just a fairy tale."

And that <b>really</b> <b>can</b> affect you, and feeling helpless and hopeless, and finding that person that you can trust, that adult, like I did later on in life, that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues, my worries, my pains, my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project is really all about. And they have a 24-hour hotline... There's someone there that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you." [...] She made an official It Gets Better video which was released on December 1, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{said the}} film [...] "succeeds well enough as a genial {{diversion}} {{and sometimes a}} delightful one, predicated on the rarely heeded Hollywood wisdom that less <b>really</b> <b>can</b> be more." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, [...] "Although the story dynamics are fundamentally silly and the family stuff, with its parallel father-daughter melodrama, is elemental button-pushing, a good cast led by a winning Paul Rudd puts the nonsense over in reasonably disarming fashion." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Playful in unexpected ways and graced with a genuinely off-center sense of humor, Ant-Man (engagingly directed by Peyton Reed) is light on its feet the way the standard-issue Marvel behemoths never are." [...] Kim Newman of Empire wrote that it [...] "straddles as many genres as the Avengers films have characters but manages to do most of them pretty well. Extremely likable, with {{a few moments of}} proper wonder." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] "This film is a passable piece of drone work from the ever-expanding Marvel-Disney colony." ...|$|E

500|$|The ESRB's {{review process}} {{involves}} the submission, by the game's publisher, {{of a video}} which captures all [...] "pertinent content" [...] in the game, where pertinent content is defined as any content that accurately reflects both the [...] "most extreme content of the final product" [...] and [...] "the final product as a whole." [...] That is to say, it must depict the [...] "relative frequency" [...] of said content. As ESRB President Patricia Vance explains it, the ESRB would not just want a [...] "tape of one extreme cut to another," [...] but rather [...] "context for the storyline, the missions, the features and functionality of a game, so that the raters <b>really</b> <b>can</b> get exposed to a pretty reasonable sense of what they'd experience playing the game." [...] The fact that the content of Oblivion under investigation was inaccessible during normal play made {{no difference in the}} decision. ESRB policy had been [...] "absolutely clear" [...] since the Hot Coffee controversy, Patricia Vance told a reporter. Publishers were told that they could not leave unfinished or other pertinent content on a disc. If locked-out content was [...] "pertinent to a rating," [...] ESRB policy stated that it needed to be disclosed, and Bethesda had not done so.|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, after Marvel Studios was {{integrated}} into The Walt Disney Studios with Feige reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter, {{it was reported}} that the studios' creative committee would have [...] "nominal" [...] input on the films moving forward, though would continue to consult on Marvel Television productions, which remained under Perlmutter's control. All key film decisions going forward will be made by Feige, D'Esposito and Victoria Alonso. At the end of the month, on how much story is developed for future films of the universe, Feige said there are [...] "broad strokes" [...] though sometime [...] "super-specific things. But for the most part, in broad strokes that are broad enough and loose enough that, if through the development of four of five movies {{before we get to the}} culmination ... we still have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that we end up. So that all the movies, hopefully when they're finished, will feel like they're all interconnected and meant to be and planned far ahead, but <b>really</b> <b>can</b> live and breathe enough as individual movies to be satisfying each and of themselves." [...] The studio also has various contingency plans for the direction of all of their films, in the event they are unable to secure a certain actor to reprise a role, or re-acquire the film rights to a character, such as was done in February 2015 with Spider-Man.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Sheen starred {{opposite}} Carey Mulligan in {{the romantic}} drama Far from the Madding Crowd as prosperous bachelor William Boldwood. His performance was well received. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker remarked: [...] "How you prevent such a fellow, crushed {{by his own}} decency, from sagging into a bearded Ashley Wilkes is no easy task, yet Sheen succeeds, and Boldwood's brave smile grows dreadful to behold." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club found the character [...] "pitiful, and sometimes downright painful to watch. He's not Hardy's Boldwood, but he's a Boldwood. The only sad, genuine moment of the film belongs to him." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian remarked that Sheen's face [...] "is etched with agony and an awful kind of abject adoration, forever {{trying to find ways}} to forgive the loved one in advance for rejection. When Sheen's Boldwood confides to Oak that he feels [...] "grief" [...] you <b>really</b> <b>can</b> feel his pain." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice also referred to the scene where Boldwood expressed his grief, commenting: [...] "Sheen's performance is fine-grained, and the pure Englishness of his understatement is heartrending." [...] Also in 2015, Sheen had well-received comedic television performances in Comedy Bang! Bang!, The Spoils Before Dying and 7 Days in Hell. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times said his television host in 7 Days in Hell was [...] "played with damp lechery and cigarette-ash mastery." [...] Liz Shannon Miller of Indiewire said he may have [...] "stolen the show" [...] while John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter described him as the [...] "scene-stealer of the bunch." ...|$|E

James Montgomery from MTV News, praised the song saying that the [...] "elastic-yet-lock-step energy not only makes the song the perfect comeback single for a band that's been gone for far too long, but it manages to capture the very essence of what inspired them to press on." [...] Tom Goodwyn of the same publication wrote: [...] "A big thumping drumbeat and driving guitar riff kick things off, before giving way to a stomping chorus written with NFL stadiums in mind." [...] Karen Bliss of the magazine Rolling Stone praised Lee's [...] "haunting" [...] and [...] "crystalline" [...] vocals in the [...] "industrial-strength sound" [...] of [...] "What You Want". Nick Catucci of the same publication gave the song three stars writing, [...] "Amy Lee trades anguish for defiance, goosing her wail with welcome sass. Still, she's nearly overrun by the music, a collision of two-ton guitars, strings and piano." [...] Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club wrote: [...] "Lee <b>really</b> <b>can</b> sing, and the opener 'What You Want' shows she has the pipes (and even the submerged spunk) to become the new Pat Benatar this generation desperately needs." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave the song five out of five stars praising the hook as one of the best in the band's career adding that it managed to make the song [...] "instantly unforgettable".

2500|$|In a {{biography}} for The Skeptics Society, Schell cites an essay by Junior Skeptic Magazine Editor Daniel Loxton, [...] "Where {{do we go}} from here?", as a source of inspiration for her skeptical outreach. “It brought home just how much work there really is to do, but it also helped me understand that we can move beyond simply being skeptics ourselves.
