5|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} railways during railway mania caused coaching services to dry up. Along {{with many other}} turnpike routes, the New Direct Road fell into disrepair during the 19th century owing {{to a lack of}} funds and available staff. By the turn of the 20th century, it had become little more than a <b>rough</b> <b>track</b> in places, making it difficult to drive on.|$|E
25|$|The {{first light}} keeper at the Caloundra Head Lightstation was {{appointed}} {{when the light}} became operational in September 1896. One room of his cottage functioned as a postal receiving office, complete with telegraph facilities, with the light keeper appointed as the receiving office keeper. In 1910 the telegraph service was discontinued but {{was replaced by a}} telephone service in 1912. The post office remained at the lighthouse until 1934 and as a result, a <b>rough</b> <b>track</b> along the ridge was created by a steady stream of local residents, helping to foster closer settlement around the lighthouse in the immediate years after its erection. This <b>rough</b> <b>track</b> eventually became Canberra Terrace. As a married man with a large family, the arrival of the first lightkeeper also led to the establishment of the first Caloundra School, which for several months in the late 1890s was conducted at the light keeper's cottage.|$|E
25|$|Under {{cover of}} darkness, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{advanced}} north along a very <b>rough</b> <b>track</b> and by daylight had reached {{just east of}} the Neby Musa position. They made a dismounted attack while British infantry attacked Neby Musa from the rear. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment occupied Neby Musa at daylight after crossing the gorge on foot to find the Ottoman garrison had withdrawn with their guns.|$|E

25|$|The {{critical}} {{decision was}} made on 14 March when Thiệu met with Phu. Thiệu had decided to abandon Pleiku and Kon Tum so that the II Corps forces could concentrate on retaking Buôn Ma Thuột, which he considered more important. Phu then decided that the only possible means of doing this was to retreat to the coast along Interprovincial Route 7B, a dilapidated, <b>rough</b> <b>track</b> with several downed bridges, before recuperating and counterattacking back into the highlands.|$|E
25|$|After {{establishing}} the colony at Sydney Cove in early 1788, a second settlement was established at Rose Hill (now called Parramatta) {{later that same}} year to establish farms to feed the people. Within a year or so, a rough land route had been established between the two settlements, traversing through {{the territory of the}} Cadigal, Wangal and Burramattagal people. This <b>rough</b> <b>track</b> later became the main artery of the expanding Greater Sydney and, as the northern boundary of what is now Croydon, influenced modern settlement in the area.|$|E
25|$|By 1790, a <b>rough</b> <b>track</b> {{had been}} built between the colony's two {{settlements}} at Sydney Cove and Parramatta. This route later became the main artery of the expanding Greater Sydney and, as the northern boundary {{of what is now}} Ashfield, dictated early British settlement in the area. The first land grant in the area was made to Rev Richard Johnson in 1793 and all of it had been granted by 1810. By the 1820s, all the grants had been amalgamated into two large estates: Ashfield Park (the northern half between Liverpool Rd and Parramatta Rd) and Canterbury Estate (the area south of Liverpool Rd). Ashfield Park was named by Robert Campbell, whose father was the laird of Ashfield in Scotland.|$|E
50|$|European {{settlement}} of the area {{dates back to the}} 1870s. The remoteness of the area initially limited access to seagoing vessels, with some <b>rough</b> <b>tracks</b> from the north and east.|$|R

25|$|Therapy? were a {{last minute}} {{replacement}} for Biffy Clyro on the Jägermeister Rock Liga tour of Germany which lasted five dates in February 2008. These dates {{were the only}} gigs played in 2008 as the band focused their energies exclusively on recording the new record. Therapy? began recording the new album in late July at Blast Studios in Newcastle and finished recording by late August. It was produced by Andy Gill. Video of rehearsals surfaced on Therapy?'s website offering previews of the new work, showcasing a more rythmetic jazz-influenced direction (Rehearsal), alongside a <b>rough</b> <b>track</b> typical of newer Therapy? output (Clowns Galore). The album, entitled Crooked Timber, was released on 23 March 2009 via Blast Records/Global Music. The band performed the new album in its entirety on selected live dates in May, played various European festivals throughout the summer (including a debut appearance at Oxegen in Ireland and a second outing at England's Download) and toured Europe extensively from October to December.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1923, Duff {{learned of}} a new 24Hour race {{to be held at}} Le Mans. He was the first entrant. W. O. Bentley, the founder and then-owner of Bentley Motors, thought it was madness and that no car would finish. In the face of Duff’s determination, he agreed to have the car {{prepared}} at the factory and let his test driver, Frank Clement, partner Duff. The Duff/Clement Bentley was one of the fastest cars, Duff setting the fastest lap at 9 mins 39 sec for the 10.726 mile lap. <b>Rough</b> <b>track</b> conditions took their toll as a flying stone holed the fuel tank, forcing Duff to run back to the pits. As only the drivers could work on the cars, Clement had to bicycle back with a can of gas to power the car back to the pits. Despite the drama, Duff and Clement finished a strong fourth. More importantly, W.O. Bentley, who only went over at the last minute, became hooked on Le Mans, the race that would make his cars famous.|$|E
500|$|Amtrak leased two RTG {{trainsets}} from ANF in August 1973, at $85,000 per month. These {{were based}} out of Chicago, and initially served the Chicago–St. Louis corridor. Amtrak heralded the Turboliners as the [...] "biggest travel {{news since the}} 747". David P. Morgan, editor-in-chief of Trains magazine, was aboard for the initial run from Chicago to St. Louis on September 28, 1973 and came away with mixed impressions. He praised the large picture windows, comparing them favorably with the [...] "rifle-slot-size" [...] windows on the Budd Metroliner, but faulted the narrow aisles, difficult-to-navigate vestibules, and seat comfort. He found that the trains [...] " [...] reasonably well", even on <b>rough</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, {{transport}} infrastructure {{was limited to}} <b>rough</b> <b>tracks</b> and railways constructed to access mining, timber and agricultural resources. It {{was not until the}} 1920s, with the rise of the motor car and the construction of tourist roads by the Queensland Government, that tourism accelerated in the region.|$|R
50|$|Shaybah was {{developed}} {{for the purposes of}} exploiting the Shaybah oilfield. It was established by Saudi Aramco during the 1990s, and, prior to this, only the <b>rough</b> <b>tracks</b> used by early exploration teams existed in this isolated desert region. All materials for the establishment and construction of Shaybah were transported the 800 kilometres from Dhahran to Shaybah by road.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is usually}} a fire-tube boiler with a locomotive-type firebox. However, some designs (e.g. the Marshall [...] "Britannia" [...] (pictured)) have circular, marine-type, fireboxes. This latter type were also known by British {{manufacturers}} as 'colonial' boilers, as they were mainly intended for export to 'the Colonies', and had a high ground clearance for travelling along <b>rough</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
500|$|The fall of Bonga put the Japanese forces {{firmly on}} the back foot; their supply route through Bonga having been cut, they had to send {{supplies}} and reinforcements along the <b>rough</b> <b>track</b> that passed between Kiligia and Wareo. The next step for the Australians was the capture of Gusika to the north on the coast and a position known as [...] "Horace's Ears" [...] further inland to the west. To that point, the advance had been going well for the Australians, so they split their forces, with the 2/28th pushing on to Gusika and the 2/43rd turning west towards [...] "Horace". At this point the Australian forces received a boost {{in the form of}} the 4th Infantry Brigade, which was assigned to the 9th Division to begin the advance north up the coastal track towards the high features that existed around Fortification Point. At the same time, the 24th Infantry Brigade would advance on Wareo from Bonga, in the east.|$|E
500|$|The full {{expedition}} set {{out from}} Fort Western on September25. [...] Morgan's riflemen led the way, blazing trails when necessary. [...] Colburn and a crew of boatwrights came in the rear, to repair bateaux as needed. [...] Morgan's group traveled relatively lightly, as they would be working to make the trail, while the last group, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Enos, carried {{the bulk of the}} supplies. [...] The expedition arrived at its first target, Fort Halifax, a decaying relic of the French and Indian War, on the second day. [...] There was a <b>rough</b> <b>track</b> from Fort Western, so some of the men and supplies had moved overland rather than in the bateaux that had to be portaged around the falls above Fort Western to begin the trip. [...] Arnold, rather than traveling in a heavy bateau, traveled in a lighter canoe so that he might move more rapidly among the troops along the travel route.|$|E
2500|$|The Eyre Highway, which connects Norseman in Western Australia to Port Augusta, {{was carved}} across the {{continent}} in 1941. At first it {{was little more than}} a <b>rough</b> <b>track,</b> but was gradually sealed over the next thirty years. [...] The last unsealed section of the Eyre Highway was finally sealed in 1976. Unlike the railway, though, it crosses the plain at its southernmost edge rather than through the centre.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} bulk of his army made the trip from Skenesboro to Fort Edward in just five days, the army's lack of {{adequate}} transport served to delay the army again, as the supply train, hampered by a lack of draft animals and carts and wagons that were capable of dealing with the <b>rough</b> <b>tracks</b> through the wilderness, took time to follow.|$|R

2500|$|In {{their early}} years, the club played their cricket on land {{adjacent}} to the Manchester Botanical Garden and leased from the Trafford family. In 1856, Sir Humphrey de Trafford identified this land as being an ideal location for the planned Manchester Art and Treasures Exhibition. Sir Humphrey {{was a member of}} the Executive Committee planning the exhibition who offered Manchester Cricket Club £500 in compensation for the remainder of their lease. The club, however, insisted on a figure of £1,000 and agreed to vacate the site ahead of the 1857 season, moving to the inferior location (as it was further from transport links and only accessible via a long <b>rough</b> <b>track)</b> that subsequently became Old Trafford Cricket Ground, the home of Lancashire cricket ever since.|$|E

5000|$|The part of {{the road}} called the [...] "Mackinnon road" [...] linked Mombasa and Kibwezi. It was built by an Australian called George Wilson.

25|$|The first caliper-type {{automobile}} {{disc brake}} was patented by Frederick William Lanchester in his Birmingham factory in 1902 and used successfully on Lanchester cars.
