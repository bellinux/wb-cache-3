40|$|PURPOSE: Study of {{the radical}} {{mechanisms}} in the <b>radiosterilization</b> of metoprolol tartrate aqueous solutions {{in order to determine}} the parameters governing its radiostability. METHODS: Pulse radiolysis with pseudo-first-order kinetics to measure Ihe reaction rate constants of hydrated electrons and hydroxyl radicals with metoprolol tartrate. Chemsimul was used to solve the decay kinetics of transients and to simulate the radiolysis of metoprolol tartrate solutions. RESULTS: Hydrated electrons react with metoprolol and the tartrate ion with rate constants of 6. 8 x 10 (7) M(- 1) s(- 1) and 1. 7 x 10 (7) M(- 1) s(- 1), respectively. Hydroxyl radicals react with metoprolol and the tartrate ion with rate constants of 5. 2 x 10 (9) M(- 1) s(- 1) and 5. 5 x 10 (8) M(- 1) s(- 1), respectively. The hydroxyl-metoprolol transients are found to scavenge the superoxide anion (5. 5 x 10 (10) M(- 1) s(- 1)), react with oxygen (1. 0 x 10 (8) M(- 1) s(- 1)), and follow a biradical decay (2. 0 x 10 (8) M(- 1) s(- 1). A simplified radical mechanism is used to simulate the loss of potency of metoprolol tartrate aqueous solutions during <b>radiosterilization.</b> CONCLUSIONS: To decrease the loss of potency of metoprolol tartrate. the sterilization dose must be lowered and very high dose rates used...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} a simple preliminary test {{to determine whether}} a drug is sufficiently radioresistant to withstand <b>radiosterilization.</b> The test is based on the electron spin resonance (ESR) detection of radicals produced after irradiation of a solid-state drug, assuming that these radicals are the precursors of the final products detected after dissolution of the drug. A calibration curve has therefore been established by measuring ESR spectra of l-alanine irradiated at different doses. The response factor to quantify the radicals is the normalized double integration (DI) of the whole first-derivative ESR spectrum. The curve gives the relationship between the normalized DI and the number of radicals. Eight beta blockers have been chosen and their radical yield determined. This {{is the first time that}} several different drugs of the same pharmacological group have been studied and compared. The results obtained are similar for seven of the eight beta blockers; the mean G value (excepted for nadolol) is 3 x 10 (- 9) mol/J. This means that beta blockers are radioresistant. The two most radiosensitive drugs (nadolol and esmolol hydrochloride) were also studied by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). No significant loss of the active compound was detected, which confirms this radioresistant property. Moreover, no change in color or smell was observed. Using ESR and HPLC, beta blockers were identified as potential candidates for <b>radiosterilization...</b>|$|E
40|$|Can {{the absence}} of {{increased}} toxicological danger in irradiated foods be applied with confidence to drugs ? The World Health Organization stated that up to 10 kGy there is no toxicological hazard. However, even if the irradiated drugs meet official standards, {{it would have to}} be established that any traces of radiolysis product formed are not toxic. All the tests from PHARMACOPEIA are not appropriate to detect the radiolysis and new physicochemical tests have to be used. Chromatographic detection of the <b>radiosterilization</b> of antibiotics may be advantageously used when the pharmaceuticals are not radio-resistant. The main obstacle to pratical application is the low sensitivity of the detectors in liquid-liquid chromatography, a re-irradiation of the suspected samples will be necessary after preliminary chromatographic studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>radiosterilization</b> on the purity profile of {{cefotaxime}} {{were evaluated by}} a liquid chromatography-diode array method. Numerous new radiolytic compounds were detected in very small amount. They were quantified and it appeared that none was present above the level of 0. 1 % of the main compound and the total amount was only of 0. 72 %. Despite the low quantities present, some radiolytic compounds had UV spectra which could justify the apparition of a yellow coloration detected after irradiation. Others had UV spectra {{similar to that of}} cefotaxime, suggesting similarity in the molecular structures. Finally, some mechanisms of formation were proposed for four radiolytic compounds which were identified by mass spectrometry in a former study. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide insight into the {{processes}} that occur after the irradiation of solid-state drugs. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were performed at two different frequencies, X-band (about 9. 5 GHz) and Q-band (about 34 GHz), to identify the radicals present in irradiated captopril. The results confirmed that an irradiated drug can trap several main radicals. Moreover, the radical composition varied as a function of the treatment. In addition, non-volatile final products were studied by liquid chromatography coupled to UV and to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The variation of the radical composition did not influence the profile of the final products; this appears to indicate that, in the case of captopril, the trapped radicals observed by EPR are not the main precursors of the final products. Finally, high-performance liquid chromatography data appear to indicate that <b>radiosterilization</b> of captopril is feasible...|$|E
40|$|<b>Radiosterilization</b> induces radicals, {{and it is}} very {{important}} to describe radical mechanisms before the possible use of cephalosporins gamma sterilization. Moreover, physiological or radiotherapeutically induced free radicals also initiate radical mechanisms. For this study, pulse radiolysis was used. This method permits to avoid in vivo direct study difficulties of bioradical processes and gives quantitative data. Reactions of solvated electron (eaq-), hydroxyl radical (. OH), azide radical (N 3.), dibromine radical anions (Br 2. -), oxygen, and superoxide radical (O 2. -) with three cephalosporins have been studied. Absorption spectra and rate constants have been determined. It has been found that both eaq- and. OH quickly react (k congruent to 10 (10) mol- 1 L s- 1) with the molecules to give radicals with similar absorption spectra.

40|$|Before {{the use of}} {{radiations}} {{to sterilize}} cefotaxime sodium powder, four new products radioinduced must be identified and qualified. They have an apparent level of or above 0. 1 %, at the sterilization dose of 25 kGy and are potentially toxic. Their identification is difficult because these products are formed at very low concentrations and generally have a structure similar {{as that of the}} main compound. The method proposed is to irradiate the drug in aqueous solution in order to increase the yields in radiolysis products, to compare the retention time of the new products, measured by high performance liquid chromatography, with those obtained after the irradiation of the solid drug and to identify from the aqueous solution the products which are common. One common product was found after the irradiation of cefotaxime in solid state and in aqueous solution. It was easily identified from the irradiated aqueous solution as anticefotaxime.

40|$|The {{development}} of oxygen-sensitive paramagnetic materials is being actively pursued {{because of their}} potential applications for in vivo electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry. Among these materials, fusinite {{is of particular interest}} because of the high sensitivity of the EPR linewidth to the partial pressure pO 2. Although this material has led to a number of very useful results in experimental systems, its potential use in humans is limited by the need to prove that it will not cause deleterious effects. The strategy used in this study to optimize the biocompatibility of the oxygen-sensitive materials was to prepare small silicon implants containing the fusinite. The use of silicon permits the diffusion of oxygen inside the implant while the material does not have contact with the biological environment. <b>Radiosterilization</b> did not affect the pO 2 sensitivity of the material. The feasibility of performing pO 2 measurement was verified in vivo by periodically inducing ischemia in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice over a period of 6 weeks...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{radiopasteurization}} (0. 3 Mrad) and <b>radiosterilization</b> (3. 0 Mrad) on certain vitamins in canned fresh fillets of cod and dogfish and in vacuum packed smoked cod and herring, were studied. The effect of post-irradiation storage {{of the samples}} at appropriate temperatures on the vitamin contents was determined. Some differences between vitamin sensitivity to irradiation and storage among the various fish samples studied were noted. Thiamine {{was found to be}} most sensitive to both irradiation and storage of non irradiated samples. Irradiated samples lost little or no thiamine upon storage. Riboflavin was more sensitive to storage than to irradiation. Niacin and vitamin B 12 were not appreciably affected by irradiation or storage. Vitamin A appeared to be more radiosensitive in smoked than in fresh fish. Thus a sample of dogfish retained 50 percent of the vitamin A content after irradiation with 3. 0 Mrad.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{chemical}} modifications induced upon irradiation of solid human insulin at <b>radiosterilization</b> doses and investigate {{the influence of}} the absorbed dose on radiolysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volatile radiolytic products were monitored by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and non-volatile products by two different high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods: the formation of higher molecular weight proteins was assessed by size exclusion liquid chromatography whereas assays for related compounds and chemical potency tests were carried out using reverse-phase HPLC-UV. Conformational changes were investigated by measurements of circular dichroism. RESULTS: After gamma irradiation at 10 kGy, the recovery of insulin was 96. 8 %; higher molecular weight proteins accounted for 0. 35 % (relative peak area) and other related compounds (including A 21 desamido insulin) represented 1. 29 %. No major structural changes and no volatile radiolytic compounds were detected. CONCLUSION: Human insulin samples irradiated in the solid-state at 10 kGy (gamma rays) and 14 kGy (electron-beam) meet the European Pharmacopoeia requirements and can be considered as quite stable towards radiation from a chemical analysis viewpoint...|$|E
40|$|Polyanilines are {{reported}} to exhibit stabilizing effects in rubber mixtures submitted to gamma-irradiation and thermo-oxidative treatment. Such abilities {{may be explained by}} their action as radical scavengers. Since radical formation followed by main chain scission is a widely accepted mechanism for radiolytic degradation of PMMA, polyaniline is a promising additive for commercial plastics submitted to <b>radiosterilization</b> processing. In this work, we investigated the ability of polyaniline emeraldine salt nanofibers (PANF-HCl) in preventing radiation damage on PMMA matrix. Effects of gamma-irradiation on PMMA/PANF-HCl composites films were assessed by comparison of the variation of viscosity-average molar mass (Mv) of PMMA at 25 kGy dose when compared to commercial PMMA films. Samples containing 0. 15 % PANF-HCl (wt/wt) retained 92 % of the initial Mv after irradiation while control sample presented 42 % of Mv retention. When exposed to 60 - 200 kGy doses, PANF-HCl embedded into PMMA matrix preserved their oxidation state but started to exhibit mild deprotonation. PANF-HCl nanofibers were characterized by Diffuse Reflection Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM). PMMA/PANF-HCl composites films were characterized by SEM and UV-VIS spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The radiolytic {{products}} of eight beta-blockers were studied {{in order to}} understand the mechanisms of irradiation of drugs in the solid state. METHODS: The drugs were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector in order to observe the degradation of the main compound after irradiation and in order to study the nonvolatile final products on more concentrated solutions of irradiated drugs. RESULTS: The first test assessed that the main compound was not significantly degraded after gamma irradiation for any of the eight beta-blockers. A more complete study, which consisted on separating the nonvolatile products and on quantifying them, indicated first that the radiolytic products could reach the number of 14 and moreover that some could exceed the 0. 1 % threshold at 30 kGy. Eventually, radiolytic yields were compared with radical yields previously determined. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of the first test can be discussed. It seems that, to study the feasibility of the <b>radiosterilization,</b> a complete study of the {{products of}} degradation is needed. Moreover, no correlation between radical and final products could be established, which denies that the former would be the precursors of the latter...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} {{different}} doses of gamma radiation on two different members of sulfonamide (sulfacetamide and sulfametoxazole) commercial preparation were studied {{for the evaluation of}} the physibility of radiation as a sterilization method for this group of antibacterial agent. HPLC technique was performed to determine the radiolytic intermediates. All investigations were done in accordance with the requiring pharmacopoeia specification for pharmaceutical dosage forms. Because of being antibacterial in nature antimicrobial activity loss was also investigated in irradiated samples. Studies performed under normal environmental conditions were repeated for samples stored under accelerated stability conditions to investigate possible degradation mechanism and kinetics of irradiated dosage forms. Sulfanilamide was determined as degradation product by HPLC method. Both because of the low quantity and this group of drugs ’ showing their pharmacological effects by this metabolite, irradiated samples were considered chemically stable. No microbial activity loss and no harmful effect resulting from degradation products were seen in biological investigations also. As a result these commercial preparations were found to be stable in studied radiation doses. This study could be a model for industrial physibility studies of the <b>radiosterilization</b> of sulfa group drugs...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} of <b>radiosterilization</b> of drugs aqueous solutions and to evaluate the effects of some additives, such as mannitol, nicotinamide and pyridoxine, which might protect the drug from degradation. Metoclopramide was selected as a model drug. The structures of the degradation products were determined to gain insight on the radiolysis mechanisms in aqueous solution in order to design strategies to lower the drug degradation. Metoclopramide hydrochloride aqueous solutions with and without excipients were irradiated either with gamma rays or high-energy electrons. HPLC-DAD was used to measure the loss of chemical potency and to quantify the degradation products which were also characterized by LC–APCI–MS-MS. Metoclopramide recovery for gamma and electron beam-irradiated solutions containing either mannitol, pyridoxine or nicotinamide meets the pharmacopoeial specifications for metoclopramide content up to a 15 kGy irradiation so that metoclopramide solutions containing these excipients might be radiosterilized at 15 kGy either with gamma rays or high-energy electrons. Structures are proposed for the majority of radiolysis products. Similar radiolysis products were detected for gamma and electron beam irradiations but the chromatographic profiles were different (differences in the distribution of radiolysis products) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the specificities of the irradiation of drugs in frozen aqueous solution. The structures of the degradation products were determined to gain insight into the radiolysis mechanisms occurring in frozen aqueous solutions. Metoclopramide hydrochloride and metoprolol tartrate were chosen as models. The frozen solutions were irradiated at dry ice temperature by high energy electrons at various doses. The drug purity (chemical potency) and the radiolysis products were quantified by HPLC-DAD. Characterization of the degradation products was performed by LC-APCI-MS-MS. The structures of the radiolysis products detected in irradiated frozen aqueous solutions were compared to those detected in solid-state and aqueous solutions (previous studies). For both metoclopramide and metoprolol, solute loss upon irradiation of frozen aqueous solutions was negligible. Five radiolysis products present in traces were identified in irradiated metoclopramide frozen solutions. Three of them were previously identified in solid-state irradiated metoclopramide crystals. The two others were formed following reactions with the hydroxyl radical (indirect effect). Only one fragmentation product was observed in irradiated metoprolol frozen solutions. For both drugs, <b>radiosterilization</b> of frozen solutions, even at high doses (25 kGy), was found to be possible...|$|E
40|$|A {{most common}} problem {{encountered}} in <b>radiosterilization</b> of solid drugs is discoloration or yellowing. By pharmacopoeia method, discoloration {{can be assessed}} by measuring absorbance of solutions of irradiated solid samples at 450  nm. We propose to evaluate discoloration of solid samples directly by recording their diffuse reflectance spectra. Further, the reflectance spectrum is used to compute various color parameters: CIE XYZ tristimulus value, CIE Lab, Δ E_ab^ * (color difference), yellowness index (YI), dominant wavelength, and excitation purity by CIE method. The investigation of difference reflectance spectra and color parameters revealed that for fluoroquinolones, e-beam was more damaging than gamma radiation, whereas for cephalosporins, trend was reversed. The quantum of discoloration with gamma radiation and e-beam {{is found to be}} nearly equal when assessed by pharmacopeia method, and it is therefore inadequate to assess small color differences. The color parameters Δ E_ab^ * and ΔYI are found to be reliable indicators of discoloration. The tolerance limits proposed in terms of /Delta E_ab^ * and ΔYI are ± 2 and ± 10  U, respectively. The dominant wavelength for all compounds has shifted to higher values indicating change in hue but defining color tolerance limit with this parameter requires adjunct excitation purity value...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Study the {{radiolysis}} of solid-state metoclopramide hydrochloride {{at various}} absorbed doses. Elucidate {{the structure of}} the degradation products to gain information on the radiolysis mechanisms. Methods Solid-state metoclopramide samples were irradiated at several doses with gamma rays and high-energy electrons to evaluate the influence of the dose rate. High-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector was used to measure the chemical potency {{as a function of the}} absorbed dose and to quantify the degradation products. The characterization of degradation products was performed by liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/tandem mass spectrometry. Results The degradation of solid-state metoclopramide after irradiation was negligible. No qualitative or quantitative differences were observed between gamma and electron beam irradiations (no dose rate effect). Four degradation products that were similar to metoclopramide were detected in trace levels (below 0. 1 % of the drug concentration) and were not unique to irradiation because they were found in lower amounts in unirradiated metoclopramide. The major degradation product formed after radiation was due to the loss of the chlorine atom from the metoclopramide molecule. Conclusion Solid-state metoclopramide is radioresistant from a chemical point of view and therefore could be a suitable candidate for <b>radiosterilization</b> studies by either gamma rays or high-energy electrons...|$|E
40|$|Fundamental {{information}} on <b>radiosterilization</b> of ceftazidime {{was obtained by}} electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement of free radicals produced in gamma-ray-irradiated ceftazidime at 4. 2 - 295 K. Three types of free radicals are produced by gamma-irradiation. The first one shows septet lines in an ESR spectrum and decays at 230 K: it is assigned as a. C(CH 3) (2) COOH radical. The second one shows triplet lines and decays at 293 K: it is assigned as iminoxyl radicals (>C=N-O.). The third one shows a broad singlet line and survives even at 295 K. The plausible assignment of this spectrum is discussed. It is concluded that an O-C bond of the gamma-irradiated ceftazidime is ruptured, producing the iminoxyl radicals and. C(CH 3) (2) COOH radicals. The yields of free radicals increase linearly with the increasing dose of gamma-irradiation up to 10 kGy at 295 K as well as 77 K. Half of the radicals that show a broad singlet line survive at 295 K upon storage of the irradiated ceftazidime for 159 days. It is concluded that the ESR measurement of free radicals gives a good method for discrimination of irradiated antibiotics from non-irradiated ones and an estimation of an irradiation dose...|$|E
40|$|Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) is a {{well-known}} spectroscopic and imaging technique that can detect free radicals both in vitro and non-invasively in vivo, with high sensitivity. In food, free radicals can be generated by several commonly used industrial processes, such as <b>radiosterilization</b> or heat treatment. EPR spectroscopy has been widely used to detect radioinduced free radicals in food, but {{is limited to the}} measurement of the global response of a sample. EPR imaging (EPRI) allows the spin density distribution of free radicals to be mapped within objects. We investigated the possibility of acquiring 2 D and 3 D EPR images of the distribution of free radicals in various foodstuffs with naturally Occurring or induced free radicals, including frogs' legs, tea leaves, coffee beans, and sunflower seeds. Our results demonstrated that the free radicals contained in foodstuffs give EPR signals with characteristics compatible with the acquisition of high-quality images. Small-size structures (e. g., frog bones, 1. 0 - 1. 5 nm width) Could be delineated with accuracy. The strongest signals came from irradiated samples, but. low-intensity signals from naturally occurring free radicals Could also be imaged.
