5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron <b>reinforcing</b> <b>rods</b> built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E

For example, a well known ghost phenomenon is caused by interaction between incident and reflected waves caused due to the presence of large and tall buildings. The characteristics of the radio waves used in television broad casting absorption have been measured by coaxial-wave-guide unit or curtain wall specimens. But these measurements have some demerits. In this regards, a new measurement technique by panel specimen using parallel wire line was proposed recently. The electric wave absorption characteristics of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>rod</b> inside the <b>reinforced</b> concrete structures are examined using the recently proposed technique.

40|$|The use of fibre <b>reinforced</b> {{composite}} <b>rods</b> as concrete reinforcement material {{seems to}} be an effective solution to overcome durability problems of traditional steel reinforced concrete structures. The main advantages of fibre reinforced composite materials over steel include the excellent corrosive resistance, mechanical properties similar to steel, high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent fatigue resistance, among others [Alsayed et al, 2000], [Lees, J. M., 2001]. Typically, fibre <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> are produced by pultrusion, although, besides this technique, composite rods can also be produced using braiding techniques [Kadioglu, F. & Pidaparti, R. M., 2005], [Saikia, B. et al, 2005]. Braiding is a low cost technique that allows in-plane multiaxial orientation, conformability, excellent damage tolerance and core reinforcement [Soebroto et al, 1990], the production of ribbed structures and a wide range of mechanical properties may be improved when the core braided fabrics are reinforced with the appropriate type of fibres [Fangueiro et al, 2004, 2005 & 2006]. The current research work deals with the development of braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> for civil engineering applications, namely to reinforce concrete structures as a substitute of steel rebars. The mechanical properties of composite rods, produced by braiding, are influenced by the type of fibre used as braided fabric core reinforcement, among other parameters. The objective of this experimental work is to evaluate the influence of the type of core reinforcement fibres on the mechanical performance of braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods.</b> Several samples of braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> were produced using polyester fibres, for the production of braided fabrics, E-glass, carbon and HT polyethylene fibres, as braided fabrics core reinforcement, and polyester resin as polymeric matrix. Braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> were produced on a vertical braiding machine incorporating an impregnation system specially developed for this purpose. Different braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> were produced maintaining the braided fabric structure and varying the type of core reinforcement fibre. Composite <b>rods</b> were <b>reinforced</b> with a single type of reinforcement fibres as well as with two and three types of fibres, varying the percentage of each type. In order to evaluate the volume fraction of the different braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> produced, tests were performed according to the Portuguese Standard NP 2216 / 1988 (determination of mass loss by calcinations of glass fibre reinforced plastics). In order to evaluate the mechanical performance of the different braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> produced, tensile tests were carried out according to ASTM D 3916 - 94 standard, with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. A post-load of 50 KN was applied to the rods prior to performing the tensile tests. When compared to the steel rebars currently used in the construction industry, composite rods higher tensile strength. Current steel rebars, A 235 NL, A 400 NR/ER and A 500 NR/ER have values of tensile strength of 360 MPa, 460 MPa, and 550 MPa respectively. Composite rods present tensile strength higher than 550 MPa. Even though the tensile strength braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> is higher than that of steel rebars, composite rods have a lower modulus of elasticity when compared with the 210 GPa of steel rebars...|$|R
