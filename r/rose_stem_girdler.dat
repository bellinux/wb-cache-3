40|$|The cashew <b>stem</b> <b>girdler,</b> Analeptes trifasciata, {{is a major}} {{insect pest}} of cashew in Nigeria causing {{economic}} damage in cashew plantations even at low density. In this study, newly emerged adults of A. trifasciata reared from field-infested cashew stems were collected from the rearing cages, sexed, and dissected to reveal the internal structures of the insects. The gut was excised and separated into the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. The dissected gut compartments were blotted dry by sandwiching in sterile Whatman No. 1 (150 mm) filter paper for a minute. The inoculated gut parts showed the presence of eight fungi flora, namely, Aspergillus repens, Trichoderma spp., Fusarium verticillioides, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, yeast, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium spp., and Rhizopus stolonifer. The frequencies of occurrence of bacteria in the gut compartments of A. trifasciata were Enterobacter spp. : 83. 33 %; Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. : 55. 56 % each; Staphylococcus spp. : 44. 44 %; Klebsiella pneumonia : 50 % and Salmonella shigella : 11. 11 %, while each of Serratia marceascea, Pseudomonas spp., and Micrococcus lutea had 5. 56 % occurrence. The occurrence of mycoflora and microbiota species varied in the gut compartments of A. trifasciata, indicating the role of these microorganisms in metabolic and other bioprocesses of A. trifasciata during digestion and synthesis of complex food substances from the cashew stem substrate. This study would provide basic information for enzymatic studies of A. trifasciata {{with a view to}} developing an integrated pest management (IPM) protocol for managing the pest in cashew plantations...|$|R

The growth rate of the <b>rose</b> <b>stems</b> depends not only on the time-dependent ambient conditions within the greenhouse, which include temperature, relative humidity, CO$_ 2 $ concentration and light intensity, but also on the location and age distribution of the leaves and the form of the underlying rose bush supporting the crop...|$|R

40|$|Micro and {{nanostructure}} of petals {{and flowers}} of pink rose family having super hydrophobic {{phenomenon known as}} "lotus effect" was studied by optical and scanning probe microscopy. Quasi-ordered corrugated structure {{was found on the}} surface of the rose petals. It represents the ensemble of smoothed shape peaks like a lotus leaf structure. Structure saving during dehydration of rose petal (for 5 days) by drying in the air under normal conditions was found, the difference is apparent in the density of the arrangement and shape of the peaks, which in case of dehydrated rose petal have a smoother shape. Thus, the typical distance between the structure peaks of the native rose petal was 25 - 30 mkm, average peak height was 8 mkm, the peak width at half- height was about 15 mkm, peak top approximated by a sphere had a radius of about 2 - 3 mkm, the slope angle of the surface tangent to the peak axis was about 38 - 42 º. Characteristic distance between the peaks for a dried rose petal is reduced to 20 - 25 mkm, the average peak height was 8 mkm, the width of the peak at half - height was about 18 mkm, peak top approximated by a sphere had a radius of about 5 - 6 mkm, the slope angle of the surface tangent to the peak axis was about 40 - 50 º. A thin nanostructure of separate peak was examined on a dried petal, which consists of longitudinal bands of about 150 - 300 nm in height and about 2 - 3 mkm in width. While visualizing of <b>rose</b> <b>stem</b> leaves, a cellular structure with micro-pores and nanometer canals on the surface was discovered. The analysis of surface roughness on different parts of investigated objects was held. A single peak roughness was about 650 nm for a living rose petal, 300 nm for dried rose petal, roughness of the <b>rose</b> <b>stem</b> leaf was about 65 - 70 nm with sizes of scanned areas equal to 10 x 10 mkm.

40|$|Using {{detection}} of ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE), {{we tested the}} hypothesis that xylem blockage by bacteria in <b>rose</b> <b>stems</b> (Rosa hybrida L.) can induce cavitation. In both Madelon and Cara Mia roses, cavitation started when the bacterial count in vase water reached 108 ml- 1, {{although the number of}} cavitations was higher in Cara Mia stems. Following placement in water containing 108 colony forming units (cfu) of bacteria, cavitation occurred immediately, both in Madelon and Cara Mia roses. After removal of the conduits that were opened at harvest (by recutting 25 cm of the stem end under water), prior to placement in the bacterial suspension, no cavitations were observed in <b>stems</b> of Madelon <b>roses.</b> This indicated that cavitation started with the air in xylem conduits that were opened by cutting. In contrast, recutting 25 cm under water from the stems of Cara Mia roses did not reduce the number of cavitations. It is concluded that a bacterial occlusion resulted in a high rate of cavitation, hence in a considerable number of conduits, with air bubbles. These bubbles may further impede water uptak...|$|R

40|$|Dutch {{horticulture}} aims at {{a reduction}} of the energy use in greenhouses by 65 % in 2010 compared to 1980. When temperature integration is applied, temperatures may be reduced, {{as long as they}} are compensated by higher temperatures within a pre-set time span. Applying temperature integration without adverse effects on plant growth requires knowledge about critical temperatures. In this study, effects of temperature integration with bandwidths of 0, 6 and 10 °C (average temperature of 20 °C) and integration periods of 2 and 14 days on rose plants were investigated. Shoot lengths at the harvestable stage were reduced with increasing bandwidths. This reduction in shoot length became stronger as the integration period increased. The developmental rate of rose shoots to the harvestable stage was not affected by temperature integration. Shoot fresh weight decreased at a bandwidth of 10 °C, but not at a bandwidth of 6 °C. For the application of temperature integration in the practice of cut rose growing, shoot length development is the most critical process, since it partly determines the price of <b>rose</b> <b>stems.</b> If a certain reduction in stem length is acceptable to commercial rose growing, temperature integration with a bandwidth of 6 °C can be applied even at longer integration periods without affecting the developmental rate and shoot weight...|$|R
