5|$|Roger {{travelled}} {{with the}} king, often accompanying {{him in the}} royal progresses around England. In late 1136 or 1137, <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> with the king at a court called at Westminster which heard a complaint by the Holy Trinity Priory in London that Hasculf de Tany, the castellan of the Tower of London, had taken land {{that belonged to the}} priory. In the end, the priory regained custody of their land. In March 1137 <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> with the king right before the king sailed to Normandy, as the chancellor witnessed a charter of the king just prior to his departure. As chancellor, <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> a witness on over 60 royal writs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} born around 1115 and was {{a native}} of Pont-l'Évêque in Normandy. His only known relative was a nephew, Geoffrey, to whom Roger gave the offices of provost of Beverley Minster and archdeacon of York. <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> a clerk of Archbishop Theobald's before being named Archdeacon of Canterbury, some time after March 1148. When Becket joined Theobald's household, their contemporary William fitzStephen recorded that Roger disliked the new clerk, and twice drove Thomas away before the archbishop's brother Walter arranged Thomas' return.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday morning, April 25, 1999, Roger Troutman was fatally wounded as {{a result}} of an {{apparent}} murder-suicide that was orchestrated by his older brother, Larry. <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> shot several times in the torso by Larry as he exited a recording studio in Dayton, Ohio. <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> taken to Good Samaritan Hospital, but died shortly after. Larry's body was found in a car a short distance away from the murder scene. There were no witnesses at the time, and Larry's motive for the murder of Roger remains unclear; however, there were increasingly large troubles over money surrounding Larry who managed the family-run housing company, Troutman Enterprises. The business filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, owing $400,000 in delinquent taxes. Larry was also possibly angry over Roger firing him as manager for his music career, of which Larry had been for several years.|$|E

5|$|<b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> {{sent into}} exile after his family's disgrace. If {{he is the}} same person as the archdeacon of Berkshire, {{he died in the}} middle of the 1160s, but no other sure {{information}} is known about him after his exile.|$|E
5|$|According to John of Salisbury, {{who first}} {{reported}} {{this story in}} 1172 {{after the death of}} Thomas Becket, as a young clerk <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> involved in a scandal involving a homosexual relationship with a boy named Walter. After Walter made the relationship public, Roger reacted by embroiling Walter in judicial case that ended with Walter's eyes being gouged out. When Walter then accused Roger of this crime, Roger persuaded a judge to condemn Walter to death by hanging. Becket supposedly was involved in the cover-up afterwards, by arranging with Hilary of Chichester and John of Coutances for Roger to swear an oath that he was innocent. According to John of Salisbury, Roger then went to Rome in 1152 and was cleared of involvement by Pope Eugene III. John of Salisbury further alleges that it was only after bribery that the pope cleared Roger. Frank Barlow, a medieval historian and Becket's biographer, points out in his biography of Becket that while <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> accused of these crimes, and may even have been guilty of some sort of criminal homosexuality, John of Salisbury's motives for bringing up this story in 1172 were almost certainly to defame Roger. Such a story would naturally have put Roger in the worst possible light.|$|E
5|$|He later {{changed his}} stance on pacifism, joined the Territorial Army and was {{commissioned}} into the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers as a Second Lieutenant on 11 September 1943.

5|$|I think I was {{the first}} woman to play a marshal in a movie western. Roger would often cast against type in those days. I could never resist a plum role like a lady marshal in a genre that would never have {{considered}} such a gender reversal like that before.

5|$|It {{was while}} <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> Theobald's clerk {{that he made}} lasting friendships with Gilbert Foliot and Hugh de Puiset.

This council condemned some of Gilbert de la Porrée's teachings, and consecrated Foliot as Bishop of Hereford. While it was later recalled that Roger and Becket did not get along, {{there is no evidence}} of hatred between the two before the Becket crisis happened.|$|E

5|$|Roger de Pont L'Évêque (or Robert of Bishop's Bridge; c. 1115–1181) was Archbishop of York from 1154 to 1181. Born in Normandy, he preceded Thomas Becket as Archdeacon of Canterbury, and {{together}} with Becket served Theobald of Bec while Theobald was Archbishop of Canterbury. While in Theobald's service, <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> {{alleged to have}} committed a crime which Becket helped to cover up. Roger succeeded William FitzHerbert as archbishop in 1154, and while at York rebuilt York Minster, which had been damaged by fire.|$|E
5|$|Roger le Poer was {{a medieval}} Lord Chancellor from 1135 until 1139 for King Stephen of England. The {{son of a}} {{powerful}} bishop, Roger owed his position to his family connections.

Arrested along with his father, <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> used to secure the surrender of a castle held by his mother and then disappeared from history.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> consecrated Archbishop of York on 10 October 1154. When he went {{north to}} York, the legal scholar Vacarius, {{who had been}} part of Theobald's household, {{followed}} Roger and spent the next 50 years in the north. Vacarius was responsible for introducing Roman civil law into England, and did so under the patronage of Roger.

5|$|Roger's and his fellow-bishops' {{stories to}} Henry are {{often cited as}} the spark that touched off the king's anger at Becket and led to his martyrdom. However, it was more {{probably}} the stories of Becket's behaviour upon arrival in England that caused Henry's anger, and which indirectly led {{to the death of}} Becket. <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> suspended by Pope Alexander III because he was implicated in Becket's death, but was restored to office on 16 December 1171.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Hammond {{spent much}} of his leave with Ness-Harvey in South Africa. In 1945, she {{followed}} him back to England, but did not like it. When Hammond left to tour Australia in 1946–47, Ness-Harvey remained behind with his mother, with whom she did not get along. This was one of the factors which led to Hammond's problems on the tour. His divorce went through, and on his return, he and Sybil married at Kingston Register Office. She had already changed her name to Hammond by deed poll. Their first child, <b>Roger,</b> <b>was</b> born in 1948. Carolyn was born in 1950 and Valerie was born in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{also used}} {{historical}} references {{for some of}} his names and Marc-Ange Draco's name is based upon that of El Draco, the Spanish nickname for Sir Francis Drake, a fact also used by J. K. Rowling for the naming of her character Draco Malfoy. For Tracy's background, Fleming used that of Muriel Wright, a married wartime lover of Fleming's, who died in an air-raid and Bond's grief {{for the loss of}} his wife is an echo of Fleming's at the loss of Wright. Fleming did make mistakes in the novel, however, such as Bond ordering a half-bottle of Pol Roger Champagne: Fleming's friend Patrick Leigh Fermor pointed out that Pol <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> the only champagne at the time not to be produced in half-bottles.|$|E

5|$|In 1094, Roger the Poitevin {{founded the}} Benedictine priory of St. Mary at Lancaster, as a cell of the Norman Abbey of St. Martin in Sées. He endowed the priory {{with the church}} and land at Poulton. <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> {{eventually}} banished from the country and his lands returned to the possession of the Crown. In 1194 King Richard I granted the hundred of Amounderness to Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler, who held it {{until his death in}} 1206. In 1268, King Henry III granted the wapentake of Amounderness to his son Edmund Crouchback, who became the 1st Earl of Lancaster around this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1270 Roger Bigod, the 5th Earl, {{inherited}} the castle and undertook extensive renovations there whilst living in considerable luxury and style. Although still extremely wealthy, the Bigods were now having to borrow increasing sums from first the Jewish community at Bungay and then, after {{the expulsion of}} the Jews, Italian merchants; {{by the end of}} the century, <b>Roger</b> <b>was</b> heavily in debt to Edward I as well. As a result, Roger led the baronial opposition to Edward's request for additional taxes and support for his French wars. Edward responded by seizing Roger's lands and only releasing them on the condition that Roger granted them to the Crown after his death. Roger agreed and Framlingham Castle passed to the Crown on his death in 1306.|$|E
