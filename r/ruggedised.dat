40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the development, characterisation {{and application of}} large diameter multimode plastic optical fibre (POF) sensors using evanescent field modulation. The exposed polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) core of the POF fibre forms the sensor interface that detects refractive index changes of a measurand acting as the cladding. When a liquid measurand is used, the sensor can detect changes in refractive index, absorption and suspended particulates. It is this simple mechanism by which the evanescent field POF sensor operates. The evanescent field POF sensor has been characterised for refractive index of surrounding liquid from 1. 33 to 1. 49. The sensor demonstrated accuracy of ± 7 x 10 - 3 refractive index units below 1. 4 and ± 2 x 10 - 3 refractive index units above 1. 4. Components have been selected and designed for this project to <b>ruggedise</b> the sensor, to make the sensor more self-contained and cheaper. The original design of the test conditions did not allow for optimum deployment of the sensor as it stripped out the very modes of light that were required for sensing purposes. The system was also operating under pressure, not reflecting the real conditions under which the sensor would be operating. The re-design of test conditions holds the sensor without straining the POF and operates under normal atmospheric pressure. The POF sensor was demonstrated reacting to a real measurand eg biofilm in which initial growth affects the optical properties at the core cladding interface by refractive index modulation. This sensor was capable of measuring biofouling and scaling at water interfaces. The sensor was trialled in a European Commission funded project (CLOOPT) to study biofouling and scaling in closed loop water systems such as heat exchangers in the cooling tower of an electric power plant, and as an interface sensor for water quality monitoring (AQUA-STEW) involving biofilm removal and surface cleansing with a new application for contact lens protein removal systems. Tapering multimode POF was a desirable goal as this increases the proportion of light coupled into the core available for sensing purposes, to achieve a more sensitive evanescent field POF sensor. Optically clear and consistent smooth tapering of ends and mid-lengths of POF fibre were achieved through chemical removal of material. The tapered POF sensor was characterised {{with a range of}} refractive indices, and it exhibited two distinct regions; the water/alcohol region below 1. 4 refractive index units, and the oil region above 1. 4 suggesting the sensor's use as an oil-in-water, or water-in-oil sensor. From 95 % confidence limits, the accuracy of the POF was ±O. 006 refractive index units (to 2 standard deviations) for fluids of refractive indices above 1. 4. Tapered POF is sensitive to refractive index providing a cheap, easy to handle and rugged throwaway sensor for water and beverage process and quality monitoring...|$|R

50|$|By 1996, 'C' Squadron was raised. All three squadrons were {{equipped}} with the M113 vehicle in the reconnaissance role until the mid-1990s, with the regiment being re-{{equipped with}} the Australian Light Armoured Vehicle (ASLAV) between 1995 and 1997. Among the specialised equipment used in reconnaissance by the regiment is the Australian Man-portable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (AMSTAR) system which is able to detect and recognise moving targets including personnel, vehicles, watercraft and low flying helicopters. AMSTAR has a target detection and classification capability at ranges up to 35,000 metres. Although the system can be moved by a few personnel it is commonly mounted on the ASLAV-Ss. A <b>ruggedised</b> laptop is used for data processing in conjunction with an aural indicator.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, red lamps (or beacons) use {{incandescent}} filament bulbs. In {{order to improve}} the otherwise quite short lifespan, they are made with a <b>ruggedised</b> design and are run below normal operating power (under-running). A recent development has been the use of arrays of high-power red LEDs in place of incandescent bulbs, which has only been possible since the development of LEDs of sufficient brightness. LED-based lamps have a significantly longer lifespan than incandescent bulbs, thus reducing maintenance costs and increasing reliability. Several manufacturers have also developed medium-intensity white strobes based on LED technology to replace xenon. Xenon flashers, whilst more visually impressive, tend to require frequent replacement and so have become a less favoured option. However, {{with the advent of}} LEDs, white strobes are still somewhat desired.|$|E
5000|$|A rugged laptop {{is built}} to operate {{reliably}} in dusty or wet environments and conditions. These laptops have a thicker and stronger housing {{compared to a}} regular laptop.

Rugged laptops are engineered to be mobile, they are vibration, shock, drop, dust and waterproof. Most rugged laptops are standard equipped with a strap for long-term use and comfortable travel holding. Even the modern-day rugged laptops are equipped with a serial port which is commonly used in the industrial and engineering related tasks. The levels of ruggardization are not standardized, but they are measured by various certifications such as MIL-STD-810 or ATEX.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s James Robertson {{developed}} his experimental Skyshark. This was a broadly conventional design {{but with a}} variety of features, including a small canard foreplane, intended to give not only a safe stall but good Short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance. The foreplane allowed STOL performance to be achieved without the high angles of attack and accompanying dangers of stalling required by conventional STOL designs. The aircraft was evaluated by the US Army. Robertson's system was commercialised as the Wren 460, a modified Cessna light aircraft. This in turn was later licensed and produced during the 1980s as the Peterson 260SE and with the foreplane modification only as the 230SE. In 2006 a <b>ruggedised</b> variant, the Peterson Katmai, entered production. A broadly similar approach is taken by the 1988 Eagle-XTS and its derivatives, the Eagle 150 series.|$|E
50|$|Reacher is {{the most}} recent {{satellite}} communications acquisition and comprises the mobile satellite ground terminals that give military ground forces communications access through Skynet 5 satellites.

It is designed to operate with a deployed advanced headquarters, and is carried on a Bucher Duro 6x6 vehicle with a detachable cabin and towing a trailer. Reacher Large is mounted on the same vehicle as Reacher Medium, but has a 4.8 m antenna. Reacher All Terrain is in service with the Royal Marines and is mounted on two BV206 vehicles with associated trailers. All Reacher terminals are transportable using Chinook helicopters, C130 aircraft, by sea and by rail. The systems are supplied by EADS Astrium subsidiary company Paradigm Secure Communications.|$|E
50|$|The Zip {{drive is}} similar to Iomega's earlier Bernoulli Box in that in both drives, a set of read/write heads mounted on a linear {{actuator}} hover over a rapidly spinning flexible medium mounted in a sturdy cartridge. However, the Zip cartridge lacks the Bernoulli plate of the earlier product, and as a consequence, the Zip cartridge has only one disk in the cartridge {{in contrast to the}} two disks in a Bernoulli cartridge (one {{on either side of the}} Bernoulli plate). In the Zip drive, the heads fly in a manner similar to a hard disk drive, without the use of the Bernoulli effect. The linear actuator uses the voice coil actuation technology related to modern hard disk drives. The Zip disk uses smaller media (about the size of a 9 cm (3.5-inch) microfloppy, but more <b>ruggedised,</b> rather than the Compact Disc-sized Bernoulli media), and a simplified drive design that reduced its overall cost.|$|E

40|$|Experiments in long {{distance}} {{quantum key distribution}} have motivated the development of <b>ruggedised</b> single photon sources, capable of producing useful correlations even when removed from the warm, nurturing environment found in most optics laboratories. As {{part of an ongoing}} pro- gramme to place such devices into low earth orbit (LEO), we have developed and built a number of rugged single photon sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion. In order to evalu- ate device reliability, we have subjected our design to various thermal, mechanical and atmospheric stresses. Our results show that while such a device may tolerate launch into orbit, operation in orbit and casual mishandling by graduate students, it is probably unable to survive the forcible disassembly of a launch vehicle {{at the top of a}} ball of rapidly expanding and oxidising kerosene and liquid oxygen.
