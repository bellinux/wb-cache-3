50|$|Rr, {{regulating}} rail. The regulating button {{is shown}} {{attached to the}} rail by the <b>regulating</b> <b>screw</b> which is turned by means of its ring on top of Rr. The purpose of the regulating button is to throw {{the point of the}} jack out of the nose of the hammer butt, and allow the hammer to rebound from the string. If the button is too high, it does not throw or trip the jack in time to prevent blocking. When the button is too low, it disengages too soon, and much of the force of the key is lost before it reaches the hammer.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{advanced}} adaptive boring heads with automatic metal-cutting elements is developed. It allows {{setting up the}} heads for the finishing of inner cylindrical surface with the required accuracy, depending on the surface diameter, the value of tolerance field and its placement schemes. We describe {{the structure of the}} adaptive boring heads and how it works. To reduce shock loads when metal-cutting elements embedded for thrust adjustment screws, elastic dampers are used. On the basis of the settlement scheme analytical dependences for determination of the clearance gap between a thrust screw and a boring head <b>regulating</b> <b>screw</b> are developed. The value to process the holes of various accuracy with the same structural and geometrical parameters of metal-cutting elements is defined as well as the value and placement of tolerance field. The graphs of dependences of the value Î” on a nominal diameter of inner cylindrical surface of machined holes and various accuracy degrees are drawn. An image dependencies have practical value and can be used to directly configure heads of production units. ...|$|E

A closed-loop controller is developed to automatically <b>regulate</b> <b>screw</b> speed and barrel temperature profile to achieve constant viscosity and enable consistent processing of variable grade recycled HDPE materials. The experimental results of real time viscosity measurement and control using a 38 mm single screw extruder with different recycled HDPEs with widely different MFIs are reported in this work...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a new {{generation}} of extruder control system for recycled materials which has ability to automatically maintain constant a polymer melt viscosity of mixed recycled polymers during extrusion, regardless of variations in the Melt Flow Index (MFI) of recycled mixed grade high density polyethylene (HDPE) feedstock. The variations in MFI are due to differences in the source of the recycled material used. The work describes how melt viscosity for specific extruder/die system is calculated in real time using the rheological properties of the materials, the pressure drop through the extruder die and the actual throughput measurements using a gravimetric loss-in-weight hopper feeder. A closed-loop controller is also developed to automatically <b>regulate</b> <b>screw</b> speed and barrel temperature profile to achieve constant viscosity and enable consistent processing of variable grade recycled HDPE materials. Such a system will improve processability of mixed MFI polymers may also reduce the risk of polymer melt degradation, reduce producing large volumes of scrap/waste and lead to improvement in product quality. The experimental results of real time viscosity measurement and control using a 38 mm single screw extruder with different recycled HDPEs with widely different MFIs are reported in this work...|$|R

40|$|A {{variable}} transmission output coupler and deviationless tuner forms {{a part of}} a tunable laser cavity. The device uses frustrated total internal reflection to provide variable output coupling and laser tunability simultaneously. Two Pellin-Broca prisms are pressed against each other by a variable spring pressure mechanism. An adjustable <b>screw</b> <b>regulates</b> the variable force, controlling the thickness of an air film between two prism faces. The Pellin-Broca prisms enable tuning the laser without angular deviation of the output beam. All beams enter and exit at Brewster's Angle, minimizing losses. No coatings are used on the optical elements, reducing the possibility of damage at high operating power of the laser. The coupler may be used in pulsed as well as continuous wave lasers.

40|$|A sliding mode {{vibration}} controller for lead screw drives Orang Vahid-Araghi 1 and Farid Golnaraghi 2 The conversion of rotary to translational motion in lead screw drives {{occurs at the}} meshing lead screw and nut threads. A decreasing coefficient of friction with sliding velocity, may lead to instabilities in these drives. In this paper, a sliding mode controller is designed for a {{two degrees of freedom}} lead screw drive model. This controller has two objectives: to <b>regulate</b> the lead <b>screw</b> angular velocity to a preset value and to attenuate friction-induced vibrations. Only upper and/or lower bounds of system parameters are assumed to be known. In addition, {{in the development of the}} controller no specific model is assumed for the dependence of the coefficient of friction on the relative sliding velocity. Two modifications are applied to the basic discontinuous sliding mode controller to eliminate the inherent chattering problem and to limit the controlled input torque levels. Numerical simulation results are presented that show the applicability and the per-formance of the proposed controller...|$|R
50|$|There {{had been}} upright grand pianos {{as well as}} upright harpsichords, the {{horizontal}} instrument being turned up on its wider end and a keyboard and action adapted to it. William Southwell, an Irish piano-maker, had in 1798 tried a similar experiment with a square piano, to be repeated in later years by William Frederick Collard of London; but Hawkins {{was the first to}} make a piano, or pianino, with the strings descending to the floor, the keyboard being raised. His instrument was in a complete iron frame, independent of the case; and in this frame, strengthened by a system of iron resistance rods combined with an iron upper bridge, his sound-board was entirely suspended. An apparatus for tuning by mechanical <b>screws</b> <b>regulated</b> the tension of the strings, which were of equal length throughout. The action, in metal supports, anticipated Robert Wornum's in the checking, and later ideas in a contrivance for repetition. This bundle of inventions was brought to London and exhibited by Hawkins himself; but the instrument was poor in tone.|$|R
