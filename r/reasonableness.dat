5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of <b>reasonableness</b> or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Olivier Bancoult, {{a native}} Chagossian {{and leader of}} the Chagos Refugees Group, brought a {{judicial}} review claim against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for the initial ordinance which led to the Chagossian removal. Bancoult sought a writ of certiorari {{on the grounds that the}} ordinance was ultra vires and failed the Wednesbury test of <b>reasonableness,</b> as it was irrational.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Security Council {{brokered}} the Renville Agreement in {{an attempt}} to rectify the collapsed Linggarjati Agreement. The agreement was ratified in January 1948 and recognised a cease-fire along the so-called 'Van Mook line'; an artificial line which connected the most advanced Dutch positions. Many Republican positions, however, were still held behind the Dutch lines. The agreement also required referenda to be held on the political future of the Dutch held areas. The apparent <b>reasonableness</b> of Republicans garnered much important American goodwill.|$|E
5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the <b>reasonableness</b> of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
5|$|Part IV {{of the act}} {{covers the}} {{delegation}} of powers to agents, and the trustees liability for their acts. This {{is an area that}} has long been criticised by practitioners and academics, particularly the provisions of the Trustee Act 1925. The Act allowed the trustees to appoint an agent in good faith, and gave them no liability for the agent's acts. In Re Vickery it was confirmed that a trustee may escape liability for an agent's acts if he acted in good faith, which was simply a test of honesty rather than <b>reasonableness.</b>|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey v. T. L. O. (1985), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} {{searches}} {{in public schools}} do not require warrants, {{as long as the}} searching officers have reasonable grounds for believing that the search will result in the finding of evidence of illegal activity. However, in Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009), the Court ruled that school officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to have received drugs from that student. Similarly, in Samson v. California (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may be searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds. Searches of prison cells are subject to no restraints relating to <b>reasonableness</b> or probable cause.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of <b>reasonableness</b> and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

25|$|When {{scientists}} use {{the idea}} of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The <b>reasonableness</b> of parsimony in one research context may {{have nothing to do}} with its <b>reasonableness</b> in another. It is a mistake to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.|$|E
25|$|Justice Antonin Scalia reiterated {{his view}} that {{substantive}} <b>reasonableness</b> review was {{incompatible with the}} Sixth Amendment, but concurred out of concerns for stare decisis.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} of <b>reasonableness</b> was {{based primarily on}} the expertise of the committee. The committee was composed of lawyers who understood the interest and were fulfilling the mandate of protecting the public.|$|E
25|$|Iacobucci, {{writing for}} the Court, allowed the appeal and {{restored}} the order for disbarment. The Court held that the proper standard of review is <b>reasonableness</b> simpliciter. On application of the standard, the order of disbarment {{was found to be}} reasonable.|$|E
25|$|Law Society of New Brunswick v Ryan, 2003 SCC 20 is {{a leading}} {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of Canada on judicial review for professional disciplinary bodies in Canadian administrative law.

25|$|REBT {{has been}} developed, revised and {{augmented}} {{through the years}} as understanding and knowledge of psychology and psychotherapy have progressed. This includes its theoretical concepts, practices and methodology. The teaching of scientific thinking, <b>reasonableness</b> and un-dogmatism has been inherent in REBT as an approach, and these ways of thinking are an inextricable part of REBT's empirical and skeptical nature.|$|E
25|$|Peter H. Russell, a {{professor}} emeritus {{of political science at}} the University of Toronto, suggested that if Harper had sought a dissolution, the governor general would have had to consider carefully the <b>reasonableness</b> of the request. In Russell's view, the viceroy's primary concern is to protect parliamentary democracy and a dissolution of parliament would have necessitated an election only two months after the preceding one; repeated short term elections are not healthy for the system. In such a case, with a reasonably viable coalition available, Jean might then refuse Harper's advice to dissolve parliament (forcing him to resign under constitutional precedent), and invite Dion to form a government.|$|E
25|$|In {{considering}} whether an implied term of good faith (along with an implied term of <b>reasonableness)</b> {{was included in}} the contract, the court first discussed past New South Wales cases on the point, in which terms of good faith had been implied into the relevant contracts, particularly Renard Constructions v Minister for Public Works. In that case, Priestley JA had considered the status of implied terms of good faith in United States contract law — particularly via an examination of the Second Restatement of Contracts — where requirements of good faith are not only well-entrenched but often incorporated into contracts by way of legislation. The court also examined the recognition of good faith in other Australian jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|Ong Ah Chuan {{has been}} {{referred}} to in subsequent cases. In some of them, {{attempts have been made to}} argue that certain legal principles are fundamental rules of natural justice, and thus constitutionally protected by Article 9(1). There has also been academic discussion concerning whether fundamental rules of natural justice enable the courts to examine the substantive fairness or <b>reasonableness</b> of laws. The ruling in Ong Ah Chuan that the mandatory death penalty is constitutional has not been followed in later Privy Council decisions. These cases were distinguished by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010) on the basis that the constitutions involved in those cases contained express prohibitions against inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment, which the Singapore Constitution lacks.|$|E
25|$|The bidding date, {{originally}} December 20, 1961, {{was postponed}} to January 22, 1962, {{to clarify the}} details of the arch construction. About 50 companies that had requested the construction requirements received bidding invitations. Extending from $11,923,163 to $12,765,078, all four bids exceeded the engineer estimate of $8,067,000. Wirth had a committee led by George Hartzog determine the validity of the bids in light of the government's conditions. Following a meeting with the bidders, the committee affirmed the bids' <b>reasonableness,</b> and Wirth awarded the lowest bidder, MacDonald Construction Co. of St. Louis, the contract for the construction of the arch and the visitor center. On March 14, 1962, he signed the contract and received from Tucker $2,500,000, the city's subsidy for the phase. MacDonald reduced its bid $500,000 to $11,442,418. The Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company served as the subcontractor for the shell of the arch.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} Vellama's filing {{of the action}} barely two weeks after her MP's seat in Parliament fell vacant was {{premature}} because the Prime Minister had yet to make his stand on the matter. There was thus no basis to make any complaint against the Prime Minister as the application had pre-empted any decision by the Prime Minister. Further, the Prime Minister's decision to advise the President to file a writ of election on 9 May 2012 meant that thereafter there was no factual basis for the Court to rule on the <b>reasonableness</b> or otherwise of the Prime Minister not calling a by-election to fill the vacancy. As such, Vellama had no factual basis upon which to proceed with her case and this alone was sufficient to dismiss her case. On the other hand, since the Court agreed with Vellama that the Constitution requires the Prime Minister to fill casual vacancies arising in SMCs within a reasonable time, it ordered each party to bear its own costs.|$|E
25|$|Abdur Rouf Choudhury's novel Natun Diganta (three volumes: {{published}} in 1991, 1992, 1993 and complete collection in 2005 by Pathak Shamabesh) is a quality {{work of art}} by any standard and most successful writing on pre- Bangladesh Liberation War. Choudhury most vividly depicted the unity of Bengal and the articulation of Bengali nationalism in his novel Natun Diganta (New Horizon) (vols. 1-3). Reason and humanity – these are its two eternal pillars. The essence of Choudhury's thought is a complete faith in the efficiency of these two immeasurable forces. Its most striking characteristic is its insistent association of work, precept and practice. It appeals not to controversial tests, not to any appearance of sweet <b>reasonableness</b> but to trials in the rough and tumble of life, and it will accept no other judgment. Natun Diganta gives warning against: 1) dogma, mysticism, ceremonial, hypnotism, the binding {{of the mind and}} will by oaths, and other inventions of external authority in religion and politics, 2) participation in violence, individual or social, and organisation's dependence on violence, 3) exploitation, luxury and material property, 4) self-degradation and 5) devotion to self-sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|Satirical comedy was woven {{throughout}} the rally with Colbert expressing, in parody, that fear {{was superior to}} Stewart's <b>reasonableness.</b> The theme started with Colbert—costumed like Evel Knievel—emerging from his [...] "fear bunker" [...] in a capsule reminiscent of the 2010 Chilean miners' rescue. Thereafter, Colbert challenged Stewart point by point, usually claiming victory.|$|E
500|$|In Strickland v. Washington (1984), the Court held that, on {{collateral}} review, {{a defendant}} may obtain relief if the defendant demonstrates both (1) that defense counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of <b>reasonableness</b> (the [...] "performance prong") and (2) that, {{but for the}} deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability that {{the result of the}} proceeding would have been different (the [...] "prejudice prong").|$|E
500|$|In Maneka Gandhi, Bhagwati J. {{appeared}} {{to suggest that}} the rational nexus test should not be applied to Article 14 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the law, because it led to a narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision. He held that Article 14 should not be construed too narrowly as it was the pillar on which the foundation of the Indian Democratic Republic rested. In his view, the principle of <b>reasonableness</b> was an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness, and it pervaded Article 14 [...] "like a brooding omnipresence".|$|E
500|$|In the Malaysian case Arumugam Pillai v. Government of Malaysia (1976), the Federal Court {{construed}} {{the phrase}} save {{in accordance with}} law in Article 13(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia restrictively. This provision states: [...] "No person shall be deprived of property save in accordance with law." [...] The Court held that all that was required for the legislation in question to be constitutional was for it to have been validly passed by Parliament. Hence, the validity of any duly enacted piece of legislation could not be questioned on grounds of <b>reasonableness,</b> no matter how arbitrary the law appeared to be.|$|E
500|$|Priestley {{engaged in}} {{numerous}} {{political and religious}} pamphlet wars. According to Schofield, [...] "he entered each controversy with a cheerful conviction that he was right, while most of his opponents were convinced, from the outset, that he was willfully and maliciously wrong. He was able, then, to contrast his sweet <b>reasonableness</b> to their personal rancor", but as Schofield points out Priestley rarely altered his opinion {{as a result of}} these debates. While at Leeds he wrote controversial pamphlets on the Lord's Supper and on Calvinist doctrine; thousands of copies were published, making them some of Priestley's most widely read works.|$|E
500|$|In 1909, the Supreme Court of the United States propounded {{a test to}} {{determine}} the <b>reasonableness</b> of a classification, stating that the classification [...] "must always rest upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect to which the classification is made". Based on this principle, the Supreme Court of India subsequently formulated a two-stage test {{to determine}} if a classification made by a law was constitutional. The relevant stages were (1) whether the classification was founded on an intelligible differentia; and (2) whether the differentia had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question.|$|E
500|$|A test of <b>reasonableness</b> {{was applied}} to Article 8(1) of the Malaysian Constitution in some cases, but it was later {{rejected}} by the Federal Court in Danaharta Urus Sdn. Bhd. v. Kekatong Sdn. Bhd. (2004). The Court noted that in cases subsequent to Maneka Gandhi the reasonable classification test had been applied, even by Bhagwati J. himself. Furthermore, equality under Article 8(1) does not mean absolute equality, but only assures the right to equal treatment with other individuals in similar circumstances. The rational nexus test {{is needed to determine}} if a law applies equally to all persons in the same group, and is therefore an [...] "integral part" [...] of Article 8(1).|$|E
500|$|The {{state may}} {{regulate}} fishing by non-Indians {{to achieve a}} wide variety of management or [...] "conservation" [...] objectives. Its selection of regulations to achieve these objectives is limited only by its own organic law and the standards of <b>reasonableness</b> required by the Fourteenth Amendment. But when it is regulating the federal right of Indians to take fish at their usual and accustomed places it does not have the same latitude in prescribing the management objectives and the regulatory means of achieving them. The state may not qualify the federal right by subordinating it to some other state objective or policy. It may use its police power only to the extent necessary to prevent the exercise of that right in a manner that will imperil the continued existence of the fish resource.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{characters}} in The Other Hand are Little Bee, a Nigerian refugee, and Sarah, a middle-class Englishwoman. Critics {{have focused on}} the contrast between the two, with Caroline Elkins of The New York Times commenting that Sarah might initially appear [...] "insipid" [...] to readers, and that when juxtaposed with Little Bee, she seems [...] "unsympathetic, even tiresome". Tim Teeman of The Times deemed Sarah [...] "batty, bizarre and inconsistent, and despite the tragedy she has suffered, unsympathetic", while writing that in contrast: [...] "Goodness peppers every atom of [...] being." [...] Other reviewers took an opposite stance. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle found Little Bee's characterisation problematic, writing: [...] "Sometimes she's not convincing, and sometimes she tries too hard to convince. It's too often apparent that Little Bee is not real. This doesn't do justice to her story, and puts the burden back on the author to show that he's representing her, rather than exploiting her." [...] Ed Lake of The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Bee's arch <b>reasonableness</b> and implausibly picturesque speech mean she often comes off as a too-cute cipher", and ultimately found Sarah the more convincing character.|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, at common law, natural {{justice is}} taken to be a {{procedural}} concept that embodies the twin pillars of audi alteram partem (hear the other party) and nemo iudex in causa sua (no one should be a judge {{in his or her}} own cause). In the United States, due process has both procedural and substantive components. Substantive due process involves the courts assessing the <b>reasonableness</b> of executive actions and legislation using rational basis review if a fundamental right is not implicated and strict scrutiny if it is. The question thus arises whether substantive fundamental rules of natural justice may be developed by local courts. However, a line of Malaysian cases has expressed the view that the concept of substantive due process is not applicable to Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). There is also academic commentary that rejects the notion of [...] "substantive natural justice", arguing that it is too vague and leads to problems in application. Another argument against substantive natural justice is the fear that it may become an avenue for judges to invalidate laws on the basis of their own subjective opinions, leading to unbounded judicial activism.|$|E
500|$|In Chee Siok Chin, the High Court {{interpreted}} the phrase necessary or expedient as conferring upon Parliament [...] "an extremely wide discretionary power and remit that permits a multifarious and multifaceted approach towards achieving {{any of the}} purposes specified in Art 14(2) of the Constitution". The Court emphasized the fact that, unlike Article 19(3) of the Constitution of India which provides {{that the right to}} fetter the freedom of speech and assembly is subject to the touchstone of <b>reasonableness,</b> Singapore's Article 14(2) does not contain the word reasonable. However, despite the broad power that Article 19(3) accords to the Indian courts, they have been [...] "most reluctant" [...] to invalidate legislation purportedly infringing the rights to free speech or assembly. There exists a strong presumption of legislative constitutionality, as the Supreme Court of India has expressed a need for [...] "judicial self-restraint and extreme caution" [...] when determining whether legislation unreasonably restricts a constitutional right. It has been noted that the Indian courts have thus been used to exemplify how much more deference Singapore courts should give to the Government, and that the Article 14(2) derogation clause was said to confer upon Parliament a great amount of discretionary power.|$|E
500|$|In equal {{protection}} cases, {{the purpose of}} the law must be distilled before the <b>reasonableness</b> of a classification can be judged. When {{the purpose of the}} law is not explicitly stated, the court may conclude that there is no legitimate public purpose, assume that there is a legitimate public purpose but refuse to look for it, or draw some inferences as to what it is. When the purpose of the law is explicitly stated, the court may either accept it at face value; or challenge the integrity of the legislative declaration, looking behind the explicit purpose to determine the true purpose. In the latter situation, what is concerned is the discriminatory character of the legislation. The need to identify the legislative purpose has been said to involve the court in the [...] "thornier aspects of judicial review", because it must either [...] "uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at face value" [...] or [...] "challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into unconfined realms of inference". The court must then [...] "make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and ... determine the legitimacy of the end".|$|E
500|$|However, in Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010) the Court of Appeal {{appeared}} to reject {{such an approach}} by declining to require that procedural laws must be [...] "fair, just and reasonable" [...] {{before they can be}} regarded as law for the purpose of Article 9(1). It noted that the provision neither contains such a qualification, nor can such a qualification be implied from its context or wording. The Court considered it [...] "too vague a test of constitutionality" [...] and said: [...] "Such a test hinges on the court’s view of the <b>reasonableness</b> of the law in question, and requires the court to intrude into the legislative sphere of Parliament as well as engage in policy making." [...] On the other hand, the Court acknowledged that Article 9(1) does not justify all legislation whatever its nature. It held, obiter, that law might not encompass [...] legislation (that is, bills of attainder – legislation purporting to be of general application but in fact directed at securing the conviction of particular individuals), or legislation [...] "of so absurd or arbitrary a nature that it could not possibly have been contemplated by our constitutional framers as being 'law' when they crafted the constitutional provisions protecting fundamental liberties".|$|E
500|$|As {{was noted}} previously, the word law in {{provisions}} of the Constitution such as Articles 9 and 12 includes fundamental rules of natural justice. Jack Tsen-Ta Lee has suggested that these fundamental rules are both procedural and substantive in nature, and that substantive natural justice gives the courts discretion to strike down a law if its very object is unreasonable and oppressive. Under this view, to interpret Article 9(1) as permitting Parliament to enact any provision that derogates from an individual's personal liberty no matter how arbitrary or oppressive as long as procedural natural justice is observed, drains it of all content. Also, instead of the invalidation of legislation in this manner being seen as an encroachment by the judiciary into the legislature's sphere, the application of substantive natural justice would simply be a full exercise of the judiciary's proper constitutional role. Lee submits that Singapore courts should follow the Indian courts and apply a <b>reasonableness</b> test to determine if legislation is substantively constitutional. Ultimately, being able to review legislation by applying the substantive aspect of natural justice would [...] "entitle courts to examine whether it is appropriate for the legislature to deprive individual of certain aspects of their personal liberty, {{and the manner in}} which such deprivation is achieved." ...|$|E
500|$|Persons {{unable to}} show {{that one of the}} {{forbidden}} classifications applies to them may try to argue that they are members of a group defined by a law in a way that violates the general guarantee of equality and equal protection. To succeed, they must establish that the classification used in the law fails the rational nexus test, which is a three-stage test formulated by the courts. The first stage of the test involves an examination as to whether the law differentiates amongst classes of individuals. At the second stage, the court considers if the differentiation is founded on an intelligible [...] or distinguishing feature. Finally, the basis of the differentiation must bear a reasonable relation to the object of the statute. However, the test is not foolproof as a classification may satisfy the test even if the object of the law is itself illegitimate. The rational nexus test, as it is currently applied in Singapore, also tolerates over- and under-inclusive classifications. It {{remains to be seen if}} local courts will consider other approaches to the issue, such as the three-tier system of scrutiny applied in the United States, the proportionality analysis applied in the United Kingdom to other areas of human rights law, or the <b>reasonableness</b> approach taken by some judges in India and Malaysia.|$|E
