25|$|The story {{opens in}} England during the First World War at Styles Court, an Essex country manor. Upon her husband's death, the wealthy widow Emily Cavendish {{inherited}} a life estate in Styles {{as well as}} the outright inheritance of the larger part of the late Mr. Cavendish's income. Mrs. Cavendish became Mrs. Inglethorp upon her recent marriage to a younger man, Alfred Inglethorp. Emily's two stepsons, John and Lawrence Cavendish, John's wife Mary and Cynthia Murdoch, also live at Styles. John Cavendish is the vested <b>remainderman</b> of Styles; that is, the property will pass to him upon his stepmother's death, per his late father's will. Lawrence Cavendish would also come into a considerable sum of money. The income left to Mrs Inglethorp by her late husband would be distributed according to her will, which she changes at least once per year. If she has not changed her will since her marriage, her husband will inherit that income. Cynthia does war-time work at the pharmacy in the nearby hospital.|$|E

50|$|The {{general rule}} in {{relation}} to any trust fund is that the life tenant is entitled {{to all of the}} income, and the <b>remainderman</b> then takes all of the capital on the death of the life tenant. Under the rule in Howe v Earl of Dartmouth there may be duty to convert and reinvest authorised investments in the trust fund to maintain fairness between the life tenant and the <b>remainderman.</b>|$|E

50|$|Personal residences {{that are}} mortgaged may be {{transferred}} to a residence trust. To the extent the residence is encumbered, {{the value of the}} property transferred will be reduced for gift tax purposes. As mortgage payments continue to be made by the grantor, additional gifts are made to the <b>remaindermen.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{value of}} the {{remainder}} likewise grows from year to year; that could count as annual income, taxed to the <b>remainderman</b> -- but also added to {{the basis of his}} remainder interest (as if he had purchased an endowment policy -- but, as we don't tax the income accumulating interest on an endowment policy until it matures, the <b>remainderman</b> should likewise be permitted to defer this [...] "income" [...] until it [...] "matures") ...|$|E
5000|$|For example, if {{the owner}} of {{property}} makes a grant of that property [...] "to John for life, and then to Jane," [...] Jane is entitled to a future interest, called a remainder, and is termed a <b>remainderman.</b> Another example is say Mary leaves her books to Mark her son, and if he doesn't want them he leaves them to his daughter Ruth, who also doesn't want them and leaves to Mary's brother Michael who is the <b>remainderman.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{synonyms}} remainderer, remainderperson, and remainor may {{be found}} in legal dictionaries, but are rarely used in practice. A female person in the position of a <b>remainderman</b> is also termed a <b>remainderman.</b> For instance in a will chattels are left to one person, who can then offer it to a second person, who can then offer it to a third person who can then it offer to the last person who is referred to as [...] "the remainderman".|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} ways in which decedents leave {{property}} in trust for their heirs. One technique is to grant a life estate to surviving children. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe verbally, and through example, an approach to liquidating a life estate. This simplification in personal finance involves a “buyout ” of the interests of the <b>remaindermen.</b> The result is dissolution of the trust, leaving the income beneficiaries to manage, as owner in fee, the remaining assets as they wish, without th...|$|R
50|$|Life estates in {{real estate}} are still created today. The life estate is more {{commonly}} used in trust instruments, typically {{in an attempt to}} minimize the effect of the inheritance tax or other taxes on transfers of wealth. A prospective reduction in tax for the creator ('settlor') often follows if the settlor has parted with all current and future interest. However many tax codes transfer the burden of estate taxes to the holder of the interest in possession (life tenant) and may treat that person or the <b>remaindermen</b> as owning a second/surplus property.|$|R
50|$|Trusts may {{be created}} to get {{funds to the}} next {{generation}} where there is significant wealth and federal exclusionary gifts have already been used up. A common such vehicle is called the grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT). Federal tax law specifically allows for this vehicle. Here the grantor places an asset in the trustone he expects will grow rapidly during the term of the trust. The document then requires the trustee to pay to the settlor a specific sum of money (the annuity) at certain intervals during the life of the trust. If there are assets in the trust {{at the end of the}} term, those assets go without estate or gift tax to the <b>remaindermen.</b> Here's a typical case: settlor owns large block of low cost basis stock in a publicly traded company. He does not wish to sell the stock and pay capital gains tax. He also has estate tax problems since his net worth when he dies is likely to be $10 million or more. His attorney drafts a GRAT in which he places $2 million of the single company's stock. The document calls for the smallest legal interest rate (published monthly by the Federal Government), which is then paid through the term of the trust. Upon the termination of the trust, the annuity has been paid back to the grantor and the remaining corpus is delivered to the <b>remaindermen</b> (typically children) without tax. Money has now passed from the grantor to his/her children without gift or estate tax. There has been no capital gains tax.|$|R
5000|$|Re Atkinson, Barbers' Company v Grose-Smith 1904 2 Ch 160 is an English trusts law case, which {{lays down}} {{a rule of}} equity {{relating}} to the disposition by the trustees of an authorised mortgage security where the security forms part of a trust fund, and the beneficiaries of the trust fund include a tenant for life and a <b>remainderman.</b> Where the security is sold and the proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the principal and interest in full, {{it is necessary to}} determine {{the way in which the}} loss shall be shared as between the tenant for life and the <b>remainderman.</b> The sum realised by the sale must be apportioned between the life tenant and the <b>remainderman</b> in the proportion that the amount due for the arrears of interest bears to the amount due in respect of principal.|$|E

50|$|Allhusen v Whitell (1867) LR 4 Eq 295 is an English trusts law case which {{lays down}} {{a rule of}} equity which {{requires}} the trustee of a trust to strike a fair balance between the beneficiaries who are tenants for life {{and those who are}} <b>remaindermen</b> in respect of payment of the debts of an estate. The life tenant under a will is entitled to income earned after the testator's death, but it often takes some time to ascertain and settle all of those debts. In the meantime the assets of the estate are earning income for tenant for life, whereas the life tenant should only receive income from the estate net of the debts; the rule in Allhusen v White requires the life tenant to make a contribution.|$|R
40|$|To many, {{sustainability}} {{is nothing}} more than another legally ineffectual buzz word manufactured by the modern environmental movement. However, such a narrow view of the concept ignores a tremendous amount of historical precedent and jurisprudence underlying it. Specifically, the doctrine of waste in Anglo-American property law has long been a vehicle for those with an interest in the future to restrict resource-depleting activities in the present, rendering it the manifestation of sustainability as a concrete legal obligation. It is through this doctrine, then, that the rich concept of sustainability as it applies to climate change policymaking can be best understood. The early history and development of the doctrine of waste in England and the United States, as well as the philosophical discourse surrounding equitable obligations to future generations, help to provide much-needed non-partisan legal and moral grounding for environmental policymaking. Specifically, the traditional American and English iterations of the waste doctrine provide a natural and tested tool for fashioning sustainability rules on a local scale. The age-old question of what precisely must be left to <b>remaindermen</b> is directly analogous to the modern questions concerning sustainable development and depletion of non-renewable resources. For this reason, the tests and rules applied in the courts of the early United States and England have a particularly useful and novel application to the modern policy discussion. Yet, an even deeper level of analytical significance exists because the choice between the extreme American and English versions of the waste doctrine maps onto the debate between the concepts of weak and strong sustainability. Through examination of the early cases and resultant rules in these two common law jurisdictions, this work provides a policy analysis tool and a recommended general course of action for environmental policymakers...|$|R
5000|$|The law {{assumes that}} future {{property}} {{is of no}} benefit to the life tenant, and thus must be sold to obtain income producing investments. The proceeds of sale are apportioned between the life tenant and the <b>remainderman</b> by using the formulae set out in Re Earl of Chesterfield's Trusts (1883) 24 Ch D 643. This provides that the sum which is reserved for the <b>remainderman</b> is the sum [...] "which, put out at 4 per cent. per annum ... and accumulating at compound interest at that rate with yearly rests, and deducting income tax at the standard rate, would, with accumulation of interest, have produced, at the respective dates of receipt, the amounts actually received; and that the aggregate of the sums so ascertained ought {{to be treated as}} principal and be applied accordingly, and the residue should be treated as income." [...] Or, put another way, the principal (which goes to capital for the <b>remainderman)</b> is the sum which, if invested at 4 per cent. at the date of the testator's death, would have produced the sum now received, and the income is assumed to be everything else (which goes to the life tenant).|$|E
50|$|Similarly, where a trust {{gives rise}} to {{successive}} interest, {{the title of a}} <b>remainderman</b> is a prospective, or contingent, interest; although unlike a discretionary beneficiary, this is still a species of property that can be dealt with, much {{in the same way as}} a contingent or prospective debt.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons why the {{beneficiaries}} may elect to do this. In Saunders v Vautier, the accumulation trusts were to continue until the beneficiary was 25, and (at 21) the beneficiary wished to terminate the accumulation. Similarly, if the trusts are held for a tenant for life, and then for the benefit of a <b>remainderman,</b> both tenant for life and <b>remainderman</b> may decide to terminate the trusts and obtain the capital immediately, and agree a partition of the funds between them; this situation often occurs where changes in the revenue laws means that upon the death of the tenant for life the trust fund may be subject to inheritance tax {{in a way that was}} not envisaged when the trust fund was originally set up.|$|E

Since the publication of the third edition in 2007, a number of significant cases have been decided in the area of trusts: - In relation to apparently explicit declarations of trust, Byrnes v Kendle (2011) 243 CLR 253 has changed the law laid down in the earlier High Court decision of Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v Jolliffe (1920) 28 CLR 178. The decision in Jolliffe had been unchallenged in more than 90 years. - In the area of the fiduciary’s accountability for bribes taken in breach of fiduciary duty, two recent decisions are included: Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd (in administrative receivership) [2011] 3 WLR 1153 and the contrary opinion of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining NL (No 2) [2012] FCAFC 6. - In the area of charitable trusts discussion of Aid/Watch Incorporated v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2010) 241 CLR 539 is included. - The impact of the Personal Property Security Act 2009 (Cth) on Romalpa clauses is also discussed...|$|R

50|$|Justice Holmes, {{writing for}} the majority, {{reasoned}} that the statute as then written required that the income received by trustees and paid to the <b>remainderman</b> be considered taxable income.

5000|$|A <b>remainderman</b> is {{a person}} who {{inherits}} or is entitled to inherit property upon the termination of the estate of the former owner. Usually this occurs due to the death or termination of the former owner's life estate, but this can also occur due to a specific notation in a trust passing ownership from one person to another.|$|E
50|$|The {{life tenant}} cannot open {{the land to}} search for {{minerals}} and other natural resources, but if the quarries or mines were open before the tenant took the life estate, then it is not waste for the life tenant to continue their use. Where the life tenant opens the land for new mines (i.e., voluntary waste) a <b>remainderman</b> can enjoin such.|$|E
5000|$|At death, {{assuming}} no mis-dealings {{to certain}} innocent purchasers, the property {{involved in a}} life estate falls into the ownership of the <b>remainderman</b> ( [...] remaindermen) or reverts to its grantor (all of which confusingly can be called 'reversions' and 'reversioners'). There is a small market for reversions in real estate, which necessitates a buyer to carry out enhanced documentary due diligence and physical checks.|$|E
5000|$|Gavit {{implies that}} the §102(a) {{exclusion}} goes to the <b>remainderman</b> alone, because he is treated as owning the corpus. In holding that trust income cannot be excluded by an income beneficiary (e.g. life-tenant), [...] "the Court in effect decided not merely how much should be taxed, but to whom." [...] But why not divide {{the realization of the}} income somehow between the several heirs? [...] For example: ...|$|E
50|$|An {{interest}} in possession trust {{is the most}} common example of a life interest trust. In a typical {{interest in}} possession trust, the life tenant receives all the income from the trust {{for the rest of his}} or her life. On the life tenant's death, the trust comes to an end, and the capital of the trust is paid to another person, known as the <b>remainderman,</b> as specified by the trust document.|$|E
50|$|Where {{there is}} a duty to convert under the rule in Howe v Earl of Dartmouth, there is, {{in the absence of}} an {{intention}} that the life tenant shall enjoy the income until sale, the second limb of the rule is that the trustee is under a duty also to apportion the property fairly between the life tenant and the <b>remainderman</b> until conversion. The specific rules relating to apportionment are often considered overly technical.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the rule}} is most often {{exercised}} {{where there is a}} sole trustee holding the trust fund on a bare trust for a sole beneficiary (usually where the trusts were held for the benefit of a tenant for life, who has died, and the sole beneficiary is the <b>remainderman),</b> {{the rule is}} not limited to those circumstances. However, if {{there is more than one}} beneficiary, then all of them need to be adults and without any disability.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom the Law Reform Committee {{recommended}} {{replacing the}} rule (together with other highly technical common law rules, {{such as the}} rule in Re Atkinson and the rule in Allhusen v Whittell) with a general statutory duty to hold a fair balance between the tenant for life and the <b>remainderman,</b> with an express power to convert income into capital and vice versa, and a duty to convert and apportion {{to the extent necessary}} to maintain an even hand and {{in a manner consistent with}} the whole investment policy of the reversionary trust fund.|$|E
5000|$|Howe v Earl of Dartmouth (1802) 7 Ves 137 is an English trusts law case. It {{laid down}} the rule of equity in {{relation}} to the duties of a trustee in relation to a trust fund where there are successive interests {{in relation to the}} trust fund, and seeks to strike a fair balance between the rights of the life tenant and the <b>remainderman.</b> [...] It is {{one of a number of}} highly technical common law rules which causes considerable angst where wills and trusts have not been professionally prepared.|$|E
50|$|The book {{is deeply}} researched. For example, the plot turns on {{an aspect of}} {{inheritance}} law - the distinction between a fee simple and a base fee with a <b>remainderman.</b> Another crucial point is the timing of John Huffam's birth, indicated by reference to contemporary {{events such as the}} Ratcliff Highway murders, the Great Comet of 1811, Wellington's capture of Ciudad Rodrigo, and the passing of the Rose act determining how parish register entries should be made. On another level the hero's name hints that the author may have given him the same birth date as Charles John Huffam Dickens.|$|E
50|$|In {{property}} {{law of the}} United Kingdom and the United States and other common law countries, a remainder is a future interest given to a person (who {{is referred to as}} the transferee or <b>remainderman)</b> that is capable of becoming possessory upon the natural end of a prior estate created by the same instrument. Thus, the prior estate must be one that is capable of ending naturally, for example upon the expiration of a term of years or the death of a life tenant. A future interest following a fee simple absolute cannot be a remainder because of the preceding infinite duration.|$|E
5000|$|In most Torrens Title jurisdictions a {{life tenant}} has, like in UK and US, {{the right to}} {{possession}} and enjoyment of the property, but once the tenant dies the property {{will return to the}} <b>remainderman.</b> The main difference is that, the life estate will be registered by the Registrar general of that jurisdiction, and will appear on the registered title. This has the effect of making them [...] one of the 9 types of recognised interest in land, and one of the four that confirm possession. The registration process in Torrens title systems usually confers indefeasibility on the life estate.|$|E
