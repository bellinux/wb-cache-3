500|$|The {{origins of}} the crash disk are {{uncertain}} because of significant irregularities and gaps, noted in the NTSB report, in the manufacturing records of GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE) and its suppliers. [...] Records found after the accident indicated that two <b>rough-machined</b> forgings having the serial number of the crash disk had been routed through GEAE manufacturing. Records indicated that Alcoa supplied GE with TIMET titanium forgings for one disk with the serial number of the crash disk. Some records show that this disk “was rejected for an unsatisfactory ultrasonic indication”, that an outside lab performed an ultrasound inspection of this disk, that this disk was subsequently returned to GE, and that this disk should have been scrapped. [...] The FAA report stated “There is no record of warranty claim by GEAE for defective material and no record of any credit for GEAE processed by Alcoa or TIMET”.|$|E

The FAA report stated “There is no record of warranty claim by GEAE for defective material and no record of any credit for GEAE processed by Alcoa or TIMET”. [...] GE records of the second disk having the serial number of the crash disk indicate that it was made with an RMI titanium billet supplied by Alcoa. Research of GE records showed no other titanium parts were manufactured at GE from this RMI titanium billet {{during the period of}} 1969 to 1990. GE records indicate that final finishing and inspection of the crash disk were completed on December 11, 1971. Alcoa records indicate that this RMI titanium billet was first cut in 1972 and that all forgings made from this material were for airframe parts. [...] If the Alcoa records were accurate, the RMI titanium could not have been used to manufacture the crash disk, indicating that the initially rejected TIMET disk with “an unsatisfactory ultrasonic indication” was the crash disk. [...] CF6 engines like that containing the crash disk were used to power many civilian and military aircraft {{at the time of the}} crash. Due to concerns that the accident could recur, a large number of disks that were in service were examined by ultrasound for indications of defects. At least two “sister disks” were found to have defects like that of the crash disk. Prioritization and efficiency of inspections of the many engines under suspicion would have been aided by determination of the titanium source of the crash disk. Chemical analyses of the crash disk intended to determine its source were inconclusive. The NTSB report stated that if examined disks were not from the same source, “the records on a large number of GEAE disks are suspect. It also means that any AD (Airworthiness Directive) action that is based on the serial number of a disk could fail to have its intended effect because suspect disks could remain in service.” [...] The FAA report did not explicitly address the impact of these uncertainties on operations of military aircraft that might have contained a suspect disk.|$|E
40|$|A set of {{modified}} NACA 5509 - 34 rotor and stator blades {{was investigated}} with <b>rough-machine,</b> hand-filed, and highly polished surface finishes over {{a range of}} weight flows at six equivalent tip speeds from 672 to 1092 feet per second {{to determine the effect}} of blade-surface finish on the performance of a single-stage axial-flow compressor. Surface-finish effects decreased with increasing compressor speed and with decreasing flow at a given speed. In general, finishing blade surfaces below the roughness that may be considered aerodynamically smooth on the basis of an admissible-roughness formula will have no effect on compressor performance...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the use of HIPed aluminum castings as near-net-shape blanks for large electrostatic focusing electrodes in ion lithography machines. The electrodes must have very smooth finishes which are free of pores and other defects. This has heretofore been achieved by <b>rough-machining</b> the blanks out of large forged aluminum billets and final diamond-turning. The use of a near-net-shape casting for the blank was expected to save a significant amount of money and time. The test was conducted on a single cast blank which was supplied by the Partner in the HIPed and stress relieved condition. Rough machining and diamond turning operations conducted by LMES/ER revealed that the casting contained unacceptably large defects. The conclusion was reached that HIPed aluminum castings in the large sizes and of the quality levels required would probably be unobtainable in a cost-effective manner. An alternative approach, using ring forgings assembled by electron beam welding was proposed and investigated by LMES/ER. Although an electrode blank was not obtained, the study indicated that this approach would be successful and cost-effective...|$|R
30|$|Before forging the gear, the {{oxidized}} {{layer and}} surface defects were removed using a hand sand wheel to effectively avoid the cracking phenomenon of forging residue. In the forging process, the procedures must be strictly followed; the forging temperature must be strictly controlled with the temperature difference not exceeding 300  °C. After forging, the forging part must be normalized under more than 950  °C and tempered less than 600  °C to eliminate forging stress and improve cutting performance. After a <b>rough-machining</b> of the gear blank, each part underwent an ultrasonic defect check. A grinding undercut large radius hob {{was used for}} gear grinding to increase gear root fillet, and improve the impact resistance and bearing capacity of gears. In the carburizing and quenching heat treatment process, the carbon potential concentrations were strictly controlled at 0.8  %– 1.0  %. A “quenching + deep freezing + low temperature tempering” process was used {{to ensure that the}} gear surface hardness reached HRC 58 - 62, surface carbide reached Grade 1 – 3, the depth of effective hardened layer reached 1.5 – 1.7  mm range (including grinding), core hardness reached HRC 38 approximately, and retained austenite content was less than 9  %. All gears were ground in high precision grinding machine NILES, and some of the key components, such as planetary gear and sun gear, were under tip relief operation. At the same time, the accuracy of gear machining was one level higher than the specified level on the drawings to ensure a good meshing of the gears. The ground gears were treated by strengthened shot blast to eliminate the burns on the tooth surface and increase residual compressive stress, thereby enhancing the gear’s contact fatigue strength and bending fatigue strength.|$|R
