40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the structure of a <b>rhodolith</b> <b>bed</b> along a depth gradient of 5 to 25 m in the shelf in front of Salvador City, a region of northeastern Brazil. The dimensions, morphology and coralline algae composition of the rhodoliths were analyzed, as well as the vitality, density, and associated flora of the bed at three depths: 5, 15 and 25 m. Samples were obtained by SCUBA divers in summer 2007. Five rhodolith-forming taxa were identified: Sporolithon episporum, Lithothamnion brasiliense, Lithothamnion superpositum, Mesophyllum erubescens, and Lithophyllum sp. The encrusting growth form and the spherical shape were predominant at all depths. Rhodolith dimensions and vitality decreased and the density increased from the shallow to the deepest zones. Fifty-six macroalgal species were found as rhodolith-associated flora. The shallower depth presented higher values for macroalgal biomass and number of species. These results associated with other recent <b>rhodolith</b> <b>bed</b> descriptions indicate that the pattern of Brazilian <b>rhodolith</b> <b>bed</b> structure along depth gradients may be related to a combination of the extent and slope of the continental shelf...|$|E

Rhodalgal sediments, which result from rhodolith breakage and chemical weathering, mix together with living rhodoliths and form shallow water habitats known as rhodolith beds, support a diverse assemblage of organisms. Rhodoliths and sediment cores collected from the El Requeso??n <b>rhodolith</b> <b>bed</b> in Bahi??a Concepcio??n, Me??xico were used to study the basic mechanical and chemical processes involved in rhodalgal sediment production and basic framework of a <b>rhodolith</b> <b>bed.</b> Results showed four major groups of rhodalgal sediments produced from rhodolith breakdown: "cores," "branches," "crumbs," and ???dust??? that ranges in size from pebbles, sands, to silts. Dissolution of rhodoliths was evident at seawater below pH 7. 5 and at 30 % dissolution, core breakdown was accelerated and smaller branches were produced. The general vertical trend of coarse-fine-coarse sedimentary texture indicates the temporal dynamics of a <b>rhodolith</b> <b>bed,</b> suggesting movement in south-north-south direction or expansion-shrinkage-expansion of the active part of the bed from past to present.

40|$|Rhodolith {{beds are}} {{distributed}} from the north-eastern to the southeastern Brazilian continental shelf, constituting the largest extension of coralline algal de-posits in the world. Little {{is known about}} the deep rho-dolith beds within the Campos Basin: the largest oil pro-duction area in the country and a priority area for marine life conservation. This study illustrates a deep <b>rhodolith</b> <b>bed</b> covering about 15 km 2 of a 40 km 2 -area in the Peregrino oil field sampled at 100 - 106 m water depth. Coralline algae are the dominant components on the living rhodolith surfaces associated with subordinate bryozoans, cnidarids, brachiopods and porifers. In some inner parts of the coralline algal nodules, encrusting acervulinid fora-minifera are the main nodule contributors. Through accel-erator mass spectrometric analysis, radiocarbon age esti-mates show that the range in ages between the living outer rhodolith parts and within 3 mm from it the rhodoliths is ca. 4, 700 years. This suggests that a proportion of fossil rhodoliths had been recolonized after periods of burial and/or erosion.

40|$|Calcareous coralline algae (Rhodophyta; Corallinales, Hapalidiales, and Sporolithales; corallines hereafter) {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} widespread and successful groups of marine macrophytes.

In assessments of the rhodoliths, internal and external algal growth morphology, rhodolith external form, rhodolith inner arrangement, and assemblages of organisms forming the rhodoliths can provide valuable information for reconstructing palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic conditions. Rhodoliths can occur massively concentrated in beds several meters thick.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the floral and faunal community associated with rhodolith beds, which are aggregations of free-living coralline algal nodules, off of Santa Catalina Island. Surveys of macroalgal cover, infaunal and epifaunal invertebrates, and fishes suggest rhodolith beds off Santa Catalina Island support greater floral and faunal abundances than adjacent sand habitat. Community separation between rhodolith and sand habitats was due to increased presence of fleshy macroalgae, herbivorous gastropods, and greater abundance of infaunal invertebrates dominated by amphipods, mainly tanaids and gammarids. Stable isotopes were used to determine important sources of primary production supporting rhodolith beds and to identify the major pathways of energy.

We characterized rhodolith and macroalgal assemblages at 5, 10 and 15 m depth during summer and winter. Lithothamnion crispatum was dominant amongst the six rhodolith-forming species present. Most rhodoliths were spheroidal in shape indicating high mobility due to water movement. Rhodolith density decreased with increasing depth and during winter. Turf-forming seaweeds accounted for 60 % of the biomass growing on rhodoliths. Macroalgae increased abundance and richness in the summer, but was similar between 5 and 15 m depth. They were less abundant and diverse than that recorded in rhodolith beds further north in Brazil. Both, season and depth, affected {{the structure of the}} macroalgae assemblages.

The 33 images in the 7 m-thick outcrop, covering a total of 11. 53 m 2, were complemented by data on rhodolith shape, structure, composition and taphonomy. The Serravallian rhodolith body was produced in a long-lasting infralittoral sedimentary environment and then transported into deeper water by slumping. Although biological and geological definitions of rhodolith-dominated facies are inconsistent in some respects, the image analysis described here allows direct comparison of percentages of rhodolith dominance in discrete fossil rhodolith facies and their living counterparts. The procedures involved are both rapid and inexpensive, so the method appears very useful for carbonate quantification. The calculated algal cover, based only on rhodoliths > 2 cm, ranges from 11. 9 to 59. 7 % (mean 27. 3 %).

40|$|Rhodoliths are {{a common}} {{producer}} of carbonates on modern and ancient shelves worldwide, and there is growing evidence that they thrive on volcanic insular shelves. However, little is still known on how rhodoliths cope {{with the demands of}} this particularly dynamic environment. In this study, the focus is placed on fossil rhodoliths from a Pliocene sequence at Santa Maria Island, Azores, in order to gain further insight into the life cycle (and death) of rhodoliths living within a mid-ocean active volcanic setting. These rhodoliths occur as a massive accumulation within a larger submarine volcano-sedimentary sequence that was studied from the macro- to the micro-scale in order to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental conditions under which the rhodolith accumulation was deposited and buried. All fossil rhodoliths from this setting are multi-specific and demonstrate robust growth forms with a lumpy morphology. Moreover, taphonomical analyses show the succession of several destructive events during rhodolith growth, suggesting life under a highly dynamic system prior to stabilization and burial. The rhodoliths therefore tell a story of an eventful life, with multiple transport and growth stages, owing to the environment in which they lived. Transport and deposition to their final resting place was storm-associated, as supported by the general sedimentary sequence. In particular, the sequence features an amalgamation of tempestites deposited under increasing water depths, sediment aggradation, and before burial by volcanic activity. This transgressive trend is also attested by the overall characteristics of the volcano-sedimentary succession, which exhibits the transition to subaerial environment in excess of 100 m above the <b>rhodolith</b> <b>bed...</b>|$|E

40|$|Rhodoliths {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{extensive}} benthic communities of the Brazilian continental shelf, but their structure is poorly known. The richest marine flora of Brazil’s coastal zone is found in Espírito Santo State and its diversity has been partly associated with the presence of extensive areas of rhodoliths, extending from the intertidal zone to 120 m across the continental shelf. One species of kelp, Laminaria abyssalis, is endemic to this area and occurs between 45 and 120 m depth. Our objective was to determine the density and physical dimensions of the superficial rhodoliths between 4 and 55 m depth in the southern region of Espírito Santo State. The study area was 3 to 45 km offshore. Samples were obtained in 2004 and 2005 by Scuba diving in three depth zones: 4 – 18 m, 25 – 30 m and 50 – 55 m. Transect lines and video images were used to determine rhodolith density. The diameter and sphericity of at least 60 individuals from each zone were measured. Rhodolith size increased and density decreased from the shallow to the deeper zones. Spheroidal was the typical shape throughout the depth zones.

40|$|The Abrolhos Bank {{is part of}} the {{so-called}} Eastern Brazilian Shelf and is an area of high ecological and economic importance. The bank supports the largest and richest coral reefs in the South Atlantic and the largest <b>rhodolith</b> <b>bed</b> in the world. The spatial and seasonal variation of phytoplankton concentration, however, and the dynamic processes controlling that variability have remained poorly known. The present study investigates the seasonal and spatial distributions of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and water conditions by analyzing nine years (2003 - 2011) of level- 3 Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived Chl-a, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) /ETA model-derived winds, NCEP model-derived heat fluxes, thermohaline and velocity results from the Hybrid Circulation Ocean Model (HYCOM) 1 / 12 o assimilated simulation. The results show that low/high concentrations occurred in austral spring-summer (wet season) /autumn-winter (dry season), with the highest values observed in the northern portion of the Abrolhos Bank. The typical meteorological and oceanographic conditions during austral summer favor the development of strong stratification. These conditions are 1) N-NE winds that favor an upwelling-type Ekman circulation; 2) coupling between the open ocean and the continental shelf through the western boundary current, which promotes cooler subsurface water to rise onto the shelf break; and 3) positive net heat flux. In contrast, the S-SE winds during autumn are in the opposite direction of the predominant current system over the Abrolhos Bank, thus reducing their speed and inducing an inverse shear. The warmer ocean and a somewhat cool and dry atmosphere promote the evaporative cooling of the surface layer. The above processes drive mixed layer cooling and deepening that reaches its maximum in winter. The blooming of phytoplankton in the Abrolhos Bank waters appears to be regulated by changes in the mixed layer depth, with Chl-a levels that start to increase during autumn and reach their peak in June-July...|$|E

Consistent mean Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Li/Ca concentrations and seasonal patterns are found for the rhodoliths' last living years (2009 2011) across 43 branches and for the full 1963 - 2008 period across the 5 branches.

Individual element variations show good reproducibility between records and Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Li/Ca co-vary systematically. Combined records of Mg/ Ca, Sr/Ca and Li/Ca are highly correlated with the 1 ST monthly pattern for the 2009 - 2011 period (0. 82 < r < 0. 91; p < 0. 001) and with local variations of monthly SST for the 1963 - 2008 period (0. 65 < r < 0. 85; p < 0. 001), with Mg/Ca systematically being the best fit to monthly seawater temperature variations. Inter-annual Mg/Ca anomalies show significant correlation with the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), indicating that S. durum rhodoliths also have the capacity to record the regional climate pattern in the tropical Pacific.

The average volume (from 2. 0 to 400 mL) and wet weight (from 32. 4 to 84. 8 g) was not significantly different among sites, but a significant positive correlation (r = 0. 95, p < 0. 05) was found between these parameters. The size of plants ranged from 2. 0 to 11. 5 cm with predominant size classes of 40. 1 - 60 mm. Differences in rhodolith density, branch density and sphericity were attributed to possible differences in hydrodynamic conditions among sites. These beds were also a suitable habitat for high diversity of associated sponges. A non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis using sponge species data revealed variability in the distribution of sponge assemblages among sites, which is likely the result of differences in environmental conditions. Although these <b>rhodolith</b> <b>beds</b> are not as extensive as those of other regions, our preliminary surveys revealed that they are a common habitat in Bahía Magdalena and likely have an important role in the productivity of this estuarine system...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} of <b>rhodolith</b> <b>beds,</b> relative abundance of species and growth-forms, was evaluated {{in relation to}} a depth gradient and substratum along the southwestern Gulf of California. Replicate transects were established in twelve <b>rhodolith</b> <b>beds</b> to evaluate the species and growth form distribution in relation to depth (2 - 7, 7 - 12 and 12 - 20 m) and habitat (sand vs. rock). Four species with four growth-forms were determined: Lithophyllum margaritae which ranged in growth-form from fruticose, fructifoliose to foliose; Lithothamnion muelleri where the growthform range was lumpy to fruticose; in both Neogoniolithon trichotomum and Mesophyllum engelhartii where only fruticose growth-form was observed. Lithophyllum margaritae was the most abundant species in relation to depth in the sandy habitat and Lithothamnion muelleri was dominant in the shallow rocky areas. The presence of N. trichotomum was limited to shallow sandy beds and M. engelhartii was limited to the deeper areas. Growth-forms also showed a variation with depth and substrata, in where fruticose forms dominate in sandy areas, lumpy forms dominate in rocky habitats and foliose forms were more abundant in the deeper areas. The differences in the abundance of each species and growth form might be explained by a combination of biological features; growth rate, density of reproductive structures and calcification rate in relation to environmental features such substrate type (rock vs. sand), water motion and light...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rhodolith</b> <b>beds</b> are the basal {{transgressive}} unit of {{the several}} hundred metres thick Badenian succession, and are a pecuharity of the Kozjansko area. Rhodoids are mainly spherical having up to 15 cm in diameter. They are built of Lithothamnium corallinacean algae with crusty and branching texture, frequently intergrown with bryozoans. The rhodoid nuclei commonly consist of pebbles of Palaeozoic clastic rocks (quartz, phyllites), Triassic carbonates and Oligocene tuffs. The rhodolith occasionally passes into a rhodolithic conglomerate. Sparsely rhodoids of somewhat smaller dimensions also occur in lithothamnium limestone (biocalcarenite). Rhodolith was formed in nearshore, well agitated areas of the Tertiary Kozjansko basin...|$|R
40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the rhodolith-forming species of Lithophyllum (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) found from Espirito Santo State, Brazil, were evaluated based on extensive subtidal sampling. A comparative {{analysis of the}} Brazilian material with recently described species lead us to conclude that three known species (Lithophyllum corallinae, L. johansenii, L. stictaeforme) and one species new to science (Lithophyllum espiritosantense Villas-Boas, Figueiredo et Riosmena-Rodriguez) {{are present in the}} area. All four species can be distinguished primarily by their tetrasporangial conceptacle roof anatomy.

40|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} {{production by}} marine organisms {{is an essential}} process in the global budget of CO 32 -, and coralline reefs {{are the most important}} benthic carbonate producers. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are well recognized as the most important carbonate builders in the tropical Brazilian continental shelf, forming structural reefs and extensive <b>rhodolith</b> <b>beds.</b> However, the distribution of CCA beds, as well as their role in CO 32 - mineralization in mesophotic communities and isolated carbonate banks, is still poorly known. To characterize the bottom features of several seamount summits in the Southwestern Atlantic (SWA), side-scan sonar records, remotely operated vehicle imagery, and benthic samples with mixed-gas scuba diving were acquired during two recent research cruises (March 2009 and February 2011). The tops of several seamounts within this region are relatively shallow (similar to 60 m), flat, and dominated by <b>rhodolith</b> <b>beds</b> (Vitoria, Almirante Saldanha, Davis, and Jaseur seamounts, as well as the Trindade Island shelf). On the basis of abundance, dimensions, vitality, and growth rates of CCA nodules, a mean CaCO 3 production was estimated, ranging from 0. 4 to 1. 8 kg m(- 2) y(- 1) with a total production reaching 1. 5 x 10 (- 3) Gt y(- 1). Our results indicate that these SWA seamount summits provide extensive areas of shallow reef area and represent 0. 3 % of the world's carbonate banks. The importance of this habitat has been highly neglected, and immediate management needs must be fulfilled in the short term to ensure long-term persistence of the ecosystem services provided by these offshore carbonate realms.

40|$|Backscatter {{strength}} versus {{incidence angle}} has been measured {{from a variety}} of seafloor types from Australian coastal waters using a Reson Seabat 8125 multibeam echo-sounder (MBES) operating at 455 kHz. MBES surveys were carried out at six sites around Australia (between 2004 and 2006). Seafloor habitats surveyed in this study included: seagrass meadows, <b>rhodolith</b> <b>beds,</b> coral reef, rock, gravel, sand, muddy sand, and mixtures of those habitats. The highest backscatter strength was observed not only for the hard and rough substrate, but also for marine flora, such as rhodolith and seagrass. The main difference in acoustic backscatter from the different habitats was the mean level, or angle-average backscatter strength. However, additional information was also obtained from the rate of change (or slope) of backscatter strength with incidence angle. Overall, analysis of MBES backscatter data found at least six different seafloor habitats could be identified, in descending order of their average backscatter strength: 1) Rhodolith, 2) Coral, 3) Rock, 4) Seagrass, 5) sand-dominated bare (i. e. no epibenthic cover) sediment, 6) mud-dominated bare (i. e. no epibenthic cover) sediment...|$|R
