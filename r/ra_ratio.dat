40|$|Interleukin- 1 ? (IL- 1 ?) is a {{key player}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases at the periphery and in the brain. Its action is regulated by interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra), the specific endogenous antagonist of IL- 1 receptors. The ratio between local concentrations of IL- 1 Ra and IL- 1 ? is known to influence the initiation and progression of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases at the periphery. In order to determine whether this is also the case in the brain, brain and plasma concentrations of IL- 1 ? and IL- 1 Ra were measured by ELISA in a model of chronic brain inflammation in Lewis rats, the hippocampal delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG). Brain IL- 1 ? increased rapidly after intracerebral (i. c.) injection of BCG and came back to baseline concentrations 1 week later, whereas IL- 1 Ra increased gradually over time and remained elevated during the last 2 weeks post-BCG intracerebral injection. Following peripheral BCG challenge, brain IL- 1 ? increased {{at the site of the}} brain BCG and peaked 12 days later before decreasing on day 16 post-challenge. Brain IL- 1 Ra remained elevated during the first days post-challenge and then decreased from the 12 th day post-challenge. The same temporal variations were observed in the plasma concentrations of IL- 1 ? and IL- 1 Ra. The increase in the IL- 1 ?/IL- 1 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratio</b> that was apparent from day 3 to day 12 post-challenge might be correlated with the invasion of peripheral inflammatory cells at the site of intracerebral injection. Besides showing that the course of inflammation alters the brain IL- 1 ?/IL- 1 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratio,</b> these findings point to the importance of monitoring plasma IL- 1 ?/IL- 1 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratio</b> to predict the course of brain inflammation...|$|E

In this paper, more than 800 Carpathian catchments (up to 35. 2 km 2 in area) were investigated in context of the “Horton’s and Schumm’s laws”.

The mean that values of the bifurcation ratio (RB) and the area <b>ratio</b> (<b>RA)</b> reach 3. 8 and 4. 8, respectively, and are thus comparable to values reported in other regions of the world. However, the “law of stream lengths” is not fulfilled in {{more than half of the}} catchments, which is not consistent with many theoretical studies reported in the literature. Only 383 (48 %) catchments fulfill the “law of stream length”, with the mean value of the length ratio (RL) = 2. 3. There was no relationship found between the geological/geomorphological settings that influence river system development and the spatial distribution of catchments where the “law of stream length” was or was not was fulfilled.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether microvascular integrity in the risk area (RA) for myocardial infarction (MI) one day after recanalization predicts the outcome in patients with first acute MI. Background. Immediately after recanalization, microcirculation in the RA is modified by both hyperemic response and microvascular impairment. Methods. Fifty consecutive patients who underwent serial myocardial contrast echocardiography before and one day after recanalization (day 2) were studied. All patients had a completely occluded lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery alone, and underwent successful reperfusion therapy. The relative size of the initial RA (<b>RA</b> <b>ratio)</b> and peak gray scale ratio (PGSR) within the RA on day 2 were determined. Patients were followed for a median of 22 months to evaluate clinical outcome. Results. On day 2, PGSR was a median of 0. 46. Study patients were subdivided into two groups, group A of 24 patients with acceptable opacification (PGSR > 0. 46 on day 2) and group B of 26 patients without it. Major cardiac events (cardiac death, nonfatal MI and repeat admission for congestive heart failure) were more frequently observed in group B (28 % vs. 4 %, Cox hazard ratio = 8. 5, p = 0. 05, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 03 to 69. 9). The median value of the <b>RA</b> <b>ratio</b> was 0. 45. Patients (n = 15) with <b>RA</b> <b>ratio</b> > 0. 45 on day 1 and PGSR on day 2 ≤ 0. 46 exhibited a 10. 7 -fold relative risk for major cardiac events (p = 0. 005, 95 % CI 2. 06 to 55. 8) and a 3. 69 -fold relative risk for composite cardiac events (major cardiac events and target lesion revascularizations) after the initial intervention (p = 0. 004, 95 % CI 1. 51 to 9. 04). Conclusions. The assessment of both {{the size of the}} initial RA and microvascular integrity on day 2 enables precise determination of the efficacy of reperfusion therapy and prediction of the short- and intermediate-term prognoses of patients with recanalized MI...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} reports data on CO 2 -rich {{geothermal}} waters and their associated carbonate deposits from the SW {{part of the}} Permian Lodève Basin (South of France). Both waters and carbonates are enriched in 226 Ra, with activities up to 2. 2 Bq/L and 3. 5 Bq/g respectively. A series of carbonate samples precipitated around the studied wells since 1990 were dated through the 226 Ra- 210 Pb and 228 Ra- 228 Th methods, {{and the results are}} discussed in a new Concordia diagram. While both methods give comparable dates for many samples, Ra-Pb ages are sometimes much older than Ra-Th ages. We propose that these discrepancies result from the adsorption of 222 Rn daughter nuclides in such a Rn-rich environment. The (228 Ra/ 226 <b>Ra)</b> 0 activity <b>ratios</b> calculated at the time of deposition are remarkably constant for about 12 years, suggesting the presence of a steady-state aquifer. The low (228 Ra/ 226 <b>Ra)</b> 0 <b>ratios</b> (0. 348 ± 0. 008) are best explained if most of the Ra derives from the Cambrian carbonate series (mainly dolostone) underlying the Permian Basin, which have low Th/U and similar (228 Ra/ 226 <b>Ra)</b> <b>ratios.</b> This study suggests that Ra and other alkaline-earth elements do not necessarily originate from the rocks surrounding the deep geothermal reservoir, but rather may be introduced into the CO 2 -rich water during its transfer towards the surface and interaction with carbonate rocks...|$|R

We performed tracer surveys during two periods in 2004, in January (dry season, gauged river discharge 47 m 3 s 21) and in July (wet season, 430 m 3 s 21). The isotopic data suggested that {{there are at least}} three different sources of these tracers in the estuary: river water, seawater, and groundwater. We estimated the extent of each input via a mixing model using 222 Rn, 223 Ra, and 224 Ra activities and 224 Ra: 223 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratios.</b> Our analysis showed that the largest groundwater outflow occurs near the mouth of the river. Our groundwater discharge estimates based on the mixing model are 10 and 16 m 3 s 21 for January and July, respectively.

IL- 1 β and IL- 1 Ra mRNA expression was investigated by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 31 patients with CAH of varying severity (classified as minimal/mild in 13 cases and moderate/severe activity in 18 cases) and in 12 control subjects. Quantitative evaluation of IL- 1 β and IL- 1 Ra corresponding bands was performed by densitometric image analysis, and expressed in arbitrary units. The 12 controls expressed a similar pattern with a mean IL- 1 β/IL- 1 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 03 (1. 03 ± 0. 15 (mean ± s. e. m.), median 0. 92, range 0. 71 – 1. 45).

Pitcairn lavas have elevated Ti, which also supports the presence of a mafic protolith in the Pitcairn mantle. A subset of Pitcairn seamount samples, including the seamount sample presented here, are tholeiitic. Tholeiitic lavas are uncommon at ocean hotspots located far from mid-ocean ridges. Like tholeiites that erupted in Hawaii, the presence of tholeiites in the Pitcairn magmatic suite can be explained by melting a silica-saturated recycled mafic component in the Pitcairn mantle source. We also present the highest ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratio (12. 6 <b>Ra,</b> <b>ratio</b> to atmosphere) from the Pitcairn hotspot. This sample anchors the high ^(206) Pb/^(204) Pb portion of the Pitcairn array and provides evidence for a plume component in the Pitcairn mantle.

40|$|International {{audience}} 226 Ra, 228 Ra and Ba distributions {{as well as}} 228 Ra/ 226 Ra and 226 Ra/Ba ratios {{were measured}} in seawater, suspended and sinking particles at the DYFAMED station in the Western Mediterranean Sea at different seasons of year 2003 in order to track the build-up and fate of barite through time. The study of the 228 Raex/ 226 Raex ratios (Raex = Ra activities corrected for the lithogenic Ra) of suspended particles suggests that Baex (Baex = Ba concentrations corrected for the lithogenic Ba, mostly barite) formation takes place {{not only in the}} upper 500 m of the water column but also deeper (i. e. throughout the mesopelagic layer). Temporal changes in the 228 Raex/ 226 Raex ratios of sinking particles collected at 1000 m depth likely reflect changes in the relative proportion of barite originating from the upper water column (with a high 228 Ra/ 226 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratio)</b> and formed in the mesopelagic layer (with a low 228 Ra/ 226 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratio).</b> 228 Raex/ 226 Raex ratios measured in sinking particles collected in the 1000 m-trap in April and May suggest that barite predominantly formed in the upper water column during that period, while barite found outside the phytoplankton bloom period (February and June) appears to form deeper in the water column. Combining ratios of both the suspended and sinking particles provides information on aggregation/disaggregation processes. High 226 Raex/Baex ratios were also found in suspended particles collected in the upper 500 m of the water column. Because celestite is expected to be enriched in Ra [Bernstein R. E., Byrne R. H. and Schijf J. (1998) Acantharians: a missing link in the oceanic biogeochemistry of barium. Deep-Sea Res.

40|$|There {{has been}} much debate as to whether 210 Pb- 226 Ra disequilibria in young {{volcanic}} rocks result from partial melting, cumulate interaction or magma degassing. Here we present new data from basalts erupted in 1978 from Ardoukoba volcano in the Asal Rift. The (210 Pb/ 226 <b>Ra)</b> t <b>ratios</b> are very low (0. 2 to 0. 6) and appear to correlate negatively with (226 Ra/ 230 Th). Invariant (230 Th/ 238 U) and (231 Pa/ 235 U) ratios require similar melting rates, porosities, and extents for all parental magmas. Thus, the range in (226 Ra/ 230 Th), which is negatively correlated with Th concentration, reflects fractional crystallization over millennia after the magmas were emplaced into the crust. This precludes the 210 Pb deficits from resulting from partial melting. Instead, the 210 Pb deficits must have formed subsequent to magma differentiation and are interpreted to reflect several decades of magma degassing. Many young basalts erupted {{in a variety of}} tectonic settings are similarly depleted in 210 Pb with respect to 226 Ra, suggesting that they continuously degas over a period of a few to several decades, perhaps reflecting the time required to rise to the surface from deeper reservoirs.

This study allows identification of the deep thermal water signature and reveals the influence of seawater or karst water inflows on Ra isotopes and 222 Rn. The deep thermal water has 226 Ra and 222 Rn activities of 840 and 1900 mBq/l, respectively, a (228 Ra/ 226 Ra) activity ratio of 0. 59, and low (224 Ra/ 228 Ra) and (223 Ra/ 226 Ra) ratios of 0. 67 and 0. 025, respectively. Several arguments suggest a dominant role of radioactive decay for short-lived Ra isotopes and Rn during the relatively rapid ascent of thermal water through wide open fractures and drains. The low (223 Ra/ 226 <b>Ra)</b> <b>ratio</b> constrains the maximum ascent velocity of thermal water to 8 - 10 m/h. Seawater inflow into the hydrothermal system results in an enrichment in short-lived Ra isotopes and 222 Rn. The high (223 Ra/ 226 <b>Ra)</b> <b>ratio</b> (0. 23) suggests that 223 Ra, 224 Ra and 222 Rn produced by alpha-recoil in the upper-Jurassic limestone are entrained by seawater percolation through the coastal basement, due to active pumping {{in one of the}} near shore production well. This process would be enhanced by a low water/rock ratio (i. e. in a low-porosity, micro-fractured limestone). Mixing of this enriched seawater with thermal water induces barite precipitation with co-precipitation of a large fraction of Ra. Short-lived Ra isotopes may thus be useful tracers of seawater flux towards the continent. Conversely, the inflow and mixing of karst groundwater result in a general dilution of all dissolved elements, only a small enrichment in 224 Ra and 223 Ra, but a large enrichment in 222 Rn (up to 26 Bq/l). The combination of Ra isotopes and 222 Rn data provides a good way to trace the dynamics of different water masses along coastal areas...|$|E

The low Ra isotope activities of the Lez system waters (from 0. 35 to 3. 45 mBq/L of 226 Ra) were measured by gamma spectrometry using the method developed in our previous work. Our data reveal the coherent behavior of 226 Ra in Lez spring waters, well correlated to other major and trace elements, like Cl, Na, K, Mg, Li, Rb and Ba. The (228 Ra/ 226 <b>Ra)</b> <b>ratios</b> are distinct between the Lez spring (0. 60 to 0. 72) and two neighboring springs (0. 52 to 0. 65), showing the spatial variability in karst systems. In spite of their small variations in the Lez spring, it was possible to trace different water components and mixing processes from Lower-Cretaceous, Upper-Jurassic and Middle Jurassic end-members, in agreement with previous studies based on major and trace elements. Data obtained on waters derived from the Upper-Jurassic karst reveal that their (228 Ra/ 226 <b>Ra)</b> <b>ratios</b> are not related to the Th/U ratio of the Jurassic limestone, but are rather influenced by the soil and alterite cover of the recharge area. 222 Rn activities in the Lez spring are relatively low (0. 5 to 3. 7 Bq/L) compared to other karst regions. The highest 222 Rn activities are found in diluted waters following heavy rainfall episodes, suggesting a subsurface origin of Rn. Soil and alterite samples that have much higher 226 Ra activities (from 51 to 130 Bq/kg), compared to those from the main aquifer rocks (from 2. 9 to 16 Bq/kg), are probably the main source of Rn, rather than the rocks of the karst itself. The study of several flood episodes reveals the correlation between Rn peak-values or total activity discharged at the spring with cumulative rainfall. Finally, 222 Rn dissolved in water decays to 210 Pb, and our data show that constraints on transfer times of underground waters can potentially be obtained from their coupled measurement...|$|R
40|$|Summary: This {{thesis is}} focused on mapping of {{contaminants}} released into the environment probably due to uranium mining. These chemical contaminants are used to reconstruct the sedimentary processes. In the thesis we evaluate geochemical situation in the catchment area in the locality Borecek (part of the municipality Ralsko) using the overbank sediments as sedimentary archives of pollution during the last decades by elements U, Ba, Zn, Ni and 226 Ra. A map of aerial survey of gamma activity was used to select the area of interest, for more accurate localisation we used a surface gamma spectrometry. On Borecek we retrieved ten depth profiles of alluvial sediments (up to 230 cm) and one in Mimon, all samples were subjected to X-ray fluorescence spectral analysis (XRF), across the floodplain we performed gamma wire logs. For interpretations of floodplains architecture electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used and selected profiles were analysed for the activity of 226 Ra and 210 Pb. Interrelation of 226 Ra and Ba proved that radiobarite is {{the main source of}} the gamma activity. 210 Pb / 226 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratio</b> was used as sediment age indicator. With enrichment factor (LEF), we performed chemostratigraphic correlation of the sediments, for that the concentration of the target elements is corrected for varying [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{elucidate}} the processes controlling the distribution and behavior of the longer-lived Ra isotopes in continuous Paleozoic carbonate aquifers of parts of Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Activities of (228 Ra) and (226 Ra) were analyzed in fresh and saline ground waters, brines, and rocks. The fluids have a wide salinity range (200 – 250, 000 mg lÿ 1 total dissolved solids). The (226 Ra) activity ranges from 0. 66 – 7660 dpm kgÿ 1 and correlates with salinity and other alkaline earth element (Ca, Sr, and Ba) concentrations. The range of (228 Ra: 226 Ra) ratios in the fluids (0. 06 – 1. 48) is similar to that in the aquifer rocks (0. 21 – 1. 53). The relatively low mean fluid (228 Ra: 226 <b>Ra)</b> <b>ratio</b> (0. 30) reflects the low Th:U ratio of the predominant carbonate aquifer rock. Radium occurs mostly (r 77 %) as Ra 2 + species in the fluids. Salinity-dependent sorption–desorption processes (with log K values from 100 – 104 and negatively correlated with salinity), involving Th-enriched surface coatings on aquifer flow channels, can explain the rapid solid–fluid transfer of Ra isotopes in the system and the correlation of Ra with salinity. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is characterised by neutrophilic inflammation in the airways and these neutrophils {{contribute to the}} production of inflammatory mediators. Dampening the production of proinflammatory mediators might be an important strategy to treat COPD and glucocorticosteroids are known to do so via inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB. However, this pathway is important for the control of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes. We studied the effects of dexamethasone on production and secretion of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL) - 1 beta and anti-inflammatory secreted IL- 1 receptor antagonist (sIL- 1 Ra) by human neutrophils activated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha. In vitro, TNF-alpha-stimulated neutrophils produced significant amounts of IL- 1 beta and sIL- 1 Ra; this production was inhibited by dexamethasone. However, synthesis and secretion of sIL- 1 Ra was inhibited at lower concentrations dexamethasone compared to IL- 1 beta, which changed the IL- 1 beta:sIL- 1 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratio</b> significantly. This altered ratio resulted in a more pro-inflammatory condition, as visualised by increased intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 expression on human endothelial cells. In vivo, moderate-to-severe COPD patients using inhaled glucocorticosteroids have decreased plasma sIL-Ra levels compared with mild-to-moderate patients not on glucocorticosteroid treatment. In conclusion, dexamethasone induces a pro-inflammatory shift in the IL- 1 beta:sIL- 1 Ra cytokine balance in neutrophils in vitro, which might contribute to a lack of endogenous anti-inflammatory signals to dampen inflammation in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Thirty-six {{springs and}} wells from the Dead Sea Rift Valley were {{periodically}} sampled and analyzed. The latter included full chemical analyses, 222 Rn and 226 Ra (by a-counting emanometry), {{as well as}} 228 Ra/ 226 Ra and 224 Ra/ 228 <b>Ra</b> activity <b>ratios</b> (g spectrometry). Sampling stretched over almost 2 yr. Several hundred Rn-Ra analyses and close to a hundred isotopic ratios were measured. Most waters in the Rift Valley have both elevated Ra (several to 750 dpm/L) and Rn (a few hundred to almost 60, 000 dpm/L) content. In practically all samples 222 Rn activity considerably exceeds that of its parent 226 Ra. The Ra content {{is the result of}} all Dead Sea Rift Valley waters being mixtures of fresh water with saline brines. Ra is efficiently extracted from surrounding rocks into the brine end member. 228 Ra/ 226 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratios</b> are exceptionally low 20. 07 to 0. 9, mostly less than 0. 2. This apparently reflects the U over Th enrichment in the source rocks that contribute the Ra. Ra enrichment (both 228 Ra and 226 Ra) is locally correlated throughout the Rift Valley with water salinity. This correlation can be used to constrain the age of the brine-freshwater mixing process. In one of the hydrologic subsystems studied (the Fuliya block), the mixing of the shallow ground water must have occurred in less than 200 to 300 yr ago, probably before no more than some 30 yr. High radon activities in surface waters along the Dead Sea Rift Valley result from the formation of radium-enriched linings on the aquifer rock surface. The mixing of the radium-extracting brines with fresh water leads to continual adsorption of radium as water salinity decreases. The unique combination of fast upward flow and continual mixing in the Dead Sea Rift Valley accounts for a constant replenishment of radium in the waters. This causes a gradual buildup of a radium lining on the aquifer walls until eventually a steady-state surface activity is established. Copyrigh...|$|R
40|$|The medium-size intra-cranial arteries {{arising from}} the carotid {{bifurcation}} are prone to perinatal arterial ischemic strokes (PAIS). PAIS’ physiopathology needs to be better understood to develop preventive and therapeutic interventions that are currently missing. We hypothesized that materno-fetal inflammation leads to a vasculitis affecting selectively the carotidian tree and promoting a focal thrombosis and subsequent stroke. Dams were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli. A prothrombotic stress was applied on LPS-exposed vs. saline (S) -exposed middle cerebral arteries (MCA). Immunolabeling detected the inflammatory markers of interest. In S-exposed newborn pups, a constitutive higher density of macrophages combined to higher expressions of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin 1 β (IL- 1 β) was observed within the wall of intra- vs. extra-cranial cervicocephalic arteries. LPS-induced maternal and placental inflammatory responses mediated by IL- 1 β, TNF-α and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP- 1) were associated with: (i) increased density of pro-inflammatory macrophages (M 1 phenotype); and (ii) pro-inflammatory orientation of the IL- 1 system (IL- 1 β/IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 <b>Ra)</b> <b>ratio)</b> within the wall of LPS-, vs. S-exposed, intra-cranial arteries susceptible to PAIS. LPS plus photothrombosis, but not sole photothrombosis, triggered ischemic strokes and subsequent motor impairments. Based on these preclinical results, the combination of pro-thrombotic stress and selective intra-cranial arteritis arising from end gestational maternal immune activation seem {{to play a role}} in the pathophysiology of human PAIS...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is an autoimmune disorder, with {{a considerable}} genetic influence on susceptibility and disease course. Cytokines {{play an important}} role in MS pathophysiology, and genes encoding various cytokines are logical candidates to assess possible associations with MS susceptibility and disease course. We previously reported an association of a combination of polymorphisms in the interleukin (IL) - 1 B and IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 RN) genes (i. e. IL- 1 RN allele 2 +/IL- 1 B(+ 3959) allele 2 -) with disease severity in MS. Extending this observation, we investigated whether IL- 1 beta and IL- 1 ra production differed depending on carriership of this gene combination. METHODS: Twenty MS patients and 20 controls were selected based upon carriership of the specific combination. In whole blood, in vitro IL- 1 beta and IL- 1 ra production was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent-assay after 6 and 24 h of stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. RESULTS: Carriers of the specific combination produced more IL- 1 ra, especially in MS patients, although not significantly. IL- 1 ra production was significantly higher in individuals homozygous for IL- 1 RN allele 2. In patients, Il- 1 ra production was higher and IL- 1 beta production lower compared with controls. In primary progressive patients, the IL- 1 beta /IL- 1 <b>ra</b> <b>ratio</b> was significantly lower than in relapsing-remitting patients. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest higher in vitro IL- 1 ra production in carriers of IL- 1 RN allele 2, with an indication of an allelic dose-effect relationship...|$|E
40|$|Autologous {{conditioned}} serum (ACS) is {{a recent}} biotherapy based on certain cytokines anti-inflammatory prop-erties mainly used for the reduction of osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms. Here we investigated different physico-chemical factors influencing ACS purification and cytokine production. Human venous blood was incubated {{in the presence of}} different diameter beads (respectively 2. 5, 3, 3. 5, and 4 mm) or glass beads with different types of coating (polished or coated with CrSO 4). Sera were recovered, and the concentrations of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory relevant cytokines were measured using Luminex technology. Fresh whole blood incu-bated for 24 h highly increased production of interleukin (IL) - 6 and IL- 8 cytokines. At the same time, the con-centrations of IL- 1 b, IL- 1 receptor agonist (IL- 1 Ra), IL- 10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a were slightly induced. The highest cytokine concentrations were obtained with the exposure of whole blood to 3 -mm glass beads and 3. 5 -mm polished beads. The minimum IL- 1 b/IL- 1 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratio</b> obtained was 3. 2 – 1. 3 after 24 -h incubation without any beads. ACS has been shown to alleviate clinical symptoms of OA in clinical studies. This descriptive study demonstrated that different pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are present in ACS since no selective anti-inflammatory cytokines were produced based on the different protocols. Furthermore, we showed that CrSO 4 -treated glass beads are not necessary and that the absence of beads combined with a 24 -h incubation could also lead to an enriched serum.

40|$|Continental {{shelves and}} shelf seas {{play a central}} role in the global carbon cycle. However, their {{importance}} with respect to trace element and isotope (TEI) inputs to ocean basins is less well understood. Here, we present major findings on shelf TEI biogeochemistry from the GEOTRACES program as well as a proof-of-concept for a new method to estimate shelf TEI fluxes. The case studies focus on advances in our understanding of TEI cycling in the Arctic, transformations within a major river estuary (Amazon), shelf sediment micronutrient fluxes, and basin-scale estimates of submarine groundwater discharge. The proposed shelf flux tracer is 228 -radium (T 1 / 2 = 5. 75 y), which is continuously supplied to the shelf from coastal aquifers, sediment porewater exchange, and rivers. Model-derived shelf 228 Ra fluxes are combined with TEI/ 228 <b>Ra</b> <b>ratios</b> to quantify ocean TEI fluxes from the western North Atlantic margin. The results from this new approach agree well with previous estimates for shelf Co, Fe, Mn, and Zn inputs and exceed published estimates of atmospheric deposition by factors of ~ 3 - 23. Lastly, recommendations are made for additional GEOTRACES process studies and coastal margin-focused section cruises that will help refine the model and provide better insight on the mechanisms driving shelf-derived TEI fluxes to the ocean...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{portable}} {{sampling system}} {{was developed to}} extract Radium isotopes from large volumes (up to 300 L) of fresh surface- and ground-waters of low Ra-activities (< 5 mBq/L). Ra is quantitatively adsorbed on a small amount (6. 5 g) of MnO 2 -coated acrylic fibers, which are then dried and burned at 600 °C in the laboratory. The resulting Mn-oxide powder (about 2 cm 3 when compacted) is then analyzed through gamma-ray spectrometry which allows measurement of the whole Ra quartet (226 Ra, 228 Ra, 224 Ra and 223 Ra) in a single counting of a few days. The usual relative standard combined uncertainties (1 σ) are 2 – 3 % for 226 Ra, 228 Ra and 224 Ra; and less than 10 % for 223 Ra. This method {{was applied to the}} analysis of Ra in karstic waters of the Lez aquifer, and surface- and ground-waters of the upper and middle Vidourle watershed (South of France). The analyzed waters have relatively low 226 Ra activities (1 – 4 mBq/L) in both cases, regardless of the contrasted geology (Mesozoic limestone vs crystalline Variscan basement), but clearly distinct (228 Ra/ 226 <b>Ra)</b> <b>ratios</b> in agreement with the differences in Th/U ratios of the two drained areas.

40|$|Geopolymeric {{recycled}} concrete (GRC) is a {{new construction}} material which takes environmentalsustainability into account, by using alkali solution and fly ash to completely substitute Portland cementas well as by replacing natural coarse aggregate with recycled coarse aggregate. GRC could be used togetherwith steel hollow sections to form composite section. There is very limited study on such GRC filledtubular sections. This paper presents an experimental study on GRC filled tubular stub columns. A total of 12 specimens were tested. The main parameters varied in the tests are: (1) two section sizes of square hollow sections(B × t) with 200 mm× 6 mm and 150 mm× 5 mm; (2) different concrete types: GRC and recycled aggregateconcrete (RAC); (3) different recycled aggregate (<b>RA)</b> replacement <b>ratios</b> of 0 %, 50 % and 100 %.

Meanwhile, the ductility of the columns was investigated by a ductility index (DI). The resultsshow that the ultimate strength decreased with increasing RA contents for both GRC and RAC filled columns. The influence of RA content on the strength was greater in GRC than that in RAC.
