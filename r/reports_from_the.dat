5|$|Meanwhile, Ted {{started work}} in February 1961 as an {{assistant}} district attorney for Suffolk County, Massachusetts (for which he took a nominal $1 salary), where he first developed a hard-nosed attitude towards crime. He took many overseas trips, billed as fact-finding tours {{with the goal of}} improving his foreign policy credentials. On a nine-nation Latin American trip in 1961, FBI <b>reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> time showed Kennedy meeting with Lauchlin Currie, an alleged former Soviet spy, together with locals in each country whom the reports deemed left-wingers and Communist sympathizers. <b>Reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> FBI and other sources had Kennedy renting a brothel and opening up bordellos after hours during the tour. The Latin American trip helped to formulate Kennedy's foreign policy views, and in subsequent Boston Globe columns he warned that the region might turn to Communism if the U.S. did not reach out to it in a more effective way. Kennedy also began speaking to local political clubs and organizations.|$|E
5|$|More recent investigations, mainly {{based on}} {{original}} medical <b>reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{period of the}} pandemic, found that the viral infection itself was not more aggressive than any previous influenza, but that the special circumstances (malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, poor hygiene) promoted bacterial superinfection that killed most of the victims typically after a somewhat prolonged death bed.|$|E

5|$|Slight {{weakening}} {{took place}} after moving over western Cuba; however, once over the Gulf of Mexico, the storm steadily regained its strength. By September19, the system re-attained the equivalent intensity of a Category2 hurricane and the forward motion increased.

By the afternoon of September19, <b>reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Louisiana and Mississippi coastline indicated that the outer bands of the hurricane were producing scattered rainfall.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} <b>reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{crash site}} {{speculated that the}} Amana was already on fire when it struck the tops of trees because those trees, and pieces of the aircraft's left wing torn off in the impact with them, showed signs of scorching. Several eyewitnesses reported seeing flames in the sky before the aircraft struck the ground. Department of Civil Aviation investigators discounted this speculation because {{only one of the}} Amana's push-button engine fire extinguishers had activated and this had most likely occurred during the crash or the fire.|$|E
5|$|The initial <b>reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> test pilot, Gerhard Nitschke, were favourable. The He 111's flight {{performance}} and handling were impressive although it dropped its wing in the stall. As a result, the passenger variants had their wings reduced from 25m (82ft) to 23m (75ft). The military aircraft - V1, V3 and V5 - spanned just 22.6m (74.1ft).|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} between a tropical wave and a upper-level low moving southeastward from Texas spawned a broad trough over the central Gulf of Mexico on October24. That day, {{there was a}} marked increase in convection, or thunderstorms. At the same time, the pressure gradient between the trough and a high pressure area over the southeastern United States produced winds of near gale force across the northern Gulf of Mexico. Early on October 26, a tropical depression developed about 380 mi (610 km) south-southwest of New Orleans. Within 12 hours, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Juan, based on satellite imagery and <b>reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hurricane Hunters. Initially, the structure was akin {{to that of a}} subtropical cyclone, with light winds near the center. Juan moved erratically at first, eventually tracking more steadily to the north-northeast on October 27. After turning to the northwest late on October 27, Juan intensified into a hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), based on <b>reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hurricane Hunters.|$|E

5|$|After their {{training}} had been completed, on 17 November the sappers were transported to an RAF airfield at Skitten in Scotland, with the operation scheduled to commence two days later. On {{the evening of}} 19 November, Group Captain Cooper, {{with the aid of}} a Norwegian meteorologist and regular <b>reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> SOE agents stationed near the landing zone, decided that although the weather was not perfect, it would be best to launch the operation that night; Cooper believed that if it were delayed, the weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent the operation from being conducted entirely. The first aircraft–glider combination took off from the airfield at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling the airfield several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective.|$|E
5|$|At 1800UTC on August1, an {{unidentified}} ship roughly 950mi (1,550km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii reported 70mph (110km/h) winds within a storm, prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Dot. Despite an apparent correlation between Dot and the preceding unnamed tropical cyclone, {{the lack of}} ship reports between July27 and August1 prevented the agency from confirming that the two systems were the same. Nonetheless, development upon designation was rapid as the system tracked westward, with <b>reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> SS Sonoma indicating that Dot had intensified to hurricane strength by August2. Rapid intensification continued, and at 0000UTC on August3, reconnaissance aircraft found winds of 150mph (240km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 952mbar (hPa; 28.11inHg), making Dot a Category4 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Later analysis indicated that these figures constituted the hurricane's peak intensity.|$|E
5|$|Four {{people were}} killed in the Philippines by Koni, and an {{additional}} person was injured. Damage <b>reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Philippines remained scarce, though the PAGASA indicated that damage costs totaled 67.250million Philippine pesos (US$1.26million). On July18, an Airbus A330-242 carrying 242passengers bound for Hong Kong encountered Koni in the South China Sea and attempted to deviate from its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather. However, the plane inadvertently encountered an area of severe turbulence, resulting in three minor injuries on board. The plane was later able to exit the area of turbulence and land safely at Hong Kong International Airport.|$|E
