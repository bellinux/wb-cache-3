5|$|Around 1657, Ruisdael {{moved to}} Amsterdam, by then a prosperous city which {{was likely to}} have offered a bigger market for his work. His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam and found a market there. On June 17, 1657 he was baptized in Ankeveen, near Naarden. Ruisdael {{lived and worked in}} Amsterdam for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> 1668, his name appears as a witness to the {{marriage}} of Meindert Hobbema, his only registered pupil, a painter whose works have been confused with Ruisdael's own.|$|E
5|$|After Barrington {{suffered}} a paralytic stroke in early 1919, {{he was unable}} to perform. He spent the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> poverty, although his fellow actors held benefits and made other efforts to help him, and his brothers and his neighbors in East Hagbourne, Berkshire, helped him as he became increasingly disabled and eventually unable even to speak.

5|$|After sending Stewie out {{for more}} paper, Paul finds several news {{articles}} in an album that imply Wilkes is actually a serial killer. Just then, the local sheriff (Joe) appears, and is surprised to find Paul there. Before he can help him, however, Stewie blows his legs off with a shotgun. The sheriff then complains that he will now {{have to spend the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> a wheelchair, only to be shot again and killed by Stewie. Paul finally finishes the book and demands Stewie let him go, but Stewie refuses, knowing he could try to turn him/her in to the police and tell them s/he kidnapped him, held him hostage, and fondled him in his sleep, which Paul did not know originally. Paul's ultimate fate is left ambiguous as the story ends with a Magnum, P.I.-style credits roll.|$|E

He later taught there at the same institute {{as a professor of}} theoretical physics between 1912 and 1914 before he left for Berlin. In 1901, after being stateless for more than five years, Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> 1905, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich. The same year, his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.|$|E

5|$|By 1604, when Charles {{was three}} and a half, {{he was able to}} walk the length of the great hall at Dunfermline Palace without assistance, and it was decided that he was strong enough to make the journey to England to be reunited with his family. In mid-July 1604, Charles left Dunfermline for England where he was to spend most of the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> England, Charles was placed under the charge of Elizabeth, Lady Carey, the wife of courtier Sir Robert Carey, who put him in boots made of Spanish leather and brass to help {{strengthen}} his weak ankles.

5|$|In 1920, Rabearivelo {{was hired}} as an {{assistant}} librarian at the Cercle de l'Union social club. That same year he drafted his first book, a short novel written in the Malagasy language. He began to correspond {{with a wide range}} of writers around the world, including André Gide, Paul Valéry, Jean Amrouche, Paul Claudel, and Valery Larbaud, and spent large sums to buy books and ship them to Madagascar. By these means he amassed a diverse collection that constituted the richest library on the island. In 1924 he took a job as a proofreader at the publishing house Imprimerie de l'Imerina, a position he would continue to occupy for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> 1921 he befriended high-level French colonial bureaucrats who shared his passion for French literature, including Robert Boudry, the colony's financial manager, and Pierre Camo, Madagascar's postal magistrate and founder of the literary magazine 18° Latitude Sud.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{returned}} to London in 1911, where, {{with the exception}} of frequent trips to France, he was to spend much of the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> 1913, he travelled to Jerusalem to research for his next novel, The Brook Kerith (1916). The book saw Moore once again embroiled in controversy, as it was based on the supposition that a non-divine Christ did not die on the cross but instead was nursed back to health. Other books from this period include a further collection of short-stories called A Storyteller's Holiday (1918), a collection of essays called Conversations in Ebury Street (1924) and a play, The Making of an Immortal (1927). Moore also spent considerable time revising and preparing his earlier writings for new editions.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than his}} stays in hospital, Hess spent the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> Spandau prison. His fellow inmates Konstantin von Neurath, Walther Funk and Erich Raeder were {{released}} {{because of poor}} health in the 1950s; Karl Dönitz, Baldur von Schirach and Albert Speer served their time and were released; Dönitz in 1956, Schirach and Speer in 1966. The 600-cell prison continued to be maintained for its lone prisoner from Speer and Schirach's release until Hess's death in 1987, at an estimated cost of DM 800,000. Conditions were far more pleasant in the 1980s than in the early years; Hess was allowed to move more freely around the cell block, setting his own routine and choosing his own activities, which included television, films, reading and gardening. A lift was installed so he could more readily access the garden, and he was provided with a medical orderly from 1982 onward.|$|E

5|$|Realistic {{religious}} painting, sometimes entire {{series of}} related works, served its didactic purpose. Nudity and mythological themes were banned, {{but other than}} that fancy collection of Western paintings were in vogue. Sigismund III brought from Venice Tommaso Dolabella. A prolific painter, he was to spend the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> Kraków and give rise to a school of Polish painters working under his influence. Danzig (Gdańsk) was also a center for graphic arts; painters Herman Han and Bartholomäus Strobel worked there, and so did Willem Hondius and Jeremias Falck, who were engravers. As compared with the previous century, even wider circles of the society participated in cultural activities, but Catholic Counter-Reformation pressure resulted in diminished diversity. Catastrophic wars {{in the middle of the}} century greatly weakened the Commonwealth's cultural development and influence in the region.|$|E
5|$|After resigning {{from the}} AHC, Darwaza spent the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> {{the modern state}} of Syria where he left {{politics}} to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, {{he did not have}} any of his works published until the 1960s. As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and Egypt forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After Egypt adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Camet {{traveled}} to Navarreux in France {{to visit his}} old family home, where his father had studied both academics and fencing. While the victory at Amsterdam was considered a milestone in Argentine athletics at the time, Camet, as a substitute was often forgotten as a contributor by his contemporaries in the fencing community such as Oscar Viñas and Eugenio Peni, despite being a legitimate and official medal winner. He was always given credit by his teammates, however, even if they emphasized his position as a substitute on the team. Camet's father died on July 15, 1931, {{a few years after}} Carmelo's success at the Olympics. Carmelo subsequently married Elsie Muir and, in 1981, returned to Navarreux for a second visit. He lived the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> Buenos Aires. At the time of his death, on July 22, 2007, at the age of 102, he was believed to be the world's oldest living Olympic athlete, although that distinction actually belonged to Erna Sondheim.|$|E
