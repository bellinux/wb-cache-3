40|$|Trans-oesophageal {{echocardiography}} {{is generally}} considered a safe procedure, but occasional life-threatening complications have been reported. The aim of this clinical investigation is to outline the need of surgical management in cases of large <b>retro-pharyngeal</b> haematoma following trans-oesophageal echocardiography. In the case reported here, a patient with cervical spondylosis on anti-coagulant therapy was referred to the Head and Neck Department because of a <b>retro-pharyngeal</b> haematoma with severe upper airway obstruction following transoesophageal echocardiography. Tracheotomy was required to guarantee respiratory function, while trans-cervical surgery was performed to evacuate the haematoma. Total recovery was achieved within 10 days. In conclusion, {{the head and neck}} surgeon should consider the need of surgical management in cases of <b>retro-pharyngeal</b> haematoma following trans-oesophageal echocardiography...|$|E

40|$|The {{coexistence}} of acquired hemophilia A with a secondary retropharyngeal hematoma is an ex-tremely unusual condition with important clinical implications. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present a case involving a patient whose first clinical manifestation, namely dysphagia, along with specific clinical examination and imaging findings, led to an incorrect initial diagnosis of a <b>retro-pharyngeal</b> abscess. However, performance of a more thorough clinical examination led to the correct diagnosis of a hematoma secondary to acquired hemophilia A. This allowed surgery to be avoided in a patient at a high risk of bleeding. Conclusions: Acute neck masses require meticulous differential diagnosis assessing the possible presence of various causative systemic diseases be-fore the most appropriate therapy can be determined...|$|E
40|$|A 50 {{year old}} male patient who {{consumed}} chicken bone soup, 4 days back, presented with dysphagia, high grade fever with chills, {{shortness of breath}} and swelling in face, neck and upper chest. Patient was toxic and in respiratory distress with room air oxygen saturation of 83 %, which increased to 92 % with 6 lit of oxygen through simple face mask. Indirect laryngoscopy revealed a retro pharyngeal abscess and CT chest revealed Sub-cutaneous and mediastinal emphysema. The abscess was immediately drained and followed with parenteral anti-microbials and high flow oxygen theapy. Patient improved and was discharged after 12 days. This case was reported as, foreign body causing <b>Retro-pharyngeal</b> abscess is a very rare entity in this anti-biotic era especially leading to a very rare complication of mediastinitis and Pneumomediastinum is unusual...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background. The {{purpose of}} this study was to de-termine the {{preoperative}} accuracy of preservation of the <b>retro-pharyngeal</b> fat plane on magnetic resonance (MR) images in predicting the absence of fixation or extension of head and neck carcinomas to the prevertebral space. Methods. TheMR images of 75 patients with T 3 or T 4 primary pharyngeal or laryngeal cancers seen over a 5 -year period and treated at our Head andNeckCancer Center were retrospectively reviewed. The MR images were independently and blindly evaluated by two head and neck radiologists for preservation of the retropharyngeal fat plane between the tumor and prevertebral musculature. In cases in which the fat was preserved, the pre-vertebral muscle complex was assessed for the presence of T 2 hyperintensity and enhancement. All patients underwent pan-endoscopy, surgery, or both...|$|E
40|$|A 10 -month-old boy {{presented}} with {{swelling of the}} neck several hours after his brother had put a small pencil in his mouth (fi gure 1). His mother retrieved the pencil {{from the back of}} his mouth and noticed a small bleeding wound on his palate. The swell-ing progressed and an x-ray showed subcutaneous emphysema of the neck (fi gure 2). Four days after presentation, the clinical situation deteriorated rapidly: respiratory failure developed and mechanical ventilation was required. A CT scan showed a pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema and a <b>retro-pharyngeal</b> abscess. The boy made a full recovery after repeated surgical drainage and administration of intravenous antibiotics. Subcutaneous emphysema after such an apparently benign trauma is an uncommon but serious complication. It can lead to respiratory failure due to local airway obstruction 1 2 or ret-ropharyngeal abscess or to pneumomediastinum, which is a serious but rare complication that can cause mediastinitis. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{method and}} system {{according}} to preferred embodiments {{of the present}} invention allows optimizing the dispensing of aerosol medicaments. In particular the system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention allows the administration of an exogenous pulmonary surfactant to very young patient (e. g. a preterm infant). A catheter 101 conveys atomized surfactant directly to the <b>retro-pharyngeal</b> region {{in order to increase}} efficiency of the medicament administration without being invasive: this is particularly important for very young patients, such as pre-term born infant suffering from Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome (IRDS). According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the catheter is made of biocompatible flexible material (e. g. plastic material). It is possible to couple the catheter with a rigid scaffolding (e. g. metallic) to increase stiffness of the device and to improve easiness of positioning operations. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the delivery of the atomized medicament is done by means of an air blasting technique...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} rare case of severe neck pain in a 45 -year-old man with severe hidradenitis suppurativa who was {{participating}} in a study involving adalimumab. The neck pain was associated with acute longus colli calcific tendinitis, which is a noninfectious inflammatory response in the longus colli tendons sec-ondary to deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite crystal. The diagnosis was made by computed tomogra-phy, which showed calcifications and deposits, and magnetic resonance imaging, which showed a <b>retro-pharyngeal</b> effusion. Ears, Nose, and Throat Services performed a fiberoptic scope examination, which revealed a patent airway and no drainable abscess. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs resulted in a dramatic improvement in the patient’s clinical symptoms. In acute longus colli tendinitis, differentiating retropharyngeal aseptic effusion from infection is important. Of note, the confounding factor {{in this case was}} that the patient was blinded to whether he was receiving the placebo or adalimumab, so whether the patient was immunosuppressed and at risk for infection was unknown. Clinician familiarity and education concerning acute calcific longus colli tendinitis may lead to decreased costs stemming from incorrect diagnosis and unnecessary treatment.

40|$|Objectives: Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE) is an {{important}} and sometimes lethal pathogen in humans, while it has been considered mainly as opportunistic in animals. Very limited cases of SDSE diseases have been described in dogs so far. Several zoonoses are caused by a close contact between humans and animals. Recently, a PCR protocol for distinction between SDSE of human (hSDSE) and equine origin has been optimised. The objective of this work was to evaluate if dogs may harbour human SDSE, with consequent potential impact on human health. Methods: Forty-seven beta-haemolytic streptococci isolated from different clinical specimens from dogs have been identified by PCR. The four strains identified as S. dysgalactiae have been tested by PCR for identifying the subspecies and for detecting a sequence of the streptokinase (skc) precursor gene of hSDSE. Results: Forty-one out of 47 streptococci strains {{have been identified as}} Streptococcus canis and four strains were S. dysgalactiae. One S. dysgalactiae strain resulted positive for the skc precursor gene specific of hSDSE, while the other three strains were negative. The dog had fever, was lacking appetite, had enlarged and painful <b>retro-pharyngeal</b> lymph nodes and significant increase of the tonsillar volume Conclusion: This is the first detection of a SDSE strain of human origin in dogs. Dogs infected by hSDSE might represent a potential risk for human health. This risk should be better investigated because of the close contact between pets and humans, including children. Species identification of beta-haemolytic streptococci isolated from dogs is usually not requested in veterinary clinical microbiology for economic reasons. If SDSE transmission between dogs and humans will be confirmed, a rapid identification of hSDSE in infected dogs could be useful for preventing the bacterial transmission to humans, with particular attention to children and immunocompromised people...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} cases of scrapie that would occur in sheep of different prion protein (PrP) genotypes if scrapie was to become established in New Zealand, and to compare the performance of two commercially available, rapid ELISA kits using ovine <b>retro-pharyngeal</b> lymph nodes (RLN) from non-infected and infected sheep of different PrP genotypes. METHODS: Using published data on the distribution of PrP genotypes within the New Zealand sheep flock and the prevalence of cases of scrapie in these genotypes in the United Kingdom, the annual expected number of cases of scrapie per genotype was estimated, should scrapie become established in New Zealand, assuming a total population of 28 million sheep. A non-infected panel of RLN was collected from 737 sheep from New Zealand that had been culled, found in extremis or died. Brain stem samples were also collected from 131 of these sheep. A second panel of infected samples comprised 218 and 117 RLN from confirmed scrapie cases that had originated in Europe and the United States of America, respectively. All samples were screened using two commercial, rapid, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy ELISA kits: Bio-Rad TeSeE ELISA (ELISA-BR), and IDEXX HerdChek BSE-Scrapie AG Test (ELISA-ID). RESULTS: If scrapie became established in New Zealand, an estimated 596 cases would occur per year; of these 234 (39 %) and 271 (46 %) would be in sheep carrying ARQ/ARQ and ARQ/VRQ PrP genotypes, respectively. For the non-infected samples from New Zealand the diagnostic specificity of both ELISA kits was 100 %. When considering all infected samples, the diagnostic sensitivity was 70. 4 (95 % CI= 65. 3 - 75. 3) % for ELISA-BR and 91. 6 (95 % CI= 88. 2 - 94. 4) % for ELISA-ID. For the ARQ/ARQ genotype (n= 195), sensitivity was 66. 2 % for ELISA-BR and 90. 8 % for ELISA-ID, and for the ARQ/VRQ genotype (n= 107), sensitivity was 81. 3 % for ELISA-BR and 98. 1 % for ELISA-ID. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the ELISA-ID kit demonstrated a higher diagnostic sensitivity for detecting scrapie in samples of RLN from sheep carrying scrapie-susceptible PrP genotypes than the ELISA-BR kit at comparable diagnostic specificity...|$|E
