The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found.

These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe.

Priests are available to hear confessions in different languages; two doctors are also admitted. Finally, a strictly limited number of servant staff are permitted for housekeeping and the preparing and serving of meals.|$|E

5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. For some of these groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be done for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is done for <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} “Reason of State” {{belongs to}} the language and the political culture of the late Renaissance period. Still today this expression is commonly used to mean recourse to force or, at any rate, to exceptional instruments {{on the part of}} a subject of political power who acts out of the need to keep personal command and to guarantee law and order within society. Beginning from the early 1980 s a wide number of studies questioned the conceptual associa-tion between Machiavelli and <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> state as well as Friedrich Meinecke’s interpretation of ratio status as machtpolitik. This new scholarship described <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> state as an art of government expressing a specific sensibility toward the state and aimed at defining the techniques for its management and preservation. By following this new line of study, the essay examines the relations between de-mocracy and <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> state in order to further an interpretation of contemporary democracies as “emergency democracies”. Demo-cratic <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> state will not be interpreted as the constitutional ex-ercise of exceptional powers in extreme necessity but as the re-course to emergency policies in recurrent and enduring crisis. The article also discusses the relations between <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> state, demo-cratic institutions and global governance in order to debate the role <b>of</b> democratic <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> state within the broader framework offered by security governance international programs...|$|R
