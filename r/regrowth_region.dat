40|$|Kibale National Park, {{within the}} Albertine Rift, {{is known for}} its rich biodiversity. High human {{population}} density and agricultural conversion in the surrounding landscape have created enormous resource pressure on forest fragments outside the park. Kibale presents a complex protected forest landscape comprising intact forest inside the park, logged areas inside the park, a game corridor with degraded forest, and forest fragments in the landscape surrounding the park. To explore the effect of these different levels of forest management and protection over time, we assessed forest change over the previous three decades, using both discrete and continuous data analyses of satellite imagery. Park boundaries have remained fairly intact and forest cover has been maintained or increased inside the park, while there has been a high level of deforestation in the landscape surrounding the park. While absolute changes in land cover are important changes in vegetation productivity, within land cover classes are often more telling of longer term changes and future directions of change. The park has lower Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values than the forest fragments outside the park and the formerly logged area—probably due to forest regeneration and early succession stage. The corridor region has lower productivity, which is surprising given this is also a newer <b>regrowth</b> <b>region</b> and so should be similar to the logged and forest fragments. Overall, concern can be raised for the future trajectory of this park. Although forest cover has been maintained, forest health may be an issue, which for future management, climate change, biodiversity, and increased human pressure may signify troubling signs...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports on}} the microcharacterization of devices for {{optoelectronic}} and for microelectronic applications using low temperature (T 5 and 77 K) spectrally resolved cathodoluminescence (SCL). The mechanisms leading to compositional inhomogeneities in the <b>regrowth</b> <b>regions</b> of InP-based butt-coupled laser-waveguide devices for semiconducting optical amplifiers (SOAs) and for defect generation in the active and cladding layers of GaAs based pump lasers for erbium-doped optical fibre amplifiers (EDFAs) were studied. Beryllium outdiffusion in the base regions of GaAs-based heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) after bias ageing was also studied. By comparing the CL results with TEM, SIMS and HRXRD studies and with the existing literature, the observed growth and operation induced defects were attributed, respectively, to the following mechanisms: recombination-enhanced defect glide (REDG) in the pump lasers, recombinationenhanced impurity diffusion (REID) in the HBTs and electrostatically induced growth flux instabilities in the butt-coupled laser-waveguide devices...|$|R

40|$|Human {{land use}} has {{modified}} {{the structure and}} function of terrestrial landscapes {{throughout much of the}} world, with cropping and livestock grazing the major drivers of landscape change. In many tropical, sub-tropical, temperate and Mediterranean <b>regions,</b> <b>regrowth</b> forests regenerate naturally on abandoned agricultural land if human disturbance declines. With the exception of some tropical forest literature, the broader ecological and conservation literature has largely ignored the potential of regrowth forests to facilitate passive landscape restoration and the recovery of fauna communities in fragmented agricultural landscapes. This paper addresses this deficiency by reviewing the available global evidence of fauna recovery in regrowth forest from 68 papers, identifying the main gaps in current knowledge, and providing directions for further research. The majority of reviewed studies focus on <b>regrowth</b> in tropical <b>regions,</b> which often contain large areas of mature forest. Species 2 ̆ 7 utilisation of regrowth forest is highly variable and is particularly influenced by land-use history, an important determinant of the structural and compositional characteristics of regrowth forests. While site-scale. (< 1 ha) forest structure and floristic diversity were frequently studied, only 11 studies considered the spatial configuration and context of habitat patches and just two studies explicitly considered landscape structure. Based on this review, six key research questions are posed to direct future research on this important issue. We conclude that a broader perspective of the role of regrowth forest in the landscape is required if we are to realise the potential benefits of regrowth forest for passive landscape restoration and fauna conservation and recovery...|$|R
40|$|Context. World-wide, {{primary forest}} is in decline. This places {{increasing}} importance on understanding the use by biodiversity of regrowth (secondary) forest, {{and on the}} management of such regrowth. Aims. This study aimed to compare the terrestrial vertebrate assemblages in tropical eucalypt forests, regrowth in these forests (following clearing for pastoral intensification) and cleared land without regrowth, to provide evidence for developing management guidelines for regrowth vegetation in a region (the Daly catchment of the Northern Territory) subject to increasing demands for land-use intensification. Methods. The terrestrial vertebrate fauna was surveyed consistently at 43 quadrats sampling forest, 38 sampling regrowth and 19 sampling cleared land (formerly forest), and the faunal composition was compared with ordination and analysis of variance. Further analysis used generalised linear modelling to include consideration of {{the relative importance of}} disturbance (condition) of quadrats. Key results. Faunal assemblages in regrowth vegetation were found to be intermediate between cleared land and intact forest, and converged towards the faunal assemblage typical of intact forest with increase in the canopy height of the regrowth. However, even the tallest regrowth quadrats that were sampled supported relatively few hollow-associated species. The management of fire, weeds and grazing pressure substantially affected the faunal assemblages of the set of regrowth and intact forest quadrats, in many cases being a more important determinant of faunal attributes than was whether or not the quadrat had been cleared. Conclusions. In this <b>region,</b> <b>regrowth</b> vegetation has value as habitat for fauna, with this value increasing as the regrowth structure increases. The convergence of the faunal composition of regrowth vegetation to that of intact forest may be substantially affected by post-clearing management factors (including fire regime and level of grazing pressure and weed infestation). Implications. Regrowth vegetation should be afforded appropriate regulatory protection, with the level of protection increasing as the regrowth increases in stature...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a dynamic land model (LM 3 V) able to simulate ecosystem dynamics and exchanges of water, energy, and CO 2 between land and atmosphere. LM 3 V is specifically designed to address the consequences of land use and land management changes including cropland and pasture dynamics, shifting cultivation, logging, fire, and resulting patterns of secondary regrowth. Here we analyze the behavior of LM 3 V, forced with the output from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) atmospheric model AM 2, observed precipitation data, and four historic scenarios of land use change for 1700 - 2000. Our analysis suggests a net terrestrial carbon source due to land use activities from 1. 1 to 1. 3 GtC/a during the 1990 s, where the range {{is due to the}} difference in the historic cropland distribution. This magnitude is substantially smaller than previous estimates from other models, largely due to our estimates of a secondary vegetation sink of 0. 35 to 0. 6 GtC/a in the 1990 s and decelerating agricultural land clearing since the 1960 s. For the 1990 s, our estimates for the pastures' carbon flux vary from a source of 0. 37 to a sink of 0. 15 GtC/a, and for the croplands our model shows a carbon source of 0. 6 to 0. 9 GtC/a. Our process-based model suggests a smaller net deforestation source than earlier bookkeeping models because it accounts for decelerated net conversion of primary forest to agriculture and for stronger secondary vegetation <b>regrowth</b> in tropical <b>regions.</b> The overall uncertainty is likely to be higher than the range reported here because of uncertainty in the biomass recovery under changing ambient conditions, including atmospheric CO 2 concentration, nutrients availability, and climate.
