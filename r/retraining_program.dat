Industrial countries spend sizable amounts on labor programs for {{the unemployed}}. In 1992 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) spent between 0. 1 percent (Japan) and 2. 6 percent (Sweden) of gross domestic product on labor programs. In several countries this training is “the largest category of active programs, and is often perceived as the principal alternative to regular unemployment benefits ” (OECD 1994 a). Countries in Eastern Europe—where the role of active labor programs is a topic of current debate—also spent between 0. 2 and 3 {{percent of gross domestic product}} on these programs (OECD 1994 a). Yet possibly because such assistance is viewed almost as a fundamental right in Western Europe, these programs are rarely evaluated outside the United States. This article surveys evaluations of <b>retraining</b> <b>programs</b> in the OECD countries, highlighting the shortcomings of such schemes and illustrating the payoff to investing in rigorous evaluations.

40|$|Background: Current {{approaches}} to the management of chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNSLBP) have shown limited effectiveness. It appears that disruption of cortical structure and function is a feature of CNSLBP and that these changes may contribute to current treatment failures. Sensorimotor retraining approaches {{have been shown to}} be effective in the management of other long-standing pain problems that are characterized by cortical dysfunction. Similar treatments may be an option for people with CNSLBP. Objective: The objectives of this study were to describe the effects of participation in a graded sensorimotor <b>retraining</b> <b>program</b> on pain intensity, interference of pain with daily life (pain interference), and self-reported disability and to evaluate the safety of the program. Design: A multiple-baseline, replicated, single-case design was used for this study. Methods: Three people with disabling CNSLBP were assessed weekly during a no-treatment baseline period. Each person then participated in a graded sensorimotor <b>retraining</b> <b>program</b> for a minimum of 10 weeks, during which clinical status was assessed weekly. Data collection continued weekly for 1 month after the end of formal treatment. Results: Pain intensity, pain interference, and disability all were reduced, and the improvements were maintained throughout the follow-up period. No adverse reactions to treatment were reported. Limitations: The findings are preliminary and were based on a single-case design. The observed improvements in clinical status may have been attributable to the effects of factors other than treatment, such as the effect of time and other, nonspecific effects. Conclusions: Positive outcomes were reported for 3 participants with CNSLBP after the completion of a graded sensorimotor <b>retraining</b> <b>program.</b> However, the findings are only preliminary and require replication with more-robust study designs...|$|E

40|$|The knee {{adduction}} moment {{represents the}} medial knee joint load, and greater value {{is associated with}} higher load. In people with knee osteoarthritis, {{it is important to}} apply proper treatment with the least side effects to reduce knee adduction moment and, consequently, reduce medial knee joint load. This reduction may slow the progression of knee osteoarthritis. The research team performed a literature search of electronic databases. The search keywords were as follows: knee osteoarthritis, knee adduction moment, exercise program, exercise therapy, gait retraining, gait modification and knee joint loading. In total, 12 studies were selected, according to the selection criteria. Findings from previous studies illustrated that exercise and gait <b>retraining</b> <b>programs</b> could alter knee adduction moment in people with knee osteoarthritis. These treatments are noninvasive and nonpharmacological which so far have no or few side effects, as well as being low cost.

Scarce literature shows conflicting results regarding {{the accuracy of}} measurements in children. The BladderScan® BVI 6200 has been developed to overcome some of the inaccuracies. We tested this device to see whether it can replace conventional ultrasound in a bladder <b>retraining</b> <b>program.</b> Patients and methods: 84 children (mean age 7. 8 years) were included. Measurements with the BVI 6200 were compared to measurements with a graduated cylinder or with conventional ultrasound before and after micturition. All volumes were expressed in milliliters. The measured volumes were compared {{to each other in}} a Bland-Altman analysis. Results: Mean (bias) of the different measurements fell within 10 % difference of measurements. The spread of the different measurements around the mean was however very large, with a broad spread of over- and under-estimations of different measured volumes. Conclusion: The BVI 6200 is not reliable enough to replace conventional ultrasound for measurements of bladder volumes.

40|$|While many {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) prevention programs have been published, few have achieved significant reductions in injury rates and improvements in athletic performance indices; both of which may increase compliance and motivation of athletes to participate. A supervised neuromuscular <b>retraining</b> <b>program</b> (18 sessions) was developed, aimed at achieving both of these objectives. The changes in neuromuscular indices were measured after training in 1000 female athletes aged 13 – 18 years, and the noncontact ACL injury rate in 700 of these trained athletes was {{compared with that of}} 1120 control athletes. There were significant improvements in the drop-jump test, (p < 0. 0001, effect size [ES] 0. 97), the single-leg triple crossover hop (p < 0. 0001, ES 0. 47), the t-test (p < 0. 0001, ES 0. 64), the multi-stage fitness test (p < 0. 0001, ES 0. 57), hamstring strength (p < 0. 0001), and quadriceps strength (p < 0. 01). The trained athletes had a significant reduction in the noncontact ACL injury incidence rate compared with the controls (1 ACL injury in 36, 724 athlete-exposures [0. 03] and 13 ACL injuries in 61, 244 exposures [0. 21], respectively, p = 0. 03).

40|$|QuestionDo {{people with}} {{recently}} acquired paraplegia {{benefit from a}} six-week motor <b>retraining</b> <b>program</b> aimed at improving their ability to sit unsupported?DesignA randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding, and intention-totreat analysis. Participants 32 people with recently acquired paraplegia and limited ability to sit unsupported. InterventionAll participants undertook standard inpatient rehabilitation over a six-week period. Experimental participants received three additional 30 -minute sessions per week of motor retraining directed at improving their ability to sit unsupported. Outcome measuresThe three primary outcomes were the Maximal Lean Test, Maximal Sideward Reach Test, and the Performance Item of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). The secondary outcomes were the Satisfaction Item of the COPM, Participants’ Impressions of Change, Clinicians’ Impressions of Change, the T-shirt Test, and the Spinal Cord Injury Falls Concern Scale. ResultsThe mean between-group differences for the Maximal Lean Test, Maximal Sideward Reach Test and the Performance Item of the COPM were – 20 mm (95 % CI – 64 to 24), 5 % arm length (95 % CI – 3 to 13) and 0. 5 points (95 % CI – 0. 5 to 1. 5), respectively. The secondary outcomes {{did not differ significantly}} between groups. ConclusionPeople with recently acquired paraplegia do not benefit from a six-week motor <b>retraining</b> <b>program</b> directed specifically at improving their ability to sit unsupported. Their ability to sit unsupported does, however, improve over time, suggesting that the practice of activities of daily living has important carry-over effects on unsupported sitting, rendering additional training redundant.
