2500|$|The three {{variations}} of this dog, the Brussels Griffon (Griffon Bruxellois), the Belgian Griffon (Griffon Belge), and the Petit Brabançon, all descend {{from an old}} type of dog called a Smousje, a <b>rough</b> <b>coated,</b> small terrier-like dog kept in stables to eliminate rodents, similar to the Dutch Smoushond. [...] The little wire-haired dog in the foreground of the Jan van Eyck painting The Arnolfini Marriage {{is thought to be}} an early form of this breed. [...] In Belgium coachmen were fond of their alert little Griffons d’Ecurie (wiry coated stable dogs) and in the 19th century, they bred their Griffons with imported toy dogs. Breeding with the Pug and King Charles Spaniel brought about the current breed type, but also brought the short black coat that led to the Petits Brabançon, which was originally a fault in the breed. The spaniels also brought the rich red and black and tan colour of the modern Griffon Bruxellois and Griffon Belge.|$|E

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{different}} façade systems with lime binder. The lime façade consists of <b>rough</b> <b>coating,</b> fine coating and protective lime wash. For {{the elaboration of}} mortar for <b>rough</b> <b>coating</b> limes of six different Slovenian producers were chosen, mainly those produced in the traditional way. Mortar for <b>rough</b> <b>coating</b> was evaluated regarding its consistency (in fresh) and compressive stress - strain relationship and absorption of water (in hardened state). Fine mortar, as the second coating of the façade system, was chosen based on practical testing, with bigger or smaller deviations from different recipes of old masters. Fine mortar surface was smooth or rough. As the third layer different lime washes with different additives (casein or varnish) and pigments were applied using different techniques (fresco or secco). I assessed {{the influence of the}} base (fine mortar) surface structure, the technique of application and the additives on the complexity of applying washes, on the appearance of dried lime washes, intensity of colour nuances, the strength of binding of the washes as well as the absorption of water of the façade system...|$|R

5000|$|The Trigg Hound {{originated}} in Barren County, Kentucky, in the 1860s, when fox hunting enthusiast Colonel Haiden C. Trigg wanted {{to develop a}} faster hound than those available in his area. He used dogs from the Birdsong, Maupin, and Walker lines to develop his strain.According to W. L. Porter {{in an article in}} The Chase, local fox hunters who saw the dogs purchased from Birdsong found them unattractive, but their performance was surprisingly good. Porter stated that the dogs were [...] "racy built, crop ears, <b>rough</b> <b>coated,</b> bushy tails and chop mouthed and looked unlike any fox hound any of us had ever seen". Eventually, Trigg's breeding program became successful on a local and national level.|$|E
5000|$|The Welsh Hound is {{a native}} breed to the British Isles, and could {{possibly}} be the Segussi breed of <b>rough</b> <b>coated</b> hound which existed in northern Europe in Roman times.

[...] "The ancient laws of Wales codified during the reign of Hywel Dda (942 - 948 AD) give the value of the Welsh Hound as 240 pence trained, 120 pence untrained.

5000|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Australian Silky Terrier include the Yorkshire Terrier and the Australian Terrier (which descends from the <b>rough</b> <b>coated</b> type terriers brought from Great Britain to Australia in the early 19th century); few records indicate whether early dogs were just Australian Terriers born with silky fur, or whether there {{was an attempt to}} create a separate breed. According to the American Kennel Club, the breed began {{at the end of the}} 19th century when [...] were crossed with the Australian Terriers. At first the breed was known as the Sydney Silky, as it was found primarily in the city of Sydney, Australia. Although most other Australian breeds were working dogs, the Silky Terrier was bred primarily to be an urban pet and companion, although it is also known for killing snakes in Australia.|$|E
