50|$|Most spurs are {{activated}} by the rider flexing the heel slightly up and in. A roweled spur permits an additional type of action; a <b>rider</b> can <b>roll</b> the spur lightly {{against the side}} of the horse rather than being limited to simply pressing inward.|$|R
50|$|A Fingerflip can be {{considered}} an umbrella term {{for a series of}} tricks involving the use of a flick of the fingers to flip the skateboard. The <b>rider</b> <b>rolls</b> forward, grabs the nose of the board with the front hand and flips the board while simultaneously jumping up in the air. The rider will come down on the board or catch the board in mid-air. Many variations have been done including the Double Fingerflip, Varial Fingerflip, Backhand Fingerflips, and 360 Fingerflips. There are fakie versions of all the Fingerflips. Ollie Fingerflip variations are typically considered to be harder than regular fingerflip variations because the rider must Ollie first before initiating the Fingerflip. Professional freestyler Darryl Grogan is known for his Ollie 360 Fingerflip, and Rodney Mullen is known to use an Ollie Varial Fingerflip in many of his runs and video footage.|$|R
500|$|The riders {{started the}} sixth stage in Turin with {{large amount of}} people in {{attendance}} for the sendoff. Giuseppe Santhià took the stage as the <b>riders</b> <b>rolled</b> over the packed finish line in Milan. Dario Beni soloed to victory in the seventh leg, finishing over a minute ahead of the second-place finisher Santhià. The next stage was won by Lauro Bordin as Galetti extended his overall lead by a single point over Rossignoli. Ezio Corlaita won the Giro's ninth stage, while Lucien Petit-Breton took the race lead and doing so, became the first non-Italian to lead the Giro d'Italia. In the following stage, the leading breakaway contained six riders [...] race leader Petit-Breton and five Bianchi riders [...] and rode into the finish in Bari together. Carlo Galetti took the stage win and the race lead, while Petit-Breton finished in sixth place on the day and was pushed down to second overall.|$|R
5000|$|When a <b>rider</b> <b>rolls</b> backwards, this {{is called}} [...] "riding fakie". A [...] "fakie" [...] trick is {{performed}} while riding backwards but taking off on the front foot. Although {{it is the same}} foot that jumps in one's traditional stance, it is normally the back foot. A rider can also land in the fakie position. While there are some parallels between switch stance and fakie, riding switch implies opening the shoulders more to face the direction headed, though not as much as in traditional stance, while fakie stance implies a slightly more backwards facing, closed shoulder posture. Nollie (nose ollie) is when the front foot takes off when one is riding in their normal stance, the same foot that jumps when doing tricks switch. In Nollie position, the body and shoulders are facing forward as much as when riding in normal stance. Generally switch and nollie are done off the nose, whereas normal and fakie are done off the tail.|$|R
5000|$|Riders then queue at loading gates. The {{trains are}} {{unchanged}} from before, but {{they no longer}} glow in the dark. Pulling out of the loading station and approaching the control tower while receiving the safety spiel (unchanged from before), the trains make a 180-degree turn and {{come to a stop}} at a holding brake, and wait for the train in front to clear the block on the lift hill. After a few seconds, the holding brake is released and the trains roll down a drop into the strobe tunnel. The strobe lights flash at a slower rate, but the frequency rate gradually increases as the train progresses down the tunnel. A repetitive warping sound signifies an energy charge as the <b>riders</b> <b>roll</b> towards a blue [...] (which replaced a mirror). At {{the far end of the}} tunnel, a field of stars appears as the blue strobe lights turn off. As the train starts its 180 degree turn to the lift hill, the white flash of a strobe light is seen. This is actually the flash of a new on-ride photo camera.|$|R
2500|$|Stage 1 on Saturday 20 October 1934 was a fresh {{take on the}} {{traditional}} Warrnambool route of [...] being run in reverse direction from Melbourne to Warrnambool {{for only the second}} time. 107 riders started the race and all of them made it through to Warrnambool. Mithouard and Chocque both punctured, the later twice and Chocque was then involved in a collision before coming into Camperdown wrecking his bicycle which was replaced. Borsari had a slipping chain near Little River [...] but recovered to rejoin the A grade bunch, however Opperman’s account of the stage was that the A grade <b>riders</b> <b>rolled</b> into Colac as a compact bunch, however they were sent away in straggling sections and without Borsari. Borsari again recovered and despite cramp in the legs he and Mithouard led into the Showgrounds at Warrnambool. Opperman states that publicity had been given to the finish of three laps on the track at Warrnambool only to find that the finish was half a lap after the entrance. The previous fastest time for this direction was 12h 53' 0" [...] set by Jim Carpenter in 1895.

60|$|But {{what does}} a doctor avail in a contest with the grim invincible enemy? Such as came could only confirm our despair by their account of the poor child's case. He had mounted his horse gallantly, sat him bravely all the time the animal plunged and kicked, and, having {{overcome}} his first spite, ran him at a hedge by the roadside. But there were loose stones at the top, and the horse's foot caught among them, {{and he and his}} brave little <b>rider</b> <b>rolled</b> over together at the other side. The people said they saw the noble little boy spring up after his fall and run to catch the horse; which had broken away from him, kicking him on the back, as it would seem, as they lay on the ground. Poor Bryan ran a few yards and then dropped down as if shot. A pallor came over his face, and they thought he was dead. But they poured whisky down his mouth, and the poor child revived: still he could not move; his spine was injured; the lower half of him was dead when they laid him in bed at home. The rest did not last long, God help me! He remained yet for two days with us; and a sad comfort it was to think he was in no pain.|$|R
60|$|We {{had little}} time, however, {{to gaze at}} this strange scene, for upon our {{appearance}} the hounds abandoned their helpless attempts to reach Saxon, and flew, with a fierce snarl of satisfaction, at Reuben and myself. One great brute, with flaring eyes and yawning mouth, his white fangs glistening in the moonlight, sprang at my horse's neck; but I met him fair with a single sweeping cut, which shore away his muzzle, and left him wallowing and writhing {{in a pool of}} blood. Reuben, meanwhile, had spurred his horse forward to meet his assailant; but the poor tired steed flinched {{at the sight of the}} fierce hound, and pulled up suddenly, with the result that her <b>rider</b> <b>rolled</b> headlong into the very jaws of the animal. It might have gone ill with Reuben had he been left to his own resources. At the most he could only have kept the cruel teeth from his throat for a very few moments; but seeing the mischance, I drew my remaining pistol, and springing from my horse, discharged it full into the creature's flank while it struggled with my friend. With a last yell of rage and pain it brought its fierce jaws together in one wild impotent snap, and then sank slowly over upon its side, while Reuben crawled from beneath it, scared and bruised, but none the worse otherwise for his perilous adventure.|$|R
60|$|The spring {{took him}} {{close to the}} horse of the latter, and before the amazed soldier could again strike, Rupert had vaulted on to the horse, behind him. Then using his immense {{strength}}--a strength brought to perfection by his exercise at Loches, and his work in lifting sacks as a miller's man--he seized with both hands the French soldier by the belt, lifted him from the seat, and threw him backwards over his head, the man {{flying through the air}} some yards before he fell on the ground with a heavy crash. Driving his heels into the horse, he rode him straight at the French general, as the latter--who had dashed forward as Rupert unseated the trooper--came at him. Rupert received a severe cut on the left shoulder, but the impetus of the heavier horse and <b>rider</b> <b>rolled</b> the French officer and his horse on to the ground. Rupert shifted his seat into the saddle, leapt the fallen horse, and stooping down seized the officer by his waist belt, lifted him from the ground {{as if he had been}} a child, threw him across the horse in front of him, and galloped forward towards the allied lines, amid a perfect roar of cheering, just as a British cavalry regiment rode out from between the infantry to check a body of French dragoons who were galloping up at full speed from their side.|$|R
6000|$|The sudden shock <b>rolled</b> <b>rider</b> {{and horse}} over. He heard Hal Carter shout, [...] "Look out, Sir Edgar!"

Three of his companions were already down, and {{although}} many more of the French had fallen, the position was well-nigh desperate.|$|R

40|$|Bicycle and {{motorcycle}} dynamics is a {{very complex}} issue, but nowadays with the modern computational tools we are able to implement and understand the equation of motion of the two wheeled vehicles. Usually the bodies that compose the vehicle, including the rider, whose mass is a relevant share of the total mass in two wheeled vehicles are modeled as rigid. Both vehicles part flexibility and rider mobility have a considerable influence on the dynamic of bicycle and motorcycle and in order to obtain reliable results it is necessary to take into account of them in the dynamic simulation. The passive response of the rider’s body to vibrations influences the dynamics and stability of the whole system, hence advanced models of two-wheeled vehicles have to include a passive biomechanical model of the rider. While it is known that the presence of the rider could strongly influence the mode of vibrations and hence the safety of a motorcycle, very few studies was carried out to improve the knowledge on rider biomechanical properties and motorcycle rider interaction. This work deals with the development of biomechanical models able to simulate the response of the <b>rider</b> to <b>roll,</b> yaw and steer oscillations. The second chapter is an overview on the experimental equipment designed for these kind of tests and a description of the test method. The chapters three and four deals with the development of biomechanical <b>rider</b> models for <b>roll</b> and yaw movement: the responses of the districts of the human body are measured by means of rate gyros and the frequency response functions (FRFs) between the measured angular velocity and the enforced angular velocity are calculated. Then biomechanical parameters are identified by means of best fitting techniques. Chapter five deals with an improved identification technique: the calculation of the impedance of the whole <b>rider</b> to <b>roll</b> excitation; in this case the measurements of the reacting forces and torques are carried out, and the frequency response functions (FRFs) between the measured reaction forces and the enforced angular velocity are calculated. In order to validate the theoretical rider models also some experimental road test were carried out: the methodology and the results are described in chapter six. In chapter seven all the biomechanical rider models are implemented in a simple two wheeled vehicle, in order to well understand the differences between the models and them influence on the dynamic. Chapter eight deals with the development of a special test bench for the measurement of motorcycle parts stiffness: the first part is a description of the design of the bench, while in the second part is presented the methodology to identify the stiffness of the main motorcycle parts. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{experimental}} responses of five <b>riders</b> to <b>roll</b> and steer oscillations. The analysis {{is carried out}} to identify the properties of a rider multi-body model, which can be useful for simulation. The riders have different physiques and riding experience and are excited {{by means of the}} motorcycle riding simulator developed at DIM. A stepped sine testing is performed. The results of the steer tests are presented in terms of FRFs between the angular acceleration of the steer and the steering torque. A multibody model is used to fit the experimental data. The results of the roll tests are presented in terms of FRFs between the accelerations measured at three point of the body of the rider (head, shoulders, torso) and the acceleration of a point placed at a fixed distance from the oscillation axis. To clarify the dynamic response of the rider, a relative motion FRF is calculated as well: it is the ratio between the relative tangential acceleration and the acceleration at the same point caused only by the roll angular acceleration...|$|R
500|$|In {{previous}} years, {{the organizers}} {{had made the}} race easier for the Italian favorites by including fewer hard climbs. With the absence of Italian Francesco Moser from this edition, the race organizers included many famous and difficult climbs, such as the Gavia Pass. Moser himself stated that the route contained many difficult climbs and was not helping Italian cycling to prosper {{at a time when}} he believed it to be ailing. When asked about the route for the 1988 edition, [...] <b>rider</b> Bob <b>Roll</b> said [...] "Those sons of bitches put every mountain they could find in the race that year." [...] Three-time winner Gino Bartali also believed the route to be very difficult and in favor of non-Italian competitors. Gino Sala also felt the route was harsher than in years past and that the team time trial could influence the overall classification greatly. La Stampa writer Gian Paolo Ormezzano praised the route saying it was beautiful and well crafted but contained one flaw, in that the race did not finish in any major Italian city. He also expressed his delight with the uphill time trial to Valico del Vetriolo as well as the inclusion of the Stelvio, Rombo and Gavia mountain passes.|$|R
5000|$|Riders {{exit the}} station and climb a 90 ft hill. Unique to Great Bear, there is a helix {{immediately}} after the lift, swinging riders around into the 124 ft drop into The Hollow. After the drop, the train enters a loop, followed immediately by an Immelmann loop, and then going into a zero-g <b>roll.</b> <b>Riders</b> continue through The Hollow over midway areas, making a sharp turn over Spring Creek. After a short straightaway, the train goes into a corkscrew, and then up a hill with two wide turns. For the 2014 season, the on-ride camera's location was changed to just after the corkscrew inversion, on the same pole that houses the on-ride camera for SooperDooperLooper. The train then enters a short brake run; after the brake-run, riders return to the station. Great Bear was the first inverted looping coaster in Pennsylvania.|$|R

60|$|The Scottish men did {{not forget}} this, next day when the battle raged. RANDOLPH, Bruce's valiant Nephew, rode, with the small body of men he commanded, into such a host of the English, all shining in {{polished}} armour in the sunlight, that {{they seemed to be}} swallowed up and lost, as if they had plunged into the sea. But, they fought so well, and did such dreadful execution, that the English staggered. Then came Bruce himself upon them, {{with all the rest of}} his army. While they were thus hard pressed and amazed, there appeared upon the hills what they supposed to be a new Scottish army, but what were really only the camp followers, in number fifteen thousand: whom Bruce had taught to show themselves at that place and time. The Earl of Gloucester, commanding the English horse, made a last rush to change the fortune of the day; but Bruce (like Jack the Giant-killer in the story) had had pits dug in the ground, and covered over with turfs and stakes. Into these, as they gave way beneath the weight of the horses, <b>riders</b> and horses <b>rolled</b> by hundreds.
