Objects brought together into coarse alignment, shaft turned, causing upper object, mounting bracket, and fixed nut to travel downward on left-handed thread and traveling nut upward on <b>right-handed</b> <b>thread.</b> This allows J-hook to turn under spring load and reach under receptacle...|$|E
5000|$|By common convention, right-{{handedness}} is {{the default}} handedness for screw threads. [...] Therefore, most threaded parts and fasteners have <b>right-handed</b> <b>threads.</b> One {{explanation for why}} <b>right-handed</b> <b>threads</b> became standard is that for a right-handed person, tightening a right-handed screw with a screwdriver is easier than tightening a left-handed screw, because it uses the stronger supinator muscle of the arm rather than the weaker pronator muscle. [...] Since most people are <b>right-handed,</b> <b>right-handed</b> <b>threads</b> became standard on threaded fasteners. Left-handed screw threads are used in some machines and in these applications: ...|$|R

50|$|The best-known {{design of}} {{expansion}} valve was the Meyer, {{the invention of}} French engineer Jean-Jacques Meyer (1804-1877) who applied for a patent on 20 October 1841. A similar valve was patented by James Morris. A second slide valve rides {{on the back of}} an adapted main slide valve and is driven by an additional eccentric. In the Meyer valve, the effective length of the expansion valve can be altered with a handwheel whilst the engine is running. The valve has two heads mounted on left- and <b>right-handed</b> <b>threads</b> on the handwheel's valve rod, so that rotating the wheel moves the heads either together or apart. In this arrangement the cut-off is normally controlled manually. Although automatic control was attempted, it was too slow-acting to be effective.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes the {{opposite}} (left-handed, counterclockwise, reverse) sense of threading {{is used for}} a special reason. A thread might need to be left-handed to prevent operational stresses from loosening it. For example, some older cars and trucks had right-handed lug nuts on the right wheels and left-handed ones on the left wheels, so that, as the vehicle moved forward, the lug nuts tended to tighten rather than loosen. For bicycle pedals, {{the one on the}} left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use. Similarly, the flyer whorl of a spinning wheel uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening. A turnbuckle has <b>right-handed</b> <b>threads</b> on one end and left-handed threads on the other. Some gas fittings are left-handed to prevent disastrous misconnections: oxygen fittings are right-handed, but acetylene, propane, and other flammable gases are unmistakably distinguished by left-handed fittings.|$|R

2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal <b>right-handed</b> <b>threads</b> for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|R
50|$|The helix of {{a thread}} can twist in two {{possible}} directions, {{which is known}} as handedness. Most threads are oriented so that the threaded item, when seen from {{a point of view}} on the axis {{through the center of the}} helix, moves away from the viewer when it is turned in a clockwise direction, and moves towards the viewer when it is turned counterclockwise. This is known as a <b>right-handed</b> (RH) <b>thread,</b> because it follows the right hand grip rule. Threads oriented in the opposite direction are known as left-handed (LH).|$|R
50|$|The helix of a screw's thread can {{twist in}} two {{possible}} directions, {{which is known}} as handedness. Most screw threads are oriented so that when seen from above, the screw shaft {{moves away from the}} viewer (the screw is tightened) when turned in a clockwise direction. This is known as a <b>right-handed</b> (RH) <b>thread,</b> because it follows the right hand grip rule: when the fingers of the right hand are curled around the shaft in the direction of rotation, the thumb will point in the direction of motion of the shaft. Threads oriented in the opposite direction are known as left-handed (LH).|$|R
40|$|For {{my senior}} design project, I {{designed}} and built a device that will dilate the human esophagus for patients suffering {{from a variety of}} medical conditions. One current technique, Mercury bougienage, uses a tapered rubber rod filled with Mercury. The Mercury falls because of gravity, inducing an outward pressure on the esophagus. Two main problems with this procedure are the large longitudinal forces involved and the dependence upon the "feel" of the physician in applying the force. As a result, there is 'an uncertain risk of tissue perforation under this treatment. Other procedures have met with limited success and are difficult to apply to narrow or tortuous strictures. My design, developed with Carr Everbach, involves the use of a three-dimensional braid that expands radially when compressed and becomes narrow when stretched. Using a screw with left and <b>right-handed</b> <b>threads,</b> two sleeves were constructed so that they could slide up and down the screw. The sleeves are attached to each end of the braid. To test the device, an apparatus was built that applies an internal pressure to a latex tube, causing it to expand. The expansion was measured with a column of water and the pressure was recorded with a pressure transducer. Preliminary mechanical tests indicate that the device will exert forces necessary for esophageal dilation. Testing of the braid shows that the radial force varies linearly with the diameter of the braid. If the radial force is monitored by a control system, the device should allow for greater sensitivity of forces applied, resulting in more effective dilation...|$|R
5000|$|Optical {{activity}} occurs due to molecules {{dissolved in}} a fluid or {{due to the}} fluid itself only if the molecules are one of two (or more) stereoisomers; {{this is known as}} an enantiomer. The structure of such a molecule is such that it is not identical to its mirror image (which would be that of a different stereoisomer, or the [...] "opposite enantiomer"). In mathematics, this property is also known as chirality. For instance, a metal rod is not chiral, since its appearance in a mirror is not distinct from itself. However a screw or light bulb base (or any sort of helix) is chiral; an ordinary <b>right-handed</b> screw <b>thread,</b> viewed in a mirror, would appear as a left-handed screw (very uncommon) which could not possibly screw into an ordinary (right-handed) nut. A human viewed in a mirror would have their heart on the right side, clear evidence of chirality, whereas the mirror reflection of a doll might well be indistinguishable from the doll itself.|$|R
