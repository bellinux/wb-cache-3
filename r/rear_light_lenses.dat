50|$|The {{cumulative}} visual {{changes from}} the first models included a revised front grille and headlights, redesigned front and rear bumpers, oval instead of round side repeater indicators, major changes to the interior and dashboard, redesigned <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> <b>lenses,</b> and a radio aerial repositioned {{from the top of}} the right-hand A-pillar to the middle of the roof, towards the rear.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, the six-cylinder LJ Torana was {{replaced}} by the new mid-sized body six- and eight-cylinder LH Torana series. To fill in time before the March 1975 release of the four-cylinder GM world T-car Holden Gemini, the short-wheelbase four-cylinder (1.3- and 1.8-litre) LJ models were given a basic facelift incorporating a body-colour plastic-moulded front grille assembly and revamped <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> <b>lenses.</b> This car was released in February 1974 on the Australian market only, in both two- and four-door forms, as the TA Torana. It was only produced for 11 months with a total production run of 11,304 units.|$|E

5|$|For the 2013 {{model year}} revision, Aston made minor {{changes to the}} {{bodywork}} by adapting designs from the Virage, including enlarging the recessed headlight clusters with bi-xenon lights and LED daytime strips, widening the front splitter, updating the grille and side heat extractors, updating the LED <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> with clear <b>lenses</b> and integrating a new rear spoiler with the boot lid.|$|R
5000|$|On 2 May 1996, German design patents {{were filed}} for updates {{made to the}} W202 C-Class. Later on in June 1997, the C-Class was given a small midlife freshening, with new darker <b>rear</b> tail <b>light</b> <b>lenses,</b> new wheel rims as well as subtle {{interior}} trim changes, including on the door mouldings. The exterior radio antenna was no longer fender mounted and was integrated into the rear glass. The front and rear bumpers were also reshaped, colour-coded side skirts were also fitted. The revised C 200 and C 230 models were fitted with a supercharger and denoted on the trunk lid as a [...] "Kompressor".|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the Evolution VII also {{marked the first time}} an automatic drivetrain was included within the model lineupâ€”the GT-A. Seen as the 'gentleman's express' version of the visually similar VII GSR and the RS2, the GT-A model was only produced in 2002 and had the following distinguishing interior and exterior specification: GT-A-only diamond cut finish 17 in alloy wheels, clear <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> <b>lenses</b> and all-in-one style front headlights (later used on the Evolution VIII). The GT-A had the option of either no spoiler, the short spoiler (as per the Lancer Cedia; and later used on the Evolution VIII 260) or the thunderspoiler as used on the standard Evolution VII models. The most distinguishing feature was a smooth bonnet with no air-grills on it at all and the revised front bumper. Although offering inferior cooling capabilities, the bonnet was designed to give a cleaner line through the air with less air resistance at motorway speeds.|$|E
5000|$|... 2014: Central LCD {{screen with}} gear position, fuel consumption, {{thermometer}} and heater {{level for the}} handle grips (available with the [...] "E Package"), 10-spoke wheels, round mirrors and dual grab rails on a revised rear cowl with LED <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> and clear <b>lens.</b> Revised frame geometry brought the handlebars 10 mm higher and 7 mm closer to the rider, and also reduced the rise angle of the tail end, both changes resulting in a more upright riding position. Revised half-fairing with LED headlight for the Super Bol d'Or. Weight increased by 3 kg.|$|R
50|$|Logos, scripts, turn signals, <b>light</b> <b>lens</b> colors, door handles, trunk locks, window vents {{and window}} trim are all {{accurately}} painted or have realistic tampos. For example, the Falcon XC Cobra has realistic blue paint stripes with the Cobra snake logo {{on the side}} of each front fender. Headlights and other lenses are often made realistically using clear plastic. The Valiant Charger has multi-hued <b>rear</b> tail <b>lights,</b> that blend from orange out to red. Body proportions of Trax Models are spot-on. Model wheel designs match those of the actual cars and tires are made of rubber.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a measurement system for blue <b>light</b> blocking <b>lens.</b> The main features of the system are using a light pulse modulator and filtering circuit technology to prevent ambient light interference, no any expensive optical filters are needed. Our system is composed of a transmitter circuit, a receiver circuit and a signal processing circuit. The transceiver driving circuit including the modulated LED of 10 kHz and measured the light signals from unwanted noise and unmodulated all light by a photodiode, and then converted by the transimpedance amplifer. The transmitter circuit uses Darlington drive circuit to optimize the LED operating current. The percentage error of the transmittance data is nearly 6 %, compared with that of the OCEAN USB 2000 spectrometer's, so proved that this device is feasibility. This experiment has also shown that the chromaticity coordinates will be changed when using blue <b>light</b> <b>lens.</b> Based on the experiment, the brightness of the blue <b>light</b> blocking <b>lenses</b> cannot be too low which will cause color deviation problems. From the analysis result in table 4, the color deviation is nearly 17 % at green blocking blue <b>light</b> <b>lenses</b> and 21 % at yellow blocking blue <b>light</b> <b>lenses</b> on y coordinates. Therefore, these two blocking blue <b>light</b> <b>lenses</b> are not suitable for use as blue <b>light</b> blocking <b>lenses.</b> The color deviation of coated blue film and brown 20 % blocking blue <b>light</b> <b>lens</b> have nearly 3 % on x-y coordinates. But, those of 8 % in 30 % brown and 17 % in green lenses are also not suitable for blue <b>light</b> blocking <b>lens</b> using. Thus the most suitable for blue <b>light</b> blocking <b>lenses</b> using is 20 % brown blocking lens. In the future, this proposed device may be used as a powerful measurement tool on the eyeglasses test line...|$|R
50|$|Detroit was by now favouring annual facelifts, and Vauxhall {{reflected}} that trend, announcing further facelifts in 1956 (wind-up windows, larger rear window, wider grille slats, separate amber <b>rear</b> flashing indicator <b>lights</b> replacing US-style red units {{incorporated into the}} brake/tail <b>light</b> <b>lens,</b> new instrument graphics) and 1957 (electric wipers, larger tail lights, new grille, new 'magic ribbon' AC speedo) {{in line with the}} Wyvern model. Technically, however, there were no further changes until the arrival of a completely new Velox in October 1957.|$|R
50|$|The Northport Range Lights were a set {{of range}} lights on Prince Edward Island, Canada. They were built in 1885, and the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> was {{deactivated}} around 1970; the front light is still active as the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> of the new range.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{produced}} between 1965 - 1979 were {{equipped with}} old-style lights: {{turn signal lights}} were colorless (white), <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> were round, {{and the back of}} the body was rounder. Subsequent post-1979 models got amber (yellow) signal <b>lights,</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>lights</b> were slightly bigger and rectangular.|$|R

40|$|In this report, the {{magnitude}} of the problem of rear-end collisions is described. The report also draws up a test framework based on a theoretical approach and a judgement of various recent provisions for improving the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration. These provisions include: regulation of <b>light</b> intensity; <b>rear</b> fog lights; braking-dependant lights; early-warning brake lights; lights activated by emergency stopping; and solutions reducing the wearing out of lamps. The test framework makes it possible to judge inventions on their necessity, functioning, and optical features. Adjustments to the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration during the last decennia involved addition of a component (third brake <b>light,</b> <b>rear</b> fog <b>light).</b> In this, existing functions were improved so that a gradual introduction could be applied (only new cars). As an adjustment often has consequences for the whole <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration, it is concluded that `Europe' was justly reserved. Once good arguments for introducing a new function or component (necessitating) are presented, the complete renewal of the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration can be considered. Matters such as integration, standardisation, and adaptive regulation then become relevant. Recommendations are made for further adjustments to the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration. These adjustments are also aimed at improving the present functions, so that retrofit is unnecessary. These are: making two <b>rear</b> fog <b>lights</b> mandatory; voluntary regulation of light intensity; voluntary alarm lights for emergency stops; and voluntary alarm lights after an emergency stop...|$|R

50|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> units {{each had}} an all-red cover and {{contained}} only two bulbs. One of the bulbs operated as a conventional brake <b>light.</b> The other <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> bulb contained two filaments, {{one of which}} came one with the light switch and the second of which flashed when the turn indicator switch was used, so following traffic saw just a single light becoming successively and rhythmically brighter and less bright when the car was about to turn. The effect will have been unremarkable to North American drivers, but triggered comment in Europe.
