5|$|Local {{government}} for the town of Reading is principally provided by Reading Borough Council, a single level unitary authority without civil parishes. However some of the town's outer suburbs are in West Berkshire and Wokingham unitary authorities. These outer suburbs belong to civil parishes, in some cases with their own town status. Reading has elected at least one Member of Parliament to every Parliament since 1295. Historically, Reading was represented by the members for the Parliamentary Borough of <b>Reading,</b> <b>and</b> the parliamentary constituencies of Reading, Reading North, and Reading South. Since the 2010 general election, <b>Reading</b> <b>and</b> its surrounding area has been divided between the parliamentary constituencies of Reading East and Reading West. The whole of the town is within the multi-member South East England European constituency.|$|E
50|$|These {{constraints}} {{combine to}} produce a profound asymmetry between patterns of <b>read</b> <b>and</b> write access to flash memory. In contrast, magnetic hard disk drives offer nearly symmetrical <b>read</b> <b>and</b> write access: <b>read</b> speed <b>and</b> write speed are nearly identical (as both are constrained by {{the rate at which}} the disk spins), it is possible to both <b>read</b> <b>and</b> write small blocks or sectors (typically 512 or 4096 bytes), and there is no practical limit to the number of times magnetic media can be written and rewritten.|$|R
50|$|Different {{considerations}} for memory access patterns appear in parallelism beyond locality of reference, namely {{the separation of}} <b>reads</b> <b>and</b> writes. E.g.: even if the <b>reads</b> <b>and</b> writes are 'perfectly' local, it can be impossible to parallelise due to dependencies; separating the <b>reads</b> <b>and</b> writes into separate areas yields a different memory access pattern, maybe initially appear worse in pure locality terms, but desirable to leverage modern parallel hardware.|$|R

(However, {{there is no guarantee}} about the relative ordering of volatile <b>reads</b> <b>and</b> writes with regular <b>reads</b> <b>and</b> writes, meaning that it's generally not a useful threading construct.) ...|$|R
