5000|$|In 1984, Francisco Arcelus {{built upon}} Esteban-Marquillas' {{use of the}} {{homothetic}} variables and extended the traditional model even further. He used this method to decompose the national share and industrial mix effects into expected and differential components. The expected component {{is based on the}} homothetic level of the variable, and is the effect not attributed to the regional specializations. The differential component is the remaining effect, which is attributable to the regional industrial mix. [...] Arcelus claimed that, even with the Esteban-Marquillas extension, the <b>regional</b> <b>share</b> effect is still related to the regional industry mix, and that the static model assumes all regional industries operate on a national market basis, focusing too heavily on the export markets and ignoring the local markets. In order to address these issues, Arcelus used a different method for separating the <b>regional</b> <b>share</b> effect, resulting in a regional growth effect and a regional industry mix effect. Both of these are decomposed into expected and differential components using the homothetic variable.|$|E

For this purpose, we assembled a panel dataset for 11 Scottish regions for the period 1959 until 2008. We specialised the analysis on beef cattle. We use simple regression techniques to verify whether there have been changes in the <b>regional</b> <b>shares</b> of beef cattle and whether beef cattle numbers in the different regions tend to converge to a steady state value. The results indicate that the data can be broken down into two major periods: before and after the accession to the European Community (EC).

In terms of the convergence analysis, it is clear that accession to the EC affected the regional beef cattle steady state values. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R

40|$|When {{welfare is}} {{analysed}} in Sweden {{the analysis is}} usually made at the national level; when the analysis is not done on the national level, the local level is in focus to illuminate differences between municipalities. Studies on poverty are no exception. The regional level contains {{a lot of information}} which is needed to understand the dynamics of poverty. Without this information it is difficult to fight or mitigate poverty. The previous research focusing on i) regional aspects of poverty and, at the same time, ii) child poverty is very limited. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse child poverty in Sweden 1990 and 2010 in a regional perspective. A multivariate cross-section OLS regression model will be used to estimate what factors causing child poverty in a regional perspective. The chosen method enables to control for a subset of explanatory variables and examine the effect of a selected independent variable when estimating the factors causing child poverty in a regional perspective. This study uses data collected from Statistics Sweden (SCB), the National Board of Social Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) and the National Labour Market Board (Arbetsformedlingen). The data used is regional macro data, which does not contain information on single individuals. The <b>regional</b> <b>share</b> of children living on economic assistance in Sweden is used as the dependent variable while the <b>regional</b> <b>share</b> of foreign born population, regional unemployment rate, the <b>regional</b> <b>share</b> of single parents, regional sickness leave, regional mean personal income and mean regional transfers per person are used as independent variables. The findings indicate that old industrial regions experience a high presence of child poverty. These regions experience an obsolete economic structure and an obstructed structural change in the economy. High unemployment, a high share of early retirement and sickness leave and relatively high welfare transfers to the population. The statistical analysis show that when the share of foreign born increases in the regional population, so do the <b>regional</b> <b>share</b> of children living on economic assistance; being unable to enter the labour market is the most probable reason.

40|$|Differences in {{the spatial}} patters of the {{intensity}} of new firm formation have attracted the intrest of researchers for a long time. Usally birth-rates or sometimes count-data is used to explain the spatial pattern {{with a variety of}} independend variables. Starting from a Shift-Share-analysis we examine the <b>regional</b> <b>share</b> of the number of newly founded firms in 74 West-German planning regions between 1987 and 1997. The <b>regional</b> <b>share</b> has the advantage that effects of different regional industry-structures as well as different size-structures are excluded. Therefore, by analysing the <b>regional</b> <b>share,</b> the factors determing the number of newly founded firms apart from industry-structure and regional size can be examined very clearly. The structure of the data allows us to apply a panel-regression appraoch with fixed effects. There are four main results of our estimations. First agglomeration-effects are of great importance for the number of newly founded firms. Regions with a high density of population provide a better environment for entrepreneurs. Furthermore, agglomeration-effects shape the correlation between the <b>regional</b> <b>share</b> and other regional characteristics, too. Usually a high share of employees working in SMEs and especially a high proportion of R&D in SME are rated as signs for the existence of a ”seed-bed” for entrepreneurs. But in our analysis these variables show a negative influence on the number of newly founded firms. Our conclusion is that this is because these variables indicate missing agglomeration-effects. SMEs are typical for rural and peripheral locations. Secondly, there is a tendency that the properties that are favourable for starting new businesses are less favourable for the survival of newly founded firms. We are the opinion that this is at least partially the result of a high degree of competition between newly founded firms. Thirdly, high rates of unemployment and growing numbers of unemployed result in growing numbers of newly founded firms. Because of missing alternatives on the labour market, people tend to start their own businesses more easily than in regions with a lesser degree of unemployment. Fourthly, we found a high degree of spatial autocorrelation. ”Neighbouring regions have much in common” that result in similar values of the <b>regional</b> <b>share.</b> But it could be shown that this is not due to common factors that are missing in our analysis. ...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the study}} by Moretti (2004) for the US, it is widely {{accepted}} that the spatial distribution of human capital plays an increasing role for regional labor market outcomes. Like in the pioneer approach we assume that workers' productivity at the firm level depend on the <b>regional</b> <b>share</b> of the high skilled. We extent the theoretical framework, however, by decomposing {{the change in the}} <b>regional</b> <b>share</b> of high-skilled workers into brain drain, brain gain as well as into labor market entry and exit effects. This allows us to investigate hypotheses about the extent and nature of knowledge spillovers in more detail. For the empirical part we analyze a large administrative panel data set. Including a series of controls as well as fixed effects for the worker, occupation, industry, region and year we find a significant negative relationship between brain drain and the regional wage level of low- and high skilled workers and a positive one for brain gain. These results are robust across different specifications and hold for Germany as a whole and West Germany alone. If estimated separately, we find much weaker and partly statistically not significant knowledge spillovers for East German regions. In general, brain drain and brain gain effects are of similar order of magnitude, whereas the effect of labor market exits of high-skilled workers exceeds that of labor market entries in absolute value. Using instrumental variable methods we show that the basic results are not driven by endogeneity bias...|$|E
