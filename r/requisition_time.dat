5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, both the Clacton and Skegness camps were requisitioned by the War Office for use as training camps. The ministry needed further camps, and contracted Butlin to build them. Butlin agreed, on the condition that he could purchase the sites when the war was over, to use as holiday camps. The ministry agreed, and Filey (1945), Pwllheli and Ayr (both in 1947), opened after the war. As Butlin was dealing with other sites, he asked his business competitor, Harry Warner, to complete the construction of Filey. Butlin had purchased his first hotel in 1939, the Thatched Barn in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Like his camps, it was <b>requisitioned</b> (this <b>time</b> by the SOE) before he could develop it.|$|R

The intent {{of this policy}} was to decrease <b>requisition</b> delivery <b>time</b> and increase VMFAT- 101 ’s aircraft readiness. In only one month, MALS- 11 staged the appropriate inventory at the squadron along with a detachment of Marines to manage the material. We review {{the effects of the}} inventory move on MAG- 11 as a whole, in terms of order lead time and capacity utilization. In addition, we examine the new inventory policy’s other effects, such as workflow efficiency. Captain, United States Marine Corp...|$|R
50|$|Taroona was requisitioned {{for service}} as a troop ship in World War II by New Zealand. She carried troops from Auckland, New Zealand to Suva in January 1942, and in March 1942. On her return to the Bass Strait run she was almost {{immediately}} again <b>requisitioned</b> this <b>time</b> by Australia and taken over as a fast troop carrier. During her first trip to Port Moresby she carried 480 troops and supplies; on leaving Moresby she ran aground on a reef at the entrance where she remained for three days, helpless hard and fast aground. All attempts to refloat her using both engines and the assistance of navy vessels proved useless. The situation became serious when on several occasions Japanese bombers swept in to attack the Seven Mile Aerodrome outside Port Moresby. Why they failed to attack Taroona remains a mystery. Finally aided by three naval vessels, she shook herself free.|$|R

It is believed that the theatre {{is the only one}} built in Britain during the war. The building process was interrupted by hostilities after the site was acquired in 1939, being at one <b>time</b> <b>requisitioned</b> as a barrage balloon station, and at another having windows and doors damaged by a bomb falling in Saltwell Park, just across the road.

The SMU stockpiles supplies close to the warfighter in order to decrease <b>requisitioning</b> cycle <b>time</b> and, in essence, has become a natural bottleneck between the wholesale and consumer levels of supply. The speed at which the SMU can effectively fulfill and ship a requisition has {{a direct impact on}} the supply, maintenance, and sustainability levels of its supported units. This project centers on determining and analyzing the internal processes of the SMU's requisition management cycle and its distribution capabilities in order to identify potential areas of improvement. The objectives of this project include an analysis of current SMU requisitioning procedures and protocols, the Marine Corps continuous process improvement program, and the incentives within the logistics contracts supporting SMU operations.

40|$|Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) manages {{more than}} 186, 000 Depot Level Repairable (DLR) line items in its {{wholesale}} inventory. It positions this materiel within a distribution network of 23 Defense Logistics Agency Depots and the privately owned Premium Transportation Facility (PTF). NAVICP plans to reduce materiel distribution time and optimize {{use of the}} distribution network to comply with mandated reductions in <b>requisition</b> response <b>time.</b> This thesis develops an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that positions one or more line items to achieve minimum distribution time subject to cost and other constraints. It derives a 57 line item test set composed of DLRs most likely to benefit from re-positioning: items with recent and projected demand and low weight. It also finds a simplified six-mode transportation scheme and an aggregated customer scheme that renders an ILP that is simple to use and captures the relationships that exist within the distribution network. Extensive analysis of the distribution network using the ILP indicates the Navy can cut response time and distribution cost by better strategic positioning of wholesale inventory within the existing network. These savings {{can be achieved by}} increasing use of PTF and considering use of storage depots not co-located with Navy activities. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
50|$|In 1943, Westralia was {{converted}} into a Landing Ship, Infantry (LSI). The ship was used to transport units of the United States Army and United States Marine Corps, and took part in numerous amphibious landings. After being used to repatriate personnel {{at the end of}} the war, Westralia was decommissioned in 1946. Before she could be returned to her owners, the vessel was <b>requisitioned</b> again, this <b>time</b> for use as a troop transport supporting the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). Westralia was not commissioned again, and operated by a merchant navy crew until 1951, when she was returned to Huddart Parker. In 1959, the ship was sold to the Asian and Pacific Shipping Co Ltd for use as a livestock carrier. Initially operated as Delfino, she was renamed Woolambi in 1960, before being sold for scrap in 1961.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWe develop a classification system for U. S. Navy consumable items {{to give the}} Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) a better position for advocacy regarding these assets. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) {{is responsible for the}} procurement, storage, and distribution of the Navy's consumable assets. Its inventory system is highly dynamic, and items may be requisitioned for long periods without undue delay followed by sudden, unexpected shortages that directly affect Navy combat readiness. We propose a new metric, customer time limit (CTL), which normalizes the <b>requisition</b> fulfillment <b>time</b> according to priority level and the physical location of the customer. Using this metric, we essentially classify inventory items as problematical with respect to two different criteria: whether the median CTL exceeds a nominal threshold, and whether CTL exhibits an increasing trend. To apply this classification, nonparametric statistical methods are used based on consumable requisition data for calendar years 2013 through 2015, resulting in three categories: NSNs at Risk, Bad Actors, or Bad Actors with Trend. Collectively, we find that NSNs at Risk and Bad Actors with Trend constitute approximately 1 % in both U. S. Navy consumable item population and annual consumable expenditure ($ 19 million out of $ 1. 9 billion purchased), and that Bad Actors comprise approximately 2 % of U. S. Navy consumable item population and 7 % of annual consumable expenditure ($ 140 million out of $ 1. 9 billion purchased). Lieutenant Commander, Supply Corps, United States Nav...|$|R
50|$|Rio Tinto's {{status as}} a mainly British-owned company, located in Spain and {{producing}} pyrites - an important material for military applications - created a complicated set of circumstances for the company's operation in the 1930s and 1940s. During the Spanish Civil War, the region in which Rio Tinto's mines were located came {{under the control of}} General Franco's Nationalists in 1936. However, Franco increasingly intervened in the company's operations, at <b>times</b> <b>requisitioning</b> pyrite supplies for use by Spain and its Axis allies Germany and Italy, forcing price controls on the company's production, restricting exports, and threatening nationalisation of the mines. Although company management (and indirectly, the British government) managed to counteract some of these efforts by Franco, much of the mine's pyrite production was channelled to Axis powers before and during World War II. Nonetheless, Franco's meddling caused the mine's production and profitability to fall precipitously during and after the war, leading the company to ultimately exit from its Spanish operations in 1954.|$|R
50|$|Though he {{had been}} {{considered}} a staunch liberal, Downey as a senator became a conservative Democrat who won the support of California's major oil interests. He supported the efforts of oil companies and agribusiness to procure state, rather than federal, control of California's oil resources. He also worked to exempt the California Central Valley from the Reclamation Act of 1902, an action which assisted corporate farms. In the Senate, Downey also introduced a series of pension bills, and in 1941 he was named chairman of a special Senate committee on old-age insurance. He took an early stand supporting a military draft but opposed the Roosevelt administration's plans to <b>requisition</b> industries in <b>time</b> of war. During World War II he called {{for the creation of}} a committee to investigate the status of blacks and other minorities in the armed forces and advocated a postwar United Nations, international control of atomic energy, increased veterans' benefits, and federal pay raises. At the end of the war he opposed continuation of the military draft. During his years in the U.S. Senate Downey often represented the interests of California's powerful motion picture industry. His shift from a liberal New Dealer to a conservative Democrat would become officially recognized after the war ended.|$|R
50|$|Costa Cruises {{originates}} from a {{cargo shipping}} company founded by Giacomo Costa fu Andrea in Genoa, Italy in 1854. Better known as Costa Line or C Line by the 1920s, its first passenger carrier was the Maria C, a former U.S. Navy stores ship that was partly converted for passenger use and served various routes to North and South America from 1947 to 1953. The company's first dedicated passenger ship was the Anna C, a cargo vessel that was <b>requisitioned</b> for war <b>time</b> {{use by the}} Royal Navy and refitted as an accommodation ship before returning to merchant use. Costa purchased the ship in 1947 and it operated between Italy and South America from 1948, later converting to full-time cruising and serving with the company until 1971. From the late 1960s until the 1980s, Costa rapidly developed its passenger operations into what we now recognise as modern cruise ships. Subsequently, in 1987, it consolidated its cruise ship operations into a new company, Costa Cruises, which at its peak, was the largest cruise ship operator in the world. The takeover of Costa Cruises by Carnival Corporation began in 1997, as a 50/50 deal between Carnival and the British tour operator Airtours. Carnival then began purchasing Airtours' shares in the company, becoming the sole shareholder in September 2000. Costa Cruises {{is now one of}} the largest brands within the Carnival Group, with 15 ships.|$|R
