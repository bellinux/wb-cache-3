40|$|It {{has become}} almost a stylized fact that after {{financial}} crises, economic activity recovers without a <b>rebound</b> <b>in</b> credit. We investigate the relationship between credit and economic activity over the business cycle.

Using data from developed and emerging market countries {{we find that the}} flow of credit has a higher correlation with GDP than the stock of credit, in particular during recovery periods from financial crises. ...|$|R
5|$|Rodman {{remained}} a bench player during the 1988–1989 season, averaging 9.0 points and 9.4 <b>rebounds</b> <b>in</b> 27minutes, yet providing such effective defense {{that he was}} voted into the All-Defensive Team, the first of eight times in his career. He also began seeing more playing time after Adrian Dantley was traded at midseason to Dallas for Mark Aguirre. In that season, the Pistons finally vanquished their playoffs bane by sweeping the Boston Celtics, then winning in six games versus the Chicago Bulls—including scoring champion Michael Jordan—and easily defeating the Lakers 4–0 in the 1989 NBA Finals. Although he was hampered by back spasms, Rodman dominated the boards, grabbing 19 <b>rebounds</b> <b>in</b> Game 3 and providing tough interior defense.|$|E

5|$|Tabbed as {{a starter}} during the preseason, Auguste, {{as one of the}} team's few post options, {{established}} himself {{as a starter}} during his junior season with good performances early in the season, albeit against weaker opposition. A memorable December 13, 2014 game against Florida State, in which he scored a career-high 26 points, started what coach Brey described as a run of key contributions from the forward, with Auguste quickly recouping from his bad performances. In January 2015, Auguste was sidelined by Notre Dame due to academic issues, with the length of the suspension undisclosed. It would ultimately only last three days, with the unknown reason later described as minor by the player. Auguste was seen as a major contributor to the Irish's 2015 ACC Tournament title contributing 16 points and 13 <b>rebounds</b> <b>in</b> the final against North Carolina (for an average of more than 11 points and 9 <b>rebounds</b> <b>in</b> the whole tournament).|$|E

40|$|Rebound of {{thoughts}} after thought suppression is widely documented. Much less {{is known about}} the effects of suppression on rebound of behavior.

Supporting the Motivational Inference Model of postsuppressional rebound, the studies show that behavioral rebound is reduced if participants are led to believe that suppression is difficult for everybody (Experiments 1 and 2). Also consistent with this model is the finding that motivation to do the suppressed behavior mediated rebound (Experiment 3). The implications for rebound of unwanted behaviors are discussed...|$|R
