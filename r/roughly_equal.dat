5|$|Cain {{featured}} {{a mix of}} mostly four pitches: a four-seam fastball (90–93mph), a cutter (84–87), a curveball (76–79), and a changeup (83–86). Increasingly, he also threw a two-seam fastball at 89–91mph. Cain led with his four-seamer, throwing it over half the time in his career. His changeup was his secondary pitch to left-handed hitters, while he threw cutters as a secondary pitch to right-handed hitters. Cain threw curveballs in <b>roughly</b> <b>equal</b> proportions to righties and lefties.|$|E

In the upper section (<b>roughly</b> <b>equalling</b> the basin parts in Uttarakhand) more than 50 species have been recorded and Cyprinidae alone accounts for almost 80% those, followed by Balitoridae (about 15.6%) and Sisoridae (about 12.2%).

Typical genera approaching this altitude are Schizothorax, Tor, Barilius, Nemacheilus and Glyptothorax. About 100 species have been recorded from the middle section of the basin (<b>roughly</b> <b>equalling</b> the sections in Uttar Pradesh and parts of Bihar) and more than 55% of these are in family Cyprinidae, followed by Schilbeidae (about 10.6%) and Clupeidae (about 8.6%). The lower section (<b>roughly</b> <b>equalling</b> the basin in parts of Bihar and West Bengal) includes major floodplains and is home to almost 100 species.

5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are <b>roughly</b> <b>equal</b> in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E

Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. Despite this, cells occur in a <b>roughly</b> <b>equal</b> ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E

5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter.

The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E
