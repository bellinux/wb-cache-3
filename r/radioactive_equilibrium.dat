5|$|Thirty-one {{isotopes}} of actinium {{and eight}} excited isomeric states {{of some of}} its nuclides were identified by 2010. Three isotopes, 225Ac, 227Ac and 228Ac, were found in nature and the others were produced in the laboratory; only the three natural isotopes are used in applications.

Actinium-225 is less available than actinium-228, but is more promising in radiotracer applications. Actinium-227 (half-life 21.77 years) occurs in all uranium ores, but in small quantities. One gram of uranium (in <b>radioactive</b> <b>equilibrium)</b> contains only 2 gram of 227Ac. Actinium-228 is a member of the radioactive thorium series formed by the decay of 228Ra; it is a β− emitter with a half-life of 6.15 hours. In one tonne of thorium there is 5 gram of 228Ac.

40|$|International audienceTritium is a {{short-lived}} radioactive isotope (T 1 / 2 = 12. 33 yr) produced naturally {{in the atmosphere}} by cosmic radiation but also released into the atmosphere and hydrosphere by nuclear activities (nuclear power stations, radioactive waste disposal). Tritium of natural or anthropogenic origin may end up in soils through tritiated rain, and may eventually appear in groundwater. Tritium in groundwater can be re-emitted to the atmosphere through the vadose zone. The tritium concentration in soil varies sharply {{close to the ground}} surface and is very sensitive to many interrelated factors like rainfall amount, evapotranspiration rate, rooting depth and water table position, rendering the modeling a rather complex task. Among many existing codes, SOLVEG is a one-dimensional numerical model to simulate multiphase transport through the unsaturated zone. Processes include tritium diffusion in both, gas and liquid phase, advection and dispersion for tritium in liquid phase, <b>radioactive</b> decay and <b>equilibrium</b> partitioning between liquid and gas phase. For its application with bare or vegetated (perennial vegetation or crops) soil surfaces and shallow or deep groundwater levels (contaminated or non-contaminated aquifer) the model has been adapted in order to include ground cover, root growth and root water uptake. The current work describes the approach and results of the modeling of a tracer test with tritiated water (7. 3 × 108 Bqm− 3) in a cultivated soil with an underlying 14 m deep unsaturated zone (non-contaminated). According to the simulation results, the soil's natural attenuation process is governed by evapotranspiration and tritium reemission. The latter process is due to a tritium concentration gradient between soil air and an atmospheric boundary layer at the soil surface. Re-emission generally occurs during night time, since at day time it is coupled with the evaporation process. Evapotranspiration and re-emission removed considerable quantities of tritium and limited penetration of surface-applied tritiated water in the vadose zone to no more than ∼ 1 - 2 m. After a period of 15 months tritium background concentration in soil was attained...|$|R

40|$|Coal- and lignite-fired {{power plants}} produce {{significant}} amounts of ashes, which are quite often being used as additives in cement and other building materials. In many cases, coal and lignite present high concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides, such as U- 238, Ra- 226, Pb- 210, Th- 232 and K- 40. During the combustion process, the produced ashes are enriched in the above radionuclides. The different enrichment of the various radionuclides within a radioactive series, {{such as that of}} 238 U, results in the disturbance of radioactive secular equilibrium. An extensive research project for the determination of the natural radioactivity of lignite and ashes from Greek lignite-fired power plants is in progress in the Nuclear Engineering Department of the National Technical University of Athens (NED-NTUA) since 1983. This paper presents detailed results for the natural radioactivity, the secular <b>radioactive</b> <b>equilibrium</b> disturbance and the radon exhalation rate of the fly-ash collected at the different stages along the emission control system of a lignite-fired power plant {{as well as of the}} bottom-ash. From the results obtained so far, it may be concluded that Ra- 226 radioactivity of fly-ash in some cases exceeds 1 kBq kg(- 1), which is much higher than the mean Ra- 226 radioactivity of surface soils in Greece (25 Bq kg(- 1)). Furthermore, the radioactivity of Pb- 210 in fly-ash may reach 4 kBq kg(- 1). These results are interpreted in relation to the physical properties of the investigated nuclides, the temperature in the flue-gas pathway, as well as the fly-ash grain size distribution. It is concluded that towards the coldest parts of the emission control system of the power plant, the radioactivity of some natural nuclides is gradually enhanced, secular <b>radioactive</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is significantly disturbed and the radon exhalation rate tends to increase.

In addition, significant compartmentalization among the nucleoside triphosphates was not observed after 30 min, since uridine triphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were at <b>radioactive</b> <b>equilibrium</b> after exposure to [32 P]Pi. At the sorocarp stage of differentiation, the dominant role of adenylate kinase activity is indicated by the observations that (i) adenylate kinase activity {{was found to be}} present, (ii) the specific radioactivities of the beta- and gamma-phosphates of ATP were equal, (iii) the increase in specific radioactivity of adenosine diphosphate was one-half that of ATP in the presence of [32 P]Pi, and (iv) the steady-state equilibrium constant calculated (0. 69) from the nucleotide levels equaled that of the apparent equilibrium constant reported in the literature (0. 70). By using the same criteria, adenylate kinase activity was not the predominant reaction establishing the adenine nucleotide levels in cells at the pseudoplasmodium stage of differentiation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDistributions of {{primordial}} radionuclides in {{soil and}} vegetables were investigated using high-purity germanium gamma-ray spectrometry. Gamma-ray spectrometry {{is one of}} the most accepted and widely used techniques for the detection and analysis of radioactive materials for a wide range of activity. Important properties of the employed gamma-ray detector were also determined to ensure the accuracy of the radiometric analysis. The studied samples were kept in airtight condition at least for 6 weeks before gamma counting to attain the <b>radioactive</b> <b>equilibrium</b> between daughters and parents of 226 Ra (238 U) and 232 Th decay series. The average specific activities for uranium in soil and vegetable samples were obtained as 21 ± 4 and 2. 4 ± 0. 4, respectively. Respective values for Thorium and Potassium levels were obtained as 21 ± 3, 1. 9 ± 0. 5 and 290 ± 20, 80. 3 ± 54. 9 in soil and vegetable samples. The reported data can be considered as base values for distribution of natural radionuclides in soil and vegetable samples in the studied region, and will be used as reference information to assess any radiological contamination due to soil and vegetables in future. The response of the studied the detector was found suitable for radioactivity analysis of natural samples having a wide range of activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} concentration of 238 U and 234 U {{has been determined}} in groundwater samples of hot springs and deep wells from the region of Northern Greece. The analysis was performed by alpha spectroscopy after pre-concentration and separation of uranium by cation exchange (Chelex 100 resin) and finally its electro-deposition on stainless steel discs. The uranium concentration in deep wells and springs varies strongly between 0. 15 and 7. 66 μg l− 1. Generally the springs present higher uranium concentration than the deep wells, except of the Apol-lonia spring, which has shown the lowest value of 0. 15 mg l− 1. 238 U and 234 U {{activity concentration}} ranged between 1. 8 – 95. 3 mBq l− 1 and 1. 7 – 160. 1 mBq l− 1, respectively. The obtained isotopic ratio 234 U/ 238 U varies between 0. 95 and 1. 74 {{which means that the}} two isotopes are not in <b>radioactive</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The highest 234 U/ 238 U activity ratio values correspond to the Langada springs, indicating most probably old-type waters. On the other hand, ground waters from wells with relatively low uranium activity concentration and low 234 U/ 238 U isotopic ratios, point to the presence of younger waters with a stronger contribution of a local recharge component to the groundwater...|$|E
