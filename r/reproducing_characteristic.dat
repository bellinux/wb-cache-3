We compare Hughes’ model with different running costs, a variant with local dependency on the density gradient proposed in Xia et al. (2009), and a second order model derived from the Payne-Whitham traffic model which has first been analyzed in Jiang et al. (2010). In particular, our study shows that first order models are incapable of reproducing stop-and-go waves and blocking at exits...|$|E
40|$|In recent literature, several {{models were}} {{proposed}} for reproducing {{and understanding the}} tagging behavior of users. They all assume that the tagging behavior {{is influenced by the}} previous tag assignments of other users. But they are only partially successful in <b>reproducing</b> <b>characteristic</b> properties found in tag streams. We argue that this inadequacy of existing models results from their inability to include user’s background knowledge into their model of tagging behavior. This paper presents a generative tagging model that integrates both components, the background knowledge and the influence of previous tag assignments. Our model successfully reproduces characteristic properties of tag streams. It even explains effects of the user interface on the tag stream...|$|E
40|$|Castalia is a {{software}} package (Koutsoyiannis, D., and A. Efstratiadis, A stochastic hydrology {{framework for the}} management of multiple reservoir systems, Geophysical Research Abstracts, Vol. 3, European Geophysical Society, 2001) that uses an original two-level multivariate scheme (from annual to daily time scale) appropriate for preserving the most important statistics of the historical time series and <b>reproducing</b> <b>characteristic</b> peculiarities of hydrological processes such as long-term persistence, periodicity and skewness. A module was developed as an expansion of Castalia, which implements a methodology for the multivariate stochastic simulation and disaggregation of monthly hydrological time series to daily series. This upgraded version of Castalia uses a three-level multivariate scheme that simultaneously preserves the above characteristics for the annual, monthly and daily time scale. Moreover, this module efficiently handles additional difficulties due to peculiarities which frequently appear in daily hydrological series, such as high variation coefficients, high values of skewness and intermittency (preservation of probability dry in rainfall). The computer system was applied for the generation of synthetic hydrological time series within simulation models that are components of a decision support system for hydrosystem management.

40|$|Roles of orbital and lattice {{degrees of}} freedom in {{strongly}} correlated systems are investigated to understand electronic properties of perovskite Mn oxides such as La_{ 1 -x}Sr_{x}MnO_{ 3 }. An extended double-exchange model containing Coulomb interaction, doubly degenerate orbitals and Jahn-Teller coupling is derived under full polarization of spins with two-dimensional anisotropy. Quantum fluctuation effects of Coulomb interaction and orbital {{degrees of freedom}} are investigated by using the quantum Monte Carlo method. In undoped states, {{it is crucial to}} consider both the Coulomb interaction and the Jahn-Teller coupling in <b>reproducing</b> <b>characteristic</b> hierarchy of energy scales among charge, orbital-lattice and spin degrees of freedom in experiments. Our numerical results quantitatively reproduce the charge gap amplitude as well as the stabilization energy and the amplitude of the cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion in undoped compounds. Upon doping of carriers, {{in the absence of the}} Jahn-Teller distortion, critical enhancement of both charge compressibility and orbital correlation length is found with decreasing doping concentration. These are discussed as origins of strong incoherence in charge dynamics. With the Jahn-Teller coupling in the doped region, collapse of the Jahn-Teller distortion and instability to phase separation are obtained and favorably compared with experiments. These provide a possible way to understand the complicated properties of lightly doped manganites. Comment: 22 pages RevTeX including 25 PS figures, submitted to Phys. Rev.

40|$|The {{formation}} of Martian dust storms {{is believed to}} be driven by dust lifting by near-surface wind stress (NSWS). Accurately representing this dust lifting within Mars Global Circulation Models (MGCMs) is important in order to gain a full understanding of the Martian dust storm cycle. Parameterisations of dust lifting by NSWS exist within several MGCMs; implementations differ but they all follow a similar design, so progress within one model is relevant to the entire field. Few studies have explored in detail how the results of these parameterisations can be affected by changing the horizontal resolution of the model. An accurate parameterisation of dust lifting by NSWS will lift a representative dust mass, <b>reproducing</b> <b>characteristic</b> dust optical depths in the atmosphere. The geographical distribution of the dust lifting by NSWS will also change throughout the year, affecting patterns of dust storm formation and development. Currently, suitable values for dust lifting parameters must be identified at every new model resolution. Resolutions of 5 ° latitude x 5 ° longitude are often used to model the Martian climate, as thermal tides and long-term weather patterns can be well represented at this resolution. However, smaller scale phenomena (such as near-surface winds driven by local topography) cannot be accurately depicted at this resolution. We use the LMD-UK MGCM to complete multi-year simulations across multiple model resolutions. Our experiments range from ‘low’ resolution 5 ° lat x 5 ° lon to ‘high’ resolution 1 ° lat x 1 ° lon. In experiments with fixed, constant lifting parameters, we find that higher resolution simulations lift more dust, but that this trend is asymptotic. At low resolutions, dust lifting increases proportionately with the increase in number of horizontal gridboxes. However, at high resolutions, doubling the number of gridboxes results only in a 30...|$|E

40|$|Anticipatory neural {{activity}} preceding behaviorally {{important events}} {{has been reported}} in cortex, striatum, and midbrain dopamine neurons. Whereas dopamine neurons are phasically activated by reward-predictive stimuli, anticipatory activity of cortical and striatal neurons is increased during delay periods before important events. Characteristics of dopa-mine neuron activity resemble those of the prediction error signal of the temporal difference (TD) model of Pavlovian learning (Sutton & Barto, 1990). This study demonstrates that the prediction signal of the TD model <b>reproduces</b> <b>characteristics</b> of cortical and striatal anticipatory neural ac-tivity.

During our evaluation, we also show that spammers have a significant influence on the characteristic properties of tagging systems.

In practice, the perpendicular media with a relatively thin Co-Cr layer, about 0. 1 μm in thickness, but which is thicker than the longitudinal media, produce high reproduced voltage at high densities. The {{reason is that the}} sharp magnetic field distribution of a single-pole-head is created for a thin Co-Cr layer by enhancing the head-to-medium magnetic coupling. As a result, the large residual magnetization remains in the recording process, and the high resolution of the singlg-pole-head generates high voltage in reproduction, even at high densities...|$|R
