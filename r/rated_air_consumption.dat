40|$|Compressed air {{is a major}} {{component}} of energy costs incurred in the weaving of textile fabrics on air-jet looms. The <b>consumption</b> of compressed <b>air</b> in air-jet weaving depends on different process variables. In this study, the effect of weft yarn count, reed count, fabric width and loom speed on the compressed <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> of air-jet loom was determined using response surface methodology. Fabric width was found to be the most dominant factor affecting the <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> followed by loom speed, reed count, and weft yarn count respectively. A statistical model for predicting the compressed <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> on air-jet loom was developed. The prediction ability and accuracy of the developed model was assessed by the fitted line plot between the predicted and actual <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> values. The prediction model may be used for optimizing the production planning, estimating the share of compressed air cost in weaving a particular fabric style, and in identifying any air wastages in the weaving shed by comparing the actual compressed <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> with that predicted by the model which was developed under controlled conditions without any air leakages...|$|R

40|$|In Textile industry, {{production}} is mostly key concern for Industry owner. This always has attracted researchers and machines manufacturers {{to make new}} developments in process and machines. Air-jet {{is one of the}} leading and successful highest productive weaving machines. However, it is now well established that due to add of charges of compressed air, manufacturing cost of air-jet weaving machine is higher as compared with rapier and projectile weaving machines. This is why countries having energy issues do not prefer air-jet weaving machines comparing projectile weaving machines. In this regard, several researchers and machine manufacturers have continuously been working to improve the efficiency of air-jet weft insertion. However, industry practice is as important as design made by researchers. The aim of this research is to investigate the <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> of air-jet weaving on industrial scale practice. In this study, five weaving machine of same manufacturer and model were selected. It was observed that despite of manufacturing same quality of fabric, <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> was varying almost in all weaving machines. Conventionally, mill workers adopt hit and trial practice in weaving industry including airpressure setting which leads to variation of nozzle pressure.
