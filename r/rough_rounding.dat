40|$|Objectives. The aim {{of present}} work was {{to carry out}} {{mathematical}} modelling of heat transfer with symmetrical heating in flat channels and <b>round</b> pipes with <b>rough</b> walls. Methods.  The calculation was carried out using the L'Hôpital-Bernoulli's method. The solution {{of the problem of}} intensified heat transfer in a <b>round</b> tube with <b>rough</b> walls was obtained using the Lyon's integral. Results. Different from existing theories, a methodology of theoretical computational heat transfer determination for flat <b>rough</b> channels and <b>round</b> pipes with <b>rough</b> walls is developed {{on the basis of the}} principle of full viscosity superposition in a turbulent boundary layer. The analysis of the calculated heat transfer and hydroresistivity values for flat <b>rough</b> channels and <b>round</b> <b>rough</b> pipes shows that the increase in heat transfer is always less than the corresponding increase in hydraulic resistance, which is a disadvantage as compared to channels with turbulators, with all else being equal. The results of calculating the heat transfer for channels with rough walls in an extended range of determinant parameters, which differ significantly from the corresponding data for the channels with turbulators, determine the level of heat exchange intensification. Conclusion. An increase in the calculated values of the relative average heat transfer Nu/NuGL for flat rough channels and rough pipes with very high values of the relative roughness is significantly contributed by both an increase in the relative roughness height and an increase in the Reynolds number Re. In comparison with empirical dependencies, the main advantage of solutions for averaged heat transfer in rough flat channels and round pipes under symmetrical thermal load obtained according to the developed theory is that they allow the calculation of heat exchange in rough pipes to be made in the case of large and very large relative heights of roughness protrusions, including large Reynolds numbers, typical for pipes of small diameters and narrow flat channels. An increase in the relative heat exchange in air due to an increase in the relative height of the roughness or the Reynolds number is accompanied by an even more significant increase in the hydraulic resistance. Calculated data on averaged heat transfer obtained in the work showed that in the range of determinant parameters for flat rough channels with symmetrical thermal loading, the average heat transfer is higher by (4. 8  11. 7) % as compared to <b>round</b> <b>rough</b> pipes – all other things being equal.  </p...|$|R

60|$|A first {{introduction}} to the Calcutta durwân or door-keeper is not nice. If he is chewing pân, he does not take the trouble {{to get rid of}} his quid. If he is sitting on his cot chewing sugar-cane, he does not think it worth his while to rise. He has to be taught those things, and he cannot understand why he should be reproved. Clearly he is a survival of a played-out system. Providence never intended that any native should be made a concierge more insolent than any of the French variety. The people of Calcutta put a man in a little lodge close to the gate of their house, in order that loafers may be turned away, and the houses protected from theft. The natural result is that the durwân treats everybody whom he does not know as a loafer, has an intimate and vendible knowledge of all the outgoings and incomings in that house, and controls, to a large extent, the nomination of the servants. They say that one of the estimable class is now suing a bank for about three lakhs of rupees.[15] Up-country, a Lieutenant-Governor's servant has to work for thirty years before he can retire on seventy thousand rupees of savings. The Calcutta durwân is a great institution. The head and front of his offence is that he will insist upon trying to talk English. How he protects the houses Calcutta only knows. He can be frightened out of his wits by severe speech, and is generally asleep in calling hours. If a <b>rough</b> <b>round</b> of visits be any guide, three times out of seven he is fragrant of drink. So much for the durwân. Now for the houses he guards.|$|R
