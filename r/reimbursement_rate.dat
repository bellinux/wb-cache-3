40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the process of}} increasing <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> for physicians who provide services to Maryland Medicaid enrollees.

It also provides {{an analysis of the}} impact of the increases in <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> on the participation of physicians in the Medicaid programme. Based on the analysis presented in this article, which targets the increase in <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> to evaluation and management procedures, the Maryland Government increased physician fees in the Medicaid programme beginning July 2002. Evaluation and management procedures are usually office visits provided by either a primary care physician or a specialist...|$|R
40|$|Adequacy of the {{provider}} {{network in the}} Medicaid program has been a longstanding area of concern to policymakers, program administrators and providers. Dissatisfaction with Medicaid <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> has deterred some providers from participating in Medicaid and has pushed others to limit their Medicaid clientele. Since <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> in the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) are similar to Medicaid rates, there is also concern that such rates may not be high enough to ensure adequate levels of provider participation. In general, Medicaid <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> in Texas appear to be average {{when compared to other}} states. However, within the state, Medicaid and SCHIP rates are significantly lower than those of Medicare and commercial payors. It is unclear what impact Medicaid and SCHIP <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> in Texas have on the adequacy of {{the provider}} network. Surveys reveal provider dissatisfaction with rates, but the network of providers in Texas appears to be sufficient in most areas. <b>Reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> in the border area merit special attention because of the uniqu...|$|R

40|$|Backgrounds and Aim: One of the {{remuneration}} methods {{in the hospital}} system in Iran is per case, based on a classification system termed Global system (GS). The GS, supported by Irans Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME), was established in 1999 and is now used for cost reimbursement in the second- and third-levels of health care services. In this system, patients are classified into 60 categories, based on the most frequent surgical operations. However, it now appears, {{that there are many}} questions about this system. This study aims to compare the global operations <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> with actual costs in the Cancer Institute, Tehran, in 2003 and 2004. nMaterials and Methods: This survey was a retrospective, analytical-descriptive one aiming at comparing the global operations <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> with actual costs in 646 global operations carried out in the Cancer Institute in 2003 and 2004. The global-operations and actual-costs data were gathered from Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and High Council of Insurance annual regulations, respectively, and analyzed using SPSS 11. 5 software and the Wilcoxon non-parametric test. Results: The differences between the cost <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> of global operations and their actual costs were lower in 2004 as compared to those in 2003. Also, the actual costs of operations were higher than the global operations <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> in both years and the difference was significant statistically in either year (P< 0 / 001). Conclusion: Some of the MOHME and Cancer Institutes authorities and experts believe that the decrease in differences between the cost <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> of global operations and their actual costs in 2003 compred to 2004 is due to increased awareness of physicians and the accounting and discharge units personnel of the global operations and related regulations, as well as increasing global operations <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates.</b> Also, they believe that the differences between the global operations <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> and their actual costs in either year could be attributed to not considering the actual inflation rate, hospital types, patients co-morbidities, etc. in calculating the global operations <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates.</b> It is suggested to make more realistic calculations, taking into account such variables as the actual inflation rate, hospital types, patient co-morbidities, etc...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} of medical treatment financing focusing mainly on analysis of health insurance companies <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> and their comparison with costs of aftercare beds. Secondary goal of the thesis is comparison of acute care beds costs and aftercare beds costs. The opening chapter discusses relationships between economics and health service and describes structure of health care funding compared to insurace companies financing strategies. Payment mechanism mostly used in the aftercare field is the pay-per-day system, this mechanism is therefore later explained in detail including particular effects on after care beds financing. The second part of the thesis compares insurance <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> with real costs of one particular facility.

A-wing will see a [...] "like-new" [...] renovation, as well the rest of the facility, that would gut the entire building to its core structure and will construct updated classrooms. A grand lobby with a tiered glass enclosure is proposed for the main entrance. B-wing plans to house an expanded guidance department and career services office. Expansion to the gymnasium out of the north end of the building will result in renovated locker rooms and health classrooms; and cardio, wellness, and weight rooms. Expansion to the cafeteria and auditorium will double their size. Renovations to C-wing also include a second lobby for the performing arts music wing with expanded music classrooms, practice rooms, and offices. The entire building will be implemented with advanced technology and air-conditioning. Site-plans reworked campus landscaping, traffic flow, and parking spaces for faculty and students. The total cost of construction for the expansion and renovation to Enfield High School is approximately $103 million. However, with a <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rate</b> from the State of Connecticut at approximately 73% the town will pay a share of approximately $35 million, bonded over 20 years. The closing of Enrico Fermi High School as a school will result in approximately $2 million in savings each year. Plans state that savings from the closing of one high school will pay for the 20 year bond, according to the Enfield Pre-Referendum High School Consolidation Committee. If the referendum did not pass, Enfield's two high schools would have remained open, but would have required limited renovations for updates to each facility at a cost of $50 million each, which would not be reimbursable by the state, in order to adhere to the State of Connecticut's new educational mandates that go into effect in 2017. Moreover, issues with Americans with Disabilities Act regulations had to be addressed in both buildings. The referendum went to town's voters in November 2012, and passed by a 2:1 margin.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the implications of fixed-price reimbursement of providers for access to hospice care by Medicare beneficiaries. Hospices that are offered higher <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> by Medicare {{are found to be}} more likely to become certified to provide care under the Medicare Hospice Benefit Program. Each $ 1. 00 increase in the daily routine home care rate raises the probability of certification by 1. 7 %. In turn, the Hospice Benefit increases access to hospice care by enabling Medicare-certified facilities to serve more patients than they would if they were noncertified. However, care must be taken to set <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> appropriately. Failure to correctly adjust <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> for the real costs of certification across {{different parts of the country}} leads to disparities in hospice certification and differential access to hospice care for Medicare beneficiaries. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{faced with}} {{shrinking}} budgets and swelling Medicaid rolls, states frequently {{try to reduce}} Medicaid spending by slashing provider <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates.</b> <b>Reimbursement</b> <b>rates,</b> however, significantly impact provider participation and consumer access to healthcare services. Therefore, such cutbacks to Medicaid’s already low rates often undermine the program’s promise of “mainstream” medical access {{for the poor and}} disabled. Medicaid beneficiaries and providers long used the court system to combat these rate cuts by suing under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 and arguing that inadequate <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> violate the “equal access provision” of the federal Medicaid Act. But in 2002, the U. S. Supreme Court foreclosed this avenue of relief and seemed to leave doctors and patients without standing to challenge even the most draconian rate cuts. A recent series of decisions by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, however, suggests that the Supremacy Clause presents an alternative means of enforcing the equal access provision. This Note explores both the promise and pitfalls of an equal access preemption claim and argues that Medicaid providers and beneficiaries should be able to enjoin significant rate cutbacks and protect healthcare access by challenging state changes to <b>reimbursement</b> <b>rates</b> as preempted by the Medicaid Act...|$|R
