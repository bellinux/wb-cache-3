The setup {{is based on the}} gold grating of a commercially available <b>recordable</b> <b>compact</b> <b>disk,</b> which allows the excitation of surface plasmons. The compact disks are mass produced by injection-moulding, which results in low cost disposable grating substrates. The measurement method allows high resolution analysis of gases and surface chemistry. Results for this system have been demonstrated using helium, air and carbon dioxide gases...|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} a label-free immunosensor {{for the detection of}} aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1). CD-trodes (electrodes obtained from <b>recordable</b> <b>compact</b> <b>disks)</b> were used as low-cost and disposable transducers after modification with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of lipoic acid. The anti-aflatoxin B 1 antibody was immobilized via EDC/NHS activation, followed by blocking with bovine serum albumin and immunoassays with AFB 1. The optimization of analytical parameters and the detection were carried out using electrochemical impedance measurements. Using chemometric tools, the best conditions for the immunosensor development were defined as: anti-AFB 1 antibody at 1 : 2000 dilution and surface blocking with 0. 5 % bovine serum albumin, both incubated for 1 h, and antibody–antigen immunoreaction for 30 min. The impedimetric immunosensor showed a linear range from 5 × 10 − 9 to 1 × 10 − 7 mol·L− 1 (1. 56 – 31. 2 ng·mL− 1), limit of detection and limit of quantification, respectively, 3. 6 × 10 − 10 and 1. 1 × 10 − 9 mol·L− 1 (0. 11 and 0. 34 ng·mL− 1). The proposed immunosensor was applied to analyze peanut samples...|$|R

40|$|A surface plasmon {{resonance}} {{sensor array}} {{based upon a}} grating substrate was developed {{for the detection of}} biomolecular interactions. The substrate consisted of a gold grating prepared by wet chemical treatment of a commercial <b>recordable</b> <b>compact</b> <b>disk.</b> A custom-built floating pin microspotter was constructed to deliver solutions containing ω-functionalized linear alkanethiols to the grating surface and produce an array of sensor elements with different exposed functional end groups. This array platform can be used to study biomolecular interactions in a label-free, sensitive, and high-throughput format. To illustrate the performance of this device, a test protein (bovine serum albumin) was exposed to sensor elements containing an array of functionalized alkanethiols possessing either activated carboxylic acid-, amine-, or hydroxyl-terminated regions. Local changes in plasmon resonance were monitored in a fixed-angle imaging configuration. Plasmon images clearly distinguish the degree of protein attachment at the various surfaces. The molecular binding events on the grating were also confirmed by ellipsometry. This grating-based SPR imaging platform represents a simple and robust method for performing label-free, high-sensitivity, and high-throughput detection of biomolecular interactions...|$|E
