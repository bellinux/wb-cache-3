25|$|Minimal transvalvular {{pressure}} gradient – Whenever a fluid flows through a restriction, {{such as a}} valve, a {{pressure gradient}} arises over the restriction. This pressure gradient {{is a result of}} the increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> through the restriction. Natural heart valves have a low transvalvular pressure gradient as they present little obstruction to the flow through themselves, normally less than 16 mmHg. A desirable characteristic of heart valve prostheses is that their transvalvular pressure gradient is as small as possible.|$|E
25|$|Free-flow diving helmets {{avoid the}} dead space problem by {{supplying}} far more air than the diver can use, and eliminating the oro-nasal compartment. This makes the whole {{interior of the}} helmet effectively fresh air, as it is adequately flushed during and after each exhalation {{at the cost of}} significantly higher gas usage in open circuit systems. This also minimises work of breathing increases due to breathing apperatus <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow,</b> making freeflow helmets particularly suitable for applications where severe exertion may be required.|$|E
25|$|The up {{and down}} {{fluctuation}} of the arterial pressure results from the pulsatile nature of the cardiac output, i.e. the heartbeat. Pulse pressure {{is determined by the}} interaction of the stroke volume of the heart, the compliance (ability to expand) of the arterial system—largely attributable to the aorta and large elastic arteries—and the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> in the arterial tree. By expanding under pressure, the aorta absorbs some of the force of the blood surge from the heart during a heartbeat. In this way, the pulse pressure is reduced from what it would be if the aorta were not compliant. The loss of arterial compliance that occurs with aging explains the elevated pulse pressures found in elderly patients.|$|E

25|$|During each heartbeat, blood {{pressure}} varies between a maximum (systolic) and a minimum (diastolic) pressure. The {{blood pressure}} in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart. Differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> presented by the blood vessels. Mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood {{moves away from the}} heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy. Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation, although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles. Gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces (e.g., during standing), and valves in veins, breathing, and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence {{blood pressure in}} veins.|$|E
25|$|Exhaust valves are {{necessary}} to prevent the diver inhaling water, and to allow a negative pressure difference to be induced over the diaphragm to control the demand valve. The exhaust valves should operate at a very small pressure difference, and cause as little <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> as reasonably possible, without being cumbersome and bulky. Elastomer mushroom valves serve the purpose adequately, though duckbill valves were also common in twin-hose regulators. Where {{it is important to}} avoid leaks back into the regulator, such as when diving in contaminated water, a system of two sets of valves in series can reduce the risk of contamination. A more complex option which can be used for surface supplied helmets, is to use a reclaim exhaust system which uses a separate flow regulator to control the exhaust which is returned to the surface in a dedicated hose in the umbilical.|$|E
2500|$|Fluid {{friction}} occurs between fluid layers {{that are}} moving relative to each other. This internal <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> is named viscosity. In everyday terms, the viscosity of a fluid {{is described as}} its [...] "thickness". Thus, water is [...] "thin", having a lower viscosity, while honey is [...] "thick", having a higher viscosity. The less viscous the fluid, the greater its ease of deformation or movement.|$|E
40|$|Water {{relations}} in cotton plants infected with Phymatotrichum omnivorum were studied {{to determine the}} mechanism of wilt development. Relationships between leaf water and osmotic potentials, relative water contents, and diffusive resistances of leaves from diseased and waterstressed healthy plants were similar, indicating that wilting was not due to changes in leaf osmotic regulation. Rates of recovery from wilting, measured as increases in relative water content with time in both diseased and waterstressed healthy plants were identical. There {{was no significant difference}} in root dry weight of healthy and diseased plants, indicating that wilting is not a consequence of reduced root area. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> water <b>flow</b> in roots and lower stems increased significantly over those of healthy plants as upper leaves of diseased plants began <b>to</b> wilt. However, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> water <b>flow</b> in petioles of diseased plants was unchanged. These results show that wilting in cotton plants is probably the consequence of increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> water <b>flow</b> in roots. Results of a preliminary study indicate that a high-molecular-weight substance produced by the fungus in culture may cause blockage of xylem elements in roots and lower stems and contribute <b>to</b> the increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> water <b>flow...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Systemic {{vascular}} resistance: {{the higher}} the resistance to blood flow, {{the higher the}} arterial pressure upstream needs to be to maintain flow. In simple terms, resistance is related to vessel radius by the Hagen-Poiseuille's equation [...] (resistance∝1/radius4, so the smaller the radius, the very much higher the resistance). Other physical factors that affect resistance include: vessel length (the longer the vessel, the higher the resistance), blood viscosity (the higher the viscosity, the higher the resistance) {{and the presence of}} an arterial stenosis (a narrow stenosis increases <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow,</b> however this increase in resistance rarely if ever increases systemic blood pressure, it decreases downstream flow). Substances called vasoconstrictors can reduce the calibre of blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure. Vasodilators (such as nitroglycerin) increase the calibre of blood vessels, thereby decreasing arterial pressure.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, biomechanic forces inside {{embryonic}} vessels {{have important}} remodelling effects. Pressure fluctuations lead to {{stress and strain}} fluctuations, which can [...] "train" [...] the vessels to bear loads later in the organism’s development. [...] The fusion of several small vessels can also generate large vessels {{in areas of the}} vascular tree where blood pressure and flow rate are larger. [...] Murray's law is a relation between the radius of parent vessels to the radius of branches which holds true for the circulatory system. This outlines the balance between the lowest <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> presented by vessel size (because large-diameter vessels exhibit a low pressure drop) and the maintenance of the blood itself as a living tissue which cannot diffuse ad infinitum. Therefore, complex branching is required to supply blood to organ systems, as diffusion alone cannot be responsible for this.|$|E
2500|$|The {{physical}} properties of a polymer are strongly {{dependent on the}} size or length of the polymer chain. For example, as chain length is increased, melting and boiling temperatures increase quickly. Impact resistance also tends to increase with chain length, as does the viscosity, or <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow,</b> of the polymer in its molten state. Melt viscosity [...] is related to polymer chain length Z roughly as [...] ~ Z3.2, so that a tenfold increase in polymer chain length results in a viscosity increase of over 1000 times. Increasing chain length furthermore tends to decrease chain mobility, increase strength and toughness, and increase the glass transition temperature (Tg). This {{is a result of}} the increase in chain interactions such as Van der Waals attractions and entanglements that come with increased chain length. These interactions tend to fix the individual chains more strongly in position and resist deformations and matrix breakup, both at higher stresses and higher temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} ability of Parkinson's {{patients}} to perform an inhalation manoeuvre correctly during an off period. Background: Due to the expected faster onset of effect compared to oral levodopa, administration of levodopa via a dry powder inhaler is an interesting alternative to oral levodopa in Parkinson's patients in an off period. During an off period, the motor function is impaired and the patient is suffering from symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. Little {{is known about the}} ability to use dry powder inhalers during an off period. We studied the inspiratory flow manoeuvre performed by Parkinson's patients in an off period. Methods: After informed consent was obtained, 13 Parkinson's patients in an off period simulated inhalation manoeuvres through a testinhaler, with 3 different <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> air <b>flow.</b> These <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> air <b>flow</b> are considered medium/high to high, according to the ERS/ISAM task force consensus statement. With the obtained flow curves, we calculated various inhalation parameters. Results: The mean PIF and its ranges were found to increase with decreasing <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> air <b>flow.</b> The average inhaled volume was > 2 L, for all three <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> air <b>flow.</b> The total inhalation time and time to PIF were found to decrease with decreasing <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> air <b>flow.</b> Twelve out of thirteen patients were able to hold their breath for at least 5 seconds after inhalation. Nine of them were able to extend the breath hold time to 10 seconds. Conclusions: Most Parkinson's patients demonstrated the ability to perform an inhalation manoeuvre that is expected to be sufficient for the successful use of a dry powder inhaler by this particular patient group...|$|R
2500|$|Commercial {{tomato ketchup}} has an additive, usually xanthan gum, {{which gives the}} {{condiment}} a pseudoplastic or [...] "shear thinning" [...] property - more commonly known as thixotropic. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added—usually 0.5%—which can {{make it difficult to}} pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (<b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flow)</b> decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.|$|E
