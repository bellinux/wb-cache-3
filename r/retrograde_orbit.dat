5|$|In 1972, Joseph Brady of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied {{irregularities}} in {{the motion of}} Halley's Comet.

However, both Marsden and PlanetX proponent P. Kenneth Seidelmann attacked the hypothesis, showing that Halley's Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material, causing changes to its own orbital trajectory, and that such a massive object as Brady's PlanetX would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets.|$|E
5|$|Neptune (30.1 AU), though {{slightly}} smaller than Uranus, is more massive (equivalent to 17 Earths) and hence more dense.

5|$|Triton {{is unique}} among all large moons in the Solar System for its <b>retrograde</b> <b>orbit</b> around its planet (i.e. it orbits in a {{direction}} opposite to the planet's rotation). Most of the outer irregular moons of Jupiter and Saturn also have retrograde orbits, as do some of Uranus's outer moons. However, these moons are all much more distant from their primaries, and are small in comparison; the largest of them (Phoebe) has only 8% of the diameter (and 0.03% of the mass) of Triton.|$|E
5|$|WASP-17b is an {{exoplanet}} in {{the constellation}} Scorpius that is orbiting the star WASP-17. Its discovery was announced on 11 August 2009. It is the first planet discovered to have a <b>retrograde</b> <b>orbit,</b> meaning it orbits in a direction counter to the rotation of its host star. This discovery challenged traditional planetary formation theory. In terms of diameter, WASP-17b is the second-largest exoplanet discovered yet, and at half Jupiter's mass, this makes it the most puffy planet known. On 3 December 2013, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope reported detecting water in {{the atmosphere of the}} exoplanet.|$|E
5|$|During its {{period of}} migration, Neptune {{is thought to}} have {{captured}} a large KBO, Triton, which is the only large moon in the Solar System with a <b>retrograde</b> <b>orbit</b> (it orbits opposite to Neptune's rotation). This suggests that, unlike the large moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy: it requires some mechanism to slow down the object enough to be caught by the larger object's gravity. A possible explanation is that Triton was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune. (Many KBOs are members of binaries. See below.) Ejection of the other member of the binary by Neptune could then explain Triton's capture. Triton is only 14% larger than Pluto, and spectral analysis of both worlds shows that their surfaces are largely composed of similar materials, such as methane and carbon monoxide. All this points to the conclusion that Triton was once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} is to {{investigate}} the possibility of habitable moons orbiting the giant planet HD 23079 b, a Jupiter-mass planet, which follows a low-eccentricity orbit in the outer region of HD 23079 's habitable zone. We show that HD 23079 b is able to host habitable moons in prograde and <b>retrograde</b> <b>orbits,</b> as expected, noting that the outer stability limit for <b>retrograde</b> <b>orbits</b> is increased by nearly 90 % {{compared to that of}} prograde orbits, a result consistent with previous generalized studies. For the targeted parameter space {{it was found that the}} outer stability limit for habitable moons varies between 0. 05236 and 0. 06955 AU (prograde orbits) and between 0. 1023 and 0. 1190 AU (<b>retrograde</b> <b>orbits)</b> depending on the orbital parameters of the Jupiter-type planet if a minimum mass is assumed. These intervals correspond to 0. 306 and 0. 345 (prograde orbits) and 0. 583 and 0. 611 (<b>retrograde</b> <b>orbits)</b> of the planet's Hill radius. Larger stability limits are obtained if an increased value for the planetary mass m_p is considered; they are consistent with the theoretically deduced relationship of m_p^{ 1 / 3 }. Finally, we compare our results to the statistical formulae of Domingos et al. (2006) [MNRAS 373, 1227], indicating both concurrence and limitations. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables; Publ.

5|$|The {{orbits of}} the Halley-type comets {{suggest that they}} were {{originally}} long-period comets whose orbits were perturbed by {{the gravity of the}} giant planets and directed into the inner Solar System. If Halley was once a long-period comet, it is likely to have originated in the Oort Cloud, a sphere of cometary bodies that has an inner edge of 20,000–50,000 AU. Conversely the Jupiter-family comets are generally believed to originate in the Kuiper belt, a flat disc of icy debris between 30 AU (Neptune's orbit) and 50 AU from the Sun (in the scattered disc). Another point of origin for the Halley-type comets was proposed in 2008, when a trans-Neptunian object with a <b>retrograde</b> <b>orbit</b> similar to Halley's was discovered, , whose orbit takes it from just outside that of Uranus to twice the distance of Pluto. It may be a member of a new population of small Solar System bodies that serves as the source of Halley-type comets.|$|E
5|$|Halley's {{orbital period}} has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its {{orbit around the}} Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, {{the point in the}} comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. (Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162°). Due to the <b>retrograde</b> <b>orbit,</b> it {{has one of the highest}} velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56km/s (157,838mph or 254,016km/h). Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it might not be the parent of that shower.|$|E

The resulting trajectories were investigated for stability in an environment that included the eccentric motion of Moon, non-spherical gravity of Earth and Moon, gravitational perturbations from Sun, Jupiter, and Venus, and the effects of radiation pressure. The results indicate that stability may be enhanced at certain resonant states within the Earth–Moon system...|$|R
