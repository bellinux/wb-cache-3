[...] westward at Hexham; [...] north at Alnwick; and [...] south at Hartlepool the explosion was heard distinctly; and for [...] out to sea. The light of the flames could be seen, reflected in the sky, [...] away at Northallerton. And whilst the report {{of the explosion}} travelled so far, people on the scene were insensible of it. They describe themselves as having been lifted from their feet and dashed down, the violence completely stunning them; and when they awoke in a stupor they had only the dim idea of a <b>rolling</b> <b>sound</b> in their ears.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} {{the sounds of}} smooth metal balls rolling over medium density fiberboard (MDF) plates. In the spectrograms of these sounds we observed gradually varying ripples. These ripples were more closely spaced for the sound generated {{in the middle of}} the plate than for the sound generated closer to the edge. Furthermore, the spacing for lower frequencies was somewhat closer than for higher frequencies. It is shown that this pattern arises from the interference between the sound directly generated at the point of contact between ball and plate, and the sound reflected at the edge of the plate. This effect was added to synthesized <b>rolling</b> <b>sounds</b> which resulted in a more natural sound. A discussion is presented concerning the perceptual relevance of this pattern...|$|R

6000|$|... "Saying that I {{would wait}} for Dambergeac in his own study, I was {{introduced}} into that apartment, and saw around me the usual furniture {{of a man in}} his station. There was, {{in the middle of the}} room, a large bureau, surrounded by orthodox arm-chairs; and there were many shelves with boxes duly ticketed; there were a number of maps, and among them a great one of the department over which Dambergeac ruled; and facing the windows, on a wooden pedestal, stood a plaster-cast of the 'Roi des Français.' Recollecting my friend's former republicanism, I smiled at this piece of furniture; but before I had time to carry my observations any farther, a heavy <b>rolling</b> <b>sound</b> of carriage-wheels, that caused the windows to rattle and seemed to shake the whole edifice of the sub-prefecture, called my attention to the court without. Its iron gates were flung open, and in rolled, with a great deal of din, a chariot escorted by a brace of gendarmes, sword in hand. A tall gentleman, with a cocked-hat and feathers, wearing a blue and silver uniform coat, descended from the vehicle; and having, with much grave condescension, saluted his escort, mounted the stair. A moment afterwards the door of the study was opened, and I embraced my friend.|$|E
60|$|There {{were many}} little knots {{and groups of}} persons in Westminster Hall: some few looking upward at its noble ceiling, and at the rays of evening light, tinted by the setting sun, which {{streamed}} in aslant through its small windows, and growing dimmer by degrees, were quenched in the gathering gloom below; some, noisy passengers, mechanics going home from work, and otherwise, who hurried quickly through, waking the echoes with their voices, and soon darkening the small door in the distance, as they passed into the street beyond; some, in busy conference together on political or private matters, pacing slowly {{up and down with}} eyes that sought the ground, and seeming, by their attitudes, to listen earnestly from head to foot. Here, a dozen squabbling urchins made a very Babel in the air; there, a solitary man, half clerk, half mendicant, paced up and down with hungry dejection in his look and gait; at his elbow passed an errand-lad, swinging his basket round and round, and with his shrill whistle riving the very timbers of the roof; while a more observant schoolboy, half-way through, pocketed his ball, and eyed the distant beadle as he came looming on. It was that time of evening when, if you shut your eyes and open them again, the darkness of an hour appears to have gathered in a second. The smooth-worn pavement, dusty with footsteps, still called upon the lofty walls to reiterate the shuffle and the tread of feet unceasingly, save when the closing of some heavy door resounded through the building like a clap of thunder, and drowned all other noises in its <b>rolling</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
6000|$|So I mused, weeping {{for very}} rage, {{but then came}} a heavy <b>rolling</b> <b>sound</b> {{overhead}}, as of moving wheeled pieces of ordnance. Thereon (so near is Hope to us in our despair) I plucked up some heart. Ere nightfall, Paris {{might be in the}} hands of the King, and all might be well. The roar and rebound of cannon overhead told me that the fighting had begun, and now I prayed with all my heart, that the Maid, as ever, might again be victorious. So I lay there, listening, and heard the great artillery bellow, and the roar of guns in answer, the shouting of men, and clang of church bells. Now and again the walls of the tower rang with the shock of a cannon-ball, once an arrow flew through the casement and shattered itself on the wall above my head. I scarce know why, but I dragged me to the place where it fell, and, put the arrow-point in my bosom. Smoke of wood and pitch darkened the light; they had come, then, to close quarters. But once more rang the rattle of guns; the whizzing rush of stones, the smiting with axe or sword on wooden barrier and steel harness, the cries of war, [...] "Mont joye St. Denis!" [...] "St. George for England!" [...] and slogans too, I heard, as [...] "Bellenden," [...] "A Home! a Home!" [...] and then I knew the Scots were there, fighting in the front. But alas, how different was the day when first I heard our own battle-cries under Orleans walls! Then I had my life and my sword in my hands, to spend and to strike; but now I lay a lonely prisoner, helpless and all but hopeless; yet even so I clashed my chains and shouted, when I heard the slogan.|$|E

40|$|Auditory {{information}} can exert {{a strong influence}} on multimodal perception. In the experiments described here, a video of a ball rolling in depth was paired {{with the sound of}} a ball rolling. The speed of the balls’ roll in the video was independently varied from the speed of the balls’ roll in the soundtrack. Total duration was held constant so that the auditory cues to speed were ongoing spectro‐temporal features of the <b>rolling</b> <b>sounds.</b> In a 2 IFC comparison, observers indicated which ball seemed to roll faster. In half of the trials the near‐threshold visual and auditory speed information was consistent, e. g., both the video and sound sped up {{between the first and second}} interval.

On the other half of the trials in which the auditory and visual information were inconsistent, performance declined accordingly...|$|R
60|$|Ethelberta, {{as she had}} intended, now went on further, and {{entering}} the nave began to inspect the sallow monuments which lined the grizzled pile. She did not perceive amid the shadows an old gentleman who had crept into the mouldy place as stealthily as a worm into a skull, and was keeping himself carefully beyond her observation. She continued to regard feature after feature till the choristers had filed in from the south side, and peals broke forth from the organ on the black oaken mass at the junction of nave and choir, shaking every cobweb in the dusky vaults, and Ethelberta's heart no less. She knew the fingers that were pressing out those <b>rolling</b> <b>sounds,</b> and knowing them, became absorbed in tracing their progress. To go towards the organ-loft {{was an act of}} unconsciousness, and she did not pause till she stood almost beneath it.|$|R
6000|$|The word {{religion}} may fairly {{be applied}} to any group of sentiments or persuasions that {{are strong enough to}} bind us to do that which we intellectually may acknowledge to be our duty, and the possession of some form of religion in this larger sense of the word is of the utmost importance to moral stability. The sentiments must be strong enough to make us ashamed at the mere thought of committing, and distressed during the act of committing any untruth, or any uncharitable act, or of neglecting what we feel to be right, in order to indulge in laziness or gratify some passing desire. So long as experience shows the religion to be competent to produce this effect, it seems reasonable to believe that the particular dogma is comparatively of little importance. But as the dogma or sentiments, whatever they be, if they are not naturally instinctive, must be ingrained in the character to produce their full effect, they should be instilled early in life and allowed to grow unshaken until their roots are firmly fixed. The consciousness of this fact makes the form of religious teaching in every church and creed identical in one important particular though its substance may vary in every respect. In subjects unconnected with sentiment, the freest inquiry and the fullest deliberation are required before it is thought decorous to form a final opinion; but wherever sentiment is involved, and especially in questions of religious dogma, about which there is more sentiment and more difference of opinion among wise, virtuous, and truth-seeking men than about any other subject whatever, free inquiry is peremptorily discouraged. The religious instructor in every creed is one who makes it his profession to saturate his pupils with prejudice. A vast and perpetual clamour arises from the pulpits of endless proselytising sects throughout this great empire, the priests of all of them crying with one consent, [...] "This is the way, shut your ears to the words of those who teach differently; don't look at their books, do not even mention their names except to scoff at them; they are damnable. Have faith in what I tell you, and save your souls!" [...] In which of these conflicting doctrines are we to place our faith if we are not to hear all sides, and to rely upon our own judgment in the end? Are we to understand that it is the duty of man to be credulous in accepting whatever the priest in whose neighbourhood he happens to reside may say? Is it to believe whatever his parents may have lovingly taught him? There are a vast number of foolish {{men and women in the}} world who marry and have children, and because they deal lovingly with their children it does not at all follow that they can instruct them wisely. Or is it to have faith in what the wisest men of all ages have found peace in believing? The Catholic phrase, [...] "quod semper quod ubique quod omnibus"--"that which has been believed at all times, in all places, and by all men"--has indeed a fine <b>rolling</b> <b>sound,</b> but where is the dogma that satisfies its requirements? Or is it, such and such really good and wise men with whom you are acquainted, and whom, it may be, you have the privilege of knowing, have lived consistent lives through the guidance of these dogmas, how can you who are many grades their inferior in good works, in capacity and in experience, presume to set up your opinion against theirs? The reply is, that it is a matter of history and notoriety that other very good, capable, and inexperienced men have led and are leading consistent lives under the guidance of totally different dogmas, and that some of them a few generations back would have probably burned your modern hero as a heretic if he had lived in their times and they could have got hold of him. Also, that men, however eminent in goodness, intellect, and experience, may be deeply prejudiced, and that their judgment in matters where their prejudices are involved cannot thenceforward be trusted. Watches, as electricians know to their cost, are liable to have their steel work accidentally magnetised, and the best chronometer under those conditions can never again be trusted to keep correct time.|$|E

60|$|One Sunday--it {{was just}} a week since the letter came--Bessie was sitting after dinner on the verandah, when her quick ears caught what she took to be the booming of heavy guns far away on the Drakensberg. She rose, and leaving the house, climbed the hill behind it. On {{reaching}} its top she stood {{and looked at the}} great solemn stretch of mountains. Away, a little to her right, was a square precipitous peak called Majuba, which was generally clothed in clouds. To-day, however, there was no mist, and {{it seemed to her that}} it was from the direction of this peak that the faint <b>rolling</b> <b>sounds</b> came floating on the breeze. But she could see nothing; the mountain seemed as tenantless and devoid of life as on the day when it first towered up upon the face of things created. Presently the sounds died away, and she returned, thinking that she must have been deceived by the echoes of some distant thunderstorm.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a search}} by James Cameron, writer and {{director}} of the 2009 film Avatar, Frommer was chosen to create a language for the Na'vi, the film's fictional alien race of sentient blue humanoid inhabitants of the moon Pandora. [...] Frommer says that his process for creating the language began with phonetics and phonology: [...] "The sound system has to be all nailed down first, so that there is consistency in the language". The morphology, syntax and vocabulary followed. Cameron had already created several dozen words that he wanted to incorporate into the new language. That gave Frommer [...] "a sense of what kinds of sounds he had in mind". Cameron also told Frommer that he [...] "wanted the language to be pleasant sounding and appealing to the audience." [...] "When you create a language, you experience the joy of <b>rolling</b> <b>sounds</b> around in your mouth, hearing unusual sounds, playing with the sounds and structural properties of language - it's a process that took about six months for the basics".|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{interactive}} approach for generating realistic physically-based sounds from rigid-body dynamic simulations. We use spring-mass systems to model each object’s local deformation and vibration, which we demonstrate {{to be an}} adequate approximation for capturing physical effects such as magnitude of impact forces, location of impact, and <b>rolling</b> <b>sounds.</b> No assumption is made about the mesh connectivity or topology. Surface meshes used for rigid-body dynamic simulation are utilized for sound simulation without any modifications. We use results in auditory perception and a novel priority-based quality scaling scheme to enable the system to meet variable, stringent time constraints in a real-time application, while ensuring minimal reduction in the perceived sound quality. With this approach, we have observed up to {{an order of magnitude}} speed-up compared to an implementation without the acceleration. As a result, we are able to simulate moderately complex simulations with upto hundreds of sounding objects at over 100 frames per second (FPS), making this technique well suited for interactive applications like games and virtual environments. Furthermore, we utilize OpenAL and EAX TM on Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 TM cards for fast hardware-accelerated propagatio...|$|R
