5|$|On January 4, 2017, {{the office}} of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo {{announced}} a plan to renovate the entire airport {{at a cost of}} $7–10 billion. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK would either see lengthened trainsets or a direct track connection to the rest of New York City's transportation system. There would also be a rebuilding the Jamaica station so that there is a direct connection to the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. There is no proposed start date for the overhaul. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the <b>Regional</b> <b>Plan</b> Association published a study in which it studied a possible direct rail link from Manhattan. In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting proposals for master plans to renovate the airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{line would}} cost $1billion, if build in its full length with a {{connection}} to the IND Queens Boulevard Line, and would stretch across , providing connections to several subway services as well as the LIRR. Another possible option would have Long Island Rail Road service restored with service to seven stations along the right-of-way, with service ending in Howard Beach. The line would serve upwards of 250,000 passengers per day and would provide access to JFK Airport from Midtown Manhattan. In February 2015, the <b>Regional</b> <b>Plan</b> Association suggested having some F trains, after running through the 63rd Street Tunnel, be rerouted to operate over the Lower Montauk Branch of the LIRR running through underserved Maspeth and Glendale and then meeting up with the Rockaway Beach Branch in Rego Park.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} little focus on {{expansion}} of the system because the system {{was in a state}} of disrepair, and funds were allocated to rebuilding and repairing the existing system. However, in the 1990s, with the system in better shape, the construction of the Second Avenue Subway was looked into again. Construction of the Second Avenue Subway started in 2007, and the first phase was completed in 2017. Since the 1990s, public officials and organizations such as the <b>Regional</b> <b>Plan</b> Association have pushed for the further expansion of the system. Projects such as the TriboroRx, a circumferential line connecting the outer boroughs, the reuse of the Rockaway Beach Branch, and the further expansion of the Second Avenue Subway have all been proposed, albeit unfunded.|$|E

5|$|By 2002, Caltrans had two {{proposals}} {{for the part}} of the widening project between East Vista Way and Mission Road: building the new highway on top of the old one, or constructing a new roadway to the south of the San Luis Rey River. Concerns arose that the TransNet local sales tax would not be extended by voters, leading to the cancellation of that project. The San Diego Association of Governments included the widening east to Bonsall in the <b>regional</b> <b>plan</b> in 2003, but indicated that the portion from Bonsall to I-15 would be dependent on the availability of funding. Residents of Fallbrook and Bonsall criticized the fact that SR76 {{was one of the few}} TransNet projects that was not to be completed by the expiration of the tax in 2008. The city of Oceanside proposed plans for grade-separated interchanges with College Boulevard and Melrose Drive in 2004, as part of a proposal to convert the expressway through Oceanside to a freeway. After complaints from residents, these proposals were tabled.|$|E
5|$|The Cross Bronx Expressway Extension and the Clearview Expressway were {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} I-78, which was to continue south from Hillside Avenue through Southeast Queens, and west across Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan to the Holland Tunnel. Under these plans, the Clearview would have been extended south to NY27 (Conduit Avenue) and the Belt Parkway, or to the Nassau Expressway and Rockaway Boulevard, in Laurelton near JFK Airport. Later plans had the Clearview ending farther east, intersecting with the Belt Parkway at its interchange with the Southern State Parkway. A 1968 proposal from the <b>Regional</b> <b>Plan</b> Association had the Clearview extension running southeast along 212th Street/Hollis Court Boulevard and Hempstead Avenue, then south along the right-of-ways of the Cross Island and Belt Parkways before ending at the Nassau Expressway. Ultimately, nearly all sections of I-78 between the Holland Tunnel and Hillside Avenue, including the Lower Manhattan Expressway, Bushwick Expressway, and the Clearview extension were cancelled by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1971. The only portion to be constructed was the short section of the Nassau Expressway near JFK Airport. This resulted in the renumbering of all of I-78 north of Hillside Avenue to I-295 on January 1, 1970.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{relationship}} between <b>regional</b> <b>planning</b> and greenways in New York State, and asks whether greenways are able to foster <b>regional</b> <b>planning.</b> Two greenways in particular are analyzed, the Hudson River Valley Greenway and the Niagara River Greenway. Interviews were conducted with municipal planners and officials of communities within the two greenway boundaries to determine how communities are interacting with greenways. Questions asked sought {{to determine whether or}} not communities were participating in <b>regional</b> <b>planning</b> efforts and if they were, if the <b>regional</b> <b>planning</b> efforts were related to the greenways in any way. Comprehensive plans for communities within the greenways were also analyzed to determine how communities were representing the greenways and <b>regional</b> <b>planning</b> in their written plans. The data collected illustrated that although the greenways are regional organizations, they do not necessarily foster <b>regional</b> <b>planning</b> because of their limited power. Communities often discuss the need to participate in <b>regional</b> <b>planning</b> efforts and cooperate with the greenways in their comprehensive plans, but this is not always the case in their day to day planning. The data collected also illustrates that the home rule policy which is so popular in New York State is a large factor in the limited amount of <b>regional</b> <b>planning</b> occurring in New York State. Recommendations are made to empower the greenways and create a regional level of governance throughout New York State that would eliminate redundancies in the state's current government system. It is believed that such a system would lead to increased <b>regional</b> <b>planning</b> throughout the state, while allowing for communities to continue planning to meet the needs of their citizens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{the past}} twenty years a major change has {{occurred}} in the structure, style, and content of <b>regional</b> <b>planning</b> and development in the United Kingdom, and especially in England. Whereas the prc- 1979 model was dictated by central government and promoted a hierarchical 'family of plans', within which comprehensive <b>regional</b> <b>plans</b> were prepared in some regions, the present system has moved towards the adoption of a greater degree of partnership. Although the <b>regional</b> <b>plans</b> produced under the present system arc frequently rudimentary, a foundation now exists for future development. Associated with the <b>regional</b> (land-use) <b>plans</b> are <b>regional</b> initiatives related to European Union Structural Funds programmes, competitiveness, transport, and housing. In moving forward to develop a more integrated and comprehensive approach to <b>regional</b> <b>planning,</b> it is important to address some of the surviving causes of the failure of <b>regional</b> <b>planning</b> in previous eras. The chief cause of failure is the absence of a settled system of regional governance and accountability...|$|R
