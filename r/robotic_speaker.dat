40|$|Abstract — Combining high-performance, sensor-rich mobile devices with simple, {{low-cost}} robotic platforms could {{accelerate the}} adoption of personal robotics in real-world environments. We present {{a case study of}} this “dumb robot, smart phone” paradigm: a <b>robotic</b> <b>speaker</b> dock and music listening com-panion. The robot is designed to enhance a human’s listening experience by providing social presence and embodied musical performance. In its initial application, it generates segment-specific, beat-synchronized gestures based on the song’s genre, and maintains eye-contact with the user. All of the robot’s computation, sensing, and high-level motion control is performed on a smartphone, {{with the rest of the}} robot’s parts handling mechanics and actuator bridging. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{makes the}} case for {{designing}} interactive robots with their expressive movement in mind. As people are highly sensitive to physical movement and spatiotemporal affordances, well-designed robot motion can communicate, engage, and offer dynamic possibilities beyond the machines ’ sur-face appearance or pragmatic motion paths. We present techniques for movement centric design, including character animation sketches, video prototyping, interactive movement explorations, Wiz-ard of Oz studies, and skeletal prototypes. To illustrate our design approach, we discuss four case studies: a social head for a robotic musician, a <b>robotic</b> <b>speaker</b> dock listening companion, a desktop telepresence robot, and a service robot performing assistive and communicative tasks. We then re-late our approach {{to the design of}} non-anthropomorphic robots and robotic objects, a design strategy that could facilitate the feasibility of real-world human-robot interaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} robotic listening compan-ionship on people’s enjoyment of music, and on {{their perception of the}} robot. We present a <b>robotic</b> <b>speaker</b> device designed for joint listening and embodied performance of the music played on it. The robot generates smoothed real-time beat-synchronized dance moves, uses nonverbal gestures for common ground, and can make and maintain eye-contact. In an experimental between-subject study (n= 67), participants listened to songs played on the speaker device, with the robot either moving in sync with the beat, moving off-beat, or not moving at all. We found that while the robot’s beat precision was not consciously detected by Ps, an on-beat robot positively affected song liking. There was no effect on overall experience enjoyment. In addition, the robot’s response caused Ps to attribute more positive human-like traits to the robot, as well as rate the robot as more similar to themselves. Notably, personal listening habits (solitary vs. social) affected agent attributions. This work points to a larger question, namely how a robot’s perceived response to an event might affect a human’s perception of the same event. I...|$|E
40|$|This {{position}} paper describes {{an approach to}} building spo-ken dialogue systems for environments containing multiple human speakers and hearers, and multiple <b>robotic</b> <b>speakers</b> and hearers. We address the issue, for robotic hearers, of whether the speech they hear is intended for them, or {{more likely to be}} intended for some other hearer. We will describe data collected during a series of experiments involving teams of multiple human and robots (and other software partici-pants), and some preliminary results for distinguishing robot-directed speech from human-directed speech. The domain of these experiments is Mars analog planetary exploration. These Mars analog field studies involve two subjects in simu-lated planetary space suits doing geological exploration with the help of 1 - 2 robots, supporting software agents, a habitat communicator and links to a remote science team. The two subjects are performing a task (geological exploration) which requires them to speak with each other while also speaking with their assistants. The technique used here is to use a prob-abilistic context-free grammar language model in the speech recognizer that is trained on prior robot-directed speech. In-tuitively, the recognizer will give higher confidence to an ut-terance if it is similar to utterances that have been directed to the robot in the past...|$|R

40|$|Electromechanical devices like Dielectric Elastomers (DEs) {{have been}} {{recently}} developed with spectacular features. They {{have been widely}} used in biomedical devices such as artificial muscles and sensors. Other use of this material is for <b>robotics,</b> loud <b>speakers,</b> and dampers in bridges. Although there are several advantages regarding the use of Dielectric Elastomers (DEs), there is still challenge on reducing the amount of voltage that it needs in order to get high strain. This challenge is solved by adding Multi-Walled Nano-Tube inside the material which will increase the dielectric constant or relative permittivity. By increasing the relative permittivity, the strain that is got from the material will also be increased. In 2015, Yu Wang started to do the experiments for DEs with MWNT inside to see how much higher strain we can get by adding those particles. In this report, those experimental data are validated by doing numerical simulation and also understanding of how other factors can be effective on increasing that strain ratio...|$|R
40|$|Dielectric {{elastomers}} (DEs) are a {{new type}} of smart materials showing promising functionalities as energy harvesting materials as well as actuating materials for potential applications such as artificial muscles, implanted medical devices, <b>robotics,</b> loud <b>speakers,</b> micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), tunable optics, transducers, sensors, and even generators due to their high electromechanical efficiency, stability, lightweight, low cost, and easy processing. Despite the advantages of DEs, technical challenges must be resolved for wider applications. A high electric field of at least 10 - 30 V/um is required for the actuation of DEs, which limits the practical applications especially in biomedical fields. We tackle this problem by introducing the multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in DEs to enhance their relative permittivity and to generate their high electromechanical responses with lower applied field level. This work presents the dielectric, mechanical and electromechanical properties of DEs filled with MWNTs. The micromechanics-based finite element models are employed to describe the dielectric, and mechanical behavior of the MWNT-filled DE nanocomposites. A sufficient number of models are computed to reach the acceptable prediction of the dielectric and mechanical responses. In addition, experimental results are analyzed along with simulation results. Finally, laser Doppler vibrometer is utilized to directly detect the enhancement of the actuation strains of DE nanocomposites filled with MWNTs. All the results demonstrate the effective improvement in the electromechanical properties of DE nanocomposites filled with MWNTs under the applied electric fields...|$|R
