40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect and mechanism of bone morphogenetic protein- 6 (BMP- 6) on the growth and maturation of mouse follicles in vitro. Preantral follicles isolated from mice were incubated with recombinant human BMP- 6 (rhBMP- 6) before analysis. BMP- 6 expression was detected by immunofluorescence and western blot. Maturation of oocytes was observed microscopically. Estradiol (E 2) and progesterone (P 4) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of steroidogenesis-related genes was detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. There was a marked increase in the preantral follicles maturation in cells incubated with 50 ng/ mL of rhBMP- 6 for eight days, compared with the control. The levels of E 2, P 4 and steroidogenesis-related genes were also significantly increased in granulosa cells and theca cells cultured for 6, 10 and 11 days, respectively. Conversely, the preantral follicle maturing rate was remarkably decreased in cells incubated with 50 ng/mL of rhBMP- 6 for day 11, accompanied with reduction in E 2, P 4 levels and steroidogenesis-related genes levels. Meanwhile, compared with the control, the maturing rate was not significantly different in cells incubated with 100 ng/mL of rhBMP- 6 for day 8 or day 11. However, the E 2 levels and its <b>relevant</b> <b>regulation</b> gene expression all increased significantly, while the P 4 content and its <b>relevant</b> <b>regulation</b> gene expression decreased. The results indicate that BMP- 6 can promote the maturation of preantral follicles in vitro in a concentration and time-dependent manner and may play a role in the regulation of steroid hormon...|$|E
30|$|Minimum age {{regulations}} are more prevalent and more restrictive than light work regulation. Hence, {{we expect a}} larger impact of their relaxation if they are binding. One rarely hears accounts of the enforcement of light work regulation, but attention is more often brought to minimum age of employment regulation. In our discussion, we do not discuss the impact of removing the restrictions on hazardous work and the worst forms of child labor that persist until older ages, {{because we do not}} have data on time allocation at older ages and generally those restrictions are on less prevalent work. The minimum age {{regulations are}} the <b>relevant</b> <b>regulation</b> for the most common types of paid employment in which children may work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} distributed, safety {{critical}} real-time systems is challenging {{due to their}} high complexity, the potentially large number of components, and complicated requirements and environment assump-tions. Our case study shows that despite those challenges, the automated formal verification of such systems is not only possible, but practicable even {{in the context of}} small to medium-sized enterprises. We considered a wireless fire alarm system and uncovered severe design flaws. For an improved design, we provided dependable verification results which in particular ensure that conformance tests for a <b>relevant</b> <b>regulation</b> stan-dard will be passed. In general we observe that if system tests are spec-ified by generalized test procedures, then verifying that a system will pass any test following these test procedures is a cost-efficient approach to improve product quality based on formal methods. ...|$|E
