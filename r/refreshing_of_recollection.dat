The use of model-based measurement <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> rejection {{was extended to}} the misinformation paradigm. I manipulated two factors, delay and feedback, that are known to influence the use <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> rejection. Recollection rejection was used to reject false suggestions in the misinformation paradigm. Manipulating delay time {{did not affect the}} acceptance of misinformation or the use <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> rejection. Warning participants about false information reduced misinformation acceptance but did not lead to increased rates <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> rejection. Collectively, these findings suggest an important role for recollection rejection in rejecting misleading suggestions about events...|$|R

40|$|What is {{conscious}} recollection? Is it {{special to}} humans or do animals have this capacity as well? What brain circuitry supports {{the kinds of}} information processing that constitute recollection? This review will outline recent evidence from studies on rodents, monkeys and humans bearing on these questions. This review focuses on a comparative approach that identified features <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> that can be studied across species, explores these elements <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> in animals, and examines in animals {{the role of the}} medial temporal areas that are critically involved in conscious recollection in humans. Substantial evidence indicates that animals exhibit all the fundamental features <b>of</b> <b>recollection,</b> that these abilities depend on the hippocampus in animals as well as humans, and that neuronal representations in the hippocampus reflect information processing fundamental to the features <b>of</b> <b>recollection.</b> In addition, the functional circuitry of the hippocampal system is largely conserved across species, and its organization suggests information processing mechanisms that support the features <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> are common across species. Aristotle (350 BC) contended that “…other animals (as well as man) have memory, but, of all that we are acquainted with, none, we venture to say, except man, shares in the faculty <b>of</b> <b>recollection.</b> ” Here Aristotle distinguishes “memory, ” as an elementary matching of current sensation...|$|R
