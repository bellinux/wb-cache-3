5|$|Meanwhile, Norwich {{railway station}} had opened in 1844. Although many Norwich {{residents}} were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the railway, and goods carriers initially found it more convenient {{to continue to}} collect goods from the coaching inns, as railway usage gradually {{increased the number of}} coaches and carts calling at the inns slowly dwindled, reducing congestion. In 1899 the Angel inn—renamed the Royal Hotel in 1840 on the occasion of Queen Victoria's wedding—finally closed, and was replaced with George Skipper's Royal Arcade, a shopping centre in the Art Nouveau style.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1968, No.79 Squadron {{no longer}} had a clear role at Ubon. The USAF had {{sufficient}} fighters based in Thailand to defend the country and was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Australian fighters—which were now regarded as obsolete—to intercept potentially hostile aircraft, as the squadron's rules of engagement did not allow it to pursue contacts that left Thai airspace. As a result, the Australian military's chiefs of staff determined that the RAAF presence in Thailand had outlived its political and military usefulness and decided to withdraw the squadron without replacement. No.79 Squadron was taken off alert status on 26July and disbanded {{at the end of the}} month. On 31March 2011 it received a battle honour for its deployment to Ubon between May 1962 and August 1968.|$|E

Assistant coach Jerry Norman convinced a <b>reluctant</b> Wooden <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the zone press, which {{the team had}} never utilized before.

5|$|Cleveland, like {{a growing}} number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which {{guaranteed}} voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.|$|E
5|$|As the {{expensive}} War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular, {{so did the}} Whig administration. The impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, a high church Tory Anglican who had preached anti-Whig sermons, led to further public discontent. Anne thought Sacheverell ought to be punished for questioning the Glorious Revolution, but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion. In London, riots broke out in support of Sacheverell, but the only troops available to quell the disturbances were Anne's guards, and Secretary of State Sunderland was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> them and leave the Queen less protected. Anne declared God would be her guard and ordered Sunderland to redeploy her troops. In line with Anne's views, Sacheverell was convicted, but his sentence—suspension of preaching for three years—was so light as to render the trial a mockery.|$|E
5|$|The League of Nations lacked {{an armed}} force {{of its own}} and {{depended}} on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do. Its two most important members, Britain and France, were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action {{on behalf of the}} League. Immediately after the First World War, pacifism became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The British Conservatives were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation. Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, {{while at the same time}} advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.|$|E
40|$|Our {{extensive}} {{research has indicated}} that high-school teachers are <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> make <b>use</b> of existing instructional educational software (Pollard, 2005). Even software developed in a partnership between a teacher and a software engineer is unlikely to be adopted by teachers outside the partnership (Pollard, 2005). In this paper we address these issues directly by adopting a reusable architectural design for instructional educational software which allows easy customisation of software to meet the specific needs of individual teachers. By doing this we will facilitate more teachers regularly using instructional technology within their classrooms...|$|R

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is seldom responsive to traditional antiemetic therapies.

5|$|Yuu is {{the protagonist}} of Charlotte. He {{develops}} a rude and narcissistic personality once he discovers {{he has the ability}} to take over another person's body for five seconds, but the true nature of his ability enables him to steal someone's superhuman ability by possessing them. Yuu is a first-year student at Hoshinoumi Academy, and he is forced to join its student council. Initially a fake honors student and chronic cheater, Yuu is <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his ability to aide the student council, but as time goes on, he becomes less narcissistic and much more selfless and caring towards others. Over the course of the story, he becomes a fan of the post-rock band Zhiend and falls in love with Nao. After Yuu travels worldwide to steal every ability user's power to protect them from being exploited, the strain of it causes him to lose all of his past memories. His older brother is Shunsuke and his younger sister is Ayumi.|$|E
5|$|The African river martin feeds in flocks over {{river and}} forest, often far from water. It eats insects, mainly taking winged ants. The flight {{is strong and}} fast, {{interspersed}} with glides. Wintering birds regularly perch on treetops, wires and roofs. The white-eyed river martin feeds on insects, including beetles, which are caught on the wing. Given its size and unusual mouth structure, it may take larger insects than other swallows. This species is described as graceful and buoyant in flight, and, like its African relative, appears <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> perches. This behaviour, together with its unusual toe-shape {{and the fact that}} mud was found on the toes of one of the first specimens, suggests that this species may be relatively terrestrial. In winter, it roosts with barn swallows in reedbeds. Pamela C. Rasmussen suggested that, given its unusually large eyes, the species might be nocturnal or crepuscular, a factor that could make it highly cryptic and thus partly explain how such a distinctive species remained undetected for so long. Although the fact that the first specimens were supposedly collected roosting at night in reed-beds might be a contraindication, {{it is possible that the}} birds might not actually have been caught at the roost; or they might be crepuscular, feeding at dawn and dusk; or they might be capable of both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour, depending on the season or local circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} mainly shot on Kodak Vision3 250D film stock. Scenes where Oscar is alive were {{shot in the}} super 35 format with Arricam LT cameras, and the rest in super 16 with an Aaton XTR Prod. The cinematographer was Benoît Debie, who also shot Irréversible. As in Irréversible, Noé was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{artificial}} lighting that would destroy the illusion if the camera was turned around. Thanks to Tokyo's many neon signs, very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes, {{despite the fact that}} many were shot late at night. For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical, in-frame light sources. Some exceptions were made. One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours, ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens. For this, Debie used a set of red, green, and blue programmable disco lights, which allowed for all different hues. The disco lights were easy to hide. They were also used for simulation of neon flashes, and to add a tint of red to the dressing-room scenes. Another exception was the use of strobe lights, which were programmed together with the coloured lights. Blue colour was avoided throughout, since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams. Noé was the film's camera operator, except for a few shots of Oscar running in the streets, as they required a taller cameraman. In those scenes, the camera was held by Debie.|$|E

5000|$|The Chancery {{commission}} (1824-26) made {{recommendations on}} streamlining procedure but the commissioners {{concluded that the}} Chancery courts themselves had the powers to improve matters. [...] Over the following decades there was much debate leading to legislation including the Improvement of the Jurisdiction of Equity Act 1852 which allowed Chancery judges to decide questions of fact rather than remitting them to the common law courts. However, by 1862, Chancery judges were still <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> make <b>use</b> of these powers so Attorney General Sir John Rolt introduced a bill to make determination of facts by Chancery judges mandatory.|$|R
5000|$|Montgomery {{considered}} that the US forces should use them. A {{third of the}} [...] "funnies" [...] were offered to the Americans of all the vehicles available, but take-up was minimal. Eisenhower was in favour of the Duplex drive (DD) amphibious tanks but left the decision on the others to General Bradley. None of the other designs were used, because {{it was thought that}} they required specialised training and an additional support organisation. Also, the Americans were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> make <b>use</b> of funnies based on the Churchill tank as they did not want the logistical complexity of adding another tank model to their inventory.|$|R

25|$|In many states, {{officials}} were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> black militia against the Klan {{out of fear}} that racial tensions would be raised. Republican Governor of North Carolina William Woods Holden called out the militia against the Klan in 1870, adding to his unpopularity. This and extensive violence and fraud at the polls caused the Republicans to lose their majority in the state legislature. Disaffection with Holden's actions led to white Democratic legislators' impeaching him and removing him from office, but their reasons were numerous.|$|E
25|$|Violations {{of trade}} treaty {{obligations}} by Austria were considered by Napoleon to be insufficient grounds for a war. There was discussion {{of whether the}} presence of an Austrian military garrison in Bologna might justify war against Austria, but the French emperor was in the end <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this as a pretext. There were Austrian troops not only in Bologna but also in Rome preserving the status quo, but in Rome there were also French troops for broadly similar reasons, and parallels between the garrisoning of Bologna and of Rome were uncomfortably close.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his early}} career, Takemitsu had been <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> make <b>use</b> of {{traditional}} Japanese music in his compositions, {{as he said}} this music [...] "always recalled the bitter memories of war". He began experimenting with traditional Japanese instruments in the early 1960s, using them in the soundtrack to Masaki Kobayashi's 1962 film, Harakiri. Other film soundtracks in which Takemitsu used traditional instruments include Shinoda's Assassination and Masaki Kobayashi's Kwaidan (both 1964). Takemitsu's first concert composition for traditional Japanese musical instruments was Eclipse (1966) for the biwa performer, Kinshi Tsuruta, and the shakuhachi player, Katsuya Yokoyama. When Seiji Ozawa played Leonard Bernstein a tape of Eclipse, Bernstein suggested combining the instruments in a composition with the western orchestra.|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{there have been a}} number of {{newspaper}} reports about students in Guangzhou being punished for speaking Cantonese in school and even outside the classroom. One elementary school in Yuexiu, Guangzhou reportedly requires students to speak Mandarin not only in classes but also during their spare time, and threatens to deduct points from their records if they fail to comply. This has caused some children <b>to</b> become <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> learn and <b>use</b> Cantonese or unable to understand or communicate in Cantonese at times.|$|R
40|$|In the 1960 s Percy Trezise {{integrated}} his {{rock art}} {{research in the}} Laura region, Cape York Peninsula, with recording Indigenous cultural knowledge and life stories. Since then, archaeologists have been <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> make <b>use</b> of this ethnographic information. This paper explores {{the issue in the}} light of current models of Aboriginal society and history for southern Cape York Peninsula. When viewed in these contexts the authenticity of Trezise's ethnohistoric and ethnographic records is validated. Gaps and ambiguities in the Trezise records may result from cross-cultural issues and the deeply esoteric nature of Aboriginal art and its connection to ancestral law. The judicious use of ethnography is recommended as a complementary method in Laura rock art studies. Trezise's primary records may provide further clarity...|$|R
25|$|De Camp had {{the mind}} of an educator, and a common theme in many of his works is a {{corrective}} impulse regarding similar previous works by other authors. A highly rational and logical thinker, he was frequently disturbed by what he regarded as logical lapses and absurdities in others' writings. Some, like Asimov, felt de Camp's conscientiousness about facts limited the scope of his stories: de Camp was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> technological or scientific concepts (e.g., hyperspace or faster-than-light travel) {{if he did not}} think them possible. Thus, his response to Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court was to write a similar time travel novel (Lest Darkness Fall) in which the method of time travel was rationalized and the hero's technical expertise both set at a believable level and constrained by the technological limitations of the age.|$|E
25|$|Planned reuse of {{reclaimed}} {{water from}} Greater Irbid in the Jordan Valley. A major water reuse project is being planned to reuse water from three {{wastewater treatment plants}} {{in the area of}} Irbid in the North of Jordan through a project supported in the framework of Jordanian-German cooperation. As of 2006, only 14% of the wastewater from these plants was being reused. An explanation for this is that farmers in the Jordan Valley are <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the reclaimed water, which they perceive to be of poor quality, for irrigation. The wastewater thus flows into the Jordan River, unused. In the future, the treated effluent from the three plants will flow through a pipe into the Jordan Valley, generating hydropower from the elevation differential of more than 1,000m. It will then be mixed with freshwater and delivered to the farmers in a quality that is acceptable to them.|$|E

As against the actual income tax rate of 5% {{on the value of}} bonus shares, the government has told the IMF that it levied a 10% tax, which will generate revenue equal to 0.1% of gross domestic product or Rs. 29billion. On 27 March 2016, around 2,000 far-right protesters led by Sunni Tehreek staged a sit-in at D-Chowk in front of the parliament in Islamabad, causing a partial halt to the capital city. The protestors demanded the implementation of Sharia in the country and declaring Mumtaz Qadri a martyr. The protestors also burned down cars and city main public transit station and injured journalists and bystanders. The government on the 28th called in the army to control the law and order. By 29th the crowd had shrunk to 700 protestors, however the government remained <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> force against the protesters. On 30 March 2016, the protesters ended their protest after government assured not to amend in blasphemy laws. On 7 April 2016, The Express Tribune in an editorial claimed that Sharif's multibillion-rupee health insurance plan seems to be failing already because of poor planning, claiming that the basic health infrastructure doesn't allow for such a plan.|$|E
50|$|The engine's {{vacuum brake}} {{cylinders}} were fitted outside the main frames under the running boards on each side, between {{the second and}} third pairs of coupled wheels. The vacuum brake operated automatically whenever the train brakes were applied. The use of vacuum braking instead of steam braking became standard practice on locomotives built from 1944 onwards and was welcomed by SAR drivers, who were always <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> make <b>use</b> of steam brakes for fear of skidding the coupled wheels. In practice, the trigger on the steam brake attachment to isolate the proportional device which admitted steam to the brake cylinder automatically upon the application of the vacuum brake, was invariably wedged down with a wooden peg by drivers to eliminate the steam brake entirely.|$|R

25|$|In series three (2009), Sarah makes a new {{enemy in}} the body {{stealing}} alien Androvax (Mark Goldthorp), {{as well as an}} ally {{in the form of the}} interplanetary police force, the Judoon (from Doctor Who). In the second two-parter, Sarah Jane is able to recover K-9 full-time (reflecting a real-world deal struck with the creators of the children's series K-9). In a crossover with the parent show, Sarah reveals her intention to marry her secret fiancé, barrister Peter Dalton, in The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith. However, Dalton's involvement in Sarah's life proves to be a scheme of the Trickster. The Tenth Doctor (Tennant) wedding-crashes to foil the Trickster's plot to make Sarah give up on alien hunting, and explains to Sarah that the Trickster is a powerful former member of the extra-dimensional so-called Pantheon of Discord. The serial clarifies that Sarah owes her independent wealth to her Aunt Lavina's will. In 'Sarah-lite' two-parter Mona Lisa's Revenge, Sarah and Luke have their first argument as he progresses into his teenage years; they argue about the cleanliness of Luke's room. In series finale The Gift, though she is <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> weapons or cause harm, when Luke falls deathly sick for the first time ever to Slitheen cousins the Blathereen, Sarah takes up arms to confront them. In the episode's conclusion, she regretfully is forced to kill them using Mr Smith. Sarah Jane next appears in the Tenth Doctor two-part Doctor Who finale, The End of Time, in 2010. When the Doctor is slowly dying from radiation poisoning, he makes timely visits to his close friends and companions; the Doctor saves Luke's life from an oncoming car on Bannerman Road, and bids a silent farewell to Luke and to Sarah Jane.|$|E
