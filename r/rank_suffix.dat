5000|$|Officers {{during the}} Civil War {{from the state}} forces were known by the <b>rank</b> <b>suffix</b> [...] "of volunteers"; if Regular Army, these {{officers}} were known by the <b>rank</b> <b>suffix</b> [...] "USA". Thus, a state regiment colonel would be known as [...] "colonel of volunteers" [...] while a Regular Army captain would be known as [...] "Captain, USA". Regular Army officers of the Civil War could accept commissions in volunteer forces and could also be granted brevet ranks (higher ranks than the permanent commission). In some cases, officers held {{as many as four}} ranks: a permanent rank (called [...] "full rank") in the Regular Army, a full rank in the volunteers, and brevet ranks in both as a result of battlefield promotion, meritorious service or Congressional action. The officers typically would only refer to themselves by the highest rank they held. An example is Union Army officer James Henry Carleton who was a [...] "full" [...] captain, a brevet major in the regular army, a colonel of volunteers, and a brevet brigadier general.|$|E
5000|$|... {{internal}} service <b>ranks</b> (<b>suffixed</b> with [...] "of {{internal service}}" [...] - in general such personnel wear the Russian military uniform) - for the personnel of MVD, Ministry of Emergency Situations and civil defense, Peneciary {{service on the}} service of: fire guard, migration service, administrative function and other.|$|R

5000|$|After the Civil War {{ended in}} 1865, the term Regular Army {{was used to}} denote an officer's {{permanent}} rank only when a brevet commission had also been received. Such {{was the case with}} George Custer who was a brevet major general of volunteers and a brevet Regular Army brigadier general while holding the permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army. If no brevet rank was held, the officer was simply referred to by his permanent <b>rank</b> and the <b>suffix</b> [...] "USA". Enlisted personnel could not hold brevet ranks and were all considered simply as United States Army personnel.|$|R
50|$|Militsiya {{personnel}} ranks mostly follow {{those of}} the Army - from private (Rus: ryadovoy), which is the lowest rank, to colonel general - with only these exceptions: there are no ranks of Army General and Marshal. Detectives (Russian: operativnik short for operativniy rabotnik) hold a rank of lieutenant at least and could be promoted to major or the lieutenant colonel. The militsiya of an oblast (or other equivalent subnational entity) is usually headed by a general. The <b>rank</b> name is <b>suffixed</b> with of militsiya (e.g. major of militsiya for a major). Militsiya personnel carry firearms, but {{are not permitted to}} carry their weapons when they are off duty.|$|R
5000|$|The suffix -man had {{the meaning}} [...] "person" [...] in Old English (see man), but in present-day English it is {{predominantly}} masculine. Thus job titles that include this suffix, such as fireman, salesman and alderman, generally {{imply that the}} holder is male. While some of these job titles have feminine variants (e.g. alderwoman), others do not, because traditionally the positions in question were not occupied by women. For most such titles, gender-neutral equivalents now also exist, such as police officer (for policeman or policewoman), salesperson or sales representative (for salesman or saleswoman), etc. However, some proposed gender-neutral terms have not attained such common usage (as with fisher {{as an alternative to}} fisherman). Military <b>ranks</b> with the <b>suffix</b> -man normally remain unchanged when applied to females: for example, a woman serving in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers might be known as Craftsman Atkins.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{several types}} of internal queries: questions about subwords of a text. As the main tool we develop an optimal data structure for the problem called here internal pattern matching. This data structure provides constant-time answers to queries about occurrences of one subword x in another subword y of a given text, assuming that |y|=O(|x|), which allows for a constant-space representation of all occurrences. This problem {{can be viewed as}} a natural extension of the well-studied pattern matching problem. The data structure has linear size and admits a linear-time construction algorithm. Using the solution to the internal pattern matching problem, we obtain very efficient data structures answering queries about: primitivity of subwords, periods of subwords, general substring compression, and cyclic equivalence of two subwords. All these results improve upon the best previously known counterparts. The linear construction time of our data structure also allows to improve the algorithm for finding δ-subrepetitions in a text (a more general version of maximal repetitions, also called runs). For any fixed δ we obtain the first linear-time algorithm, which matches the linear time complexity of the algorithm computing runs. Our data structure has already been used as a part of the efficient solutions for subword <b>suffix</b> <b>rank</b> & selection, as well as substring compression using Burrows-Wheeler transform composed with run-length encoding.
