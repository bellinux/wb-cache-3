5|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} provide larval {{and juvenile}} fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for <b>restocking</b> waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1941, just as ASO {{units were}} finding their feet, {{a large number}} of {{personnel}} and aircraft were sent to Malta (and the Desert Air Force) to interdict Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps supplies from Italy to North Africa. Adding to the problem was a shortage of materials and testing facilities. <b>Restocking</b> squadrons and re-equipping them was slow. Not until 1942 did the ASO squadrons get the recognition needed, {{in the wake of the}} German Operation Cerberus. Maintenance was also poor. Each service was to maintain an operational ready rate of 70 to 75 percent. In Coastal Command it was 40, and not much higher in others at that point. Greater emphasis was made and serviceability increased.|$|E
25|$|By November25, focus {{had shifted}} to {{rebuilding}} lost livelihoods, including the <b>restocking</b> of livestock. To this end, the Puntland government distributed around 15,887 heads of livestock in December {{to hundreds of}} pastoralist households affected by the storm. According to Puntland officials, the Bosaso and Galkayo airports' runways were also undergoing repair work.|$|E
30|$|The cleared areas should {{immediately}} be <b>restocked</b> {{with native}} woody and grassy vegetation to prevent new invasions as abandoned and unused areas are preferred colonization grounds for P. juliflora. Hence, <b>restocked</b> native woody and grassy vegetation or a cropping field, e.g. a dense maize field, will prevent P. juliflora from spreading.|$|R
30|$|An {{estimate}} of the annual herbicide inputs for New Zealand plantation forests was made using two sources of information. Results from the survey were used to define typical use of herbicides. This information was combined with data from the New Zealand Forest Owners Association ([URL] accessed February 2013) that quantified the <b>restocked</b> and newly planted area. For the estimation of annual herbicide use, it was assumed that: 1) average annual <b>restocked</b> and newly planted area is 50, 000  ha (based on the average calculated for the period 2001 to 2009), 2) all newly planted and <b>restocked</b> areas get an aerial pre-plant spray and first-year post-plant control (release), 3) first-year release operation is 40 % aerial and 60 % spot weed control, and 4) 50 % of the <b>restocked</b> and newly planted area receives repeat aerial release between year 2 and year 4.|$|R
40|$|As planted forests {{mature and}} are clearfelled in patches, second {{rotation}} tree crops (<b>restocks)</b> become available to black grouse, {{a species of}} conservation concern in the UK. Currently, only a limited amount {{is known about the}} resources provided by this habitat to black grouse and their broods. The aims of this study therefore, were to investigate the recovery of field-layer vegetation and the invertebrate population from <b>restock</b> through to canopy closure of planted trees, assess the duration of habitat availability and food resources to black grouse, and understand how forest management could improve provision. Changes to the abundance of predators resulting from habitat management were also considered. The comparative habitat quality of <b>restocks</b> was assessed in a wider landscape context. Field-layer vegetation in 72 <b>restocks</b> in two afforested areas in the north-east and the south-west of the Scottish Highlands was surveyed. On average, only 60...|$|R
25|$|The {{most popular}} {{freshwater}} game fish are trout, bream, bass, and catfish, {{all but the}} last of which are produced in state hatcheries for <b>restocking.</b> Popular saltwater game fish include red drum, spotted seatrout, flounder, and tarpon. Porpoises, whales, shrimp, oysters, and blue crabs are found inshore and offshore of the Georgia coast.|$|E
25|$|General Manager Theo Epstein's {{first major}} step toward <b>restocking</b> {{the team for}} 2007 was to pursue {{one of the most}} {{anticipated}} acquisitions in recent history. On November 14, Major League Baseball announced that the Red Sox had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese superstar pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka. Boston placed a bid of $51.1 million, and had 30 days to complete a deal. On December 13, just before the deadline, Matsuzaka signed a 6-year, $52 million contract.|$|E

25|$|By 1987, {{water quality}} had {{improved}} sufficiently to try <b>restocking</b> the upper river, and {{large numbers of}} yearling trout were released into the river in April. A fish survey {{carried out by the}} Yorkshire Water Authority a year later showed that many of these were surviving. By 1992, there was evidence that the fish were breeding in the river, and naturally bred brown trout were found between Denby Dale and Clayton West in 1994, {{for the first time in}} over 100 years. The trout population in the upper Dearne was declared to be self-sustaining by 1996.|$|E
25|$|Discharges {{from the}} Darton sewage {{treatment}} works contained residues from dyes {{used by a}} local carpet manufacturer, which reached the works by a foul sewer, but could not be adequately treated by the existing processes. As a result, the final effluent was a deep red colour, and was {{a major factor in}} the poor biochemical oxygen demand ratings for the river. Major improvements, including new primary settlement tanks and tertiary treatment lagoons, were made to the treatment works, and the carpet manufacturers installed facilities to treat their effluent before it was discharged to the sewer. By 1994, fish were again appearing below the Star Paper Mill weir, and Yorkshire Water and the Environment Agency carried out another fish <b>restocking</b> programme.|$|E

25|$|From the 1880s {{the water}} quality {{deteriorated}} rapidly, {{as a result of}} coal mining and its associated communities. The river became unable to sustain life, and by 1974, was the most polluted of the rivers within the River Don catchment. The pollutants came from coking plants, from inefficient sewage treatment plants, and from the manufacture of chemicals. Major investment in upgrading the sewage treatment works took place, and in the treatment of industrial effluent before it was discharged to the river. The closure of the main coking plants has also aided the recovery of the river, and enabled <b>restocking</b> with fish to begin in 1994. By 1996 there was evidence for self-sustaining fish populations, and that the river could support organised angling.|$|E
25|$|Valley Forge was {{slated for}} {{overhaul}} and was heading towards its base in San Diego when Hoskins was notified of the Second Phase Offensive {{launched in the}} last week of November by the Chinese Army in support of the North Korean effort. After arriving on the west coast of the U.S. on December 1, Hoskins was directed to resupply and steam back to Korea as soon as possible. Valley Forge spent five days <b>restocking</b> and embarking a new air group. She departed for Korea on December 6, arrived on the 22nd, and began air operations in support of the UN retreat the next day. By the time Valley Forge ended its second deployment in March 1951, its air groups had flown 2,580 sorties and dropped another 1,500 tons of ordnance.|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and <b>restocking).</b> Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, water mint, Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|E

25|$|The river below Clayton West {{ceases to}} be a shallow, fast-flowing watercourse, and {{consists}} of deeper pools with a slower flow, which is suitable for various coarse fish as well as trout. By 1974, a modest improvement in water quality had been achieved by treatment of industrial effluent, and some fish managed to exist below the weir at the Star Paper Mill in Barnsley. The weir helped to oxygenate the water, {{and most of the}} fish had been washed downstream from Cannon Hall and Bretton Lakes. During flood conditions, many of the population would be washed further downstream, to be replaced by others from the lakes. A survey in 1982 found gudgeon, minnow and three-spined stickleback, which had increased by 1985, and over 10,000 coarse fish were released as part of a <b>restocking</b> programme. However, most of these were killed by serious pollution incidents that affected the river in 1987 and 1988, and incidents continued for a further three years. The sewage treatment works at Darton and Lundwood, on either side of Barnsley, were largely responsible.|$|E
25|$|Some {{benefits}} from the piracy have also been noted. In the earlier years of the phenomenon in 2008, {{it was reported that}} many local residents in pirate hubs such as Harardhere appreciated the rejuvenating effect that the pirates' on-shore spending and <b>restocking</b> had on their small towns, a presence which often provided jobs and opportunity when there were comparatively fewer. Entire hamlets were in the process reportedly transformed into boomtowns, with local shop owners and other residents using their gains to purchase items such as generators for uninterrupted electricity. However, the election of a new administration in 2009 in the northeastern Puntland region saw a sharp decrease in pirate operations, as the provincial authorities launched a comprehensive anti-piracy campaign and established an official maritime police force (PMPF). Since 2010, pirates have mainly operated from the Galmudug region to the south. According to the Somalia Report, the significant infrastructural development evident in Puntland's urban centers has also mainly come from a combination of government development programs, internal investment by local residents returning to their home regions following the civil war in the south, and especially remittance funds sent by the sizable Somali diaspora. The latter contributions have been estimated at around $1.3–$2 billion a year, exponentially dwarfing pirate ransom proceeds, which total only a few million dollars annually and are difficult to track in terms of spending.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{presents}} a different problem, as the mines have been abandoned, but the pollution continues. Near Penistone, ochre discharged {{into the river}} from old ganister mine workings, giving it an orange colour for about six miles, eventually remedied, while at Beeley Wood, the ochre comes from a pile of waste metal on the river bank. A nearby paper mill {{has also been a}} significant polluter of the river. Some of the problem has been mitigated by the construction of lagoons, into which mine discharges have been diverted. Water quality on the Dearne and the Rother has not improved as much as on the Don, and pollution of the lower reaches is {{compounded by the fact that}} the pollutants, which include dioxins, are locked up in the river bed sediments. Despite the steady improvement in water quality, <b>restocking</b> of the river with fish, attempted on several occasions between 1981 and 1994, was largely ineffective, caused by intermittent discharges of pollutants. In November 2011, the Environment Agency announced that they had recently re-stocked the Don with 1,000 barbel. A spokesman said that the fish in the river were now at a sustainable level with a breeding population and these would be the last fish added as part of a 10-year programme to help the Don recover from an industrial heritage that had depleted fish stocks.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} attractions of the bank is the Crocodile Conservation Center. It is the largest {{breeding}} center of crocodiles in India and has bred thousands of crocodiles since its inception. The captive breeding program at the crocodile bank was so successful that by the 1990s there were over 8,000 crocodiles in residence, thousands had been reintroduced to the wild, and more sent to zoos and wildlife parks around the world. The CrocBank has supplied crocodile eggs, snakes, water monitors, lizards and iguanas for breeding programs and for exhibits. The bank also provides surplus reptiles for transferring to other zoos and exchange programs. Since 1976, over 1,500 crocodiles and several hundred eggs have been supplied to various state forest departments for <b>restocking</b> programmes in the wild and for setting up breeding facilities in other states in India and neighboring countries. All three of the original species that were bred at the bank (the mugger, the gharial and the saltwater crocodile) remain endangered, while the gharial is critically endangered and now faces extinction. The CrocBank also successfully breeds several species of threatened turtles, including two listed as critically endangered. The bank is a coordinating zoo of the Central Zoo Authority of India for the breeding programmes for endangered species, including rock python, king cobra and Ganges softshell turtle, as per the National Zoo Policy adopted by the Government of India in 1988. The National Zoo Policy (1998) states several objectives that zoos should pursue including education, publications, and breeding rare and endangered species. In 2010, the bank also bred the rare Tomistoma crocodile, {{which is in the}} Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} islands {{have been named}} after the bird. The island of Lundy in the United Kingdom is reputed to derive {{its name from the}} Norse lund-ey or [...] "puffin island".
