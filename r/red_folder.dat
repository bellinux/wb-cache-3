40|$|Three Trade Epitaphs’ was Christopher Wakeling's fourth annual {{contribution}} to the special edition. This piece is hand-set and printed in 10 point Univers 55 along with progressive sizes of Monotype Placard types. The printings are in black, white, red, blue and grey inks on Zerkall mould-made paper. It consists of three loose sheets printed one side, inserted into a <b>red</b> cover <b>folder</b> printed with white woodletter (Three | Trade | EPITAPHS). Finished size: 48 picas by 50 picas. Each epitaph is an ode to a former printing trade craftsman: Letterfounder, Compositor and Pressman. The short verses are extracted from The Trade, privately published in 1943 to ‘beneft the funds of the Printers’ Pension, Almshouse and Orphan Asylum Corporation’. Each is a personal typographical experiment exploring {{the relationship between the}} printed text and the ‘white’, non-printed space of the optical square format. All punctuation was removed from the original verses so that variable word space, together with line and page arrangement could be explored as a means of enhancing or re-enforcing the textural meaning and its grammatical sense. The natural rhythmical pattern of each ode forms the root for the linear vertical arrangement of the texts. Loose inserted with a small imprint card printed in red and black announcing its inclusion for ‘Parenthesis’ subscribers...|$|R

O'Brian deduces that the story continues in Archangel and makes plans for them to travel. When O'Brian leaves the room, Kelso and Zinaida plot to leave him behind and travel to Archangel together.|$|E

They go to a place and get out of the van to see Ainhoa wearing a wedding dress and the captain asks where the groom is. We then see an image of Ulysses enjoying the sea, wearing a white shirt, showing he's the groom. Then voiceovers from Ainhoa and Ulysses begin to tell the ending: [...] "Because no atomic bomb, {{particle}} accelerator (can destroy love). Neither can four shots to the chest nor a well-intentioned lie." [...] Ramiro gets with Estela. Captain Montero and Dr. Julia decide to have another child, which make it that Valeria is no longer the youngest. Vilma marries Cho. Cho speaks to the child in Korean and Vilma in Spanish which will lead the child to have a funny accent. Piti became a caretaker and godfather to Cho and Vilma's child. Mouse's grandfather, Mr. Ventura, died with a smile on his face and was deeply missed by everyone. Mouse is adopted by Max, who says [...] "he wants to be just like him."
