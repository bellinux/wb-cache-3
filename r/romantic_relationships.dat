5|$|Attachment {{theory was}} {{extended}} to adult <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles of attachment {{have been identified in}} adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} debates on how birth order (only born, first born, second born, middle born, and last born) {{can have an}} effect on personality. Equally important, McGlade (2008) {{suggested}} that there is a moderate relationship between personality and <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction. Thus, to put in other words, birth order might lay either a direct or indirect effect on <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction. Nevertheless, <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction cannot be predicted efficiently based on the birth order of a particular partner,for a <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> is undeniably a mutual relationship that involves two parties. Therefore, birth order combination of a couple should be given emphasis (Leman, 2009). Hence, the current study attempts to study the relationship between birth order, personality, and <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction. A sample of 100 participants from UTAR was recruited to conduct this study. The present study found that {{there was no significant difference}} in personality among participants of different birth order. Likewise, no significant difference in <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction was found among participants with various birth order combinations. However, there were significant weak to moderate correlations between certain Big Five personality traits and <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction...|$|R

According to surveys of the recent 20 years, there are actually few people in China who never experience <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> during Junior High and Senior High. Most people may have unrequited love, and a mutual <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> takes place only when the two adolescents like each other. However, in China, most parents, who are conservative, and educators supporting examination-based education claim that zaolian will bring many problems such as it will affect students' study ability and examination marks, or that zaolian relationship will almost always split in the end.|$|R

5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts {{strain on}} marriages and other <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships,</b> {{which in turn}} has {{important}} implications for quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E

40|$|Three self-disclosure {{variables}} {{have been}} associated with <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction: (1) personal self-disclosure, (2) partner self-disclosure, and (3) the difference between the two. This study re-examines the relation between each of these self-disclosure variables and males 2 ̆ 7 and females 2 ̆ 7 <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction. This study also provides answers to two novel questions: (1) which self-disclosure variable best predicts males 2 ̆ 7 <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction, and (2) which best predicts females 2 ̆ 7 <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction. Participants were 124 heterosexual couples who completed the following four measures: the Background Inventory, the Self-Disclosure Index, the Dyadic Satisfaction Subscale, and the Relationship Assessment Scale. Results indicated that only two of the three self-disclosure variables (viz., personal self-disclosure and partner self-disclosure) predicted <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction. Although these variables were found to be equally good predictors of females 2 ̆ 7 <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction, personal self-disclosure emerged as the best predictor of males 2 ̆ 7 <b>romantic</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction. Stepwise multiple regressions supported correlations revealing that, for females, the optimal prediction model involved the interaction between personal and partner self-disclosure, whereas for males, the optimal prediction model involved only personal self-disclosure. A possible reason for this sex difference is discussed. Dept. of Psychology. Paper copy at Leddy Library: Theses 2 ̆ 6 Major Papers - Basement, West Bldg. / Call Number: Thesis 2004. S 33.

5|$|Eric and Leslie Ludy {{met when}} Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships,</b> the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool {{in the creation of the}} reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> are supposed to look like.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} measures of adult attachment, the most common being self-report questionnaires and coded interviews based on the Adult Attachment Interview. The various measures were developed primarily as research tools, for different purposes and addressing different domains, for example <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships,</b> parental relationships or peer relationships. Some classify an adult's state of mind with respect to attachment and attachment patterns by reference to childhood experiences, while others assess relationship behaviours and security regarding parents and peers.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, {{studies have shown}} that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships</b> and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.|$|E

5|$|In the church's teaching, sexual {{activity}} is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians, or {{in a natural}} marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in <b>romantic</b> <b>relationships,</b> particularly engagement to marriage, partners are called to practise continence, {{in order to test}} mutual respect and fidelity. Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. Sexual activity must always be open to the possibility of life; the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise always bring a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance.|$|E
