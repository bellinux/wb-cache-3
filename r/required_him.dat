50|$|The National Firearms Act of 1934 {{required}} the registration of {{certain types of}} firearms.

5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because party politics <b>required</b> <b>him</b> to do so. His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E
5|$|Henry Brougham became Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom after a Whig {{election}} victory.

5|$|However intense running {{sessions}} ran by coach Mick Lyons {{took their}} toll on his right knee, and on 20 September 1990 he took a knock in a practice match, which <b>required</b> <b>him</b> to have yet another operation on his right knee.

He had a testimonial game between Manchester United and Everton at Old Trafford in May 1992, but as United lost the title the previous week, only 7,434 turned out for the occasion.|$|E

Sotheby's moved him to a junior cataloger position working in both the Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments. This position enabled him to develop his eye for art, and he quickly became known {{for his ability to}} discern forgeries. His work as a cataloguer also taught him to describe objects in a concise manner and <b>required</b> <b>him</b> to research these objects. Chatwin advanced to become Sotheby's expert on Antiquities and Impressionist art and would later run both departments. Many of Chatwin's colleagues thought he would eventually become chairman of the auction house.|$|E
