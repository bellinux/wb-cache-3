25|$|Along {{with the}} Latin language, the Latin writing system spread first {{spread over the}} Italian Peninsula {{with the rise of}} the Roman Republic, {{especially}} after 350 BCE. For example, the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Umbria</b> seems to have switched from its own script in the 2nd century BCE to Latin in the 1st. Next were the lands surrounding the Western Mediterranean Sea: Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, Africa Proconsularis, Numidia, Hispania, and Gallia Transalpina. This continued during the early period of expansion of the Roman Empire (c. 27 BCE – 117 CE) in regions such as Illyria, Rhaetia, Noricum, Dacia, Gaul, Belgica, western Germania, and Britannia. The eastern half of the Empire, including Greece, Macedonia, Asia Minor, the Levant, and Egypt, continued to use Greek as a lingua franca, but Latin was widely spoken in the western half, and as the western Romance languages evolved out of Latin, they continued to use and adapt the Latin alphabet. The Germanic peoples that invaded and gradually settled the Western Roman Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries, most notably the Franks (first as the Merovingian script, later the Carolingian minuscule), adopted the Latin script and spread it further.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} comparison {{among the}} three strongest earthquakes occurred in Italy in the past 30  years is presented. These three earthquakes struck the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Umbria</b> and Marche in 1997, Abruzzo in 2009, and Emilia-Romagna, Lombardia and Veneto in 2012, respectively. They were assigned exactly the same local magnitude, Ml 5. 9, and comparable focal depths. In spite of having occurred in the same country, these earthquakes displayed considerable differences from both the scientific and the civil protection points of view. Differences can be ascribed to the released energy, the seismotectonic and geomorphological features, {{as well as the}} diverse population density, building features and socio-economic conditions that characterize the three epicentral areas. Nevertheless, the overall economic losses come out to be almost the same, although deriving from quite diverse distributions among the different categories of costs. Differences and similarities {{among the three}} events are carefully analysed and discussed in the paper. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
