25|$|The {{places were}} overrun by the Soviet 4th Guards Tank Corps {{on the night}} of 10 and 11 February 1943. After the reconquest by the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking with the support of 333 Infantry Division and the 7th Panzer Division on 18 February 1943 the Wehrmacht {{soldiers}} discovered numerous deaths. Many of the bodies were horribly mutilated, ears and noses cut off and genital organs amputated and stuffed into their mouths. Breasts of some of the nurses were cut off, the women being brutally raped. A German military judge who was at the scene stated in an interview during the 1970s that he saw a female body with her legs spread-eagled and a broomstick rammed into her genitals. In the cellar of the main train station around 120 Germans were herded into a large storage <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> mowed down with machine guns.|$|E
25|$|Gillian {{tells her}} lover, {{reporter}} Ben Caxton, about her experience with Smith. Ben explains that as {{heir to the}} entire exploration party, Smith is extremely wealthy, and following a legal precedent set during the colonisation of the Moon, he could be considered owner of Mars itself. His arrival on Earth has prompted a political power struggle that puts his life in danger. Ben persuades her to bug Smith's <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> publishes stories to bait the government into releasing him. Ben is seized by the government, and Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her. When government agents catch up with them, Smith makes the agents vanish, then is so shocked by Gillian's terrified reaction that he enters a semblance of catatonia. Gillian, remembering Ben's earlier suggestion, conveys Smith to Jubal Harshaw, a famous author {{who is also a}} physician and a lawyer.|$|E

25|$|He {{did so in}} a field next to the old {{road that}} led to Pitești. Maluțan then told his four {{passengers}} {{that he could do}} nothing more. The Securitate men ran to the roadside and began to flag down passing cars. Two cars stopped, one of them driven by a forestry official and one a red Dacia driven by a local doctor. However, the doctor was not happy about getting involved and, after a short time driving the Ceaușescus, faked engine trouble. A car of a bicycle repair man was then flagged down and he took them to Târgoviște. The driver of the car, Nicolae Petrișor, convinced them that they could hide successfully in an agricultural technical institute on the edge of town. When they arrived, the director guided the Ceaușescus into a <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> locked them in. They were arrested by local police at about 15:30, then after some wandering around transported to the Târgoviște garrison's military compound and held captive for several days until their trial.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 20, two 75mm guns {{commanded}} by a retired artillery officer Captain Orad de la Torre, plus one 155mm gun joined the siege. Also, a Breguet XIX warplane from the Cuatro Vientos air base bombed the barracks. At half past ten, one bomb wounded Fanjul and Sierra. A few moments later some soldiers inside the barracks waved a white sheet from the windows apparently {{with the intention of}} surrendering. Against the orders of Lieutenant Moreno of the Assault Guards, who were leading the attack, the crowd ran forward but other defenders fired at them from the barracks with machine guns. This happened twice, killing or wounding numbers of people. Around noon, the crowd maddened by these incidents broke through the main gate. Some surrendering defenders were massacred by the crowd in the main courtyard, several being thrown from an upper gallery. Photographs show the courtyard littered with uniformed bodies. Captain Orad de la Torre and Arturo Barea both reported seeing a number of rebel officers who had gathered in a mess <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> shot themselves. At least some of the Falangist and monarchist volunteers wearing civilian clothes were able to slip away in the confusion.|$|E

When the band realizes it cannot possibly be playing a 'live' soundcheck since they are in their tour bus, they exit the vehicle to stop the imposters. The real band members trap the fakes in a <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> go out on stage and perform. Near the end of the video, security kicks the fake band members out of the arena.|$|E

She is not happy that her mother remarried and thus does not like to live at home. She too comes to live in Tomoya's apartment. She has a cameo appearance roughly eighteen minutes into episode six of the Clannad anime series. A central theme in the story is the ties between families, much like in Clannad.|$|E

Sheila explains that {{she is also a}} sex addict, like Sam, and that Sam and she {{met for the first time}} at one of group meetings of sexual addicts. Frasier begs her not to tell Sam about their short-time affair. Suddenly, Sam arrives into the <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> in order to be honest to her, confesses to Sheila that, at the day of their engagement, Sam slept with another woman twice. Then Sheila confesses that she slept with other two regular patrons: Paul ("short, bald, fat") and then Cliff Clavin. Though he forgives her dalliance with Paul, Sam is disgusted to learn about Cliff and breaks off his relationship with Sheila. (When she turns to Frasier for help, he is equally disgusted about Cliff.) ...|$|E

[...] It's going to be as if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important.

500|$|At {{the insistence}} of {{publishers}} Grosset & Dunlap, the Nancy Drew books were revised beginning in 1959, both to make the books more modern and to eliminate racist stereotypes. Although Harriet Adams felt that these changes were unnecessary, she oversaw a complete overhaul of the series, as well as writing new volumes {{in keeping with the}} new guidelines laid down by Grosset & Dunlap. The series did not so much eliminate racial stereotypes, however, as eliminate non-white characters altogether. For example, in the original version of The Hidden Window Mystery (1956), Nancy visits friends in the south whose African-American servant, [...] "lovable old Beulah... serves squabs, sweet potatoes, corn pudding, piping hot biscuits, and strawberry shortcake." [...] The mistress of the house waits until Beulah has left the <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> says to Nancy, [...] "I try to make things easier for Beulah but she insists on cooking and serving everything the old-fashioned way. I must confess, though, that I love it." [...] In the revised 1975 version, Beulah is changed to Anna, a [...] "plump, smiling housekeeper".|$|E

It begins about ten seconds after the album's closer [...] "Release" [...] as a hidden track, but both count as one track on the CD. The song is entirely instrumental (except for random unintelligible words Vedder utters throughout) with a dominant fretless bass line makes up the core of the song (which Ament referred to in a 1994 Bass Player magazine interview as [...] "my tribute to (fretless bass instrumentalist) Mick Karn"), along with some guitar and sounds that seem to come from the drums. Producer Rick Parashar stated in 2002, [...] "As I recall, I think Jeff had, like, a bass line...I heard the bass line and then we kind of were collaborating on that in the control <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> I just started programming on the keyboard all this stuff; he was jamming with it and it just kind of came about like that." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the drive}} to Athlead, Darryl opens up to Pam that he is worried about the {{interview}}. At Jim's new company, Pam gives Darryl a thumbs up as he heads into the interview <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> is chatted up by an employee who says [...] "Jim speaks about you all the time" [...] and we [...] "can't wait for you to move here." [...] The thought of moving to Philadelphia disturbs her. Meanwhile, Darryl initially fumbles his interview due to nerves and feelings of inadequacy, but everyone else helps calm him down, and he makes a strong reversal. Darryl concludes the interview by attempting to shoot a basket with the room's sports decorations, but instead knocks a light fixture into the fish tank, electrocuting all the fish. Pam commiserates with Darryl over this embarrassing misstep. Jim returns to inform Darryl that although {{he will have to}} pay for the fish, he has the job. During the drive home, Darryl gushes over his new job and the chance to live in Philadelphia while Pam worries about where she and her family will be in the future.|$|E

They repeated that process a few times until the song was finished. Vernon expressed a positive opinion of working with West, and though he called West demanding in some ways, he appreciated West's enthusiasm for music and the creativity produced by the recording sessions. The song was recorded around the death of Michael Jackson and the event had an effect of the recording crew of the song, and certain aspects of the song are influences by personal events that affected West throughout the years. In an interview with MTV, West said that the song was going to be last featured on the album, and commented that [...] "emotionally it just fit the crescendo of everything that I was saying and what I wanted to say to this girl. And it's also my favorite eight bars that I've ever written in my life. I think it's one of the greatest pieces of writing." ...|$|E
500|$|In the video, Rihanna plays Casta's lesbian love interest. Casta {{arrives at}} the castle in a car, and steps out with a very provocative dominatrix-looking outfit, and meets Rihanna who is waiting inside. Throughout all of the video, Casta tries to seduce Rihanna whilst Rihanna {{initially}} resists, but eventually gives in to Casta's charm. First, she meets Rihanna {{in the living room}} and catches her eye. In the next scene, the couple are shown on top of a table with ultraviolet lighting and Casta rubs her head on Rihanna's legs. They are then shown outside the castle and Rihanna falls to the ground in despair while Casta looks on, letting her long hair fall loose and standing seductively. Soon, they are shown in a room full of male dancers and Rihanna begins to feel more comfortable around her admirer. The last two scenes are Rihanna and Casta in PVC bondage outfits kissing and caressing on a bed in a darkened <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> at a burning table, looking away from each other. Billboards music video reviewer, Monica Herrera commented, [...] "Rihanna saved a far sexier clip than 'Rockstar 101' for fans abroad."

The villages are one and a half kilometer from the U.S. military base. We are convinced that one soldier cannot kill so many people in two villages within one hour... have been killed by the two groups." [...] Lali asked the Afghan government, the United Nations and the international community to ensure the perpetrators were punished in Afghanistan. [...] While visiting one of the affected villages, Hamid Karzai pointed to one of the villagers and said: [...] "In his family, in four rooms people were killed – children and women were killed – and then they were all brought together in one <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> set on fire.

President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. The late President lay in state in the East <b>Room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. For his final journey with his son Willie, both caskets were transported in the {{executive}} coach [...] "United States" [...] and for three weeks the Lincoln Special funeral train decorated in black bunting bore Lincoln's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands, {{as well as many}} people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by. Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd to eulogize Lincoln, one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president. Historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but also noted that some Lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news. African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'. In a larger sense, the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended.|$|E
