5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled <b>room</b> <b>had</b> Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E
5|$|The 17th-century room, S2, {{used the}} south {{wall of the}} {{existing}} structure as its own north wall, and was largely built using materials salvaged from S1, although the standard of the work was poorer. The new <b>room</b> <b>had</b> a double fireplace, {{but there was no}} evidence of a dividing wall between the two hearths. Limestone blocks, identical to the quoins in S1, were used as structural and decorative features in the fireplace. In addition to the pantiles taken from S1, there were Cornish slate roof tiles. Whether they formed part of the roof of S2 or were associated with the possible wooden extension is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former dining room and kitchen. The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden <b>room</b> <b>had</b> been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas.|$|E
50|$|The main <b>room</b> <b>has</b> a {{capacity}} of 600 and the upstairs <b>room</b> <b>has</b> {{a capacity}} of 150.|$|R

50|$|Six <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> been excavated, {{including}} a tepidarium (room 4) and a caldarium (rooms 5-6). These <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> the traditional Roman hypocaust heating system.|$|R
5|$|The {{main bar}} {{was large and}} black with curves in many directions. The <b>room</b> <b>had</b> black and white zebra-patterned wallpaper, {{in the style of}} New York's El Morocco club, and an indoor {{waterfall}} surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. Beyond the main bar was a smaller bar and a small showroom, and after that the club's main showroom, the Vermilion Room, with its burgundy velvet wallpaper. The small front room was used for year-round lounge acts and the main showroom with supper service featured top-billed acts in the summer months and for special bookings.|$|E
5|$|The prison {{reformer}} John Howard travelled {{around the}} country in the 1770s inspecting jails, and presented his research in The State of the Prisons in England and Wales (1777). In a jail owned by the Bishop of Ely, Howard wrote, prisoners had ten years earlier been kept chained to the floor on their backs, with spiked collars round their necks and iron bars over their legs. The Duke of Portland had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. Lord Arundel owned a jail in Penzance, where Howard found a debtor in a room 11ftx11ft and 6ft high, with a small window. The door of the <b>room</b> <b>had</b> not been opened for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Two former {{restaurants}} operated at the campus: the Conservatory Restaurant was led {{by students}} of the Farm-to-Table concentration in the CIA's bachelor's degree programs. The Wine Spectator Greystone Restaurant (WSGR) was run by students in the associate degree program in culinary arts. The restaurant focused on using local and seasonal ingredients, and the dining <b>room</b> <b>had</b> open cooking stations to give diners a {{full view of the}} working kitchen. The WSGR initially served food of the Mediterranean cuisines, and was at first professionally run. Later on, it became fully student-run, however changes in late 2015 led to lunch service staffed by students and dinner service staffed by employees. The restaurants closed around 2016 with the campus' reorganization after purchasing Copia.|$|E

[...] "Two of the <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> a double bed each, {{and the other}} <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> two single beds each."

5|$|Fox, who had {{projected}} {{the budget}} at $75 million, rejected the treatment which they estimated {{would have cost}} $5 million more. Beast, Nightcrawler, Pyro, and the Danger <b>Room</b> <b>had</b> to be deleted before the studio greenlighted X-Men. Fox head Thomas Rothman argued that this would enhance the story, and Singer concurred that removing the Danger Room allowed him to focus on other scenes he preferred. Elements of Beast, particularly his medical expertise, were transferred to Jean Grey. Singer and DeSanto brought Christopher McQuarrie from The Usual Suspects, and together did another rewrite. David Hayter simultaneously rewrote the screenplay, receiving solo screenplay credit from the Writers Guild of America, while Singer and DeSanto were given story credit. The WGA offered McQuarrie a credit, but he voluntarily took his name off when the final version was {{more in line with}} Hayter's script than his.|$|E
5|$|George W. Jones, {{who would}} later become a U.S. Senator from Iowa, arrived in the Sinsinawa Mound area in 1827, and in 1828 {{established}} a mining settlement there. The first structure at the settlement was Jones's own log cabin, built {{during the spring of}} 1828 in two days. The cabin measured 49 feet (14.9 m) by 17feet (5.2m) and each <b>room</b> <b>had</b> one door and one window. When the Black Hawk War began four years later he also built a small fort at the site. The remains of the fort, one of many constructed in the region to protect local residents, are said to still stand {{at the entrance to the}} Sinsinawa Dominican complex. One of the men who assisted Jones in building the fort's blockhouse was Enoch Robinson, a soldier who later helped bury the victims of the Sinsinawa Mound raid. At the time of the attack Jones was with Henry Dodge's militia volunteers, on the way to meet overall commander General Henry Atkinson at Lake Koshkonong, then a marsh region.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 growing {{diplomatic}} {{tensions in}} the Middle East, tensions that would soon culminate in the Suez Crisis, resulted in the resurrection of 69 Squadron. On April 19 the IAF issued an order reactivating the squadron at Ramat David, with Nahum Efrat as its commanding officer. The squadron was soon tasked with its first mission, allocating two B-17s for search and rescue operations during Dassault Mystère delivery flights from France to Israel. The reformed squadron once again began training personnel and equipping the aircraft for possible hostilities. As Israel purchased more jet fighters, however, <b>room</b> <b>had</b> {{to be made for}} the new arrivals, and in September 1956 the IAF ordered the squadron to send its aircraft into storage and changed its status to reserve. By October 3 the aircraft had been stored at Bedek Aviation (later Israeli Aircraft Industries) at Lod, but only three weeks later, on October 25, the IAF activated the squadron once more.|$|E

50|$|The {{northern}} {{room was}} used as the post office and retains some early timber fixtures including shelving and drawers. This <b>room</b> <b>has</b> a counter, with a timber battened panel above, opening to the enclosed northern corner verandah. The eastern <b>room</b> <b>has</b> a large louvred window in the northeast wall, and a timber fireplace surround attached to the southeast wall over an enclosed doorway.

5|$|In the 1970s, {{the hotel}} {{fell into a}} {{turbulent}} period. Terrorist threats from the Irish Republican Army became the chief concern, and bomb scares were not uncommon. The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell-Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for £2.75m. At {{the time of the}} sale, the hotel's occupancy rate was just 45 percent; the Ritz Grill <b>Room</b> <b>had</b> been closed and it had lost quite a bit of money in recent times. In 1984, the Ritz brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances which were popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of demand, the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea at the Ritz to hotel guests only, as those staying at the Ritz were often unable to get a table. Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval and the Ritz compromised by requiring reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel. Proper attire for tea is a must; the Ritz once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie.|$|E
5|$|The band {{searched for}} a new concert venue because the Arlequines was {{becoming}} too small for their growing audience. They moved to Cemento, {{where most of the}} 1991 concerts took place. They played with the bands Todos tus muertos, Pobres pibes, Nepal, Militia, Devastación, Rapier, and Resistencia Nativa. Their albums Hermética and Intérpreteswhich had been released as LP records and cassettes, were released by Tripoli on a single compact disc. Tony Scotto left the band because of creative differences and was replaced by Claudio Strunz. Strunz, drummer of the band Heinkel and owner of Hermética's rehearsal <b>room,</b> <b>had</b> already played with the band during practice sessions when Scotto was absent. He made his debut at Sunchales. The band appeared in two television programs, La movida del '90 and Siglo XX Cambalache and recorded their second full-length album, Ácido Argentino, with 150 hours of recording time at the Aguilar studios. It was released at Cemento on December 27.|$|E
5|$|The {{women were}} not {{positively}} identified until a week after their bodies' discovery, by which time they had been reported missing in Ohio by husband and father, Hal Rogers. On June 8, a housekeeper at the Days Inn said that the women's <b>room</b> <b>had</b> not been disturbed, and the beds had not been slept in. The hotel manager contacted the police. Fingerprints found in the room were matched to the bodies; final confirmation of their identification came from dental records. Marine researchers at the University of South Florida estimated from currents and patterns that the women were thrown from a boatand not from a bridge or dry landbetween two and five days before they were found. The Rogers car, a 1984 Oldsmobile Calais with Ohio license plates, was found at the boat dock by the Courtney Campbell Causeway.|$|E

5|$|Two {{months after}} the {{withdrawal}} of Bruce's bill, a ministerial by-election in Pontefract in 1872 gave the LNA an opportunity for further action. Although they did not field a candidate, Josephine attended meetings in the town. At one LNA meeting {{the floor of the}} <b>room</b> <b>had</b> been liberally sprinkled with cayenne pepper by her opponents, making speaking difficult. After it was cleared away, her opponents set bales of straw alight in a storeroom below, which led to smoke rising through the floorboards; two members of the Metropolitan Police—specially drafted into the town for the by-election—looked on but took no action. Although the incumbent Liberal candidate, Hugh Childers, was returned, there were heavy abstentions, and his vote was reduced by around 150 (from an electorate of 2,000). In December 1872 Josephine met the Prime Minister, William Gladstone, when he visited Liverpool College. Although he supported the aims of the LNA, he was politically unable to back the LNA publicly, and had supported Bruce's bill.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{interior}} design of Norfolk House was {{to define the}} London town house for the next century. The floor plan {{was based on an}} adaptation of one of the secondary wings he had built at Holkham Hall. A circuit of reception rooms centred on a grand staircase, with the staircase hall replacing the Italian traditional inner courtyard or two-storey hall. This arrangement of salons allowed guests at large parties to circulate, having been received {{at the head of the}} staircase, without doubling back on arriving guests. The second advantage was that while each <b>room</b> <b>had</b> access to the next, it also had access to the central stairs, thus allowing only one or two rooms to be used at a time for smaller functions. Previously, guests in London houses had had to reach the principal salon through a long enfilade of minor reception rooms. In this square and compact way, Brettingham came close to recreating the layout of an original Palladian Villa. He transformed what Andrea Palladio had conceived as a country retreat into a London mansion appropriate for the lifestyle of the British aristocracy, with its reversal of the usual Italian domestic pattern of a large palazzo in town, and a smaller villa in the country. As happened so often in Brettingham's career, Robert Adam later developed this design concept further, and was credited with its success. However, Brettingham's plan for Norfolk House was to serve as the prototype for many London mansions over the next few decades.|$|E
25|$|The storage closet, or lumber <b>room,</b> <b>had</b> no {{exterior}} window, {{but instead}} received {{light from a}} window to the stairwell, as there was an exterior window above the staircase landing.|$|E

The front <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> barrel-vaulted fireplaces with high mantels on their back walls. The left hand rear <b>room</b> <b>has</b> had small bathroom added at a later period. The floor plan of the basement {{is the same as the}} first floor. The upper floor <b>has</b> four <b>rooms</b> with small fireplaces.|$|R
50|$|A lounge, dining room, kitchen, private bar {{and staff}} rooms {{are located on}} the first floor. These <b>rooms</b> <b>have</b> ornate plaster {{cornices}} and ceilings.

25|$|In a {{study in}} France, the mean indoor {{concentration}} of acetaldehydes measured in 16 homes was approximately seven {{times higher than the}} outside acetaldehyde concentration. The living <b>room</b> <b>had</b> a mean of 18.1±17.5 μg m−3 and the bedroom was 18.2±16.9 μg m−3, whereas the outdoor air had a mean concentration of 2.3±2.6 μg m−3.|$|E
25|$|The dome, {{supported}} by 12 steel ribs, would rise 100ft above the floor, and be illuminated by an electric lantern 45ft in diameter — {{the only source}} of light, for the <b>room</b> <b>had</b> no windows. The building was constructed of non-combustible materials intended to protect the Jezreelites when the Last Trump was called and fire rained down upon the rest of existence.|$|E
