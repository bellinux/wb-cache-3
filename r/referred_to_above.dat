One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E

5|$|In the 1995 {{study by}} Chase et al. <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>above,</b> {{which was the}} largest yet to use purely {{molecular}} data, the results demonstrated paraphyly of the lilioids. However, because their data contradicted purely morphological phylogenies they were reluctant to draw definite conclusions as to the monophyly of this group. They identified four major clades of monocots. They named these alismatids, aroids, stemonoids and dioscoreoids, in addition to Acorus, and {{a core group of}} Asparagales, Liliales and commelinoids. They based the names of these groups on the closest corresponding superorders and orders of Dahlgren, with the exception of stemonoids (based on Stemonaceae for which there was no obvious equivalent).|$|E

This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson, who was accused of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called ‘dominus de Papay’.

25|$|It {{was late}} in the 11th century that a single {{anonymous}} scholar appears to have brought together these and numerous other poems and fitted them into an elaborate prose framework – partly of his own composition and partly drawn from older, no longer extant sources (i.e. the tochomlaidh <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>above</b> by O'Curry), paraphrasing and enlarging the verse.

Already in 1965, the Soviet Union issued a copper-nickel-zinc rouble commemorating the victory in World War II. This, and the next four commemorative roubles, were issued in several millions of copies, and circulated as regular currency.|$|E
