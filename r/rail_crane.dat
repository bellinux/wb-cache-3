2500|$|... 20 trams {{were built}} by Brush in 1937. These are {{single-deck}} cars that closely resemble the original English Electric railcoaches, but have more pointed ends. They were originally numbered 284–303, with eighteen survivors being renumbered 621–638 in 1968 (301 and 303 having been mothballed and scrapped without being renumbered). 638 was experimentally converted as a driver-only operated tram in 1969 with doors {{built at the}} ends for entry, but the experiment was deemed a failure due to the layout and seating capacity reduction; 638 was converted back into a conventional Brush railcoach. 638 was withdrawn from service in 1980 requiring an overhaul, but was scrapped in 1984 after being deemed surplus to requirements. 629 was withdrawn in 1972 requiring an overhaul, but was scrapped in 1980 due to Rigby Road workshops working throughout the 1970s on the OMO rebuild programme. 628 was withdrawn in 1969 due to a collision with Balloon car 726. The body of 628 was scrapped, but the underframe was converted into a rail carrying trailer with a <b>rail</b> <b>crane</b> installed. 628 was renumbered to 748 and then 260. 633 was rebuilt as the illuminated Trawler and was renumbered to 737 in 2008. One Brush car, No. 631, was retained by Blackpool Transport for their heritage fleet of trams and has been restored back to its 1950s condition. Although its restoration {{has not yet been}} completed and some features of its 1990s rebuild remain, it re-entered service in May 2013. 622 was given to Anchorsholme Primary School for use as a static classroom. 626 was sold to Peel Holdings. 636 was sold to Stored Energy Technology to test experimental equipment. All of the other Brush cars were acquired for preservation due to the modernisation of the tramway in 2011-2012. In December 2013, former Permanent Way car 259 (624, originally 287) and 632 which were preserved by the Lancastrian Transport Trust, returned to Rigby Road Depot from outside storage and await repaints and repairs before they can re-enter service as part of the heritage fleet. 621 was preserved at Beamish museum until 2016 when the tram was donated to the heritage fleet in Blackpool and moved back there in December 2016. 621 will return to service in September 2017, painted in 1950s green and cream livery. 623, painted in 1940s wartime green and cream livery, is in operation at Heaton Park Tramway, Manchester. In 2017, it went on loan to the Blackpool Tramway for the 80th anniversary of the Brush railcoach cars. 625 is privately preserved and is currently stored in Rigby Road Depot. 290 (627) is preserved by Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust. 630 is in operation at the National Tramway Museum, Crich. 630 was rebuilt in the 1990s with modern indicator headlamps, electrical equipment and bus-type seats. It remains in this condition as a reminder of this period of Blackpool's tramway history. 634 was privately sold and was on static display at the North Eastern Electrical Traction Trust museum painted in 1990s green and cream livery until 2016 when the tram was donated to the heritage fleet in Blackpool by its owner and returned to Blackpool in February 2016 and will re-enter service in the future. 298 (635) was preserved by the National Tramway Museum, Crich and remains stored. 637 is privately preserved and is currently stored in Fleetwood.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{a sample of}} the results. The models that have been developed are used for an extensive experimental programme, the objective of which was to determine the characteristics of the various ITT-options. The 5 investigated systems are :. MTS/FTF with control and default planning. MTS/FTF with control and sophisticated planning. AGV land-side. AGV water-side. ALV Before starting the experiments, for each system the optimal control-parameters were determined. The experimental programme resulted in a relation between the service rate and the costs of the various options. This relation is derived from the results of the simulation, with the aid of cost formulas which were prepared by INCOMAAS. A distinction can be drawn between runs which serve for the tuning of a number of parameters, runs to determine the run length and production runs that determine the ITT performance as a function of a number of factors. The tuning of the model is necessary to determine the setting of a number of parameters. These parameters relate to the control and planning, for example: under what conditions is a transport order urgent, how long before the physical arrival of a container is a transport order planned-in, how long is the permitted pre-work time for a transport job. Separate tuning is required for the railway handling of MTSs. This determines under which conditions the loading or unloading of a train is classified as urgent and what the maximum permitted trip distance (Xmax) of the <b>rail</b> <b>crane</b> is when it is `grazing'. The best parameter setting is determined for each option. The length of the runs is set at ten weeks, preceded by a running-in period of one week. In the production runs the available ITT and the handling capacity of the handling centres is varied [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|The master's thesis {{presents}} a new method for <b>crane</b> <b>rail</b> geometry determination, i. e. based on measurements obtained {{by using a}} terrestrial laser scanner and a dedicated computer programme which, {{on the basis of}} the rail points cloud, determines the horizontal and vertical path of the <b>crane</b> <b>rail.</b> The method was tested on the <b>crane</b> <b>rails</b> of Krško Hydroelectric Power Plant and Brestanica Thermal Power Plant, where, after scanning the point cloud, the upper and the lateral internal surface of railheads was derived. Each <b>crane</b> <b>rail</b> was divided into segments, through which the planes were fitted and the characteristic rail lines were determined. Based on the profiles, positional and height rail offsets were determined between the characteristic points on the same profile, as well as the actual span and the height difference between the <b>crane</b> <b>rails.</b> Furthermore, it was verified whether the calculated geometry parameters complied with the rules set by the standard in question. The thesis also examined how the rail geometry parameters – as determined by the terrestrial laser scanning method – correspond with the parameters determined by the classical polar method of surveying. Furthermore, it was tested how the determination of patterns is influenced by the length of the segment as well as the density of rail points. Based on the conclusions drawn during the elaboration of this thesis, certain guidelines are given on how to ensure the quality of <b>crane</b> <b>rail</b> geometry determination using terrestrial laser scanning technology...|$|R
