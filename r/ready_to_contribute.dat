5|$|While Charles Theodore's {{dream of}} a Burgundian renaissance receded, Joseph {{continued}} on his course to annex part of Bavaria. The widow—Max Joseph's widow or the mother-in-law or both—petitioned Prussia on behalf of Charles II August. Frederick's envoys to the heir presumptive convinced this slighted prince to lodge protests with the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. Joseph's troops remained in portions of Bavaria, even establishing an Austrian administration at Straubing, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. Austrian occupation of Bavaria was unacceptable to Charles August's champion, Frederick. Prussian troops mobilized near Prussia's border with Bohemia, reminiscent of the invasion in 1740 that so endangered Maria Theresa's succession to the Habsburg hereditary lands. Meanwhile, the French wriggled out of their diplomatic obligations to Austria, telling Joseph {{that there would be}} no military support from Paris for a war against Prussia. Britain, Prussia's strongest ally, was already mired in a war in North America, but Prussia's military had recovered from the Seven Years' War and Frederick did not require any help. Prussia's other ally, Saxony, aligned by two marriages with Charles August, was strategically prepared for war against Austria and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> twenty thousand troops. Watching from St. Petersburg, Catherine II was willing to mop up the spoils of war for the Russian Empire but did not want to get involved in another costly European conflict.|$|E
25|$|OLF {{says that}} {{the root cause of}} {{political}} problems in Ethiopia is the policy of oppression by the former Imperial state of Ethiopia and refusal by the state to respect the rights of oppressed peoples to self-determination. The current Ethiopian government recognizes the right of self-determination of all states in its constitution, but it is accused of placing limitations imposed on the exercise of that right. OLF believes that there is an imperial domination that must be brought to an end in order to bring genuine peace and stability. Thus there is currently a policy of shelving political problems which must cease. The OLF says that it is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> towards any meaningful effort to reach at a comprehensive settlement to bring peace to all peoples. In the view of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) another issue with the OLF movement has been the movement's treatment of Oromos who don't support OLF's ideologies. This {{is part of the reason}} the EPRDF helped to form an organization called the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization. OLF has stated that they do not resent Oromos for being members of the OPDO.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to their}} lackluster 2013 performance, the Phillies had the seventh first-round {{pick in the}} June 5–7 MLB draft. They {{selected}} Aaron Nola, a starting pitcher from Louisiana State University predicted {{by many to be}} one of the first draft picks to reach the major leagues, for fast-tracking through the Phillies' minor-league system. In the second round, they selected another pitcher – lefthander Matt Imhof, who played college ball with the Cal Poly Mustangs – and selected Aaron Brown, a pitcher-outfielder from Pepperdine, in the third round. The Phillies changed their organizational draft philosophy from drafting unpolished players with potential to selecting players <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> to the big-league club, picking only one high-school player in the first 28 rounds. Michael Baumann wrote on the Crashburn Alley blog, [...] "Given how high the Phillies drafted and how bad their farm system is at the top, I wanted them to get back into the game with one swing. This draft won’t do that, but generally you want to get at least one good major league player out of every draft class, plus some odds and ends." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the home meal {{replacements}} (HMR) consumer and investigates three HMR categories: <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> eat meals, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> heat meals, and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> cook meals. A nationally representative (n= 359) survey was undertaken in Taiwan amongst primary food purchasers in the households. Within each HMR category, consumers were segmented into frequency based on their level of purchase behavior. The frequency with the highest purchase level of HMR was compared with the frequency with the lowest purchase level on their food-related lifestyles about HMR. Analysis of data found {{that the importance of}} product information were found <b>to</b> be positively <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> eat meals. The demands of freshness were found <b>to</b> be negatively <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> eat meals. The health and quality dimensions were found <b>to</b> be negatively <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> heat meals and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> cook meals. The whole family dimensions were found <b>to</b> be positively <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> heat meals and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> cook meals. The price criteria were found <b>to</b> be positively <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the reported purchase behavior of <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> cook meals. 隨著時間壓力的增加、烹調設備的進步與缺乏烹調餐食慾望等生活型態轉變，影響到用餐型態的選擇，對於方便性飲食需求將持續增加；在此背景下，提供取代部分或全部的家庭餐食，減少消費者食用前的處理步驟，增加料理的簡便力和省力化，讓家庭可更方便食用的家庭取代餐(Home meal replacement) 概念之產品，在未來的國內食品市場將愈趨重要。因此，本研究目的希望鎖定在家庭食品消費中居於主導地位的家庭主婦為研究對象，藉由目的為收集消費者在購買、準備和消費食品產品時的態度和行為等資訊之食品生活型態(food-related lifestyle) ，找出影響家庭取代餐購買行為之因素，並探討食品生活型態因素對家庭主婦在不同類型之HMR產品購買行為之影響關係，提供相關食品產業在制定決策時的參考。研究結果發現，在顯著影響因素方面，產品資訊的重要性對即食餐購買頻率有顯著正面影響，新鮮需求則有負面的顯著影響關係；在健康與品質導向因素中，對即熱餐和即煮餐之購買頻率皆為負向顯著影響，相反的，家人的協助因素則有正向的顯著影響關係；此外，當家庭主婦對價格的敏感度愈高時，則會提高即煮餐之購買頻率。第一章 緒論 [...] . 1 第一節 研究背景與動機 [...] . 1 第二節 研究目的 [...] . 5 第二章 文獻探討 [...] . 6 第一節 用餐型態的轉變與家庭取代餐的崛起 [...] . 6 第二節 食品生活型態 [...] 17 第三節 食品生活型態與家庭取代餐購買行為相關研究 [...] 23 第三章 研究方法 [...] 25 第一節 研究架構與假說 [...] 25 第二節 變項操作性定義 [...] 27 第三節 研究對象、範圍與取樣方法 [...] 31 第四節 問卷設計與分析方法 [...] 32 第四章 分析與結果 [...] 38 第一節 問卷回收 [...] 38 第二節 樣本敘述性統計分析 [...] 39 第三節 食品生活型態之分析 [...] 42 第四節 家庭取代餐購買行為之分析 [...] 60 第五章 結論與建議 [...] 83 第一節 研究發現與結論 [...] 83 第二節 研究建議 [...] 87 參考文獻 [...] . 90 附錄...|$|R
500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Ultimate Guitar, Gary Holt {{said that he}} is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> with the songwriting for the next album. When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Sir John Hawkins (1776) remarked, [...] "Though he {{had been}} a {{performer}} in the opera at the same time with Nicolino and Valentini" [...] (possibly meaning Roberto Valentini) [...] "he had no notion of grace or elegance in singing; it was all strength and compass..." [...] Hawkins's opinion of Leveridge was coloured by social perceptions: [...] "Being a man of rather coarse manners, and able to drink a great deal, he was by some thought a good companion. The humour of his songs, and indeed of his conversation, consisted in exhortations to despise riches and the means of attaining them; to drown care by drinking; to enjoy the present hour, and to set reflection and death at defiance. With such a disposition as this, Leveridge could not fail to be a welcome visitor at all clubs and assemblies, where the avowed purpose of meeting was an oblivion of care; and being ever <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> to the promotion of social mirth, he made himself many friends, from whose bounty he derived all the comforts that in an extreme old age he was capable of enjoying." ...|$|E

50|$|Although female West Indian {{manatees}} {{are mostly}} solitary creatures, they form mating herds while in estrus. Most females first breed successfully between ages of seven and nine; they are, however, capable of reproduction {{as early as}} four years of age. Most males reach sexually maturity {{by the time they}} are three or four. The gestation period is 12 to 14 months. Normally, one calf is born, although on rare occasions two have been recorded. The young are born with molars, allowing them to consume sea grass within the first three weeks of birth. On average, manatees that survive to adulthood will have between five and seven offspring between the ages of 20 and 26.When a calf is born, it usually weighs 60 - 70 lb and is 4.0 - 4.5 ft long. The family unit consists of mother and calf, which remain together for up to two years. Males aggregate in mating herds around a female when she is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> mate, but <b>contribute</b> no parental care to the calf.|$|R

He swung a creditable racket at tennis, was always <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> a baritone solo to charity concerts, and gave freely to the poor. He was what you might call a golden-mean man, good-hearted rather than magnetic, with no serious vices and no heroic virtues.
