5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> iron and volatile elements {{and the fact that}} its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.|$|E
5|$|The <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{oxygen in}} the early ocean {{resulted}} in a scarcity in dissolved molybdenum. Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but the molybdate ion MoO42− is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water.|$|E
5|$|Vision, chemoreception (tongue-flicking) {{and hearing}} are {{important}} senses for terrestrial snakes but these stimuli become distorted in water. The poor visibility, chemical dilution and limitation of ground-borne vibrations underwater suggest that sea snakes and sea kraits may have unique sensory abilities {{to compensate for}} the <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> other sensory cues.|$|E
30|$|Credit {{constraints}} {{operate in}} a variety of ways in Iran where undeveloped capital market forces entrepreneurs to rely on self-financing or borrowing from friends or <b>relatives.</b> <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> access to long-term credit for small enterprises forces them to rely on high cost short term finance.|$|R

5|$|In {{keeping with}} an {{existing}} tradition for Australian gold medallists at the Summer Olympics, Bradbury, Camplin and Begg-Smith's victories were recognised by Australia Post, which released stamps depicting their triumphs, {{and gave the}} athletes royalties {{for the use of}} their image. Due to the <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> interest in winter sport in Australia, both Camplin and Bradbury had been without sponsorship before their Olympic triumphs, and were effectively broke.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rise in cases of {{undisclosed}} synthetic diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.|$|E
5|$|The current {{standard}} {{theory for}} Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen {{into and out}} of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> angular momentum when compared to the planets. However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.|$|E

30|$|The {{prevalence}} of mobile phones {{has changed the}} constrained mobility situation of migrants to some extent. They can now use mobile phones to contact people, entertain themselves, or obtain information {{at any time and}} at any place, thanks to the mobile Internet. On the one hand, this increase in virtual mobility could decrease the social exclusion of Dashilar’s migrants. It could also substitute for forms of travel that previously would have been obligatory, such as for job hunting. Virtual mobility improved respondents’ efficiency of information access and saved travel time. Additionally, it motivated migrants to travel more by informing them about various activity destinations and helping them obtain more information on their own. On the other hand, the popularity of mobile phones could lead to another type of social exclusion for these migrants, due to their limited education, skills, and capacity for information access, as well as the treatment they reportedly receive in Beijing and their <b>relatives</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> social resources.|$|R

5|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had {{resulted}} in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated {{by the introduction of}} the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Uranus's rings are opaque {{and only a}} few kilometers wide. The ring system contains little dust overall; it consists mostly of large bodies 0.2–20m in diameter. However, some rings are optically thin: the broad and faint 1986U2R/ζ, μ and ν rings are made of small dust particles, while the narrow and faint λ ring also contains larger bodies. The <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> dust in the ring system may be due to aerodynamic drag from the extended Uranian exosphere.|$|E

In 2015 five of the huts were put on the market for a {{combined}} asking price of £1 million. On average the huts measure around five by three metres, have no running water, and the occupants may only stay overnight from March to October. Despite the <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> amenities, the area {{has become one of the}} UK's most desirable; huts are rented out for up to £600 a week.|$|E
50|$|Heterochromia is a {{difference}} in coloration, usually of the iris but also of hair or skin. Heterochromia {{is a result of}} the <b>relative</b> excess or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> melanin (a pigment). It may be inherited, or caused by genetic mosaicism, chimerism, disease, or injury.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the first}} {{description}} of Proplatynotia, some features {{have been recognized}} that separate it from other platynotans. The teeth of Proplatynotia are smooth and lack plicidentine, folded layers of dentine around the center pulp cavity of the tooth. Plicidentine, while rare in land-living vertebrates, is characteristic of monitor lizards and their closest extinct <b>relatives.</b> The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> plicidentine in Proplatynotia led to an early hypothesis {{that it was not}} a platynotan, but evolved platynotan features through convergence.|$|R

In honor of his previous service, {{he was assigned to}} the prestigious Committee on Foreign Relations. In this position, he endorsed Eisenhower's appointment of Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal. His <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> seniority did not afford him much influence.|$|E
5|$|As {{the museum}} {{moved to the}} National Mall in the mid 1980s, its {{permanent}} collection consisted of more than 6,000 art objects (e.g., sculpture, artifacts, textiles) and the large Elisofon photography collection. This original collection focused on Sub-Saharan Africa, with better representation of the Guinea coast and Western Sudan than the Central African region. The collection is idiosyncratic, reflecting the <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> colonial era African art acquisitions in American donor collections. Some early highlights of the museum's collection include an Edo–Portuguese ivory spoon and an Akan gold pendant bequeathed by the Robert Woods Bliss estate. The museum's first acquisitions budget came with joining the Smithsonian.|$|E
5|$|Care {{of young}} is protracted, {{extending}} {{for as long}} as six months, among the longest for birds. For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill, with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> predation compared to that of land-living birds.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{number of}} {{children}} under the age of five who dies of malaria per thousand births is sixteen in Tanzania. Even though improvements have been made there are still many challenges in the care of malaria infected children. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences that nurses and relatives to malaria infected children have regarding the pediatric malaria care at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Tanzania. Method: Semi structured interviews were conducted among three nurses and three relatives to malaria infected children within a pediatric ward at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Tanzania. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and then analysed. Result: All the nurses agreed that the major challenge in the care of malaria infected children is the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge from the relatives about prevention of malaria. This results in a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> adherence among the relatives concerning prevention. The relatives agreed about their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge about malaria and they wished for more education. They also considered the workload to be an issue for the nurses at the ward. The availability for the child to get treatment depends whether they are from a rural area or city. Conclusion: To continue the fight against malaria among children it is of great importance to focus on the <b>relatives</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge about malaria, the workload issue and the long distance to hospital. ...|$|R
40|$|Registered General Nurses (RGNs) play crucial {{roles in}} {{emergency}} departments (EDs). EDs in Ghana are primarily staffed by RGNs {{who have had}} no additional formal education in emergency care. Additionally, basic, master’s, or doctoral level nursing education programs provide limited content on the complexities of emergency nursing. Nurses in EDs are affected by many challenges such as growing patient population, financial pressures, physical violence, verbal abuse, operational inefficiencies, overcrowding, and work overload. There is a paucity of research on challenges experienced by RGNs in EDs in the Volta Region of Ghana. In this qualitative study, twenty RGNs in EDs from three selected hospitals in the Volta Region of Ghana were interviewed. All recorded interviews were transcribed, reviewed several times by researchers and supervisors, and analyzed using content analysis. Five thematic categories were identified. These thematic categories <b>of</b> challenges were <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> preparation for ED role, verbal abuse from patients <b>relatives,</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> resources in ED, stressful and time consuming nature of ED, and overcrowding in ED. Formal education of RGNs in the advanced role of emergency care, adequate supply of resources, increased hospital management support, and motivations for RGNs working in ED are necessary to improve the practice of emergency care...|$|R

5|$|Fighting {{has been}} a part of ice hockey since the sport's rise in {{popularity}} in 19th century Canada. There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control. Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century. The implementation of some features, such as the blue lines in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minerals}} {{used for}} paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, shale, malachite, iron oxides, hematite, limonite, gypsum, and azurite. Twined sandals, and bones from the ferruginous hawk {{and the great}} horned owl have been found there. The <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W. Postlethwaite, who had for three seasons directed Hewett's excavation of Chetro Ketl's great kiva, oversaw the final work at the site conducted by the University of New Mexico and the School of American Research.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{were among}} the first animals to be domesticated by {{humankind}} (although the domestication of dogs may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia. Their wild relatives have several characteristics, such as a <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> aggression, a manageable size, early sexual maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication. Today, Ovis aries is an entirely domesticated animal that is largely dependent on humans for its health and survival. Feral sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) and not on the scale of feral horses, goats, pigs, or dogs, although some feral populations have remained isolated long enough to be recognized as distinct breeds.|$|E

5000|$|Words or {{concepts}} {{for which}} no adequate Egyptian translation existed were taken directly from Greek to avoid altering {{the meaning of the}} religious message. In addition, other Egyptian words that would have adequately translated the Greek equivalents were not employed as they were perceived as having overt pagan associations. Old Coptic texts employ many such words, phrases and epithets; for example, the word [...] '(Who is) in (His) Mountain', is an epithet of Anubis.

5|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must {{be present in}} the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes (like propane) may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98percent of the crust. The <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The Red River Trails {{are less}} well known today than many other pioneer trails and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in {{folklore}} as the great western trails in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada. They were neither fought over nor the locus of battles (with {{the exception of the}} Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other trails presented greater dangers.

5|$|There are {{numerous}} important prehistoric remains in Orkney, {{especially from the}} Neolithic period, four of which form a World Heritage Site. There are diverse reasons for the abundance of the archaeological record. The sandstone bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind-blown sands have helped preserve several sites. The <b>relative</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> industrialisation and low incidence of ploughing also have helped to preserve these ancient monuments. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures (perhaps inherited from the Norse period of occupation) that may have helped to retain their structural integrity..|$|E

Like many other types of non-avian theropod eggs, Continuoolithus eggs are typically found paired; this is because the parent dinosaurs had two functional oviducts, each of which would produce an egg simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Studying signal {{transduction}} pathways {{and attempting to}} identify the action of proteins involved in these pathways is difficult due to the abundance and complexity of interactions, families of proteins with the same or similar action, and the <b>relative</b> a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> selectivity for substrates (a good example of which are protein kinases). A method has been developed to use a radioactively labeled ATP orthogonal analog with an orthogonal kinase that uses the ATP analog to phosphorylate its substrates, allowing for identification of its targets within the pathway by the radioactive label that it will add the target. Variations on this approach {{can be used to}} identify the function of {{signal transduction}} proteins whose function remains undetermined.|$|R
