50|$|Production took {{approximately}} 9 months. Ring and its sequel Rasen {{were released}} in Japan {{at the same}} time. After its <b>release,</b> <b>Ring</b> was huge box office success in Japan and acclaimed by critics. It inspired numerous follow-ups within the Ring franchise and triggered a trend of Western remakes, starting with the 2002 American film The Ring.|$|E
5000|$|Variety {{stated that}} Rings [...] "most notable success" [...] {{has been in}} Hong Kong, where it became the biggest grosser {{during the first half}} of the year, beating popular American films such as The Matrix. On its 1999 Hong Kong <b>release,</b> <b>Ring</b> earned HK$31.2 million (US$4.03 million) during its two-month {{theatrical}} run making it Hong Kongs highest-grossing Japanese-language film. This record was later beaten by Stand By Me Doraemon in 2015.|$|E

5000|$|Ring and its sequel Rasen were {{released}} in Japan {{at the same}} time. The studio hoped this would increase revenues, because the Ring story was already a successful novel and television film. The two films shared a few cast members and had the same production team, but different directors and screenwriters; Rasen was {{written and directed by}} Jōji Iida whereas Ring was written by Hiroshi Takahashi and directed by Hideo Nakata. After their <b>release,</b> <b>Ring</b> became an enormous success while Rasen floundered, quickly becoming the [...] "forgotten sequel".|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Keerthy {{worked as a}} child actress in {{a few of her}} father's {{productions}} such as Pilots (2000), Achaneyanenikkishtam (2001) and Kuberan (2002) and some television serials. 11 years after Kuberan she made her debut as a lead actress in Priyadarshan's horror comedy Geethaanjali, in which she had a dual role. She was still studying during that time and shot for Geethaanjali during her semester break. Reviews on the film and her performance were mixed, with Sify writing that she [...] "does put in some effort but make only limited impression in a double role", while Rediff wrote that she [...] "has got a plum role but whether she impresses with her acting prowess is another matter". In 2014, Keerthy had her next <b>release,</b> <b>Ring</b> Master directed by Rafi of Rafi Mecartin duo in which she shared screen space with Dileep. She played the role of a blind girl, which she said was much more challenging than her double role in Geethanjali. The film was a commercial success, being termed a [...] "super hit" [...] by Sify.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Wear loss {{is defined}} as volume, weight and length {{difference}} due to the wear process. In practice, measurement of wear loss is difficult because {{most parts of the}} machine have no simple shape and are not easy or even impossible to measure the changes of volume, weight or length. In this paper, a particular method of wear loss measurement based on computer image collection and analysis was developed to measure the length changes of some particular parts such as ball grooves of the muster clutch’s <b>release</b> <b>ring</b> of a type of tracked vehicle. Macro-surface profiles of a worn surface of a groove on a <b>release</b> <b>ring</b> were taken by a digital camera first and were demarcated. Then worn scars of these digital photos were scaled in length by a computer image processing software of DT vision foundry. The geometrical relationship between wear length and depth was analyzed so that the wear depth was available as well. Results show that the length of the scar is 15. 9 mm and the depth is 1. 48 mm. Then the surface of the wear scar was measured by a type of 3 D laser scanning machine and the points cloud was rearranged and edited by a reverse software of Surfacer. Results of 3 D scanning show that the length of the scar is 15. 7 mm and the depth is 1. 56 mm, which is well consistent with the results of the method mentioned above. It demonstrates the effectiveness and economy of using the method of computer image collection and analysis for wear loss measurement. ...|$|E
50|$|Horowitz and Geissman's first example {{demonstrates}} a possible thermodynamic sink {{to couple with}} the cationic 2-aza-Cope rearrangement, where the product is biased by the phenyl substituent through aryl conjugation, then captured by hydrolysis of the iminium. Other methods of biasing a product include using substituents which are more stable on substituted carbons, <b>releasing</b> <b>ring</b> strain (for instance, by pairing the rearrangement with cyclopropane opening), intramolecular trapping (pictured), and pairing the rearrangement with the Mannich cyclization.|$|R

30|$|We also {{conducted}} multiple assembly experiments {{to evaluate a}} success rate of the proposed method. The number of success was 19 out of 20 trials and the success ratio was 95  %. The failure in our experiments occurred in {{the first step of}} the proposed method. This means that the <b>released</b> <b>ring</b> fell from the shaft. Therefore, the effect of the proposed hollows is verified although the proposed method should be improved. To avoid the failure, the error recovery method should be developed in the future.|$|R

40|$|By using a Swern oxidation-epimerization-reduction {{sequence}} it {{is possible}} to selectively epimerize any position in isopropylidene-protected xylopyranosides, thus forming arabinosides, ribosides, and lyxosides.

Deadline.com attributed the film's poor opening to negative critical reception and lack of award buzz, similar to Gold the week prior.|$|R
25|$|Enediynes {{generally}} {{undergo the}} Bergman cyclization at temperatures exceeding 200nbsp&°C. However, incorporating the enediyne into a 10-membered cyclic hydrocarbon makes the reaction more thermodynamically favorable by <b>releasing</b> the <b>ring</b> {{strain of the}} reactants. This allows for the Bergman cyclization to occur at 37nbsp&°C, the biological temperature of humans. Molecules which incorporate enediynes into these larger ring structures {{have been found to}} be extremely cytotoxic.|$|R
50|$|Not all cyclic {{monomers}} containing an heteroatom undergo CROP. Ring size influences {{whether the}} cyclic monomer polymerize through this mechanism. For example, 4, 6 and 7-membered rings of cyclic esters polymerize through CROP. When considering the ring {{size of the}} monomer, the reactivity toward polymerization is dictated by the ability to <b>release</b> the <b>ring</b> strain. Therefore, cyclic monomers with small or lacking ring strain will not polymerize.|$|R

50|$|During this time, the {{franchise}} also moved into several new spin-off series. The Storybook series, which combines Sonic gameplay {{with the story}} and setting of famous books, comprises two games only released for the Wii: Sonic and the Secret <b>Rings</b> (<b>released</b> in 2007) and Sonic and the Black Knight (released in 2009).|$|R
5|$|Upon <b>release,</b> Secret <b>Rings</b> {{received}} average reviews. Reviewers praised its visual {{style and}} considered the game as a whole to be an improvement from prior entries, but were critical of its controls, which some claimed took time to get used to, and its inconsistent difficulty. Sega released a sequel in 2009, Sonic and the Black Knight; the two form {{what is known as}} the Sonic Storybook series. Sonic and the Secret Rings was de-listed from retailers in 2010, following Sega's decision to remove all Sonic titles with sub-average Metacritic scores in order to increase the value of the brand.|$|R
