40|$|Over {{the past}} several years some very {{interesting}} data relevant to ocean wave backscatter have been produced by non scanning pencil beam radars with high range resolution. These radars are located-on land which overlooks the water/sea surface and operate at low grazing angles (LGA). Prominent among these are the X-band RSRE-Thorn EMI and the LLNL-Hughes real aperture radars employed in the Joint US/UK ocean wave experiments in Loch Linnhe and the Sound of Sleat (Scotland). The range-time image obtained with the RSRE radar is typical of the many images which have been obtained. The most prominent features of these images are linear regions or strips of increased average RCS having temporal durations up to or exceeding 100 seconds. For HH polarization these features are marked by the presence of periodic spikes in RCS. The features appear quite consistent with wave groups which are moving approximately parallel to the <b>radar</b> <b>boresight.</b> A self-consistent model of this wave group behavior, as manifested in the radar images, has been proposed by Tulin. This model provides estimates of the wavelengths involved and accounts for the periodicity of the spiky returns which appear to be due to the passage of nonlinear or incipiently breaking waves through the wave groups. Nothing in this model precludes the presence of multiple wave groups moving at different velocities. In fact, some images exhibit wave groups moving at different velocities, and in some cases both incoming and outgoing wavegroups are present simultaneously. Obviously, X-band Bragg waves cannot explain these features because the lifetime of these waves is, at best, a few seconds. The association of these features with the scattering from the crests of much larger (e. g., meters) waves is reasonable because the lifetime of these waves is very long. However, it is not reasonable to assume that ambient wavegroups in the field of view of the radar all just happen to be moving along the <b>radar</b> <b>boresight...</b>|$|E
40|$|Asymmetries in {{plasma density}} {{irregularity}} generation between the leading and trailing {{edges of the}} large-scale plasma density structures in the high-latitude ionosphere are investigated. A model is developed that evaluates the gradient-drift instability (GDI) growth rate differences across the gradient reversal that is applicable at all propagation directions and for the broad range of altitudes spanning the entire lower ionosphere. In particular, the model describes asymmetries that would be observed by an oblique scanning radar near density structures in the polar cap such as elongated polar patches. The dependencies on the relative orientations between the directions of the gradient reversal, plasma convection, and wave propagation are examined at different altitudinal regions. At all altitudes, the largest asymmetries are expected for observations along the gradient reversals, e. g., when an elongated structure is oriented along the <b>radar</b> <b>boresight.</b> The convection direction that results in the strongest asymmetries exhibits a strong dependence on the altitude, with the optimal convection being parallel to the gradient reversal in the E region, perpendicular to it in the F region, and at some angle between these extremes in the transitional region. Implications for observations of polar patches by oblique scanning radars within the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network are discussed. It is demonstrated that the wave propagation direction relative to the prevalent convection and gradient directions plays a critical role in controlling both the irregularity growth rate and its asymmetries near gradient reversals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{measurements}} and {{models for the}} polarimetric backscatter response of various point targets on roads and road surface faults is presented. Of particular interest are debris and faults {{that could lead to}} fatal accidents and damage of property. A desired safety feature for automotive radar sensors is the capability of detecting such debris and faults. The detectability of a point target is evaluated by comparing its RCS value with the RCS threshold value defined by the backscatter response of the road surface. Extensive backscatter measurements at W-band were conducted to obtain the backscatter response of typical debris and faults on asphalt surfaces at near grazing incidence angles (76 – 86). On the other hand, theoretical models, based on diffraction from impedance wedges and scattering from impedance cylinders, respectively, as well as physical optics approximation, were developed to predict the backscatter response of road surface faults and targets with planar facets on road surfaces. Experimental results indicate that detectability in all cases is a function of target size, its azimuthal angle with respect to <b>radar</b> <b>boresight,</b> and the polarization state of the system. The measured backscatter response is used to verify the validity of the theoretical models. Angular polarimetric backscatter measurements of targets defining roadside boundaries such as a concrete curb, a guardrail, and a pebble surface are also presented. The results of these measurements could be used to alert fatigued drivers should their vehicles be heading sideward. I...|$|E
40|$|A {{spaceborne}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) having pipeline multiple-look data processing is described which makes use of excessive azimuth bandwidth in radar echo signals to produce multiple-looking images. Time multiplexed single-look image lines from an azimuth correlator go through an energy analyzer which analyzes the mean energy in each separate look to determine the <b>radar</b> antenna electric <b>boresight</b> for use in generating the correct reference functions {{for the production of}} high quality SAR images. The multiplexed single look image lines also go through a registration delay to produce multi-look images...|$|R
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and <b>radar</b> engineering, antenna <b>boresight</b> is {{the axis of}} maximum gain (maximum radiated power) of a directional antenna. For most antennas the boresight is the axis of symmetry of the antenna. For example, for axial-fed dish antennas, the antenna boresight is the axis of symmetry of the parabolic dish, and the antenna radiation pattern (the main lobe) is symmetrical about the boresight axis. Most antennas boresight axis is fixed by their shape and cannot be changed. However phased array antennas can electronically steer the beam, changing {{the angle of the}} boresight by shifting the relative phase of the radio waves emitted by different antenna elements, and even radiate beams in multiple directions (multiple boresights).|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} on spatial domain interferometry observations of meteor trail irregularities at a low-latitude location in China was conducted during August 2013 using the Sanya VHF coherent radar (18. 4 °N, 109. 6 °E). More than 3 thousand range-spread meteor trail echoes (RSTEs) were observed. Among the trail echoes, the spatial structure of meteor trail irregularities {{responsible for a}} single long-duration RSTE event persisting for ~ 4 [*]min was reconstructed. This RSTE {{was found to be}} initially generated at 90 – 115 [*]km altitudes and aligned along the <b>radar</b> beam <b>boresight.</b> After about the first minute of the trail lifetime, the trail echo appeared only in a narrow altitude range of 94 – 98 [*]km. An analysis on the spatial pattern of the long-duration RSTE showed that the trail irregularities at lower range gates moved away from the region perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. The eastward drifts of the RSTE irregularities were found to decrease with increasing altitude, e. g., from 80 [*]ms− 1 at ~ 94 [*]km to 20 [*]ms− 1 at ~ 100 [*]km. Simultaneous horizontal neutral wind measurements made with the Fuke all-sky meteor radar (located north of Sanya) recorded a similar velocity profile. We suggest that the neutral wind could drive the spatial structural evolution of the RSTE irregularities, and help to determine the altitudes where the longest portion of the RSTE was located.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1988 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaTraditionally {{telemetry}} trackers {{have not}} been required to provide precision space-position data. Such data, when needed, has required expensive radar or optical support. Currently, {{an increasing number of}} flight test operations have need of precision spatial data, in conjunction with telemetry data reception, in areas where no radar or optical support is available. To meet this need, EMP has carefully combined existing technologies to upgrade the angle output data accuracy of telemetry trackers to the level expected of precision <b>radars.</b> A TV <b>Boresight</b> Camera and video Tracking Error Detector combined with the EMP Model ACU- 6 microprocessor-based Antenna Control Unit provide the means to automatically measure and store all of the systematic bias errors inherent in a telemetry tracking system. The resulting error model is used to provide real-time-data-correction for each error parameter. Video tracking provides correction for dynamic tracking errors in real time.
