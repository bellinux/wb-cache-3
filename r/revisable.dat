5000|$|One needs, first, to get clear {{just what}} is meant by the claim that logic is <b>revisable</b> - and, equally importantly, what is not meant by it. What I mean, at any rate, is not that the truths of logic might have been {{otherwise}} than they are, but that the truths of logic might be other than we take them to be, i.e. we could be mistaken about what the truths of logic are, e.g. in supposing that the law of excluded middle is one such.So a better way to put the question, because it makes its epistemological character clearer, is this: does fallibilism extend to logic? Even this formulation, however, needs further refinement, for the nature of fallibilism is often misunderstood.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to {{primary and secondary}} intersubjectivity, and the contributing dynamics of interaction itself to the social cognitive process, IT proposes that more nuanced and sophisticated understandings of others are based, not primarily on folk psychological theory {{or the use of}} simulation, but on the implicit and explicit uses of narrative. [...] IT builds on the notion that the pervasiveness of narratives in most cultures, from the earliest nursery rhymes to the performances of theater, film, and television, expose us to a variety of characters, situations, and reasons for acting in certain ways. These, combined with personal narratives, provide the background knowledge that allows us to implicitly frame the actions of others in understandable narratives, providing a fallible and <b>revisable</b> sense of what the other is up to.|$|E
5000|$|Nearly all {{philosophers}} {{today are}} fallibilists {{in some sense}} of the term. Few would claim that knowledge requires absolute certainty, or deny that scientific claims are <b>revisable.</b> But many philosophers would challenge [...] "global" [...] forms of fallibilism, such as the claim that no beliefs are conclusively justified. Historically, many Western philosophers from Plato to Augustine to René Descartes have argued that some human beliefs are infallibly known. Plausible candidates for infallible beliefs include beliefs about logical truths ("Either Jones is a Democrat or Jones is not a Democrat"), beliefs about immediate appearances ("It seems that I see a patch of blue"), and incorrigible beliefs (i.e., beliefs that are true in virtue of being believed, such as Descartes' [...] "I think, therefore I am"). Many others, however, have taken even these types of beliefs to be fallible.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{implemented}} {{system for the}} incremental acquisition and revision of lexical entries in HPSG. As a byproduct of parsing, linguistic properties of unknownwords are inferred from their sentential context. After parsing, the corresponding lexical entries are updated accordingly. A key idea of our approach is to employ a gradual, information-based concept of "unknownness", where lexical entries may contain unknown, i. e. <b>revisable</b> pieces of information. <b>Revisable</b> information is further classified into specializable and generalizable kinds. The overall approach is compatible with standard HPSG analyses and poses only a few extra demands on the grammar. These include marking <b>revisable</b> information with one of two distinguished formal types and specifying revisability clauses that provide access to the places of <b>revisable</b> information within the parse result. The update mechanism revises the corresponding places in the lexical feature structures iff the co [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The lexical {{acquisition}} system {{presented in this}} pa- per incrementally updates linguistic properties of unknown words inferred from their surrounding context by parsing sentences with an HPSG grammar for German. We employ a gradual, informationbased concept of "unknownness" providing a uni- Ibrm treatment for the range of completely known to maximally unknown lexical entries. "Unknown" information is viewed as <b>revisable</b> information, which is either generalizable or specializable. Updating takes place after parsing, which only requires a modified lexical lookup. <b>Revisable</b> pieces of information are identified by grammar-specified declarations which provide access paths into the parse feature structure. The updating mechanism revises the corresponding places in the lexical feature structures iff the context actually provides new information. For revising generalizable inlbrmation, type union is required. A worked-out example demonstrates the inferential capacity of our implemented system...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a denition {{of the belief}} revision prob- lem that consists in removing a contradiction from an extended logic program by modifying the truth value of a selected set of literals called revis- ables. The program contains as well clauses with false in the head, representing integrity constraints. Any model of the program must ensure that the body of integrity constraints be false for the program to be non-contradictory. Contradiction may also arise in an extended logic program when both a literal L and its opposite :L are obtainable in {{the model of the}} program. Such a problem has been widely studied in the literature, and various so- lutions have been proposed that are based on abductive logic proof procedures. The system performs belief revision in a society of logic-based agents, by means of a (distributed) genetic algorithm. The problem can be modeled by means of a genetic algorithm, by assigning to each <b>revisable</b> of a logic program a gene in a chromosome. In the case of a two-valued revision, the gene will have the value 1 if the corresponding <b>revisable</b> is true and the value 0 if the <b>revisable</b> is false. The fitness function that is used in this case is represented in part by the percentage of integrity constraints that are satisfied by a chromosome...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} inference {{and statistical}} decision for set-identified parameters from the robust Bayes perspective. When a model is set-identified, prior knowledge for model parameters is decomposed into two parts: {{the one that}} can be updated by data (<b>revisable</b> prior knowledge) and the one that never be updated (unrevisable prior knowledge.) We introduce a class of prior distributions that shares a single prior distribution for the <b>revisable,</b> but allows for arbitrary prior distributions for the unrevisable. A posterior inference procedure proposed in this paper operates on the resulting class of posteriors by focusing on the posterior lower and upper probabilities. We analyze point estimation of the set-identified parameters with applying the gamma-minimax criterion. We propose a robustified posterior credible region for the set-identified parameters by focusing on a contour set of the posterior lower probability. Our framework offers a procedure to eliminate set-identified nuisance parameters, and yields inference for the marginalized identified set. For an interval identified parameter case, we establish asymptotic equivalence of the lower probability inference to frequentist inference for the identified set. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the public debate prior to its {{possible}} ratification, supporters of the European Union Constitutional Treaty (EUCT), among whom all of EU and member states officials, point out the many important institutional improvements the text potentially entails. While only partly accurate, these arguments appear mostly to be of secondary order in view of the basic requirements of political liberalism. In this paper, we try to demonstrate that, at this more fundamental level, both what we refer to as the “principle of integrity ” and the “principle of efficiency ” of collective action are clearly violated in the current (and definitive) state of the EUCT. This violation occurs because the text mixes non <b>revisable</b> public policy decision rules with non <b>revisable</b> public policy decided contents on the one hand, and, on the other hand, because the very rules chosen do not sufficiently allow for the possibility of collective decision in a more than ever numerous and heterogeneous European Union. In order to clarify those two points, we use a “constitutional political economy ” theoretical framework. We finally develop some considerations about the possible co-existence of “integrity ” and “efficiency”, as we define them, in the pseudo-federal regime that characterises the EU...|$|E
