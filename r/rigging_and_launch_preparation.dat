Purpose {{of this paper is}} to describe the status of advancement of SSMS Project design and development activities, in view of the first ride-share flight of SSMS, planned with Vega in 2018. Standardisation of Spacecraft technical, operational and programmatic interfaces were the overarching rules adopted for the SSMS hardware and processes design. Concerning hardware; low cost, simple manufacturing processes, dispenser modularity to adapt to a wide range of possible aggregate configurations were put in place. For missioning <b>and</b> <b>launch</b> <b>preparation</b> processes; support to launch service process cost tailoring, streamline of missioning analyses and aggregate assembly, integration and test phases are tackled. In the context of the currently on going development activities for the Vega launcher evolution, named Vega C, the SSMS ground rules and system requirements went through an evolutionary study devoted to the optimisation of the Project for future Vega C industrial usage. In parallel, design activities are on going to implement the first flight of SSMS with the current Vega version of the launch system in 2018. In order to meet the above needs both the hardware and processes design elements of the SSMS have been redefined, resulting in updated dispenser configuration <b>and</b> redefined <b>launch</b> <b>preparation</b> processes. SSMS hardware is now in advanced status of definition, structural and functional models have been defined and simulation activities for definition of processes are on going to meet the tight launch cost targets imposed by Light satellite missions...|$|R

40|$|In {{assessing}} the bacterial populations present in spacecraft assembly, spacecraft test, <b>and</b> <b>launch</b> <b>preparation</b> facilities, extremophilic bacteria (requiring severe conditions for growth) and extremotolerant bacteria (tolerant to extreme conditions) were isolated. Several cultivation approaches {{were employed to}} select for and identify bacteria that not only survive the nutrient-limiting conditions of clean room environments but can also withstand even more inhospitable environmental stresses. Due to their proximity to spacefaring objects, these bacteria pose a considerable risk for forward contamination of extraterrestrial sites. Samples collected from four geographically distinct National Aeronautics and Space Administration clean rooms were challenged with UV-C irradiation, 5 % hydrogen peroxide, heat shock, pH extremes (pH 3. 0 and 11. 0), temperature extremes (4 °C to 65 °C), and hypersalinity (25 % NaCl) prior to and/or during cultivation {{as a means of}} selecting for extremotolerant bacteria. Culture-independent approaches were employed to measure viable microbial (ATP-based) and total bacterial (quantitative PCR-based) burdens. Intracellular ATP concentrations suggested a viable microbial presence ranging from below detection limits to 106 cells/m 2. However, only 0. 1 to 55 % of these viable cells were able to grow on defined culture medium. Isolated members of the Bacillaceae family were more physiologically diverse than those reported in previous studies, including thermophiles (Geobacillus), obligate anaerobes (Paenibacillus), and halotolerant, alkalophilic species (Oceanobacillus and Exiguobacterium). Non-spore-forming microbes (α- and β-proteobacteria and actinobacteria) exhibiting tolerance to the selected stresses were also encountered. The multiassay cultivation approach employed herein enhances the current understanding of the physiological diversity of bacteria housed in these clean rooms and leads us to ponder the origin and means of translocation of thermophiles, anaerobes, and halotolerant alkalophiles into these environments...|$|R
40|$|The Upper Stage (US) {{section of}} the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Ares I rocket will require {{internal}} access platforms for maintenance tasks performed by humans inside the vehicle. Tasks will occur during expensive critical path operations at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) including vehicle stacking <b>and</b> <b>launch</b> <b>preparation</b> activities. Platforms must be translated through a small human access hatch, installed in an enclosed worksite environment, support the weight of ground operators and be removed before flight - and their design must minimize additional vehicle mass at attachment points. This paper describes {{the application of a}} user-centered conceptual design process and the unique challenges encountered within NASA's systems engineering culture focused on requirements and "heritage hardware". The NASA design team at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) initiated the user-centered design process by studying heritage internal access kits and proposing new design concepts during brainstorming sessions. Simultaneously, they partnered with the Technology Transfer/Innovative Partnerships Program to research inflatable structures and dynamic scaffolding solutions that could enable ground operator access. While this creative, technology-oriented exploration was encouraged by upper management, some design stakeholders consistently opposed ideas utilizing novel, untested equipment. Subsequent collaboration with an engineering consulting firm improved the technical credibility of several options, however, there was continued resistance from team members focused on meeting system requirements with pre-certified hardware. After a six-month idea-generating phase, an intensive six-week effort produced viable design concepts that justified additional vehicle mass while optimizing the human factors of platform installation and use. Although these selected final concepts closely resemble heritage internal access platforms, challenges from the application of the user-centered process provided valuable lessons for improving future collaborative conceptual design efforts...|$|R
