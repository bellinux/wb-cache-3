By using the software FluidSim, the pneumatic sequential operation controlling circuitry with multi-cylinders for driving the flying splicer is designed, in which the air cylinders cooperate to accelerate the new reel to the circumferential velocity of the expiring web, paste the adhesive end of the new reel on the expiring web, and cut off the remaining piece of expired web.

40|$|International audienceThe cost {{of rolling}} is {{determined}} in particular by productivity (i. e. reduction per pass and speed) and lifetime of rolls before regrinding. Adhesive wear {{of the sheet}} gives rise to transfer on the roll surface (called "roll-coating" or "pick-up"). Its occurrence depends on rolling conditions (load, speed, temperature, lubrication) {{and is one of}} the determining factors of the maximal reduction for a given rolling speed. Abrasive wear of the roll is the second factor for roll lifetime. Both phenomena are strongly related to tribological and mechanical characteristics of the surface layer of rolls. Stainless steel is known for its high adhesiveness. As, furthermore, a good surface finish is needed, transfer is the main reason for frequent <b>roll</b> <b>changes.</b> Coatings with good tribological properties (anti-wear and first of all, anti-adhesive) could help extend the roll service. In the present paper, the potential of different PVD coatings (CrN, TiN and TiBN) is explored. The impact of these coatings on influential phenomena during rolling is analysed thanks to well adapted tribological and mechanical laboratory tests. The results show that TiN has a good potential in cold rolling of stainless steel strips...|$|R
