50|$|On 20 November, after loading 97,975 {{barrels of}} black oil from , {{as well as}} a full load of avgas, diesel, and cargo oil, Caliente lay at anchor {{awaiting}} a destination. Ulithi, a <b>regulating</b> <b>station</b> of the Logistics Division, Pacific Fleet, had been deemed safe from enemy interference yet close enough to serve as a transshipment point for the forward operating areas. But on 20 November the Japanese struck at this logistical lifeline. At 0547 hours the oiler , a sister ship of Caliente, was hit by a kaiten, a Japanese manned torpedo, and burst into flames. The Mississinewa was occupying a berth originally meant for the Caliente. Caliente and the other oilers, to protect their volatile cargo, steamed out of the harbor. While at least three of the attackers were sunk the Mississinewa, having just loaded 107,000 barrels of fuel in her hold, exploded and sank, killing 60 of her crew.|$|E

50|$|As part {{of their}} plan, Freudenberg took {{a job in a}} public utility also {{supplying}} natural gas, and the two took an apartment in the East Berlin neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg. In January and February 1989, they began assembling a 13 metre tall by 11 metre diameter balloon envelope out of polythene, which they cut into strips, taped together, and engirded with a string net. There was no basket, only a narrow wooden beam. On the evening of 7 March they decided that the wind conditions were favourable for their escape. They drove to a pressure <b>regulating</b> <b>station</b> in Blankenburg neighborhood to which Freudenberg had the keys and at midnight began to fill their balloon with gas. From some time after 1:00 am the balloon was visible from a distance. A waiter {{on his way home from}} work which had ended at 1:30 am noticed the balloon, and called the Volkspolizei. When the couple heard a patrol car arriving shortly after 2:00 am the balloon was not yet completely filled. Because they feared it would not lift both of them they quickly decided for Freudenberg to escape alone, his wife always having been doubtful. He occupied the beam and cut the tethers. With only one person aboard the balloon had a very high buoyancy and rose fast. Ballast bags hanging down on lines severed a power line shortly after launching and caused it to short-cut and spark. Although East German security had often shot and killed citizens attempting to escape, they decided against shooting because of the possibility of triggering an explosion of the natural gas now leaking. Also, they believed Freudenberg to have been killed by the current which was not the case. Freudenberg's 23 year old wife was able to get back home, where the Stasi were already waiting for her.|$|E

In particular, the developments which {{have taken place in}} the area of microprocessor technology have provided the opportunity to implement improved control strategies in areas where existing pneumatically based systems are somewhat limited in terms of performance.

Soap screening techniques and Gasurveyor 500 series instrument were used in this study for detecting potential leaks. Leaked gas was quantified using either Hi-Flow gas sampler or bagging measurements system. The results show that the respective potential gas leaking point of City Gate Station (CGS), commercial Regulating and Metering Station (RMS), industrial RMS, residential RMS and Town Bordering Station (TBS) / District <b>Regulating</b> <b>Station</b> (DRS) are scrubber dump valve (average leak rate 217. 00 L/min), insulating point (average leak rate 4. 04 L/min), tube fitting connector (average leak rate 8. 00 L/min), connector (average leak rate 1. 55 L/min) and pressure relief valve (average leak rate 437. 92 L/min).

40|$|Abstract We {{report the}} CH 4 {{emission}} flux {{from the city}} of Indianapolis, IN, the site of the Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) project for developing, assessing, and improving top-down and bottom-up approaches for quantifying urban greenhouse gas emissions. Using an aircraft-based mass balance approach, we find that the average CH 4 emission rate from five flight experiments in 2011 is 135 ± 58 (1 σ) moles s- 1 (7800 ± 3300 kg hr- 1). The effective per capita CH 4 emission rate for Indianapolis is 77 kg CH 4 person- 1 yr- 1, a figure that is less than the national anthropogenic CH 4 emission (∼ 91 kg CH 4 person- 1 yr- 1) but considerably larger than the global figure (∼ 48 kg CH 4 person- 1 yr- 1). We consistently observed elevated CH 4 concentrations at specific coordinates along our flight transects downwind of the city. Inflight investigations as well as back trajectories using measured wind directions showed that the elevated concentrations originated from the southwest side of the city where a landfill and a natural gas transmission <b>regulating</b> <b>station</b> (TRS) are located. Street level mobile measurements downwind of the landfill and the TRS supported the results of aircraft-based data, and were used to quantify the relative contributions from the two sources. We find that the CH 4 emission from the TRS was negligible relative to the landfill, which was responsible for 33 ± 10 % of the citywide emission flux. A regression of propane versus methane from aircraft flask samples suggests that the remaining citywide CH 4 emissions (∼ 67 %) derive from the natural gas distribution system. We discuss the combination of surface mobile observations and aircraft city-wide flux measurements to determine the total flux and apportionment to important sources...|$|E

For that purpose, some experiments and numerical simulations were performed to identify the relative effect of several parameters on emergence and amplitude of oscillations. Amplitudes and frequencies of the outlet pressure were especially sensitive to inlet pressure and {{to the size of}} the downstream volume. Amplitudes and frequencies of oscillations were reduced for highest downstream volume, the frequency simulated was generally higher than the frequency measured on test bench.

40|$|The years {{following}} World War II brought new broadcasting stations to a divided Germany, government <b>regulated</b> radio <b>stations</b> in the East and state <b>regulated</b> <b>stations</b> in the West. Radio broadcasts were a significant cultural {{source for the}} Germans in times of reconstruction. Broadcasting stations played much of the familiar Tanz- und Unterhaltungsmusik, reminiscent of earlier times of happiness and prosperity. However, with changes in a new generation’s musical tastes the demand for swing bands declined. Radio stations began to rework their in-house “dance bands” into “jazz bands. ” The West Deutscher Rundfunk (WDR), and other broadcast stations, employed jazz musicians full-time. This thesis investigates {{the development of the}} WDR Big Band as follows: Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the state of jazz and swing music at the end of World War II in Germany. Chapter 2 examines the decline in popularity of swing bands after World War II in Germany and its causes. It examines the transitional years from “dance bands” into “big bands” by studying the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) dance band in Cologne. These changes lay the path for the change to “big bands” during the 1960 ’s. The final chapter presents an analysis of the stylistic changes that the KTUO band made to transform into a big band during the 1960 ’s. It will touch on the collaboration between the KTUO band and the WDR broadcasting station and will then examine {{the early years of the}} new WDR Big Band. I will consider personnel choices and stylistic practices of the WDR Big Band. Further, I will study the later years of the WDR Big Band to the present, including changes in direction and collaborations with American artists. Finally, the third chapter also provides conclusions of this investigation and implications for future research. Advisor: Pamela F. Star...|$|R
