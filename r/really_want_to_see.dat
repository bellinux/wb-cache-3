The theme of waiting is also central to a track that Harrison wrote in 1967 while in the Beatles, [...] "Blue Jay Way", and a similar {{sentiment}} appears in his 1970–71 solo hit [...] "My Sweet Lord", through the line [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you, Lord, but it takes so long". In the latter lyric, Harrison expresses his impatience to see and know God, and Harrison biographer Geoffrey Giuliano interprets [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] as a further reflection of the singer's spiritual concerns.|$|E
500|$|While {{comparing}} the two compositions, author and musicologist Dominic Pedler writes that both songs have a three-syllable title refrain ("My sweet Lord", [...] "He's so fine") {{followed by a}} 5-3-2 descent of the major scale in the tonic key (E major for [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and G major for [...] "He's So Fine"); respective tempos are similar: 121 and 145 beats per minute. In the respective B sections ("I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you" [...] and [...] "I dunno how I'm gonna do it"), there is a similar ascent through 5-6-8, but the Chiffons distinctively retain the G tonic for four bars and, on the repeat of the motif, uniquely go to an A-note 9th embellishment over the first syllable of [...] "gonna". Harrison, on the other hand, introduces the more complex harmony of a relative minor (C#m), {{as well as the}} fundamental and distinctly original slide-guitar motif.|$|E

He {{would go on to}} score four goals in Spain's next three games, including a last minute winner against Belgium. Another goal during a friendly match against Chile saw him end the year with 12 goals, breaking Raúl's record of 10 goals held since 1999. Villa began 2009 with a goal against England in a 2–0 friendly, with this goal, he broke another record and became the first Spanish international to have scored in six consecutive games, seeing off records set by Telmo Zarra and László Kubala. Speaking of the goal, he said, [...] "I am very happy with the goal. Truth is, I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it on TV. The record is very nice.

I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story.

Comparing Kim to comic book superheroine Wonder Woman, Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times wrote, [...] "MOVE over, boy wonders. The newest superhero on the block doesn't need a gimmicky mask or a jolt of testosterone to get the job done ... Kim Possible is ready and able to rescue humankind from evildoers without sacrificing her interest in boys and clothes." [...] However, in her book Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection, author Lyn Mikel Brown dismissed Kim as both a feminist and role model because of her alleged reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the observation that [...] "Her biggest threat is not evil, in fact, but the head cheerleader". Since her debut, Kim has proven herself a popular character among both girls and boys, although McCorkle admitted that [...] "whenever you have a girl in the lead doing all the action stuff, there’s a certain age group of boys who won’t admit they like the stuff.

2500|$|Work on The Settlers III {{began in}} January 1997, {{prior to the}} release of The Settlers II: Gold Edition. Initially, Blue Byte had no {{immediate}} plans to do a third title in the series, but due to the unexpected popularity of both The Settlers and its sequel, Volker Wertich (designer and programmer of the original) and Thomas Hertzler (Blue Byte CEO and the series producer) decided to begin development.

As well as enhancing the graphics and sound effects, and increasing the complexity of the supply and demand-based gameplay, there were also certain aspects of the original with which Blue Byte had been unhappy, and which they hoped to address in the sequel. They also sought feedback from fans of the first game, and worked to deal with anything the fanbase disliked or felt could be improved upon. However, Volker Wertich, who had designed and programmed the original, was not involved with the second game, because, as he describes it, [...] "after two years programming The Settlers, I didn't <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> those little men for a while." ...|$|E

Mother, none of you ever mention whether you get my letters, but I suppose they come safe--it is not impossible I may miss some week, but I have not missed a single one for months past. I wish I could send you something worth while, and I wish I could send something for Andrew--mother, write me exactly how it is with him....

So, Mannahatta, you tear Uncle George's letters, do you? You mustn't do so, little girl, nor Uncle Walt's either; but when you get to be a big girl you must have them all nice, and read them, for Grandmother will perhaps leave them to you in her will, if you behave like a lady. Matty, my dear sister, how are you getting along? I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you bad, and the baby too--well, may-be we shall all come together and have some good times yet.

The treasure, if there is one, will be difficult to find, but I have got nearly a year yet, and if necessary I will spend the whole of it in digging. Dias could go and get provisions for us. Of course he must not always go to the same place. Sometimes he can go up to Huaura, sometimes down to Chancay or Ancon. This place, he has told me, lies a mile or two south of the Salinas promontory, which would partly account for its escaping notice, for the road from Huaura, as we see on the map, skirts the foot of the hill, and goes straight on to Chancay and Ancon, and there is no earthly reason why anyone should go out to the promontory. People here don't leave the roads and travel eight or ten miles merely to look at the ocean, especially when by following the straight line they would see it without trouble. Well, we have both had hard work during the past year, what with felling trees to make bridges, chopping logs for fires, making roads practicable by moving rocks out of the way, occasionally using our picks where Dias thought that there was a lode, and carrying mules' burdens up and down steep places.|$|E
