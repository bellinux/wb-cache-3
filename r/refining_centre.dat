5000|$|Samuel Kier {{established}} America's first {{oil refinery}} in Pittsburgh on Seventh avenue near Grant Street, in 1853. In {{addition to the}} activity in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, an important early oil well in North America was in Oil Springs, Ontario, Canada in 1858, dug by James Miller Williams. The discovery at Oil Springs touched off an oil boom which brought hundreds of speculators and workers to the area. New oil fields were discovered nearby throughout the late 19th century and the area developed into a large petrochemical <b>refining</b> <b>centre</b> and exchange.

40|$|Recently rediscovered by James Knowles, "The Entertainment at Britain's Burse" is {{generally}} considered to be an anomaly, a text designed both to entertain royalty and to praise trade. The work of Janette Dillon and, more recently, of David Baker, however, has suggested the broader significance of Jonson's text, and has demonstrated its interplay with important and culturally shifting concepts of the period, particularly those connected with consumption, exchange, and foreign trade. Advancing from those readings, this article offers a reassessment of The Entertainment at Britain's Burse, examining it as an integral but problematic part of Robert Cecil's rather defensive marketing of the New Exchange as a <b>refined</b> <b>centre</b> of luxury; highlighting, therefore, the tensions and ambiguities implicit in the text's "praise" of Cecil and his new venture. Significantly, the article argues that, in its loaded use of the language of discovery and wonder, in its representation of the Shop Master as a Cecilian figure, and in its evocation of the satirical perspective of Jonson's city comedies, Jonson's entertainment undermines Cecil's strategic fashioning of the centre as a place where all is given not for money but for love, {{at the same time as}} it duly celebrates the occasion of the king's visit to name the newly completed Exchange. Moreover, the article suggests that this multiplying of perspective is achieved via a play on the paradox of luxury as symbolic of both magnificence and vulgarity, and by a complex, simultaneous stimulating and censuring of the spectator's/potential consumer's acquisitive desire for valuable trifles. 19 page(s...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{continuous}} and retrospective passive monitoring techniques have been employed {{in this study}} {{to carry out a}} comprehensive assessment of heavy metal dispersion and deposition from a secondary lead smelting complex. The principal period of monitoring was designed to coincide with contemporaneous changes in the operation of the complex involving, the incorporation of new smelting and <b>refining</b> <b>centres.</b> The initial phase of the sampling programme began with a preliminary multi-element survey to establish the degree of communality between different metals in smelter emissions and their interrelationships with background factors. Heavy metal deposition was monitored at bimonthly intervals over a two year period at 40 bulk precipitation sites located within an area of 250 km[sup]- 2. In a complementary survey suspended moss-bags were collected at bimonthly intervals from 60 sites over a period of one year. Bimonthly levels of Pb deposition at these sites ranged from 7. 0 to 1148 g ha[sup]- 1 in bulk precipitation and 31 to 1792 mg kg[sup]- 1 in moss-bags. The longer term pollution effects resulting from smelter emissions were assessed by determining retrospective heavy metal accumulations in saxicolous lichens and coniferous woodland soil profiles. The results of these surveys have been subjected to a range of interactive computer application packages including statistical analysis, computer mapping and plotting techniques. In the largest of these exercises, a series of 68 two-dimensional and 3 -dimensional computer map projections are used to model patterns of heavy metal dispersion and deposition from the smelting complex. The surface profiles produced in these map projections reveal distinctive patterns of severe fugative pollution close to their source region and highly consistent linear stack emission trends largely moderated by the effects of local topographic relief. Local topographic expression is considered {{to be the most important}} single determinant influencing the atmospheric dispersion and deposition of heavy metal emissions. The development of locally induced wind patterns appear to largely suppress the vertical dispersion of emissions, leading to higher incident levels of heavy metal pollution within the local system of valleys. Relatively low levels of metal pollution were encountered away from these areas of low elevation during the early monitoring phase, but were later supplanted by more acute pollution effects, up to 500...|$|R
60|$|Measurements.--It {{has been}} already shown that when both plots are present (Plate 4, Fig. 8, ~4~), they form the termini of a base line, from which {{any part of}} the pattern may be triangulated, as {{surveyors}} would say. Also, that when only one plot exists (~3~), and the pattern has an axis (which it necessarily has in all ordinary ii and oo cases), a perpendicular can be let fall upon that axis, whose intersection with it will serve as a second point of reference. But our methods must not be too <b>refined.</b> The <b>centres</b> of the plots are not determinable with real exactness, and repeated prints from so soft a substance as flesh are often somewhat dissimilar, the one being more or less broadened out than the other, owing to unequal pressure. It is therefore well to use such other more convenient points of reference as the particular pattern may present. In loops, the intersection of the axis with the summit of the innermost bend, whether it be a staple or the envelope to a rod (Fig. 14, second and third rows of diagrams), is a well-defined position. In spirals, the centre of the pattern is fairly well defined; also a perpendicular erected {{from the middle of the}} base to the outline above and below (Fig. 8, ~4~) is precise and convenient.|$|R
40|$|Robust, accurate, {{real-time}} pupil tracking is a {{key component}} for online gaze estimation. On head-mounted eye trackers, existing algorithms that rely on circular pupils or contiguous pupil regions fail to detect or accurately track the pupil. This is because the pupil ellipse is often highly eccentric and partially occluded by eyelashes. We present a novel, real-time dark-pupil tracking algorithm that is robust under such conditions. Our approach uses a Haar-like feature detector to roughly estimate the pupil location, performs a k-means segmentation on the surrounding region to <b>refine</b> the pupil <b>centre,</b> and fits an ellipse to the pupil using a novel image-aware Random Sample Concensus (RANSAC) ellipse fitting. We compare our approach against existing real-time pupil tracking implementations, using a set of manually labelled infra-red dark-pupil eye images. We show that our technique has a higher pupil detection rate and greater pupil tracking accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} cane sugar from {{its origins in}} the east to {{its status as a}} luxury {{foodstuff}} and even medicine in the medieval period to a commodity produced and consumed globally in today’s world is well known. Yet archaeologically, sugar is an invisible commodity, its presence usually being inferred from the humble sugar pots used in the last stages of its sophisticated production process. This book attempts to redress the imbalance between history and archaeology by reporting on the excavation of a medieval sugar refinery, Tawahin es-Sukkar near Safi, situated south of the Dead Sea in Jordan. There it was possible to explore many of the steps in the sugar-making process. The book’s title refers to the industrial waste whose study has shed light on those steps. To place this refinery in chronological and economic context, excavation was extended to the adjacent ‘support town’ of Khirbet Shaykh ‘Isa; the book presents its results. The available archaeological evidence for sugar production across the Mediterranean is reviewed. There is particular emphasis on the sugar vessels and the light they can shed on the poorly understood relationship between primary production <b>centres,</b> <b>refining,</b> storage and consumption centres. The book, which is fully illustrated, can be profitably read by archaeologists, archaeological scientists, historians and visitors to Jordan alike...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{centre of gravity}} was first {{introduced}} by Clausewitz to military area in his masterpiece: On War. It has been widely used in recent years. However, the interpretations of the concept are seriously confused. Different people and different organisations define the term {{according to their own}} understanding. The problems caused by the confusion of the concept in wars and conflicts demonstrate the imperative to refine the concept. In order to explore the possibility of providing a way out, the thesis follows the theme: theory - practice - theory. It tries to achieve four objectives: concluding the natural meaning of the concept of centre of gravity, finding out the current confusion of the concept, <b>refining</b> concept of <b>centre</b> of gravity, creating a strategy and operational centre of gravity analytical model with the Chaos and Complex Theory, and putting forward some suggestions about future application of the concept. In Chapter One and Two, the thesis analysed Sun Zi, Clausewtiz, Liddell Hart, Jomini, Mao Zedong, John Warden, the US Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Joint Chiefs of Staff's related ideas about the concept. It seems that all of them believe that centre of gravity is where one has to focus his effort, and attacking centre of gravity is the most effective and practical way to realise the objectives. Based on the common understanding, the thesis used Chaos and Complex theory to refine the concept to adapt it to non-linear war, to make it as an objective and effectiveness-oriented concept. A strategic and operational model were built in Chapter Two. From Chapters Three to Six, the thesis applied the refined concept and new models to four wars under the circumstances of limited conventional warfare. Given the fact that the centre of gravity has different characters in different kinds of wars, this thesis selected two short wars (the Falklands War and 2003 Gulf War) and two stalemated conflicts (the Vietnam war, and Palestine and Israel conflict) to conduct case studies. The four case of studies showed that the refined concept and new models were able to principally explain the successes or failures in the wars. The studies also provided some revelations for the thesis to discuss the application of the concept in future warfare. However, the application of the concept is a kind of art, not science. Using it to analyse a historical war or operation is one thing, applying it to direct a war or operation is fundamentally different...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Centre National d' Etudes Agronomiques des Regions Chaudes (CNEARC) (France) (National centre for tropical agriculture studies) is to train scientists {{to be able to}} combine technical production skills with an understanding of economic, social and cultural aspects of rural development. Identification of the skills required, particularly as they relate to small scale farming, has been constantly <b>refined</b> since the <b>Centre</b> was opened in 1981. This has largely been achieved by analysing the cause of the setbacks experienced by many development projects in the past. CNEARC training tackles the problem of lack of knowledge about a specific farming situation by teaching students how to diagnose given physical and cultural environments. Careful attention to this diagnosis will reveal not only how farmers make use of their resources but also the level of farmer knowledge. And an understanding of the reasons guiding farmer practices will provide the basis for development. By relying principally on concepts and on systematic methods of approach, the training allows students to avoid the risk of making simplistic judgements based on isolated, single disciplinary analysis. A frequent cause of project failure is the tendency to concentrate on technical issues which favour the objectives of decisionmakers to the detriment of farmers. An awareness of this risk has led to greater importance being given during the training courses to the roles of the different players in the development process and to methods for ensuring true farmer participation in projects. The teaching methods at CNEARC make use of a number of external contacts, particularly from the world of research since the Centre is in the Agropolis complex in Montpellier, France. This openness provides students with an opportunity to make contact with the many partners with whom they will eventually be working, those responsible for development projects, professional organizations, agencies or financial institutions. Each year CNEARC welcomes approximately 200 students from Europe, Africa, SE Asia and Latin America. The majority of students already have some professional experience of rural development and international' cooperation, although a few come to CNEARC for initial training. Continuous training for scientists or technicians covers a broad range of subject areas of relevance to rural development. Some courses, for example the Masters course on extension and professional agricultural organizations, and the course for training trainers, carry diplomas. The CNEARC mission is to improve international development through training in devel oping countries.
