40|$|Abstract: the {{development}} of electric power and communication technology promotes the apply of cable widely, the trouble of cable become more and more. establish the measure cable breakpoint location range system to locate the breakpoint rapidly, the location of cable breakpoint can be calculated by the interval time that the pulse transmit and receive. All kinds cable be used widely as the electric power and communication technology develop, the core of cable broken is a common phenomenon. And the work of examine and <b>repair</b> <b>cable</b> is more heavy. For the cable lay underground, breakpoint is covered by the protect and shield stuff, simple tools can not find breakpoint, it must adopt special way to measure the breakpoint location. So finding the breakpoint is the precondition to eliminate problem, finding the distance of breakpoint can shorten the measure time, benefit for eliminating problem and reducing loss. 1 Status for measure cable breakpoint location range technology The way to locate the cable breakpoint(cable breakpoint range) can be classify two kind: calculate the breakpoint range by using the information of voltage and current, the second by using exterior signal. The first include travelling wave and impedance method, also can be classify to single port and double port way according to the resource of data; the second include test time o...|$|E

50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>repair</b> ship {{will be sent}} to the {{location}} to drop a marker buoy near the break. Several types of grapples are used depending on the situation. If the sea bed in question is sandy, a grapple with rigid prongs is used to plough under the surface and catch the cable. If the cable is on a rocky sea surface, the grapple is more flexible, with hooks along its length so that it can adjust to the changing surface. In especially deep water, the cable may not be strong enough to lift as a single unit, so a special grapple that cuts the cable soon after it has been hooked is used and only one length of cable is brought to the surface at a time, whereupon a new section is spliced in. The <b>repaired</b> <b>cable</b> is longer than the original, so the excess is deliberately laid in a 'U' shape on the seabed. A submersible can be used to <b>repair</b> <b>cables</b> that lie in shallower waters.|$|R
