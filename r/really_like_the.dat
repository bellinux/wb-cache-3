25|$|In the {{isolation}} he felt after the Börne debacle, Marx's friendship {{came as a}} relief to Heine, since he did not <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> other radicals. On the other hand, he did not share Marx's faith in the industrial proletariat and remained {{on the fringes of}} socialist circles. The Prussian government, angry at the publication of Vorwärts, put pressure on France to deal with its authors and in January 1845 Marx was deported to Belgium. Heine could not be expelled from the country because he had the right of residence in France, having been born under French occupation. Thereafter Heine and Marx maintained a sporadic correspondence, but in time their admiration for one another faded. Heine always had mixed feelings about communism. He believed its radicalism and materialism would destroy much of the European culture that he loved and admired.|$|E
25|$|To gain back {{ground in}} Greece, Germany reluctantly began a Balkans Campaign {{alongside}} Italy which resulted {{also in the}} destruction of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941 and the ceding of Dalmazia to Italy. Mussolini and Hitler compensated Croatian nationalists by endorsing the creation of the Independent State of Croatia under the extreme nationalist Ustaše. In order to receive the support of Italy, the Ustaše agreed to concede the main central portion of Dalmazia as well as various Adriatic Sea islands to Italy, as Dalmazia held a significant number of Italians. The ceding of the Adriatic Sea islands was considered by the Independent State of Croatia to be a minimal loss, as in exchange for those cessions they were allowed to annex all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, which led to the persecution of the Serb population there. Officially, the Independent State of Croatia was a kingdom and an Italian protectorate, ruled by Italian House of Savoy member Tomislav II of Croatia, but he never personally set foot on Croatian soil and the government was run by Ante Pavelić, the leader of the Ustaše. However, Italy did hold military control across all of Croatia's coast, which combined with Italian control of Albania and Montenegro gave Italy complete control of the Adriatic Sea, thus completing {{a key part of the}} Mare Nostrum policy of the Fascists. The Ustaše movement proved valuable to Italy and Germany as a means to counter Royalist Chetnik guerrillas (although they did work with them because they did not <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Ustaše movement whom they left up to the Germans) and the communist Yugoslav Partisans under Josip Broz Tito who opposed the occupation of Yugoslavia.|$|E

[...] He had been offered the nomination for Governor of Massachusetts by the Anti-Masonic Party in 1834; although he was known to be against secret societies like the Freemasons, he refused, and supported Whig John Davis for governor that year. [...] Davis won the election, which was held in November 1834. [...] In February 1835, the state legislature elected Davis to the United States Senate. [...] In an arrangement brokered in part by Daniel Webster, Everett was promised the Whig nomination for governor (a move that upset Lieutenant Governor Samuel Turell Armstrong, who also sought the nomination). [...] Everett easily defeated the perennial Democratic Party candidate, Marcus Morton, in November 1835. [...] He was re-elected by comfortable margins in the three following years, all facing Morton.|$|E

[...] "Anytime you get to work on a period piece, it's more fun," [...] comments visual effects artist Chris [...] "Pinkus" [...] Wesselman, who used archival photographs, postcards, and architectural plans to recreate the Atlantic City boardwalks as accurately as possible. [...] "We got to explore what the old Atlantic City was <b>really</b> <b>like.</b> <b>The</b> piers were one of the toughest parts because every summer they would change – new houses, new advertisements."

500|$|Live was {{released}} to keep Usher's fans satisfied during the four-year break between My Way (1997) and 8701, his {{second and third}} studio albums, respectively. During that time, Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films The Faculty (1998), Light It Up (1999) and Texas Rangers (2001). The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed {{in his hometown of}} Chattanooga, Tennessee on October15 and 16,1998. Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sound of a band, that's one, just for myself, but there were so many people who didn't {{get a chance to see}} the concert, so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album, and I came out with a home video for all the people who didn't get a chance to see the performance, and a little bio of me as well." [...] Seven of the songs included on Live are from Usher's self-titled debut album (1994) and My Way. A medley of songs originally performed by Bobby Brown—"Don't Be Cruel", [...] "Every Little Step", [...] "Rock Wit'cha" [...] and [...] "Roni"—is also featured on the album, along with covers of Force MDs' [...] "Tender Love" [...] and LL Cool J's [...] "I Need Love".|$|E

Additionally, the youth played lacrosse, went swimming, and skating. The following quotations highlight the youth’s perceptions of the variety of activities: “I <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> games and how sometimes we would go places—Oh I <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> swimming activity which was really fun” (Y- 1) and “I liked soccer, racquet hockey—oh and huckle buckle.

500|$|The {{recording}} {{process of}} the album eventually lasted from January to August 2003, with an additional mixing and mastering period lasting until October. Previous Blink-182 sessions were recorded in three months. The band stated that being in a studio longer than three months gave them the luxury of experimenting with different methods of writing, playing, and recording. The band built each song with a minute attention to detail. Hoppus described the studio as a [...] "musical laboratory": over 70 guitars, 30 amps, [...] "30 or 40" [...] different snare drums, up to six drum kits, various keyboards, turntables, and pianos {{were used in the}} album's production, a lot of which came from Finn's personal collection. Barker was responsible for the turntables and a copy of Pink Floyd's The Wall. The group also enlisted the help of James Guthrie, an engineer behind The Wall. The trio also sent The Cure frontman Robert Smith the bed track of [...] "All of This" [...] in hopes he would contribute; Smith makes a guest appearance and recorded his parts in England. The three initially believed their legitimacy would be in question due to the humor-oriented nature of their earlier recordings, to which Smith responded, [...] "Nobody knows what kind of songs you are going to write in the future and nobody knows the full potential of any band. I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> music you sent me." [...] The band also collaborated with DJ Shadow and Dan the Automator, and Barker desired to work with The Neptunes. Jerry Finn, who had produced the previous two Blink-182 albums and the Box Car Racer album, returned to produce Blink-182, which would be his final contribution with the band.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{satisfied}} with the album's keyboard-dominated production nor the band's commercialized image, John Norum decided to leave Europe in November 1986 to pursue a solo career. [...] "I didn't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> direction the band was going in," [...] Norum said, [...] "We became this teeny-bopper, bubblegum band and I hated that whole image, the spandex, poodle-rock type of thing. I was more into the heavier, guitar-oriented stuff {{and it seemed like}} the keyboards were taking over more and more, and we were becoming more commercial. So I decided to leave. I just wanted to move on and do something else." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of the lead single, [...] "Russian Roulette", Harmony was aware of the mixed {{reaction}} from fans who had heard the track. He assured fans that the song was not fully representative {{to the rest of the}} album, though it reflected Rihanna's growth as an artist. In an interview with Rap-Up, Tricky Stewart announced that he had collaborated with The-Dream on the project. He described the album as a whole as [...] "uptempo and edgy", stating that the album is different from her past works. In February 2010, Rihanna expressed a positive opinion on the album, but commented that her future work would be less intense. She asserted, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> bottom, the grime of it. But if I were to combine that with more energetic, up-tempo pop records, then I think that would be a happy marriage. And that's where we'll probably go next". When asked what the most important song to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] and [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] were cited as her favorites.|$|E
2500|$|Structure {{was what}} Allen {{brought to the}} {{screenplay}} for Bob Fosse's Cabaret. The producers hadn't wanted to film the stage script by Joe Masteroff and John Van Druten, and felt that not portraying the male lead as a homosexual was dishonest to the story. They {{wanted to go back}} to Christopher Isherwood's original novel Goodbye to Berlin of 1939, but the Berlin stories weren't structured in any linear fashion and Allen had to diagram the entire story. Allen and Fosse got along badly from the start: she found him [...] "so depressed that it took two hours just to get him in the frame of mind for work." [...] In Allen's opinion most of the humor from the original was lost; she believed Fosse didn't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> lead character of Sally Bowles at all. She worked on the screenplay for ten months, but in the end Fosse and the producers were still unhappy with the final form, and having commitments elsewhere, Allen handed the script over to her friend Hugh Wheeler.|$|E

2500|$|All's {{previous}} albums {{had been}} released through Cruz Records, an independent record label that was an imprint of SST Records. With the commercial success of punk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, All began considering offers from major labels. [...] "Major label talk started probably around '93 or '94", recalled guitarist Stephen Egerton. [...] "We maybe were just looking to sort of {{go to the next}} place, maybe. We had done this slow building up to where as many as a thousand people might be coming to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to see if maybe we could get the records out to more people." [...] "In {{the past year or so}} we've seen bands like Green Day and Season to Risk turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri", [...] remarked bassist Karl Alvarez. [...] "We <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea of getting our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but as it stands now, they are starting to get a little hipper." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1999 Swedish film , Floberg {{played the}} role of Claes, one of two {{fishermen}} who rescues Polish Irena, played by Izabella Scorupco, from the water.

This was the fifth time Floberg played in a film directed by Erik Gustavson, who praised him: [...] " [...] is my Robert De Niro. Our fifth film together. It has always gone well". Floberg, on the other hand, dryly commented: [...] "Yes, I got a phone call [...] this time too". In an interview with Verdens Gang, he elaborated on his relationship with Gustavson: [...] "We have a really good understanding. We talk a lot in codes, and save a lot of time. Besides, I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> way Erik works". Floberg also expressed his satisfaction with playing a [...] "good guy" [...] for once, humorously acknowledging that he is probably considered Norway's [...] "number one movie-psycho". Co-star Scorupco, on the other hand, characterized Floberg as charming, and [...] "easy to fall in love with". In Misery Harbour, a Scandinavian/Canadian collaboration from the same year, Floberg returned to playing a negative character. He received critical acclaim for his depiction of the arrogant literary critic Johan Hoeg, being described as [...] "brilliant", and [...] "taking on the role (...) with razor-sharp spitefulness".|$|E
