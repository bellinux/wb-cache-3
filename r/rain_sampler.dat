40|$|Isotope {{hydrograph}} separation (IHS) {{is a valuable}} tool to study runoff generation processes. To perform an IHS, samples of baseflow (pre-event water) and streamflow are taken at the catchment outlet. For rainfall (event water) either a bulk sample is collected or it is sampled sequentially during the event. For small headwater catchment studies, event water samples are usually taken at only one sampling location {{in or near the}} catchment because the spatial variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall is assumed to be small. However, few studies have tested this assumption. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall and its effects on IHS results using detailed measurements from a small pre-alpine headwater catchment in Switzerland. Rainfall was sampled sequentially at eight locations across the 4. 3 km 2 Zwäckentobel catchment and stream water was collected in three subcatchments (0. 15, 0. 23, and 0. 70 km 2) during ten events. The spatial variability in rainfall amount, average and maximum rainfall intensity and the isotopic composition of rainfall was different for each event. There was no significant relation between the isotopic composition of rainfall and total rainfall amount, rainfall intensity or elevation. For eight of the ten studied events the temporal variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall was larger than the spatial variability in the rainfall isotopic composition. The isotope {{hydrograph separation}} results, using only one <b>rain</b> <b>sampler,</b> varied considerably depending on which <b>rain</b> <b>sampler</b> was used to represent the isotopic composition of event water. The calculated minimum pre-event water contributions differed up to 60 %. The differences were particularly large for events with a large spatial variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall and a small difference between the event and pre-event water isotopic composition. Our results demonstrate that even in small catchments the spatial variability in the rainfall isotopic composition can be significant and has to be considered for IHS studies. Using data from only one <b>rain</b> <b>sampler</b> can result in significant errors in the estimated pre-event water contributions to streamflow...|$|E

Weather parameters such as air temperature, humidity and pressure are also recorded simultaneously. The pH and conductivity measurement data including weather parameters are transmitted to central station using a GSM modem for further analysis.

40|$|The stable {{oxygen and}} {{hydrogen}} isotope composition in precipitation {{can be used}} in hydrology to describe the signature of local meteoric water. The isotopic composition of water vapor is usually obtained indirectly from measurements of δD and δ 18 O in precipitation, assuming the isotopic equilibrium between rain and water vapor. Only few studies report isotopic data in both phases for the same area, thus providing a complete Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL). The goal {{of this study is to}} build a complete LMWL for the lagoon of Venice (northern Italy) with observations of both water vapor and precipitation. The sampling campaign has started in March 2015 and will be carried out until the end of 2016. Water vapor is collected once a week with cold traps at low temperatures (− 77 ◦C). Precipitation is collected on event and monthly basis with a custom automatic <b>rain</b> <b>sampler</b> and a rain gauge, respectively. Liquid samples are analyzed with a Picarro L 1102 -i and results are reported vs VSMOW. The main meteorological parameters are continuously recorded in the same area by the campus automatic weather station. Preliminary data show an LMWL close to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) with lower slope and intercept. An evaporation line is clearly recognizable, considering samples that evaporated between the cloud base and the ground. The deviation from the GMWL parameters, especially intercept, can be attributed to evaporated rain or to the humidity conditions of the water vapor source. Water vapor collected during rainfall shows that rain and vapor are near the isotopic equilibrium, just considering air temperature measured at ground level. Temperature is one of the main factor that controls the isotopic composition of the atmospheric water vapor. Nevertheless, the circulation of air masses is a crucial parameter which has to be considered. Water vapor samples collected in different days but with the same meteorological conditions (air temperature and relative humidity) show differences in terms of δ 18 O up to 3 h. Isotopic ratios in rain events and water vapor are in fact dominated by a seasonal component but outliers are clearly linked to air parcel origin. The monthly measurements of δD and δ 18 O in precipitation of August 2015, for instance, are lower than in colder months, considering monthly average temperatures. Single rain events show a small sequence of precipitation, that leads to 40 % of total precipitation of August, which lowers δ−values considerably. The sampling on event basis during occasional and discontinuous rain also allows to identify the rainout effect, which leads to lightening water during a rainfall. Statistics based on back trajectories (48 hours) show that the major part of air parcels travels across central Europe and derives from sources located in the north Atlantic, whereas, a smaller fraction of the water vapor can be attributed to editerranean sources...|$|E

In the first storm, the dust travelled eastward over Canberra and Sydney, and in the second storm, the dust travelled east/southeastward over Canberra and Melbourne. Rain fell on both cities during the second dust storm.

Due to experimental constraints, modern pollen <b>rain</b> <b>samples</b> are generally collected over shorter timeframes (1 – 3 years) and are therefore less likely to capture the full range of natural variability in pollen rain composition and abundance.

40|$|In mountainous {{headwater}} catchments, {{with their}} high variability of hydrological processes and catchment properties {{together with the}} limited spatial and long-term data, it remains unclear how the different spatiotemporal controls affect runoff generation during base and stormflow. In this doctoral thesis environmental tracers are used to identify sources contributing to baseflow, observe linkages between different landscape units and discern how rainfall becomes stormflow in a Swiss pre-alpine headwater catchment, the Zwäckentobel (4. 25 km 2), with high precipitation amounts (P> 2000 mm y− 1) and heterogeneous catchment properties. The spatially collected rainfall and its isotopic composition are used to test whether {{it is reasonable to}} assume that in small headwater catchments, there is spatially homogenous rainfall and isotopic composition, implying that one sampling location is sufficient. Important tracers in this thesis are the stable isotopes 2 H and 18 O. The collected water samples were analysed with a laser spectroscope. For this analysis it was tested how many measurements are needed to reduce the memory effect and obtain a desired accuracy. For the Zwäckentobel water samples it was sufficient to measure each sample six times while for highly depleted samples the memory effect was reduced only after seven to eight injections. The water samples collected during three snapshot sampling campaigns were analysed for their isotopic (δ 2 H) and hydrochemical components (Ca, DOC, AT, pH, SO 4, Mg and H 4 SiO 4) andcontainedusefulinformationonthedifferentsourcesandhelpedtoidentifythe flowpath of the water during baseflow. Although the six subcatchments had different landscape units, the inter- and intra catchment variability of the isotopic and hydrochemical components was generally small and statistically not significant. Streamwater samples at the subcatchment outlets were more similar to springs near the water divide than to groundwater from observation wells and wetlands. The wetlands, with 30 - 60 % of the subcatchment area and large storage capacity, were less connected and acted as passive features with negligible contribution to baseflow runoff. In five subcatchments of the Zwäckentobel headwater catchment, rainfall and streamwater of 13 different rainstorms were sampled to perform a two-component isotope hydrograph separation. Pre-event water contributions based on δ 18 O or δ 2 H computations were similar. The pre-event water contributions of headwaters depended largely on rainfall (amount and intensity) and varied more between events than between catchments, despite clear differences in land cover between the catchments. With increasing rainfall amount, the proportion of rainfall in runoff increased and changed from pre-event to event water dominated. Antecedent wetness was not found to control the pre-event water contribution. The fact that catchment properties and antecedent conditions were only secondary factors in runoff processes, was mainly due to the dominant and frequent rainfall, which obscured a potential signal indicating differences in catchment properties. At the eight locations sequentially sampled rainfall revealed a spatial variability in total rainfall, rainfall intensity and its isotopic composition. The spatial variability in the isotopic composition varied from event to event. No clear relation between the isotopic composition and rainfall or altitude was observed. The isotope hydrograph separation results varied considerably depending on which temporal weighing technique or <b>rain</b> <b>sampler</b> was used. These results demonstrated that even in small catchments the spatial variability in the isotope composition of event rainwater has to be considered in hydrograph separation studies. When data from only one rain gauge are available, the location of the gauge might largely affect results and this source of uncertainty must be considered. The combination of long-term and spatially short-term hydrometeorological measurements, together with three baseflow sampling campaigns and event water sampling in different neighboring streams and multiple events, complemented each other and helped to overcome individual limitations. The results show the necessity and benefits of this spatially distributed dataset to derive and better understand controlling factors in runoff generation in a headwater catchment with high precipitation amounts and heterogeneous catchment properties...|$|E

40|$|The {{technique}} of on-line flow injection (FI) cobalt-ammonium pyrrolidin- 1 -yldithioformate (Co-APDC) coprecipitation for the preconcentration of trace {{amounts of the}} heavy metals Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn in <b>rain</b> water <b>samples</b> with simultaneous determination by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (KP-AES) has been developed. A precipitate collector system, consisting of a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membrane on a polypropylene support filtering device combined with a 1. 5 m reaction coil, was selected. An inorganic solution of concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide was applied as the dissolution reagent. The technique is characterized by high retention efficiency (which ranged from 77 to 99 % for the six elements of interest), good enrichment factors (ranging from 10 to 50 for 100 s preconcentration depending on the elements studied) and satisfactory accuracy and precision (recoveries from two standard additions to a <b>rain</b> <b>sample</b> ranged from 92 to 104 %, with relative standard deviations ranging from 1. 9 to 5 %).

40|$|Complexation of {{dissolved}} copper (Cu) was {{studied in}} Atlantic coastal rainwater using adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (ASCV) with salicylaldoxime as a competing ligand at pH 7. 8. Detectable concentrations of strong Cu-complexing ligands possessing conditional stability constants of 1013 - 1016 {{were observed in}} over 80 % of the rain events occurring {{over the course of}} 2 year. In 11 of the 23 samples analysed, total dissolved Cu concentrations were higher than those of dissolved ligands, indicating that a significant fraction of the Cu occurred as the free ion and as weaker complexes. In the remaining samples, ligand concentrations were equal to or greater than Cu concentrations, indicating virtually complete (> 99 %) complexation of the ambient Cu. By varying the analytical detection window, two classes of ligands with differing conditional stability constants were detected in selected <b>rain</b> <b>samples</b> suggesting that the Cu ligands most likely represent a spectrum of organic compounds. Back trajectory analysis indicated that continentally dominated <b>rain</b> <b>samples</b> contained higher concentrations of Cu and organic ligands relative to storms of marine origin, suggesting a strong terrestrial and/or anthropogenic source of both Cu and ligands in rain at this location. Variability in Cu speciation may impact a variety of atmospheric redox reactions because free and complexed forms of the metal have very different reactivities. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The optical {{characteristics}} of chromophoric {{dissolved organic matter}} (CDOM) were determined in <b>rain</b> <b>samples</b> collected in Xiamen Island, during a rainy season in 2007, using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy associated with UV-Vis absorbance spectra. Results showed that the absorbance spectra of CDOM in <b>rain</b> <b>samples</b> decreased exponentially with wavelength. The absorbance coefficient at 300 nm [a(300) ] ranged from 0. 27 to 3. 45 m(- 1), which would {{be used as an}} index of CDOM abundance, and the mean value was 1. 08 m(- 1). The content of earlier stage of precipitation events was higher than that of later stage of precipitation events, which implied that anthropogenic sources or atmospheric pollution or air mass types were important contributors to CDOM levels in precipitation. EEMs spectra showed 4 types of fluorescence signals (2 humic-like fluorescence peaks and 2 protein-like fluorescence peaks) in rainwater samples, and there were significant positive correlations of peak A with C and peak B with S, showing their same sources or some relationship of the two humic-like substance and the two protein-like substance. The strong positive correlations of the two humic-like fluorescence peaks with a(300), suggested that the chromophores responsible for absorbance might be the same as fluorophores responsible for fluorescence. Results showed that the presence of highly absorbing and fluorescing CDOM in rainwater is of significant importance in atmospheric chemistry and might play a previously unrecognized role in the wavelength dependent spectral attenuation of solar radiation by atmospheric waters...|$|R
40|$|Solving {{the problem}} due to {{transition}} metals' comigration during electrokinetic injection, the transient isotachophoresis (ITP) procedure {{was developed to}} preconcentrate and focus transition metals during electrokinetic injection. It was found to provide a suitable method for trace metals' preconcentration from rainwater at sub-μg/L level from buffer system consisting of 30 mM hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 0. 1 mM 1, 10 -phenanthroline, 1 % methanol, 15 mM ammonium chloride, and 0. 08 M urea at pH = 3. 7. Trace metals as Cd 2 +, Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Co 2 +, and Fe 2 + (total Fe determined as Fe 2 +) are determined with working range from 0. 5 - 80 μg/L, repeatability less than 7 %, and detection limits from 0. 1 to 0. 5 μg/L under optimized operation conditions as follows: Injection at 3 kV for 40 s prior to CE run at + 15 kV in buffer system developed and with 0. 4 mM tetrabutyl ammonium bromide added to <b>rain</b> <b>sample</b> as terminating ion. Leading and terminating ion effect, buffer additive, and operation conditions on performance of ITP procedure were investigated. Procedure developed was applied for trace metals' determination in rain water collected in Hong Kong. It provides fast, efficient, and economic method determining transition metals in <b>rain</b> <b>sample</b> down to sub-μg/L level, reducing sample pretreatment time and eliminating off-column preconcentration steps often leading to contamination problems for transition metals determination at μg/L level. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rain</b> water <b>sampling</b> {{in marine}} areas was {{undertaken}} by four groups working independently {{at the same}} lime at the same place. The analytical results of the samples collected exhibit large variations and {{the main cause of}} these variations is the "non-rain deposition" as sea salt during the rain itself. The collected water is a mixture of rain water and variable amounts of more concentrated sea salt transported by the wind. This non-rain deposition is influenced by the exposure geometry of the sampler to the wind flow. Because sample conductivity and pH were measured using exactly the same protocol each time, a quantitative model based on simple conductivity and pH measurements is proposed to compute the amount of dissolved sea salt within samples collected under marine conditions. The acid balance of the rain water appears to be not influenced by this non rain deposition. Conclusions given by this work should be taken into account to ensure the data quality of <b>rain</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis, especially if joint comparative experiments are conducted at different sites...|$|R

The {{results suggest that the}} isolate from Kerala is a recently introduced species from Austria. The researchers suggest that the introduction happened through clouds over the ocean - a phenomenon of intercontinental species dispersal previously reported for bacteria and fungi, but first time for the alga.
