40|$|In this PhD Thesis {{the main}} types of the {{atmospheric}} circulation {{evolution in the}} lower and middle troposphere are being defined, that favor 5 kinds of extreme weather episodes in Greece (warm episodes, cold episodes, episodes of extreme rainfall, snowfall episodes and fog episodes). For this purpose two data sets are used a) daily values of meteorological parameters at 16 meteorological stations in Greece, for the period 1 / 9 / 1957 to 31 / 8 / 2002. b) values of meteorological parameters describing the atmospheric circulation in the lower and middle troposphere in Europe and the Mediterranean one day before the initiation, {{the day of the}} initiation and one day {{after the end of the}} episodes. For each of the 5 kinds of episodes, from the first data set the episodes dates are located. On the second data set a methodology scheme is applied that comprises of the multivariate methods of Factor Analysis and Cluster Analysis in order to define the main types of the atmospheric circulation, favoring each kind of episodes. For the warm episodes, the cold episodes, the extreme rain episodes, the snow episodes and the fog episodes, 7, 6, 16, 13 and 10 main types of the atmospheric circulation are defined, respectively. The main cause of warm episodes in Greece is the anticyclonic circulation over Greece, due to the expansion of the Azores Anticyclone. Cold episodes are favored by the combination of an anticyclone in Europe and cyclonic circulation in the eastern Mediterranean. The main cause of extreme rain episodes is a depression in the Mediterranean and a trough in the 500 hPa level west of Greece. Snow episodes are favored mainly by the combination of anticyclonic circulation in Europe and a deep depression in the Mediterranean, which contribute to the advection of cold air masses and to an intense baroclinicity over Greece. The formation of <b>radiation</b> <b>fogs</b> is being favored by anticyclonic circulation and a constant pressure value over Greece. A weak southerly flow of humid air masses can cause advection fogs mainly in the coastal regions and in the islands. ...|$|R

40|$|Stable {{pressure}} systems over interior Alaska sometimes produce [...] prolonged, extreme (below - 40 °C) cold spells at the surface. The {{meteorological conditions}} responsible for two such cold spells are discussed [...] {{in detail in}} Appendix A, where it is shown {{that the rate of}} radiative [...] cooling of the air is enhanced by suspended ice crystals which are themselves [...] a result of the initial cooling. [...] <b>Radiation</b> <b>fogs</b> formed during the onset of cold spells are generally [...] of short duration because the air soon becomes desiccated. These fogs [...] consist of supercooled water droplets until the air temperature goes below [...] the "spontaneous freezing point” for water droplets (about - 40 °C); the [...] fog then becomes an ice crystal fog, or simply "Ice Fog". During the [...] cooling cycle water is gradually condensed out of the air until the [...] droplets freeze. At this point there is a sharp, discontinuous decrease [...] in the saturation vapor pressure of the air because it must be reckoned [...] over ice rather than over water. The polluted air over Fairbanks allows [...] droplets to begin freezing at the relatively high temperature of - 35 °C. [...] Between - 35 and - 40 °C the amount of water vapor condensed by freezing [...] of supercooled water droplets is 3 to 5 times greater than the amount [...] condensed by 1 °C of cooling at these temperatures. This results in [...] rapid and widespread formation of ice fog (Appendix B) which persists [...] in the Fairbanks area as long as the cold spell lasts. The persistence [...] of Fairbanks ice fog depends on a continual source of moisture [...] (4 [...] 1 x 10 ^ 6 Kg H 2 O per day) from human activities within the fog. [...] Ice fog crystals are an order of magnitude smaller than diamond [...] dust, or cirrus cloud crystals, which in turn are an order of magnitude [...] smaller than common snow crystals (0. 01, 0. 1 and 1 to 5 -mm respectively). [...] The differences in size are shown to result from differences in cooling [...] rates over 5 orders of magnitude. Most of the ice fog crystals have [...] settling rates which are slower than the upward velocity of air over [...] the city center. The upward air movement is caused by convection cells [...] driven by the 6 °C "heat island" over Fairbanks. This causes a reduced [...] precipitation rate which permits the density of ice fog in the city [...] center to be three times greater than that in the outlying areas. [...] The inversions which occur during cold spells over Fairbanks begin [...] at ground level and are among the strongest and most persistent in the [...] world. They are three times stronger than those in the inversion layer [...] over Los Angeles. Thus, the low-lying air over Fairbanks stagnates [...] and becomes effectively decoupled from the atmosphere above, permitting [...] high concentrations of all pollutants.

40|$|Little {{is known}} {{concerning}} {{the effects of}} wildfires on tree radial growth and their climatic response under contrasting regimes of fog water inputs on oceanic islands. On Tenerife, Canary Islands, windward slopes are humid with high-fog frequency due to influence of wet trade winds, while climate on leeward slopes is more arid. We used tree-ring records of Pinus canariensis Sweet ex Spreng. to quantify {{the effects of a}} fire of known date on radial growth and determine the main limiting climatic factors for growth. Radial growth patterns and their responsiveness to fire severity and climatic variation differed between windward and leeward slopes. Surface fire did not significantly impact growth, while crown fire caused short-term growth reduction, and even cessation, more pronounced on the windward slope. Growth rates, tree-ring common signal, and climate sensitivity were smaller on the windward slope, with cold winters, and summer water stress limiting growth. On the leeward slope, climate explained a greater amount of growth variation mainly due to negative effects of high October-December sea-level pressures causing dry winter conditions. Contrasting growth dynamics on both slopes may result from diverging physiological effects of water inputs and reduced <b>radiation</b> caused by <b>fog</b> drip.

40|$|The source-oriented Weather Research and Forecasting {{chemistry}} model (SOWC) {{was modified}} to include warm cloud processes and {{was applied to}} investigate how aerosol mixing states influence fog formation and optical properties in the atmosphere. SOWC tracks a 6 -D chemical variable (X, Z, Y, size bins, source types, species) through an explicit simulation of atmospheric chemistry and physics. A source-oriented cloud condensation nuclei module was implemented into the SOWC model to simulate warm clouds using the modified two-moment Purdue Lin microphysics scheme. The Goddard shortwave and long-wave radiation schemes were modified to interact with source-oriented aerosols and cloud droplets so that aerosol direct and indirect effects could be studied. The enhanced SOWC model was applied to study a fog event that occurred on 17 January 2011, in the Central Valley of California. Tule fog occurred because an atmospheric river effectively advected high moisture into the Central Valley and nighttime drainage flow brought cold air from mountains into the valley.

40|$|Net {{ecosystem}} productivity (NEP) was continuously {{measured using}} the eddy covariance (EC) technique from 2003 to 2005 at three forest sites of ChinaFLUX. The forests include Changbaishan temperate mixed forest (CBS), Qianyanzhou subtropical coniferous plantation (QYZ), and Dinghushan subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest (DHS). They span wide ranges of temperature and precipitation and {{are influenced by}} the eastern Asian monsoon climate to varying extent. In this study, we estimated ecosystem respiration (RE) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP). Comparison of ecosystem carbon exchange among the three forests shows that RE was mainly determined by temperature, with the forest at CBS exhibiting the highest temperature sensitivity among the three ecosystems. The RE was highly dependent on GEP across the three forests, and the ratio of RE to GEP decreased along the North-South Transect of Eastern China (NSTEC) (i. e. from the CBS to the DHS), with an average of 0. 77 +/- 0. 06. Daily GEP was mainly influenced by temperature at CBS, whereas photosynthetic photon flux density was the dominant factor affecting the daily GEP at both QYZ and DHS. Temperature mainly determined the pattern of the interannual variations of ecosystem carbon exchange at CBS. However, water availability primarily controlled the interannual variations of ecosystem carbon exchange at QYZ. At DHS, NEP attained the highest values {{at the beginning of the}} dry seasons (autumn) rather than the rainy seasons (summer), probably because insufficient <b>radiation</b> and frequent <b>fog</b> during the rainy seasons hindered canopy photosynthesis.

The slope of NEP that decreased with increasing latitude along the NSTEC was markedly different from that observed on the forest transect in the European continent. Long-term flux measurements over more forest ecosystems along the NSTEC will further help verify such a difference between the European forest transect and the NSTEC and provide insights into the responses of ecosystem carbon exchange to climate change in China...|$|R
