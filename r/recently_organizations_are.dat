40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{importance}} of Big Data and What You Can Accomplish with the data that counts. Until <b>recently,</b> <b>organizations</b> have <b>been</b> limited to using subsets of their data, or they were constrained to simplistic analyses because the sheer volumes of data overwhelmed their processing platforms. But, {{what is the point of}} collecting and storing terabytes of data if you can't analyze it in full context, or if you have to wait hours or days to get results? On the other hand, not all business questions are better answered by bigger data. How can you make the most of all that data, now and in the future? It is a twofold proposition. You can only optimize your success if you weave analytics into your solution. But you also need analytics to help you manage the data itself. There are several key technologies that can help you get a handle on your big data, and more importantly, extract meaningful value from it. ...|$|R

However, this change has introduced legal complications that so far remain unaddressed, for instance regarding the exchange of privacy-sensitive information aimed at rendering a coherent picture of the crisis. This paper examines how information managers interpret legislation during crises. We analyze our results by drawing on Radbruch's tripartite taxonomy, showing that information managers oscillate between the values of certainty of law and purposiveness in regards to legislation, while the value of justice remains remarkably absent in their interpretation. By introducing a legal perspective on crisis information management we provide an important contribution to the crisis coordination debate...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the years}} The Institute of Marine Research, has been {{developed}} to become the leading body for monitoring and exploration of marine ecosystems, development of the aquaculture industry, and science based advices on harvesting of living marine resources in Norway. The institute developed with a steadily growing classical hierarchical organization with departments according to scientific disciplines or ecosystem categories. During the nineties the institute operated with scientific centres on aquaculture, living resources, and marine environment, and received a rather favourable evaluation by an international panel in 2001. Instead of continuing on a recognized way of functioning, a process was started to develop {{the organization of the}} institute to be better able to deliver science based advices according to the ecosystem approach. A matrix organization with four research and advisory programmes, 19 research groups, a research technical department with eight sub-units, a central administration and a research vessel department was implemented in 2004. <b>Recently,</b> the <b>organizations</b> <b>is</b> adjusted and developed even further so that we now have 10 programs, five of them a research and advisory profile, the others a clear thematic profile. The research and technical groups have been integrated to get a better cooperation and social interaction between the scientific and technical employees.

40|$|Introduction <b>Recently,</b> many <b>organizations</b> have <b>been</b> {{attempting}} {{to develop an}} inexpensive "Network Terminal. " Such a device {{would have the same}} functionality as a PC without much of its hardware. In place of the RAM and hard drives that make current mulitmedia PCs so expensive, it would have a widebandwidth network connection and would use network servers to replicate functions previously implemented internally. One design scheme for the Network Terminal is to simply have it display downloaded screen images. This Generic Imaging Terminal (GIT) has many advantages: for one thing, it can be almost as simple as a television set. In addition, the interface is not operating system dependent, so the user could run MacOS, Windows, and UNIX in the same box. The GIT has one major disadvantage, however: uncompressed screen images can be as large as 8 [...] 10 MB. Sending these fast enough to provide full interactivity (10 [...] 20 fps) over today's networks is at best difficult and at worst imposs...|$|R

Especially after the technology boom of the 1980s, {{both sides of the}} aisle have generally embraced the notion that government-funded basic research is essential for the nation's economic health and global competitiveness, and for national defense. That support has manifested itself in an expanding budget—from $1 billion in 1983 ($2.19bn in 2010 dollars) to just over $6.87 billion by FY 2010, (fiscal year 2011 request and 2010 enacted level) stagnating since with $6.9 billion for FY 2013 NSF has published annual reports since 1950, which since the new millennium have been two reports, variously called Performance Report and Accountability Report or Performance Highlights and Financial Highlights; the latest available FY 2013 Agency Financial Report was posted December 16, 2013, and the 6 page FY 2013 Performance and Financial Highlights was posted March 25, 2013. <b>Recently,</b> the <b>organization</b> has <b>been</b> focusing on obtaining high return on investment from their spending on scientific research.|$|R

With regard {{to the demands of}} the globalization era <b>recently,</b> the successful <b>organizations</b> <b>are</b> those which are ruled by figures who have comparative and competitiveness strengths in many fields. In educational context, a leadership can be seen from the practice of school management starting from the basic educational level to the higher one. Educational leadership in the practice of school management expects that the one who plays roles and mandated 2 ̆ 7 as a leader must have specific requirements of a leader. Social life in the globalization era has changed the mindsets and views of the people in the world at any level.
