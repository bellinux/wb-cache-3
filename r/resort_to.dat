5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E
