Gateway had hopes that eMachines' <b>retail</b> <b>channel</b> strength would complement its own strengths in consumer and business direct channels. Through the deal, founder Ted Waitt turned over day-to-day responsibilities and the CEO role to eMachines' CEO, Wayne Inouye, and remained as chairman through May 2005. Inouye announced his resignation as CEO on February 9, 2006; Chairman Rick Snyder served as interim CEO until September 7, 2006, when J. Edward Coleman was brought in as the new CEO. At that point, Gateway still sold both Gateway and eMachines brand computers through retail vendors such as Circuit City, Best Buy, TigerDirect, Walmart, and CompUSA.

40|$|We {{develop a}} dynamic game theoretic {{model of a}} two-echelon system {{consisting}} of two manufacturers and two retailers, where all players are risk averse. Each manufacturer has two pure channel strategies, namely the integrated channel (I) and the <b>retailing</b> <b>channel</b> (R). We mainly focus on how the channel structure strategies and wholesale prices of the manufacturers depend on the risk sensitivity, the pricing power and the purchasing option of the retailer. We derive the optimal decisions for each player and find that: a higher substitutability of the two products implies a stronger manufacturer's motivation to use <b>retailing</b> <b>channel</b> to act against the <b>retailing</b> <b>channel.</b> We further identify {{the effects of the}} retailer's risk sensitivity on the wholesale prices which depend on the channel structure. If the total net price cap for the leader retailer is sufficiently large relative to the follower retailer, then the purchasing option of the retailer affects the supply chain's channel structure significantly.
