500|$|The {{claimant}} {{must first}} {{show that the}} defendant's actions have caused an interference with their use or enjoyment of the land. These interferences are indirect, and almost always the result of continuing events rather than a one-off incident. This interference may be a physical invasion of the land, such as in Davey v Harrow Corporation, noise, as in Christie v Davey, or smells, such as in Wheeler v J J Saunders. The courts have allowed cases where the interference causes emotional distress, as in Thompson-Schwab v Costaki, but have been loath to protect recreational facilities or [...] "things of delight"; things such as the blocking of a pleasant view or a television signal are not considered a nuisance. The latter was discussed in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, where the claimants argued that the blocking of their television signal by {{the construction of the}} skyscraper at One Canada Square was a nuisance. The House of Lords rejected this argument. There are rights to land known as servitudes, such as the right to light through windows or the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> An occupier can also be liable for an interference that is naturally arising, assuming they are aware of the interference's existence and fail to take reasonable precautions, as in Leakey v National Trust, which established that in such situations [...] "the standard ought to be to require of the occupier what is reasonable to expect of him in his individual circumstances". This principle was extended in Holbeck Hall Hotel v Scarborough Borough Council, where the Court of Appeal said that if a landowner knows or ought to know that their property may cease to support another's, they are required to take reasonable precautions or they will be liable.|$|E
5000|$|Easements {{are also}} {{separate}} from natural rights, which operate universally {{and do not}} have to be created. Some natural rights appear similar to easements. For example, there is a natural right to support of one's land. This does not, however, extend to buildings upon the land or the consequences on the land of building upon it. The operate of prescription to bring about a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> of buildings as well as land in the form of an easement limits the operation of this natural right, however. Natural rights are only actionable after the fact [...] - [...] where damage has already occurred; the neighbouring landowner cannot be compelled to take preventative steps or give support in any particular fashion. The right to water from a stream or river is another natural right which may be extended through the operation of an easement. Easements in this area must also be considered in light of statutory regimes, particularly in the commercial context. There is also a public right to fish and navigate on the foreshore, although this is limited in several respects.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to untangle}} the different court decision in first instance of religious courts in West Sumatra regarding past spousal support (nafkah madhiah) to former wife. Such unified decisions bring about negligence of wife 2 ̆ 7 s and children 2 ̆ 7 s <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> This research uses the religious court archives on past spousal support {{as the main}} data. The judge decision and its reason, pattern of logic and type of protection are critically analyzed {{in relation to the}} existing regulation and law. There are a huge number of husbands who ignore and leave their wives and children without financial support. They repudiate their wives and propose the petition to court. When appearing at court to respond the petition, women usually reclaim spousal support if the petition will be granted. However, judges often respond to such women 2 ̆ 7 s claim differently. Judge may approve women 2 ̆ 7 s demand while others reject them. As a result, wives and children face the most critical situation upon court decision. It is therefore urgent to offer legal aid and protection of women and their children in a post-repudiation court decision...|$|E

The actor also worked as a Casting Director for Chaplin in The Circus, City Lights, and Modern Times.
