40|$|The {{installation}} of a <b>raised</b> <b>floor</b> system can change the thermal behaviour of the building by reducing {{the interaction between the}} heat gains and the thermally massive concrete slab. In this study, the influence of the <b>raised</b> <b>floor</b> on the summer design day zone cooling load profile is evaluated for an office building located in San Francisco by using the whole-building energy simulation program, EnergyPlus. The zone cooling load profiles and the thermal performance with and without the <b>raised</b> <b>floor</b> are compared and analyzed. The effects of structure type, windowto- wall ratio and the presence of carpet on the thermal behaviour of the <b>raised</b> <b>floor</b> are also investigated. The results show that the mere presence of the <b>raised</b> <b>floor</b> largely affects the zone cooling load profile and the peak cooling load over the range of - 7 % to + 40 %. The most significant parameters are the zone orientation, i. e. the exposure to direct solar radiation, and the presence of floor carpeting. If carpeting is present, commonly used in U. S. office buildings, the overall impact on zone peak cooling load is reduced, ranging from 0 to 5 % greater for the <b>raised</b> <b>floor</b> than without it. Without carpet the peak cooling load is 4 % greater with <b>raised</b> <b>floor</b> than without it in the north zone, 22 % in the east and west zones, and 12 % in the south zone...|$|R

The building was built by Morgan/Harbour Construction and has earned LEED® Gold Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. [...] Some of its green features include sunshades on exterior windows and <b>raised</b> <b>flooring.</b> The sunshades on the exterior windows reduce the amount of energy needed to warm and cool the office by offering a natural way to control temperature.

50|$|In the U.S., {{underfloor}} {{air distribution}} {{is becoming a}} more common way to cool a building by using the void below the <b>raised</b> <b>floor</b> as a plenum chamber to distribute conditioned air, which {{has been done in}} Europe since the 1970s. In data centers, isolated air-conditioning zones are often associated with <b>raised</b> <b>floors.</b> Perforated tiles are traditionally placed beneath computer systems to direct conditioned air directly to them. In turn, the computing equipment is often designed to draw cooling air from below and exhaust into the room. An air conditioning unit then draws air from the room, cools it, and forces it beneath the <b>raised</b> <b>floor,</b> completing the cycle.|$|R

50|$|A {{raised floor}} (also <b>raised</b> <b>flooring,</b> access floor(ing), or raised access {{computer}} floor) provides an elevated structural floor above a solid substrate (often a concrete slab) {{to create a}} hidden void for the passage of mechanical and electrical services. Raised floors are widely used in modern office buildings, and in specialized areas such as command centers, IT data centers and computer rooms, {{where there is a}} requirement to route mechanical services and cables, wiring, and electrical supply. Such flooring can be installed at varying heights from 2 in to heights above 4 ft to suit services that may be accommodated beneath. Additional structural support and lighting are often provided when a floor is raised enough for a person to crawl or even walk beneath.|$|E
50|$|There are {{specific}} practices {{that must be}} followed to properly maintain the litter and maximize the health and productivity of the flocks raised on it. Many factors {{must be considered in}} successful litter management including time of the year, depth of the litter, floor space per bird, feeding practices, disease, the kind of floor, ventilation, watering devices, litter amendments, and even the potential fertilizer value of the litter after it is removed from the house. Most poultry are grown on dirt floors with some type of bedding material. Concrete floors and some specialized <b>raised</b> <b>flooring</b> are used at some facilities. In many areas of the United States, shavings from pine or other soft woods have historically been the bedding of choice for poultry production. Regionally, other materials have been the bedding material of choice due to regional cost and availability, such as rice hulls in the lower Mississippi River poultry production areas of Arkansas and Mississippi.|$|E
50|$|Cooling load {{profiles}} for UFAD {{systems and}} overhead systems are different, mainly {{due to the}} thermal storage effect of the lighter-weight raised floor panels compared to the heavier mass of a structural floor slab. The mere presence of the raised floor reduces {{the ability of the}} slab to store heat, thereby producing for the system with a raised floor higher peak cooling loads compared to the system without a raised floor. In the OH system, particularly in perimeter zones, part of the incoming solar heat gain is stored in the floor slab during the day, thus reducing peak zone cooling loads, and released at night when the system is off. In a UFAD system, the presence of the <b>raised</b> <b>flooring</b> transforms the solar absorbing massive floor slab into a lighter weight material, leading to relatively higher peak zone cooling loads. A modeling study based on EnergyPlus simulations showed that, generally, UFAD has a peak cooling load 19% higher than an overhead cooling load and 22% and 37% of the total zone UFAD cooling load goes to the supply plenum in the perimeter and interior, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Frequent {{changes in}} {{arrangement}} in office {{space and the}} huge amount of cables {{brought about by the}} extensive use of computers make the implementation of <b>raised</b> <b>flooring</b> a necessity in modern office buildings. Underfloor ventilation systems that make use of the underfloor plenum for conditioned air distribution will therefore increase in popularity as they extend the flexibility of building services and take advantage of the raised floor to accommodate the HVAC system. Previous research has revealed that the top return type underfloor system saves a significant amount of energy, as the supply air temperature can be higher than that in a ceiling-based system. However, thermal discomfort due to temperature non-uniformity was also reported. This paper presents the experiment results of a laboratory study of the thermal performance for a floor return (FR) type underfloor system under different heat load densities and supply air temperatures. Vertical temperature differences and air velocities were found to be within the comfort limits stated in major international standards. The measured predicted mean vote and predicted percentage of dissatisfied values also satisfied the ISO Standard 7730. A comfortable environment was maintained by the FR type system under a dense internal heat load and with the supply air temperature set at as high as 18 degreesC. Copyright © 2002 S.
