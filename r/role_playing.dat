The study treats “reuse ” on two levels: reuse of an existing online <b>role</b> <b>play</b> and reuse of an online <b>role</b> <b>play</b> as the model for another <b>role</b> <b>play.</b> In keeping with terminology that has come into recent use, we propose that the first level implies the online <b>role</b> <b>play</b> is used as a Learning Object and the second level implies the online <b>role</b> <b>play</b> is used as a Learning Design. Thirty six <b>role</b> <b>plays</b> were identified in Australian universities of which 80 % were reuse of a Learning Design.

Data were collected by developing a survey that focused on perceived learning, participation and satisfaction.

40|$|Background: At KIST Medical College, Lalitpur, Nepal, a Medical Humanities module {{for first}} year medical {{students}} has been conducted. <b>Role</b> <b>plays</b> {{are used to}} explore social, medical and sexual issues in the Nepalese context.

Method: The module was conducted from January to August 2011 using a total of 15 <b>role</b> <b>plays.</b> Student feedback was obtained using a semi-structured questionnaire. Informal discussions were held and a questionnaire was circulated among the first year students {{who had participated in}} the module. Results: Ninety-eight of the 100 students in the module participated in the study. The overall opinion regarding the <b>role</b> <b>plays</b> was positive. Students stated <b>role</b> <b>plays</b> helped to make module objectives concrete and interesting, made students identify with the problem being investigated and improved communication skills. <b>Role</b> <b>plays</b> were designed to address important health issues in Nepal and prepare students for addressing these issues in future practice.

40|$|Speaking is {{perceived}} to be one primary target of the L 2 learners including those in ESP. To achieve this target, appropriate methods of teaching are required. This study aims to describe the use of <b>role</b> <b>play</b> as an alternative for teaching speaking especially to the students in ESP. It is a literature review which attempts to present ideas concerning the benefits of <b>role</b> <b>play,</b> the stages of implementation, and also the limitations in practice. Journal articles and book references are mainly the source of this study. <b>Role</b> <b>play</b> can function as an effective method that any ESP teachers can use in their teaching practice. It gives students more chances to act and interact with their partners and also lightens up the atmospheres and brings liveliness in the classes. Moreover, it enhances the students’ positive attributes such team work, confidence and critical thinking that make them more aware of the usefulness and practicality of English. Six stages of using <b>role</b> <b>play</b> for teaching practice are alternatively proposed. They cover (1) deciding the teaching material, (2) selecting the situation and creating the dialog, (3) teaching dialog for <b>role</b> <b>play,</b> (4) having students practice the <b>role</b> <b>play,</b> (5) having students modify the situation and dialog, and (6) evaluating and checking students' comprehension. Though <b>role</b> <b>play</b> may serve a good alternative, it may also be time consuming and pose problems of logistics and space. Considering its many benefits, <b>role</b> <b>play</b> can be a good alternative for teachers to vary their teaching practice. Keywords: teaching speaking, ESP, <b>role</b> <b>play...</b>|$|R

40|$|Most of the Senior High School Students still cannot {{communicate}} in English {{although they have}} learned it for six years; i. e., in the "SMP" and "SMU". It {{is due to the}} fact that the time allocated for mastering speaking skill is limited. It seems that the English teacher seldom gives speaking class to his students. As the consequence, the students cannot develop their oral communicative competence. Oral Communicative Competence is an ability to choose the language forms and use them orally in appropriate situations. To solve this problem, in this thesis the writer suggests the English teachers to use <b>role</b> <b>play.</b> The using of this technique is based on the communicative approach as what has been stated in 1994 Senior High School curriculum. Here, the writer suggests to use <b>role</b> <b>play</b> because <b>role</b> <b>play</b> has some advantages that can develop students' speaking ability (oral communicative competence). The advantages are: (1) <b>Role</b> <b>play</b> motivates the students to take part actively in communication activity through their <b>roles.</b> (2) <b>Role</b> <b>play</b> closely relates to the outside world, so motivates and gives opportunities for the students to practice English as if they were in a real situation. (3) <b>Role</b> <b>play</b> helps the students to use the verb forms and vocabularies in appropriate way and manner in the right place according to a certain situation. (4) <b>Role</b> <b>play</b> makes the students resourceful and have self assurance in expressing themselves in various situations. On the other hand, the disadvantage of <b>role</b> <b>play</b> is <b>role</b> <b>play</b> tends to use large amount of time space and people. In order to apply the contribution of <b>role</b> <b>play</b> in the teaching of speaking, the writer put forwards three suggested steps. They are: (1) Preparation in which the teacher prepares the topic and situation. (2) Presentation which includes activities that lead students to {{communicate in}} the form of a <b>role</b> <b>play.</b> (3) Evaluation in which the teacher evaluates the student's communicative competence: the grammatical sentence, pronunciation, and useful expressions...|$|R
