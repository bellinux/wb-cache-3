It was the last vehicle, an attempt at a standardized light rail vehicle promoted by the federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration, that led to the company's ending rail production due to myriad problems. This cost Boeing and the vehicle's two buyers, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and San Francisco Municipal Railway millions and led to premature retirement of the vehicles.|$|E

40|$|The 1993 {{reform of}} rail {{transport}} in Great Britain {{led to an}} outright break-up of the British Rail vertically integrated monopoly. All railway activities have been isolated and divided among private operators whose relationships are determined by contracts. This paper examines the relevance of a vertical separation between train operations and rolling stock ownership and the stability of this new structure. Transaction cost theory, which mainly concentrates on vertical integration and contractual coordination issues, provides a relevant analytical framework. It is argued that the disintegrated governance structure is not suitable to {{the features of the}} relationships between lessors and lessees of rolling stock. Moreover, the coordinative mechanisms of existing leases cannot solve the problems caused by vertical separation. Therefore, operators have adapted the structure and change the characteristics of the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> transactions. vertical integration, public utilities reform, transaction cost economics...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to permit an {{approach}} for: (1) selecting a maintenance strategy for <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> and (2) obtaining possible spare parts' quantities and replacement intervals for the components of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> The methodology adopts an analytic network process (ANP) technique for the strategy evaluation, because ANP considers the important interactions among evaluation factors. The ANP's result decides upon a proper <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> maintenance strategy formed by various combinations of preventive maintenance (PM) and corrective maintenance (CM). The ratio PM/CM, obtained by ANP, can help to predict spare parts' quantities of the components of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> The empirical result also indicates that preventive maintenance should be much more valued than corrective maintenance. In addition, safety is considered the most crucial factor for the selection of a <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> maintenance strategy.
