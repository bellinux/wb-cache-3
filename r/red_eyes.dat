40|$|Background: Red eye is a {{very common}} {{presenting}} complaint in clinical practice among all age groups, including adolescents. Health habits formed during adolescence is carried to adulthood and is often a consequence of their perception. This study, therefore, determined the perception of students toward the <b>red</b> <b>eye.</b> Aim: To determine the perception of <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> and its associated factors among secondary school students in Sagamu. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out among 1082 senior secondary school students in Sagamu local government area, using a semi-structured self-administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 20. Relevant descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated. Results: The mean age of respondents was 15. 27 ± 1. 48 years. There were more females (54. 8 %) than males. Majority (81 %) had heard of <b>red</b> <b>eye,</b> and this was mainly from neighbors; 58. 4 % felt they could not contact <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> from an infected person. About 35 % would instill onion {{if they had a}} <b>red</b> <b>eye.</b> About 50. 2 % felt <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> could lead to blindness. Awareness of <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> was associated with age (P = 0. 005), but not with sex and religion. Among respondents, 95. 5 % and 96. 2 % had a poor perception as well as a poor attitude toward <b>red</b> <b>eye,</b> respectively. Conclusion: The perception and attitude of senior secondary school students in Sagamu to <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> is poor. Appropriate eye health education and promotional services, including periodic eye examination of students, should be carried out in school health services.

A wide spectrum of diseases may cause a <b>red</b> <b>eye.</b> Fortunately, most are relatively benign, but many potentially sight-threatening conditions may manifest in a similar way. From the history and examination, the primary care physician {{must be able to}} differentiate between features that make primary care treatment possible and high-risk features that necessitate immediate referral. This article includes a discussion on features that distinguish benign from sight-threatening causes of <b>red</b> <b>eye.</b> Unilateral <b>red</b> <b>eye,</b> pain (a deep ache), deep redness, decreased visual acuity and photophobia signify more sinister causes. The <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> has an extensive differential diagnosis. Some of the common causes are conjunctivitis, subconjunctival haemorrhage, episcleritis, scleritis, anterior uveitis and acute glaucoma. Generally, patients who present with <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> can be divided into two groups: those who can be treated at primary care level and those who need secondary or tertiary level care. Other distinguishing features include a pattern to the redness, the type of discharge, the presence of increased lacrimation and photophobia, as well as corneal haze. However, these are not always easily employed as differentiating factors.

40|$|Background : Red eye is {{the main}} sign of ocular {{inflammation}} rsulted from external <b>eye</b> vessels dilatation. <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> {{is one of the}} most common complaints in patients referring to eye clinics which can be a sign of wide variety of ocular problems, from mild conjunctivitis to vision- threatening infections, diseases or trauma. Most disorders characterized by a <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> are relatively benign. But more serious causes may be misdiagnosed from the Self-Limited ones. Inappropriate or delayed management may result in serious visual problems. This study was conducted to survey the effect of the variation of season on the causes of <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> and the ability of general practitioner on its management in 2004 at Shaheed Rahnemoon Hospital-Yazd. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive case series study, 400 patients with <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> referred to eye clinic in summer and winter of 2004 were evaluated. The <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> criterion was episcleral or conjunctiva hyperemia that changes the external eye color which was detected by observation and slit lamp examination. Data were collected through questionnaires and analyzed by SPSS software and chi-square test. Results: The patients were classified in three age groups: less than 15 years (18), 15 - 39 years (51. 5) and more than 40 years (30. 5). In two first age groups conjunctivitis and trauma were the most common causes of the <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> while in the third age group conjunctival degenerative changes were most frequent. Conjunctivitis was the most common cause of the <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> (35. 8) and other causes were trauma (22) and conjunctival degenerative changes (15). 59 of patients were males and 41 were females. Conjunctivitis was the most common cause of <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> in both genders (P. V= 0 / 000). Irritation was the most common symptom (91. 3), followed by tearing (85. 8) and itching (68. 8) (P. V= 0. 000). There was no relationship between the causes of <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> and the variation of seasons. Conclusion: The <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> was more frequent in males than in female and there was no difference between the causes in two seasons. The most common causes of <b>red</b> <b>eye</b> are conjunctivitis, trauma, and conjunctival desenerative changes. Uncommon but high risk cases such as uveitis, scleritis and hidden globe rupture must be referred to ophthalmology at once to prevent serious consequences.

5|$|A smallish crake, the African crake has brown-streaked blackish upperparts, bluish-grey underparts and {{black-and-white}} barring on {{the flanks}} and belly. It has a stubby red bill, <b>red</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and a white}} line from the bill to above the eye. It is smaller than its closest relative, the corn crake; that species is also lighter-plumaged, and has an eye stripe. The African crake has a range of calls, the most characteristic being a series of rapid grating krrr notes. It is active during the day, and is territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male has a threat display, and may fight at territory boundaries. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves built in a depression under a grass tussock or small bush. The 3–11 eggs start hatching after about 14 days, and the black, downy precocial chicks fledge after four to five weeks. The African crake feeds {{on a wide range}} of invertebrates, along with some small frogs and fish, and plant material, especially grass seeds. It may itself be eaten by large birds of prey; snakes; or mammals, including humans, and can host parasites. Although it may be displaced temporarily by the burning of grassland, or permanently by agriculture, wetland drainage or urbanisation, its large range and population mean that it is not considered to be threatened.|$|E

5|$|The best {{documented}} {{account of}} these hauntings occurred between 1968 and 1970. The Evening Herald and Evening Press newspapers carried a number of reports regarding a Mrs Margaret O'Brien and her husband Nicholas, a retired Garda superintendent, who were converting the house into an arts centre. The redevelopment had been a troubled affair with tradesmen employed on the work leaving complaining of ghosts. One night, {{a friend of the}} O'Brien's, artist Tom McAssey, and two workmen were confronted by a spectral figure and a black cat with glowing <b>red</b> <b>eyes.</b> McAssey painted a portrait of the cat which hung in the house for several years after. Although locals were sceptical of the reports, further apparitions were reported, most notably of an Indian gentleman and of two nuns called Blessed Margaret and Holy Mary who had taken part in black masses on Mount Pelier Hill. There were also reports of ringing bells and poltergeist activity. In 1970 an RTÉ television crew recorded a documentary at the house. In the documentary a clairvoyant called Sheila St. Clair communicated with the spirits of the house through automatic writing. In 1971, a plumber working in the house discovered a grave with a skeleton of a small figure, most likely that of a child or, perhaps, the body of the dwarf alleged to have been sacrificed by the members of the Hell Fire Club. The house operated as a restaurant in the 1990s before closing in 2001; it is now a private residence.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} the specimen, van Grouw {{noticed that the}} legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions. The short feathering of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in life, not the outer. The plate accompanying Forbes' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side, and depicts the legs as pinkish, whereas they are yellow in the skin. The spotted green pigeon has at times been described as having a knob {{at the base of}} its bill, {{similar to that of the}} Nicobar pigeon. This idea seems to have originated with Forbes, who had the bird depicted with this feature, perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of Caloenas; it was depicted with a knob as late as 2002. This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess a knob, and Latham did not mention or depict this feature, so such depictions are probably incorrect. The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin, but red paint around the right eye-socket suggests that it was originally intended to have <b>red</b> <b>eyes.</b> It is unknown whether this represents the natural eye colour of the bird, yet the eyes were also depicted as red in Latham's illustration, which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen. Forbes had the iris depicted as orange and the skin around the eye as green, though this was probably guesswork.|$|E
