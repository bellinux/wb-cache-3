She stated that she loved France, her street, her café, and not having to use a car. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>go</b> on to work on a big budget American film after Inglourious Basterds, her next role was in a small theater piece in France.|$|E
5|$|As Ricko {{finishes}} his confession, the police arrive and he realises that Jared has turned him in. He attempts to escape {{but the police}} give chase and corner him on a cliff. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>go</b> to jail, and ignoring Jared's screams of protest, he jumps to his death. In the weeks that follow, Jared's life collapses. Despite learning of Diane's illness, he moves out of her house, choosing instead to be homeless. Jared returns home one day to collect his belongings; after arguing with Diane, he confesses that he witnessed Tracy's rape and could have saved her life if he had intervened or helped her afterwards. Later that day, Jared joins Diane and Cherie in cleaning graffiti from Tracy's grave.|$|E

Richard et al, (2002) mentioned that they are caused ‘’by extension of target language rules to inappropriate context.’’ (P.185). this kind of errors have been committed while dealing with regular and irregular verbs, {{as well as the}} application of plural forms.

5|$|Although {{interest}} in the P-class ships and the battlecruiser proposal waned {{for a time in}} late 1937 and early 1938, it was quickly revived on 28 April 1938 with Hitler's public airing of his views on the 1935 Anglo-German Treaty and the consequent increased possibility of war with the United Kingdom. Calling the Naval Staff and Admiral Erich Raeder to him, Hitler laid out his thoughts of a strong navy that could pose enough danger to the British such that they would enter into an alliance with Germany <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>go</b> to war. As decided here, Plan Z entailed two task forces each centered on three H-class battleships and one aircraft carrier, with cruisers and destroyers as escorts. In war, these forces would collaborate with the three battlecruisers by occupying convoy screens while U-boats and {{one or more of the}} O class took out the cargo-carrying merchant ships. The presence of the battlecruisers operating at large would have the secondary effect of forcing the Royal Navy to deploy battleships as convoy escorts, thus weakening any fleet that could engage the Plan Z task forces.|$|E

The {{assistant}} coach of the school's hockey team was Ray Bourque, a former NHL defenseman who {{was elected to the}} Hockey Hall of Fame. Bogosian's teammates at Cushing included his older brother, Aaron, and Bourque's son, Ryan. While at Cushing he was used mostly as a fifth or sixth defenseman and played few minutes as a result. After his second year at the school, Bogosian was selected 19th overall in the 2006 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Draft by the Peterborough Petes Bogosian's decision to play in the OHL <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>go</b> to the NCAA differed from most of his teammates, including his brother.

40|$|Cavafy's (1961) famous poem {{describes}} the paralysis induced when {{waiting for an}} event that never happens, finding distraction in other things while expecting imminent cataclysm. Libraries have perhaps been guilty of this in recent years, joining the chorus bemoaning the imminent arrival of the digital barbarians and undertaking {{a whole series of}} avoidance tactics which make libraries ever more efficient but ever less relevant. Like Cavafy's senators, libraries have prepared themselves, decked themselves in finery but have waited for the future to come to them <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>gone</b> out to engage with it...|$|R

The result was a small wooden aircraft with a high-set front wing and low-set rear wing, fixed tricycle undercarriage, and pusher propeller, with the engine {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and the pilot sitting in the front of the fuselage.|$|E

25|$|The {{weakness}} of the muscles involved in swallowing may lead to swallowing difficulty (dysphagia). Typically, this means that some food may {{be left in the}} mouth after an attempt to swallow, or food and liquids may regurgitate into the nose <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>go</b> down the throat (velopharyngeal insufficiency). Weakness of the muscles that move the jaw (muscles of mastication) may cause difficulty chewing. In individuals with MG, chewing tends to become more tiring when chewing tough, fibrous foods.

On a chance meeting with then head of Naruto stable, the former yokozuna Takanosato, the head of the stable convinced Hagiwara's initially skeptical parents that he was a great candidate for sumo. Hagiwara eventually joined the stable upon finishing junior high school.
