5|$|The Denny Substation {{will have}} an initial {{capacity}} of 50 Megavolt-ampere (MVA), and could increase to 405 MVA with facilities expansions. An underground distribution network, scheduled {{to be completed in}} 2020, will direct electricity from the substation to the Denny Triangle and South Lake Union neighborhoods. The substation will be connected to the Massachusetts Substation in SoDo via a 115-kilovolt (kV) transmission line through Downtown Seattle. The use of a gas-insulated switchgear in the Denny Substation will allow for a smaller footprint; the facility will also use solar cells to produce its electricity and a heat <b>recovery</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and <b>recovery</b> <b>system</b> (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E
5|$|Another {{effort to}} raise Monitors {{propeller}} was successful on 8 June 1998, although {{the amount of}} effort required {{to work in the}} difficult conditions off Cape Hatteras was underestimated and the fewer than 30 divers used were nearly overwhelmed. The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as divers investigated the wreck in detail, planning how to recover the engine and determining if they could stabilize the hull so that it would not collapse onto the turret. In 2000 the divers shored up the port side of the hull with bags of grout, installed the engine <b>recovery</b> <b>system,</b> an external framework to which the engine would be attached, in preparation for the next season, and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season.|$|E

50|$|In {{a typical}} {{installation}} that incorporates cost <b>recovery</b> <b>systems</b> and electronic billing, {{there is a}} dedicated server to support the billing system (Host); a Local Area Network (LAN) to support user applications such as word processing, graphics, document management, spreadsheets; and cost recovery devices used to input data such as employee ID, client names, account numbers, etc. The accounting server and the cost <b>recovery</b> <b>systems</b> are usually connected to the LAN, and data must be transferred {{on a regular basis}} between each of the accounting server and the cost <b>recovery</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

Exhaust <b>recovery</b> <b>systems</b> work by either converting the exhaust energy into mechanical or electrical energy or to transfer the energy for heating purposes.|$|R
5|$|Continuing a {{theme of}} his presidency, in 2006 Mosley called for Formula One {{manufacturers}} to develop technology relevant to road cars. In recent years, {{a large proportion of}} the enormous budget of Formula One has been spent on the development of very powerful, very high-revving engines, which some say have little applicability to road cars. Mosley has announced a 10-year freeze on the development of engines, which would allow manufacturers to spend more of their budgets on environmentally friendly technology such as the Kinetic Energy <b>Recovery</b> <b>System</b> (KERS) introduced in 2009. In July 2008, he sent a letter to the Formula One teams, in which he called for the teams to propose future sporting regulations to address specific issues including reduced fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|The climactic {{underwater}} {{battle was}} shot at Clifton Pier and was choreographed by Hollywood expert Ricou Browning, who had worked on Creature From the Black Lagoon in 1954 and other films. He {{was responsible for the}} staging of the cave sequence and the battle scenes beneath the Disco Volante and called in his specialist team of divers who posed as those engaged in the onslaught. Voit provided much of the underwater gear in exchange for product placement and film tie-in merchandise. Lamar Boren, an underwater photographer, was hired to shoot all of the sequences. United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Charles Russhon, who had already established Eon productions' rapports with the local authorities in Turkey for From Russia with Love (1963) and at Fort Knox for Goldfinger (1964), supplied the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the Disco Volante. Russhon, using his position, was also able {{to gain access to the}} United States Navy's Fulton surface-to-air <b>recovery</b> <b>system,</b> used to lift Bond and Domino from the water at the end of the film. Filming ceased in May 1965, and the final scene shot was the physical fight on the bridge of the Disco Volante.|$|E
5|$|The race saw two drivers {{out before}} the start lights even went out, as first Sebastian Vettel stopped on track during the warm-up lap with an engine failure before Jolyon Palmer pulled into the pit lane instead of lining up on the grid, {{suffering}} from a hydraulic failure. It {{was the first time}} in Vettel's career that he was unable to start a race. At the start, Rosberg pulled into the lead ahead of Hamilton, who came into contact with Valtteri Bottas and dropped back to ninth place. Both Bottas and Ricciardo damaged their front wings in the situation. Felipe Massa took advantage and moved into second behind Rosberg. Further back, Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz also made contact, leaving Sainz with a puncture and Pérez with front wing damaged and both had to pit for repairs. Daniil Kvyat and Nico Hülkenberg were two more victims of contact during the first lap. The order after five laps was Rosberg, Massa, Bottas, Ricciardo and Räikkönen, who took fourth a lap later. The same lap, Jenson Button retired with a failure of his energy <b>recovery</b> <b>system.</b> After yet another lap, Räikkönen moved ahead of Bottas as well into third. Hamilton recovered from his first-turn accident and soon moved ahead of Bottas as well, laying in fourth place on lap eight. On lap ten, Bottas received a drive-through penalty for his collision with Hamilton at the start. By lap eleven, Esteban Gutiérrez retired with brake failure, while his teammate Grosjean was in fourth place.|$|E

40|$|The {{utility of}} {{orthogonal}} collocation methods in {{the solution of}} opti-mal control problems relating to Formula One racing is demonstrated. These methods {{can be used to}} optimise driver controls such as the steering, braking and throttle usage, and the optimisation of vehicle parameters such as aerodynamic down force distributions. Of partic-ular interest is the optimal usage of energy <b>recovery</b> <b>systems.</b> Con-temporary kinetic energy <b>recovery</b> <b>systems</b> (KERS) are studied and compared with future hybrid kinetic-thermal energy <b>recovery</b> <b>systems</b> known as (ERS-K) and (ERS-H).

Most <b>recovery</b> <b>systems</b> use specialized software, though Toshiba and Dell licensed Norton Ghost technology for their <b>recovery</b> <b>systems</b> at one point.
