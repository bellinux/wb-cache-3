A dedicated pair of copper conductors is used to sense every contact and transducer value. These conductors originate at the power-system device, are installed in trenches or overhead cable trays, and are then terminated on panels within the RTU.

50|$|The typical {{data flow}} in a DMS has the SCADA system, the Information Storage & Retrieval (ISR) system, Communication (COM) Servers, Front-End Processors (FEPs) & Field <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Units</b> (FRTUs).|$|R
30|$|A coordinated {{voltage control}} scheme for real time {{implementation}} in distribution networks with DG is proposed in [14]. This scheme {{is based on}} voltage estimations by <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> placed at DG and capacitor buses. An amendable control scheme for the above technique is proposed in [15]. The proposed scheme needs less parameters measurements which reduces communication and calculation burden on <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> (RTUs). These schemes assumes that line impedance of any section is constant. However, in general, R/X ratios are not constant along the line. Also, these schemes are not well covered the distribution systems with laterals.|$|R
50|$|The {{information}} {{measured by}} these field instruments is then gathered in local <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Units</b> (RTU) that transfer the field data {{to a central}} location in real time using communication systems, such as satellite channels, microwave links, or cellular phone connections.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> is {{initially}} interrogated with what DNP3 terms an [...] "Integrity Poll" [...] (a combined Read of Class 1, 2, 3 and 0 data). This causes the <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> to send all buffered events and also all static point {{data to the}} Master station. Following this, the Master polls for the event data by reading Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3. The reading of the classes can all be performed together or each class can be read at a different rate, providing a mechanism to create different reporting priorities for the different classes. After an Integrity Poll, only significant data changes are sent. This can result in significantly more responsive data retrieval than polling everything, all the time, irrespective of whether it has changed significantly.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> for the DNP3 {{protocol}} {{can be a}} small, simple embedded device, {{or it can be}} a large, complex rack {{filled with}} equipment. The DNP User Group has established four levels of subsets of the protocol for RTU compliance. The DNP Users Group has published test procedures for Levels 1 and 2, the simplest implementations.|$|E
50|$|A <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> (RTU) is a {{microprocessor-controlled}} {{electronic device}} that interfaces {{objects in the}} physical world to a distributed control system or SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system by transmitting telemetry data to a master system, and by using messages from the master supervisory system to control connected objects. Other terms that may be used for RTU is remote telemetry unit or remote telecontrol unit.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the second}} {{generation}} <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> (often {{in the form of}} Teleprinters like a Friden Flexowriter) saw greatly increased use. [...] Telephone connections provided sufficient speed for early <b>remote</b> <b>terminals</b> and allowed hundreds of kilometers separation between remote-terminals and the computing center. Eventually these stand-alone computer networks would be generalized into an interconnected network of networks—the Internet.|$|R
30|$|General {{term that}} {{encompasses}} well-defined types of field devices, such as: (1) master <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> (MTUs) and Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), {{located at the}} topmost layer and managing all communications; (2) <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> (RTUs), and programmable logic controllers (PLCs), controlling and acquiring data from remote equipment and connecting with the master stations; (3) sensors and actuators.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>units,</b> {{also known}} as (RTUs), connect to sensors and {{actuators}} in the process, and are networked to the supervisory computer system. RTUs are [...] "intelligent I/O" [...] and often have embedded control capabilities such as ladder logic {{in order to accomplish}} boolean logic operations.|$|R
50|$|In 1984 The Tetragenics Company, a {{subsidiary}} of the Montana Power Company, introduced the first <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> (RTU) that time-tagged events to the nearest millisecond, and now there are also other RTUs with this capability. Digital protective relays and some PLCs now also include time-tagging to the nearest millisecond; SCADA systems that incorporate these devices provide SER functions without a dedicated SER device.|$|E
5000|$|The {{improved}} {{bandwidth efficiency}} is accomplished through event oriented data reporting. The <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> monitors data points and generates events when it determines {{that the data}} should be reported (for example, when it changes value). These events are each placed {{in one of three}} buffers, associated with [...] "Classes" [...] 1, 2 and 3. In addition to these, Class 0 is defined as the [...] "static" [...] or current status of the monitored data.|$|E
50|$|Modbus enables {{communication}} among many devices {{connected to the}} same network, for example, a system that measures temperature and humidity and communicates the results to a computer. Modbus {{is often used to}} connect a supervisory computer with a <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> (RTU) in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Many of the data types are named from its use in driving relays: a single-bit physical output is called a coil, and a single-bit physical input is called a discrete input or a contact.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, local flow {{metering}} was done using high maintenance mechanical circular chart recorders. Today {{these have been}} replaced with electrically powered <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> (RTU). Multiple <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> communicate to a central host system via radio systems or tap into the cellular phone system. The host (or central control room) communicates with the RTUs and radio communication infrastructure {{is referred to as}} a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. In addition to gas {{flow metering}}, the RTU also provides some local, self-contained, site control such as well shut-in in the event of abnormal gas flow conditions. However the bulk of the RTU's function is to provide the host with site specific data which includes the above-mentioned gas flow metering data, plus process related data including pipeline and/or well pressure, condensate tank levels etc.|$|R
50|$|The M71 was {{a version}} of the M70 {{intended}} for process control. It provided for 1/4 or 1 M Byte of ECC DRAM, up to 1/2 MB of EPROM, 4 serial lines (DC-319 DLARTs) and two parallel ports implemented using 8255 chips. It was initially designed by Mentec for use in its own <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Units.</b>|$|R
50|$|VTScada {{communicates}} with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Units</b> (RTUs), pump controllers {{and other}} devices using radio, LAN, WAN, cellular, or phone lines. This information is logged and displayed to users {{on a computer screen}} via trend graphs, reports, or graphical display pages. The software can also send control signals back to the devices to control the process.|$|R

Embedded Systems are {{also included in the}} sphere of operational technology (e.g. SMART instrumentation), along with a large subset of scientific data acquisition, control & computing devices. An OT device could be as small as the ecu of a car or as large as the distributed control network for a national electricity grid.|$|E
5000|$|The system’s {{rail lines}} run on eleven {{lettered}} [...] "routes".

50|$|The pump {{manufacturers}} have always designed and manufactured electronic devices {{to control and}} supervise the pumping stations. Today it is also very common to use a programmable logic controller (PLC) or <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> (RTU) to do such work, but the experience needed to solve certain particular problems, makes an easy choice {{to look for a}} specific pump controller.RTUs are very helpful in remote monitoring of each pumping station from a centralized control room with SCADA (Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition) systems. This setup can be helpful in monitoring pump faults, levels or any other alarms and parameters making it more efficient.|$|E
50|$|Mentec Limited {{was founded}} in 1978 and {{initially}} focused {{on the development of}} monitoring and control software and systems. It was a significant Digital reseller and OEM in Ireland. Mentec Computer Systems Limited was a subsidiary of Mentec Limited that developed PDP-11 processors. Mentec Inc. was a US-based subsidiary of Mentec Limited. In the early 1980s it had a range of <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> based on the SBC/11-21 (Falcon).|$|R
30|$|Integrating {{data from}} <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> (RTUs), phase {{measurement}} units (PMUs), {{and a wide}} area measurement system (WAMS) enables a unified open platform of wide area information. This must be supported by considerable analytical power for state estimation and contingency analysis, to produce effective decision support and “situation awareness” for grid operators [31]. This information is coordinated and control actions are derived using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) {{within the framework of}} an energy management system (EMS).|$|R
50|$|PLCs {{have similar}} {{functionality}} as <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>units.</b> An RTU, however, usually {{does not support}} control algorithms or control loops. As hardware rapidly becomes more powerful and cheaper, RTUs, PLCs, and DCSs are increasingly beginning to overlap in responsibilities, and many vendors sell RTUs with PLC-like features, and vice versa. The industry has standardized on the IEC 61131-3 functional block language for creating programs to run on RTUs and PLCs, although nearly all vendors also offer proprietary alternatives and associated development environments.|$|R
5000|$|Early SCADA system {{computing}} {{was done}} by large minicomputers. Common network services did not exist at the time SCADA was developed. Thus SCADA systems were independent systems with no connectivity to other systems. The communication protocols used were strictly proprietary at that time. The first-generation SCADA system redundancy was achieved using a back-up mainframe system connected to all the <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> sites and {{was used in the}} event of failure of the primary mainframe system. [...] Some first generation SCADA systems were developed as [...] "turn key" [...] operations that ran on minicomputers such as the PDP-11 series made by the Digital Equipment Corporation..|$|E
50|$|Since about 1998, {{virtually}} all major PLC manufacturers have offered integrated HMI/SCADA systems, {{many of them}} using open and non-proprietary communications protocols. Numerous specialized third-party HMI/SCADA packages, offering built-in compatibility with most major PLCs, have also entered the market, allowing mechanical engineers, electrical engineers and technicians to configure HMIs themselves, {{without the need for}} a custom-made program written by a software programmer.The <b>Remote</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> (RTU) connects to physical equipment. Typically, an RTU converts the electrical signals from the equipment to digital values such as the open/closed status from a switch or a valve, or measurements such as pressure, flow, voltage or current. By converting and sending these electrical signals out to equipment the RTU can control equipment, such as opening or closing a switch or a valve, or setting the speed of a pump.|$|E
5000|$|Originally the {{gas flow}} {{computer}} was a mechanical (1920s technology) or later a pneumatic or hydraulic computing module (1940s technology {{used to the}} early 1990s but still available {{from a number of}} suppliers), subsequently superseded in most applications by an electronic module, as the primary elements switched from transmitting the measured variables from pneumatic or hydraulic pressure signals to electric current as explosion-proof (1960s technology to present)) and then intrinsically safe (1970s to present) transmitters (with low-power transistor circuitry) became available, that simply provided a dedicated gas flow computer function. Today [...] "gas flow computers" [...] as such have become uncommon, since gas flow computing is a subfunction of a data acquisition and control program implemented with programmable logic controller (PLCs) and <b>remote</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> (RTUs); with the rise of smart transmitters in the early 1980s, these functions have also been incorporated within the field transmitters themselves.|$|E

Failure of the communications network does not necessarily stop the plant process controls, and on resumption of communications, the operator can continue with monitoring and control. Some critical systems will have dual redundant data highways, often cabled via diverse routes.|$|R
