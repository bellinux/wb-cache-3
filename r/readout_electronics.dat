50|$|Due {{to their}} {{individual}} photon counting nature, these instruments {{are limited to}} observations where the irradiance is low. The irradiance {{is limited by the}} time resolution of its associated detector <b>readout</b> <b>electronics.</b> With current technology this is in the megahertz range. The maximum irradiance is also limited by the throughput and gain parameters of the detector itself.|$|E
50|$|SRON’s {{leading role}} in the {{development}} of SAFARI is mainly due to the infrared detectors developed by SRON scientists. Extremely sensitive detectors must be used in SAFARI to gain maximum benefit from the low infrared emissions of SPICA’s cooled mirror. In June 2010, an international evaluation committee selected, out of four different technologies, the Transition Edge Sensor (TES) detectors from SRON together with the associated <b>readout</b> <b>electronics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Direct {{conversion}} imagers utilize photoconductors, such as amorphous selenium (a-Se), {{to capture}} and convert incident x-ray photons directly into electric charge. X-ray photons incident upon a layer of a-Se generate electron-hole pairs via the internal photoelectric effect. A bias voltage applied to {{the depth of the}} selenium layer draw the electrons and holes to corresponding electrodes; the generated current is thus proportional to the intensity of the irradiation. Signal is then read-out using underlying <b>readout</b> <b>electronics,</b> typically by a thin-film transistor (TFT) array.|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} aspects of nuclear medicine imaging systems such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) are the spatial resolution and the sensitivity (detector efficiency {{in combination with the}} geometric efficiency). Considerable efforts have been spent during the last two decades in improving the resolution and the efficiency by developing new detectors. Our proposed improvement technique is focused on the <b>readout</b> and <b>electronics.</b> Instead of using traditional pulse height analysis techniques we propose using free running digital sampling by replacing the analog <b>readout</b> and acquisition <b>electronics</b> with fully digital programmable systems. This thesis describes a fully digital data acquisition system for KS/SU SPECT, new algorithms for high resolution timing for PET, and modular FPGA based decentralized data acquisition system with optimal timing and energy. The necessary signal processing algorithms for energy assessment and high resolution timing are developed and evaluated. The implementation of the algorithms in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and digital signal processors (DSP) is also covered. Finally, modular decentralized digital data acquisition systems based on FPGAs and Ethernet are described...|$|R

5000|$|As {{development}} proceeded, {{while the}} basic design concept was kept, {{much of the}} equipment in the satellite was replaced by new designs {{in order to meet}} requirements imposed by the CSA's Multi-Mission Microsatellite Bus program. The basic instrument design was kept, as was the basic structure design, and the attitude control subsystem sensors and actuators; the on-board computers and radios were replaced, the instrument <b>readout</b> <b>electronics</b> was redesigned, and the external instrument [...] "door" [...] was replaced by an internal shutter.|$|E
5000|$|Sofradir {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of second- and third-generation IR detectors. It {{was one of the}} first to produce second-generation IR detectors. Second-generation IR detectors have a high level of sophistication because they require the integration of <b>readout</b> <b>electronics</b> on the Focal Plane Array (FPA) as well as signal processing. Sofradir was the first European IR detector manufacturer to have achieved space-deployed products, which are currently in orbit on Venus Express.

50|$|High density, {{compound}} semiconductors such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), {{cadmium zinc telluride}} (CdZnTe), gallium arsenide (GaAs), mercuric iodide or thallium bromide {{have been the subject}} of extensive research for use in high energy X-ray detection. The favorable charge transport properties and high electrical resistivity of CdTe and CdZnTe have made them ideally suited to applications requiring spectroscopy at higher X-ray energies. Imaging applications, such as SPECT, require detectors with a pixelated electrode that allow objects to be imaged in 2D and 3D. Each pixel of the detector requires its own chain of <b>readout</b> <b>electronics</b> and for a highly pixelated detector this requires the use of a high sensitivity application-specific integrated circuit.|$|E
40|$|The ALICE High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID) {{consists}} of seven identical proximity focusing RICH counters.

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of piezoelectric sensors {{is that they}} cannot be used for truly static measurements. A static force results in a fixed amount of charge on the piezoelectric material. In conventional <b>readout</b> <b>electronics,</b> imperfect insulating materials and reduction in internal sensor resistance causes a constant loss of electrons and yields a decreasing signal. Elevated temperatures cause an additional drop in internal resistance and sensitivity. The main effect on the piezoelectric effect is that with increasing pressure loads and temperature, the sensitivity reduces due to twin formation. While quartz sensors must be cooled during measurements at temperatures above 300 °C, special types of crystals like GaPO4 gallium phosphate show no twin formation up to the melting point of the material itself.|$|E

5000|$|All gaseous {{ionization}} detectors {{are able}} to collect the electrons released by ionizing radiation, guiding them to a region with a large electric field, and thereby initiating an electron avalanche. The avalanche is able to produce enough electrons to create a current or charge {{large enough to be}} detected by electronics. In most ionization detectors, the large field comes from a thin wire with a positive high-voltage potential; this same thin wire collect the electrons from the avalanche and guides them towards the <b>readout</b> <b>electronics.</b> GEMs create the large electric field in small holes in a thin polymer sheet; the avalanche occurs inside of these holes. The resulting electrons are ejected from the sheet, and a separate system must be used to collect the electrons and guide them towards the readout.|$|E

5000|$|Much of the {{original}} Belle detector has been upgraded {{to cope with the}} higher instantaneous luminosity provided by the SuperKEKB accelerator. Close to the beam pipe, the two innermost layers of Belle's silicon vertex detector have been replaced by a depleted field effect transistor (DEPFET) pixel detector, and the silicon vertex detector layers have been extended. The central tracking system - a wire drift chamber, has been enlarged. Two new particle identification systems have been installed in the forward endcap (consisting of an aerogel ring-imaging Cherenkov detector) and in the barrel (consisting of quartz bars utilising totally internally reflected Cherenkov photons and measuring the time of propagation). The original CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter has been re-used (a new pure CsI calorimeter is being designed for the forward endcap to be installed at a later stage). The calorimeter <b>readout</b> <b>electronics</b> have been upgraded.

50|$|The RDA {{is located}} {{in an area of}} several square miles just South of the city of Lamar, Colorado, in the United States, part of the area {{proposed}} for Auger North. It consists of surface detectors (water tanks instrumented with photomultiplier tubes and <b>readout</b> <b>electronics),</b> communication towers, and a building housing the data concentrator and computing. The ten water tanks are instrumented with one photomultiplier tube each to detect the Cherenkov radiation generated by particles in cosmic ray air showers. (The water tanks currently used in the southern Pierre Auger observatory use three photomultiplier tubes each.) The communication towers will test a new way to transport data from the water tanks to the data concentrator. A higher bandwidth will benefit many possible upgrades to the southern site. A new communication system is also needed to allow the proposed northern detector array to cover a larger area than the existing southern observatory. In the existing system all surface detectors directly transmit to a single point. In a larger array this would not be feasible. Surface detectors would communicate with their nearest neighbors and surface detectors close to the single data concentrator station would relay the data from surface detectors that are further away.|$|E
