40|$|Specific {{modifications}} in the Disk Operational System Unified Series {{to insure the}} relocatability of programs stored permanently in the core image library is described. A self-relocating method for loading programs into the working memory with re-editing all the programs recorded in the core image library is presented. The modified linkage editor can {{be included in a}} <b>relocation</b> <b>dictionary</b> containing data about each address constant at the assembly stage {{at the request of the}} programmer. The <b>relocation</b> <b>dictionary</b> increases the dimension of the RL-phase in comparison with the dimension of this same phase when edited by the standard method, making possible the creation of multiphase program complexes. Generation and use of the modified system using Assembly language is described. An example of the use of the system is given, and limitations of the use of the relocatable programs in the modified system are outlined...|$|E
