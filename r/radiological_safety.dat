5|$|Warren was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps in 1943 and appointed Chief of the Medical Section of the Manhattan Engineering District. He {{was responsible for the}} health and safety of the thousands of personnel involved in the Manhattan Project. He was present at the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo, New Mexico where he was responsible for the safety aspects of the detonation of the world's first nuclear weapon. He led a survey team from the Manhattan Project to assess the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1946 he was Chief of the <b>Radiological</b> <b>Safety</b> Section of the Joint Task Force for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear test at Bikini Atoll.|$|E
25|$|Even a brief perusal of the Atomic Energy Act reveals that, {{despite its}} comprehensiveness, {{it does not}} at any point {{expressly}} require the States to construct or authorize nuclear powerplants or prohibit the States from deciding, as an absolute or conditional matter, not to permit the construction of any further reactors. Instead, petitioners argue that the Act is intended to preserve the Federal Government as the sole regulator of all matters nuclear, and that 25524.2 falls {{within the scope of}} this impliedly pre-empted field. But as we view the issue, Congress, in passing the 1954 Act and in subsequently amending it, intended that the Federal Government should regulate the <b>radiological</b> <b>safety</b> aspects involved in the construction and operation of a nuclear plant, but that the States retain their traditional responsibility in the field of regulating electrical utilities for determining questions of need, reliability, cost, and other related state concerns.|$|E
500|$|The {{detonation}} {{of the two}} {{atomic bombs}} in Japan [...] "raised as many military and medicomilitary questions as they answered". A series of nuclear tests was planned, codenamed Operation Crossroads. Some 42,000 personnel were deployed to Bikini Atoll as part of Admiral William H. P. Blandy's Joint Task Force 1 to conduct the test. Their health and safety was Lyons's responsibility, but the specialised job of <b>radiological</b> <b>safety</b> was handled by the Manhattan Project. Warren, as Chief of the <b>Radiological</b> <b>Safety</b> Section (RADSAFE), planned and implemented measures to assess, limit and control the impact of radiation. Teams were given special training at Oak Ridge {{in the operation of}} instrumentation to measure radioactivity, and the interpretation of their readings. Training was also conducted aboard [...] en route to Bikini Atoll, where it arrived on 12 June 1946. In all, some 3,500 personnel were assigned to RADSAFE. Warren was appalled by the effects of radioactive contamination on the environment.

50|$|In 1956 during June, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) {{recommended}} new {{radiation exposure}} limits {{for the general}} public in a report entitled The Biological Effects of Atomic Radiation. The AEC, which was the body that developed nuclear weapons, accepted the NAS recommended radiation exposure limits. Some AEC members asserted that the limits were reached incorrectly and should be reviewed in the future. Additionally, Charles L. Dunham, the AEC Director of the Division of Biology and Medicine (DBM) said that the new limits of nuclear radiation exposure would prevent them from continuing testing in Nevada. Dunham, in association with other AEC offices and officials, made recommendations to move further tests to the Pacific in order to eliminate the need to determine <b>radiological</b> fallout <b>safety.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{contamination}} {{problem was}} not widely appreciated {{by the general public}} until 1948, when No Place to Hide, a best-selling book by David Bradley, was serialized in the Atlantic Monthly, condensed by the Reader's Digest, and selected by the Book of the Month Club. In his preface, Bradley, a key member of the <b>Radiological</b> <b>Safety</b> Section at Bikini known as the [...] "Geiger men", asserted that [...] "the accounts of the actual explosions, however well intended, were liberally seasoned with fantasy and superstition, and the results of the tests have remained buried in the vaults of military security."

The checklist was adapted on the basis of observation of daily practice in a tertiary referral centre and evaluation by users. To assess the effect of RADPASS, in a series of radiological interventions, all deviations from optimal care were registered before and after implementation of the checklist. In addition, the checklist and its use were eval-uated by interviewing all users. Results The RADPASS checklist has two parts: A (Planning and Preparation) and B (Procedure). The latter part comprises checks just before starting a procedure (B 1) and checks concerning the postprocedural care immedi-ately after completion of the procedure (B 2).

40|$|Objectives. We {{performed}} a systematic literature review {{to analyze the}} clinical application {{and the safety of}} mifepristone, a prominent antiprogesterone agent, in meningioma patients. Materials and Methods. A systematic search was performed through Medline, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials. gov databases from 1960 to 2014. Study Selection. Studies were selected through a PICO approach. Population was meningioma patients, meningioma cells cultures, and animal models. Intervention was mifepristone administration. Control was placebo administration or any other drug tested. Outcomes were clinical and <b>radiological</b> responsiveness, <b>safety</b> profile, and cell growth inhibition. Results. A total of 7 preclinical and 6 clinical studies and one abstract were included. Encouraging results were found in preclinical studies. Concerning clinical studies, the response rate to mifepristone in terms of radiological regression and symptomatic improvement/stability in patients with inoperable meningioma was low. In meningiomatosis, favorable preliminary results were recorded. The safety profile was good. Limitations were as follows. The tumoral expression of progesterone receptors was not analyzed systematically in every study considered. Conclusions. No clear evidence exists to recommend mifepristone in inoperable meningiomas. Preliminary encouraging results were found in diffuse meningiomatosis. Mifepristone is a well-tolerated treatment. Patients’ selection and hormonal profile analysis in meningiomas are fundamental for a better understanding of its benefit. Multicenter placebo-controlled trials are required...|$|R
40|$|In this {{update on}} {{etanercept}} (ETN) in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) we analyze this drug's mechanism of action, clinical efficacy/effectiveness, optimal dosage, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) association, <b>radiological</b> progression, <b>safety,</b> switching aspects, and pharmacoeconomy. The efficacy/effectiveness of ETN in PsA {{has been demonstrated}} in randomized placebo-controlled trials {{as well as in}} observational studies representing routine clinical practice. At 1 and 2 years, ETN inhibited radiographic disease progression, assessed by the modified total Sharp score. ETN (generally at a dosage of 50 mg/weekly) can be used either in monotherapy or in combination with DMARD such as methotrexate. A systematic search of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of ETN to treat adults with plaque psoriasis or PsA suggests that the short-term risk/benefit ratio is favorable. Longterm studies, such as observational studies, confirmed this safety profile of ETN. A variable percentage of patients withdrew anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor treatment owing to inefficacy or poor tolerability. Observational studies showed {{that in the case of}} treatment failure with 1 agent, switching to the other agent may also be useful in patients with PsA because of the different molecular structures and targets of available TNF-α blockers. The clinical effect of ETN is associated with favorable pharmacoeconomic considerations. The Journal of Rheumatology Copyright © 2012. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is to systematically identify and evaluate hazards related to the tunnel boring machine (TBM) used in the Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF) at the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project. This process {{is an integral part}} of the systems engineering process; whereby safety is considered during planning, design, testing, and construction. Since the TBM is an ''as built'' system, the M&O is conducting the System Safety Analysis during the construction or assembly phase of the TBM. A largely qualitative approach was used since a <b>radiological</b> System <b>Safety</b> Analysis is not required. The risk assessment in this analysis characterizes the accident scenarios associated with the TBM in terms of relative risk and includes recommendations for mitigating all identified risks. The priority for recommending and implementing mitigation control features is: (1) Incorporate measures to reduce risks and hazards into the system/subsystem/component design, (2) add safety features and capabilities to existing designs, and (3) develop procedures and conduct training to increase worker awareness of potential hazards, on methods to reduce exposure to hazards, and on the actions required to avoid accidents or correct hazardous conditions. The scope of this analysis is limited to the TBM during normal operations, excluding hazards occurring during assembly and test of the TBM or maintenance of the TBM equipment...|$|R
