5|$|In {{addition}} to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003. The player had to <b>roll</b> <b>their</b> coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model {{in the center of}} the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the number of tickets to be won. The game incorporated music and sounds from the video games.|$|E
5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and <b>roll</b> <b>their</b> body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E
5|$|Shark {{eyes are}} similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, {{including}} similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment {{with the help of a}} tissue called tapetum lucidum. This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead <b>roll</b> <b>their</b> eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time. A micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection.|$|E

25|$|High-flyers {{can perform}} {{springboard}} diving attacks to opponents {{inside or outside}} of the ring. Instead of countering or side-stepping attacks, they perform an evasive <b>roll.</b> <b>Their</b> special ability is a possum pin. After recovering from being knocked down, a high-flyer can remain on the ground. If the attacker attempts a grapple move, the defending wrestler will go for a pin attempt which is difficult to break out of. However, if the opponent attempts a strike, then the pin attempt is lost.|$|E
25|$|As {{young males}} mature and leave their {{maternal}} groups, they most often remain solitary, although rarely they join an older male. Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally, they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner {{and it is}} rare for serious fights to take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their necks, <b>roll</b> <b>their</b> eyes, and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly {{pacing back and forth}} {{in front of the other}} male. They seek out females only during mating time. When they are with a herd of females, males do not coerce them or try to restrict their movements as do some other antelopes.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in a radio}} address, the Emperor of Japan announces {{the end of the}} War. Suzu, having faced countless {{setbacks}} and tragedies during the war, and had grown accustomed to the single-minded focus of keeping the family alive, is forced to accept the reality of her losses and temporarily falls into despair. Soon, the times begin to change rapidly: US occupation forces, no longer the enemy, come to Kure and provide food for its citizens. Suzu visits her grandmother Ito's family house in Kusatsu, a rural town to the west of Hiroshima and out of the affected area, to see her sister Sumi, who took refuge from deserted Hiroshima and is the only survivor of Suzu's family. Sumi informs Suzu of the fate of their parents; Sumi herself has fallen seriously ill from the radiation left behind by the atomic‐bomb radiation. Shūsaku, who returns from his naval service, meets with Suzu by chance in a deserted area of Hiroshima and tells her that he has found a new job. They come across a little girl, a war (atomic bomb) orphan struggling to survive in the ruins after losing her mother, and adopt her into their home in Kure. Suzu regains her passion for life slowly, with the courage and affection of her friends and family. As the credits <b>roll,</b> <b>their</b> adopted daughter is shown growing up in Suzu & Shūsaku's family home, sewing clothes with her own hands, aided by Suzu in peaceful post-war Japan.|$|E

500|$|When {{the band}} {{returned}} from hiatus with Save Rock and <b>Roll,</b> <b>their</b> main {{goal was to}} reinvent {{the sound of the}} group from scratch, creating what Trohman called a [...] "reimagining of the band", which focused more on pop and moved away from the punk aspects of their sound. While mostly an album which mixes pop, rock and R, the record was still described by Dave Simpson of The Guardian as a pop punk record, but also noted influences from Heart in the album's ballads. In American Beauty/American Psycho, the band felt influences from playing with different artists and expanded on boundaries further than Save Rock and Roll did. In an interview with Rolling Stone, guitarist Joe Trohman said the album has [...] "hip hop grooves with guitars on it," [...] with [...] "more in your face guitar than Save Rock and Roll". Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press described American Beauty/American Psycho as a [...] "mix of fluid grooves, punky riffs and outré pop sensibilities." ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{arguments}} are countered in two ways. First, {{the history of}} borrowers turning to illegal or dangerous sources of credit seems to have little basis in fact according to Robert Mayer's 2012 [...] "Loan Sharks, Interest-Rate Caps, and Deregulation". Outside of specific contexts, interest rates caps {{had the effect of}} allowing small loans in most areas without an increase of [...] "loan sharking". [...] Next, since 80% of payday borrowers will <b>roll</b> <b>their</b> loan over at least one time [...] because their income prevents them from paying the principal within the repayment period, they often report turning to friends or family members to help repay the loan [...] according to a 2012 report from the Center for Financial Services Innovation. [...] In addition, {{there appears to be no}} evidence of unmet demand for small dollar credit in states which prohibit or strictly limit payday lending.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the 69 Eyes' music {{style was}} of glam metal {{influenced}} by acts such as Mötley Crüe and Hanoi Rocks.

The term [...] "goth 'n roll" [...] is used by fans to describe their style. [...] They are often described as a dark rock band, a term which the band has embraced. In recent times, with the release of Back in Blood, The 69 Eyes have moved back to a more guitar-based sound, although gothic imagery and lyrical themes remain forefront in their style.|$|E

[...] Lizzie Plaugic of CMJ stated in a mixed review, [...] "Because The Internet is not easily dismissible, because it's so self-awarely annoying. It trips over its own feet hoping the cool kids will <b>roll</b> <b>their</b> eyes at it, because behind those eye rolls is a jealousy that Gambino can fall with such nonchalance. Even though Because The Internet is kind of strange and kind of a bummer, it does show Glover's range as a musician." [...] Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork stated, [...] "With Gambino's wordplay ping-ponging from caustic wit to message board snark, the enduring strength of the album is its production. Gambino and Göransson handle the bulk of it here alongside usual suspect Stefan Ponce and alley oops from twin act Christian Rich and Flying Lotus associate Thundercat. Because the Internets production team not only ensures the sounds are pretty, spacey, and jarring in all the right places, but they also effortlessly nail the album's Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz synchronicity gambit." ...|$|E
