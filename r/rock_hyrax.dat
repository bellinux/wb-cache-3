5|$|The {{black mamba}} is diurnal and chiefly an ambush predator, {{though it has}} been {{recorded}} as hunting partly by pursuit, such as catching pigeons at a watering hole before they can fly high enough to escape. It usually goes hunting from a permanent lair, to which it will regularly return, if the hunting is good {{and it is not}} disturbed. It hunts mainly by sight and in doing so it commonly will raise much of its length well off the ground. The black mamba does not typically hold onto prey after biting, instead releasing its quarry and waiting for it to succumb to paralysis and die. This however depends on the type of prey; for example, it typically will hold onto a bird till it stops struggling to escape. If prey tries to escape or defend itself, the black mamba often may follow up its initial bite with a rapid series of strikes to incapacitate and quickly kill its prey. The snake has been known to prey on hyrax and <b>rock</b> <b>hyrax,</b> bushbabies, and bats. The black mamba has a potent digestive system and has been observed to digest prey fully within eight to ten hours.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>hyraxes</b> (Procavia capensis) are {{a common}} {{component}} of faunal assemblages at South African archaeological sites. Previous {{studies have focused on}} their remains as proxies for aspects of diet and mobility in prehistoric human populations. They have also been recognized as valuable palaeoenvironmental indicators {{due to the fact that}} their stratified communal middens record shifts in stable isotopes, palynology, and molecular biomarkers that appear to reflect environmental change. Previous studies conducted in east Africa have concluded that <b>rock</b> <b>hyraxes</b> are preferential grazers.

Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens).

40|$|Abstract. Seven juveniles and 3 adults from {{a closed}} group of 19 <b>rock</b> <b>hyraxes</b> (Procavia capensis) {{housed in a}} zoo’s indoor rock exhibit died or were euthanized after {{developing}} blepharoconjunctivitis and orofacial ulcers over a 2 -week period. Histopathologic examination of dermal ulcers and ulcerated tongues revealed amphophilic to basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in epithelial cells bordering ulcers. Epithelial cells with inclusion bodies were often characterized by cytomegaly and karyomegaly, and many cells had formed syncytia. Examination of inclusion bodies in tongue epithelium by transmission electron microscopy revealed icosahedral nucleocapsids, approximately 80 – 95 nm in diameter, with morphologic features consistent with herpesvirus. Cytopathic effect (CPE) typical of alphaherpesvirus infection was seen in bovine turbinate, equine dermal, and Vero cell monolayers after inoculation with homogenates of the skin lesions, but CPE was not seen after inoculation onto Madin-Darby canine kidney or swine testicle cell monolayers. Polymerase chain reaction analysis using degenerate primers that targeted {{a portion of the}} herpesvirus polymerase gene generated a product of approximately 227 base pairs. The product was cloned, sequenced, and then analyzed using BLAST. At the nucleotide level, there was 86 %, 77 %, and 76 % shared identity with Eidolon herpesvirus 1, Human herpesviruses 1 and 2, and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 2, respectively. Herpesvirus infections in <b>rock</b> <b>hyraxes</b> have not been characterized. The data presented in the current study suggest that a novel alphaherpesvirus caused the lesions seen in these <b>rock</b> <b>hyraxes.</b> The molecular characteristics of this virus would tentatively support its inclusion in the genus Simplexvirus. Key words: Herpesvirus; polymerase chain reaction; Procavia capensis; <b>rock</b> <b>hyraxes.</b> ...|$|R

500|$|Corona Australis or Corona Austrina is a {{constellation}} in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere. Its Latin name means [...] "southern crown", {{and it is}} the southern counterpart of Corona Borealis, the northern crown. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The Ancient Greeks saw Corona Australis as a wreath rather than a crown and associated it with Sagittarius or Centaurus. Other cultures have likened the pattern to a turtle, ostrich nest, a tent, or even a hut belonging to a <b>rock</b> <b>hyrax.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Baboon Reserve, {{opened in}} 1990, is a two-acre {{recreation}} of the Ethiopian highlands which, {{at the time}} of its opening, was the largest primate exhibit in the United States. The exhibit's main features revolve around the zoo's troop of geladas such as artificial rocks and earthbanks, and displays about life in the highlands and the side-by-side evolution of humans and geladas. Visitors can watch the geladas from multiple viewpoints along with Nubian ibex and <b>rock</b> <b>hyrax,</b> all of which are mixed together in the hilly enclosure. An African village-styled café overlooks the exhibit. Baboon Reserve won the AZA Exhibit Award in 1991. In the fall of 2014, a male gelada was born at the zoo, the first in over 13 years.

2500|$|The {{most common}} mammal on the {{mountain}} was the dassie (the South African name, from Afrikaans, pronounced [...] "dussy"), or <b>rock</b> <b>hyrax.</b> Between about 2000 and 2004 (no one is certain about the exact year or years) their numbers suddenly plummeted for unknown reasons. They used to cluster around the restaurant at the upper cable station, near areas where tourists discarded or (inadvisably supplied) food. The population crash of the dassies was in all probability responsible for {{the decline in the}} Verreaux's eagle population on the Peninsula, which is believed to have consisted of 3 breeding pairs during the period 1950 to 1990, with only 2 pairs, maximally, ever having been reported to fledge a chick each in any given year. With the commencement of formal monitoring in 1993, two breeding pairs were recorded on the Cape Peninsula Mountain Chain in 2004: one below the upper cable station at the western end of Table Mountain, in Blinkwater Ravine, the other on the cliffs below Noordhoek Peak. The nest near the cable station was abandoned in 2006, leaving only the Noordhoek pair, which continued to fledge chicks reasonably regularly till 2013, at which point one member of the pair disappeared. From 2013 till January 2017 only a single Verreaux's Eagle, presumed to be a female, remained on the Peninsula. She continued to maintain the nest under Noordhoek Peak, but seemed unable to attract a mate. But in early 2017 a pair of eagles was seen by at least 7 independent observers during the course of 10 days (27 January - 5 February). It {{remains to be seen whether}} they will breed later in the year. Dassies are an important part the Verreaux's eagle's prey on the Peninsula. (See Foot note) ...|$|E
