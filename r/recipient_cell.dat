2500|$|Cells can {{communicate}} with each other by releasing molecules that produce signaling cascades within another receptive cell. [...] If the signal requires upregulation or downregulation of genes in the <b>recipient</b> <b>cell,</b> often transcription factors will be downstream in the signaling cascade. Estrogen signaling {{is an example of a}} fairly short signaling cascade that involves the estrogen receptor transcription factor: [...] Estrogen is secreted by tissues such as the ovaries and placenta, crosses the cell membrane of the <b>recipient</b> <b>cell,</b> and is bound by the estrogen receptor in the cell's cytoplasm. [...] The estrogen receptor then goes to the cell's nucleus and binds to its DNA-binding sites, changing the transcriptional regulation of the associated genes.|$|E
2500|$|Oncogenes promote cell growth {{through a}} variety of ways. Many can produce hormones, a [...] "chemical messenger" [...] between cells that {{encourage}} mitosis, the effect of which depends on the signal transduction of the receiving tissue or cells. In other words, when a hormone receptor on a <b>recipient</b> <b>cell</b> is stimulated, the signal is conducted {{from the surface of the}} cell to the cell nucleus to affect some change in gene transcription regulation at the nuclear level. Some oncogenes are part of the signal transduction system itself, or the signal receptors in cells and tissues themselves, thus controlling the sensitivity to such hormones. Oncogenes often produce mitogens, or are involved in transcription of DNA in protein synthesis, which creates the proteins and enzymes responsible for producing the products and biochemicals cells use and interact with.|$|E

Exposure of <b>recipient</b> <b>cells</b> to Pronase before treatment with donor DNA did not affect transformation, suggesting {{the absence of a}} protein competence factor.

However, several fundamental aspects of secreted miRNAs remain unknown, particularly the mechanism that governs the function or fate of exogenous miRNAs in <b>recipient</b> <b>cells.</b> In the present study, we provide evidence indicating that Argonaute 2 (Ago 2) {{plays a role}} in stabilizing miRNAs and facilitating the packaging of secreted miRNAs into MVs. More importantly, Ago 2 in origin cell-secreted MVs (but not in <b>recipient</b> <b>cells)</b> directs the function of secreted miRNAs. First, Ago 2 overexpression clearly increased the level of miR- 16 in cells transfected with a miR- 16 mimic by protecting the miRNAs from degradation in lysosomes. Second, Ago 2 overexpression increased the level of miR- 16 in cell-secreted MVs, suggesting that Ago 2 may facilitate the packaging of secreted miRNAs into MVs. Third, exogenous miR- 16 delivered by MVs within the origin cells significantly reduced the Bcl 2 protein level in <b>recipient</b> <b>cells,</b> and miR- 16 and Bcl 2 mRNA were physically associated with exogenous HA-tagged Ago 2 (HA-Ago 2).

Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned medium of irradiated as well as non-irradiated head and neck cancer cells by serial centrifugation. Quantification using NanoSight technology indicated an increased exosome release from irradiated compared to non-irradiated cells 24 hours after treatment. To test whether the released exosomes influence the radiation response of other cells the exosomes were transferred to non-irradiated and irradiated <b>recipient</b> <b>cells.</b> We found an enhanced uptake of exosomes isolated from both irradiated and non-irradiated <b>cells</b> by irradiated <b>recipient</b> <b>cells</b> compared to non-irradiated <b>recipient</b> <b>cells.</b> Functional analyses by exosome transfer indicated that all exosomes (from non-irradiated and irradiated donor cells) increase the proliferation of non-irradiated <b>recipient</b> <b>cells</b> and the survival of irradiated <b>recipient</b> <b>cells.</b> The survival-promoting effects are more pronounced when exosomes isolated from irradiated compared to non-irradiated donor cells are transferred. A possible mechanism for the increased survival after irradiation could be the increase in DNA double-strand break repair monitored at 6, 8 and 10 h after the transfer of exosomes isolated from irradiated cells. This is abrogated by the destabilization of the exosomes. Our results demonstrate that radiation influences both the abundance and action of exosomes on <b>recipient</b> <b>cells.</b> Exosomes transmit prosurvival effects by promoting the proliferation and radioresistance of head and neck cancer cells. Taken together, this study indicates a functional role of exosomes in the response of tumor cells to radiation exposure within a therapeutic dose range and encourages that exosomes are useful objects of study for a better understanding of tumor radiation response...|$|R
50|$|Microcell Mediated Chromosome Transfer (or MMCT) is a {{technique}} used in cell biology and genetics to transfer a chromosome from a defined donor cell line into a <b>recipient</b> <b>cell</b> line. MMCT has been in use since the 1970s and has contributed to a multitude of discoveries including tumor, metastasis and telomerase suppressor genes {{as well as information}} about epigenetics, x-inactivation, mitochondrial function and aneuploidy. MMCT follows the basic procedure where donor cells (i.e. cells providing one or more chromosomes or fragments to a <b>recipient</b> <b>cell)</b> are induced to multinucleate their chromosomes.

When DNA is transferred to the <b>recipient</b> <b>cell</b> by conjugation,the viral genes in the transferred DNA are immediately turned on because the <b>recipient</b> <b>cell</b> lacks the repressor.

When <b>recipient</b> <b>cells</b> were treated {{at the time}} of DNA addition with concentrations of streptolydigin (STG) as inhibitory of RNA synthesis as RIF, discrimination was not reduced. The kinetics of RNA synthesis inhibition with these inhibitors indicated that, as reported for other bacterial species, RIF inhibited the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase, whereas STG inhibited the progression of RNA polymerase at any point. Pulse-labeling of RNA immediately before STG addition showed that, if cells were incubated under STG inhibition for 10 to 15 min, their nascent RNA was degraded. Genome-bound RNA polymerase was not released under these conditions. When <b>recipient</b> <b>cells</b> were incubated with STG until nascent RNA was degraded and then exposed to transforming DNA, STG was as effective as RIF in reducing discrimination.

40|$|SummaryConjugation enables {{horizontal}} transmission of DNA among bacteria, thereby facilitating the rapid spread of genes {{such as those}} conferring resistance to antibiotics. Cell-cell contact is required for conjugative DNA transfer but does not ensure its success. The presence of certain plasmids in potential <b>recipient</b> <b>cells</b> inhibits redundant transfer of these plasmids from competent donors despite contact between donor and <b>recipient</b> <b>cells.</b> Here, we used two closely related integrating conjugative elements (ICEs), SXT and R 391, to identify genes that inhibit redundant conjugative transfer. Cells containing SXT exclude transfer of a second copy of SXT but not R 391 and vice versa. The specific exclusion of SXT and R 391 is dependent upon variants of TraG and Eex, ICE-encoded inner membrane proteins in donor and <b>recipient</b> <b>cells,</b> respectively.
