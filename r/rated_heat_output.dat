40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} test results of an external thermoelectric generator that utilizes the waste heat from a small-scale domestic biomass boiler with nominal <b>rated</b> <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of 25 kW. The low-temperature Bi 2 Te 3 generator based on thermoelectric modules {{has the potential to}} recover waste heat from gas combustion products as effective energy. The small-scale generator is constructed from independent segments. Measurements have shown that up to 11 W of electricity can be generated by one segment. Higher output power can be achieved by linking thermoelectric segments. The maximum output power is given by the dew point of the flue gas. The electrical energy that is generated can be used, e. g., for power supply or for charging batteries. In the near future, thermoelectric generators could completely eliminate the dependence an automated domestic boiler system on the power supply from the electricity grid, and could ensure comfortable operation {{in the event of an}} unexpected power grid failure...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to determine thermal and pressure-drop performance and the operational characteristics of a Stewart-Warner model 906 -B combustion heater. The performance tests covered a range of ventilating-air flows from 500 to 3185 pounds per hour, combustion-air pressure drops from 5 to 35 inches of water, and pressure altitudes from sea level to 41, 000 feet. The operational characteristics investigated were the combustion-air flows for sustained combustion and for consistent ignition covering fuel-air ratios ranging from 0. 033 to 0. 10 and pressure altitudes from sea level to 45, 000 feet. <b>Rated</b> <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of 50, 000 Btu per hour was obtained at pressure altitudes up to 27, 000 feet for ventilating-air flows greater than 800 pounds per hour; rated output was not obtained at ventilating-air flow below 800 pounds per hour at any altitude. The maximum heater efficiency {{was found to be}} 60. 7 percent at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 050, a sea-level pressure altitude, a ventilating-air temperature of 0 F, combustion-air temperature of 14 F, a ventilating-air flow of 690 pounds per hour, and a combustion-air flow of 72. 7 pounds per hour. The minimum combustion-air flow for sustained combustion at a pressure altitude of 25, 000 feet was about 9 pounds per hour for fuel-air ratios between 0. 037 and 0. 099 and at a pressure altitude of 45, 000 feet increased to 18 pounds per hour at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 099 and 55 pounds per hour at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 036. Combustion could be sustained at combustion-air flows above values of practical interest. The maximum flow was limited, however, by excessively high exhaust-gas temperature or high pressure drop. Both maximum and minimum combustion-air flows for consistent ignition decrease with increasing pressure altitude and the two curves intersect at a pressure altitude of approximately 25, 000 feet and a combustion-air flow of approximately 28 pounds per hour...|$|E

40|$|The <b>rate</b> of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> {{is one of}} the {{suitable}} {{measurements of}} metabolic activity of the organism or its parts, down to the cellular or even the sub-cellular levels. In this paper, microcalorimetry was first applied to study the metabolic activity of microbial in both alginate-polylysine-alginate and alginate-chitosan-alginate microencapsulated cultures as well as in free non-encapsulated culture. The organisms used for the measurements were Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a result of this work, it was found that, despite E. coli cell in free non-encapsulated culture has the highest metabolic rate due to the highest value of <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> the proliferation of the cells terminates quickly with a lowest biomass formed. And we found also an obviously longer stationary phase in microencapsulated culture. As far as S. cerevisiae was concerned, it was found that there was also the highest value of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> in free non-encapsulated culture, but the cell density was lower than that in microencapsulated culture. On account of the microcalorimetric and metabolic measurements, it can be concluded that more substrate can be used to convert to biomass in microencapsulated culture which means a higher biomass yield existed.

40|$|Klebsiella aerogenes {{has been}} grown in carbon-limited chemostats and the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of {{different}} steady states measured by pumping the culture through an LKB flow microcalorimeter. Initially the flow time between fermentor and microcalorimeter cell was 5 minutes {{during which time}} the steady-state conditions of the chemostat were disturbed and the measured <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> was less than that in the fermentor. To minimise this problem a specially designed fermentor was fitted into the airbath of the microcalorimeter, thus providing temperature control and reducing the flow time between fermentor and microcalorimeter to 1 minute. This design was adequate providing only one dilution rate was used in each experiment. If different dilution rates {{were used in the}} same experiment the fermentor contents could not be maintained at 37 C and inaccurate <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> were recorded. It is believed that with modifications this design may be used to accurately determine the energy changes occuring in chemostat cultures. K. aerogenes has been grown in batch culture in media limited by carbon or nitrogen. Characteristic heat output-time records were obtained for each medium. As growth proceeded the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> increased steadily until oxygen became limiting whereupon the <b>rate</b> of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> decreased.

Metabolic characteristics were obtained including metabolic <b>rate</b> constant (r), <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> in the log phase (Qlog), total heat production (QT), peak time, and measured and potential maximum power output (Pm and Pmax). The powerâtime curves and metabolic characteristics show the differences among Tetrahymena strains. Euclidean dis-tances and a clustering analysis diagram were obtained by metabolic properties. The smaller distances are between the four strains of Tetrahymena thermophila and the largest distance exists between Tetrahymena pyriformis GL and Tetrahymena pigmentosa HG 2.

40|$|Thermal events {{accompanying}} {{the growth of}} K. aerogenes in batch culture in C- and K+-limited salts media were recorded using a flow-microcalorimeter; growth parameters (biomass, CO 2, pO 2 and pH) were also continuously monitored. Calorimetric data is {{discussed in terms of}} i) the power-time trace profile and ii) enthalpy changes associated with formation of cells and utilization of C-source. Standard experimental and cultural conditions, which affect the measured thermal events, were established; at P = 0. 05 the reproducibility of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> was 3 %. The reproducibility of other growth parameters were similar. The p-t trace accompanying aerobic growth in glucose-limited media consisted of a single peak, the maximum power output coincided with the cessation of exponential growth and exhaustion of glucose; at this point the CO 2 output was a maximum and pO 2 a minimum. The total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> increased linearly with glucose concentration. The enthalpy change for anabolic growth processes depends on the temperature and glueose-concentration. Generally the <b>rate</b> of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> exceeded those for biomass and CO 2 production. Maintenance coefficients for batch growth in glucose- and a-methyl glucoside-limited media are calculated. Addition of a second carbon source to cells growing in glucose had a characteristic effect on the p-t trace depending on its carbon content. The p-t trace of glucose-trained cells in media containing a-MG showed that it was metabolized in the presence of glucose. Results of thermal data for cells trained for growth in a-MG and mixed glucose/a-MG media are discussed in terms of known metabolic pathways. The effects of metabolic inhibitors on thermal, events are discussed in terms of their mode of action; azide inhibited growth in glucose but not in alpha-MG. <p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{salinity}} stress on metabolic <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) root tips {{was measured by}} isothermal microcalorimetry. Several varieties differing in tolerance to salinity were compared and differences quantified. Two levels of inhibition by increasing salt were found. Following {{the transition from the}} initial rate of the first level, inhibition remained at about 50 % with further increases in salt concentration up to 150 millimolar. The concentration of salt required to inhibit to this level was cultivar dependent. At highter concentrations (> 150 millimolar) of salt, metabolism was further decreased. This decrease was not cultivar dependent. The decreased <b>rate</b> of metabolic <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> at the first transition could be correlated with decreases in uptake of NO 3 -, NH 4 +, and Pi that occurred as the salt concentration was increased. The high degree of dependence of the inhibition of metabolic <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> on NaCl concentration points to a highly cooperative reaction responsible for the general inhibition of metabolism and nutrient uptake. The time required to attain the first level of salt inhibition is less than 20 minutes. Inhibition of root tips was not reversible by washing with salt free solutions. In addition to revealing these features of salt inhibition, isothermal microcalorimetry is a promising method for convenient and rapid determination of varietal differences in response to increasing salinity...|$|R
40|$|The sprayform tooling {{process is}} a new method for the economic, rapid {{manufacture}} of hard steel production tooling. A robot-manipulated cluster of electric arc spray guns is scanned over a disposable negative ceramic replica of the tool, depositing a molten steel droplet spray and forming a shell of several centimetres thickness. After spraying, the ceramic is removed and the remaining thick steel shell is trimmed, backed and then used in press forming and other production operations. The shell temperature during manufacture must be carefully controlled to produce shells of low or zero distortion. The shell temperature depends on the balance between the <b>rate</b> of <b>heat</b> input from the sprayed metal, the <b>rate</b> of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> by convection to the N 2 atomising gas, and other heat transfer mechanisms. The sprayform process mass yield and the spray shell microstructure are further controlled by the angle at which the steel droplets deposit onto the growing shell surface. This paper describes the development of two new multiple arc wire gun cluster configurations, which are aimed to optimise the manufacture of: (i) relatively large shells and (ii) smaller shells but with severe topography. A mass deposition and subsequent heat flow model for the sprayform tool process have been combined with experimental measurements of critical process parameters, such as the shell surface heat transfer coefficient distribution, to investigate {{the effect of the}} electric arc spray gun cluster design on process yield and shell thermal distributions during the manufacture of thick sprayformed shells...|$|R

For binary PCâPFA blends PC hydration is enhanced {{in the very early}} stages of hydration, but at extended periods (up to 120 h) an increase in PFA replacement level causes a systematic reduction in <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> For binary PCâMK blends the results suggest that the MK initially diminishes PC hydration but the subsequent pozzolanic reaction of MK increasingly contributes to the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> causing some blends to exceed the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of the PC control.

Various factors associated with the synthesis and subsequent storage of tricalcium silicate were found to alter its reactivity and {{it is thought that}} these may be responsible for much of the variability in the reported reactivity of tricalcium silicate preparations. The contribution of the individual factors (such as particle size distribution and impurity ion content) to such reactivity changes was investigated.

Reported values for crossbridge efficiency in human muscles are high compared to values measured in vitro using muscles of other mammalian species. Most in vitro muscle experiments {{have been performed}} at temperatures lower than mammalian physiological temperature, raising the possibility that human efficiency values are {{higher than those of}} isolated preparations because efficiency is temperature dependent.

Measurements were made of the power <b>output</b> and <b>heat</b> production of bundles of muscle fibres from the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and slow-twitch soleus muscles during isovelocity shortening. Mechanical efficiency was defined as the ratio of power output to rate of enthalpy output, where rate of enthalpy output was the sum of the power <b>output</b> and <b>rate</b> of <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> Experiments were performed at 20, 25 and 30 Â°C. Maximum efficiency of EDL muscles was independent of temperature; the highest value was 0. 31 Â± 0. 01 (n= 5) at 30 Â°C. Maximum efficiency of soleus preparations was slightly but significantly higher at 25 and 30 Â°C than at 20 Â°C; the maximum mean value was 0. 48 Â± 0. 02 (n= 7) at 25 Â°C.

A simulation model predicting boiler performances and condensing rate in the boiler heat exchanger is very valuable. The model developed within this work is a one-dimension model of a domestic gasfired condensing boiler. The aim of the model is to {{know whether or not}} the boiler works in good condensing conditions. It gives a better understanding of using and installation requirements of condensing boilers. The structure of the model is similar to a conventional boiler model [1] with a combustion chamber and a dry heat exchanger (HX 1), at which a wet heat exchanger (HX 2) is added (Figure 1). The calculation consists of evaluating combustion gas temperature and gas composition after the dry heat exchanger. Then, retrievable energy from the flue gas is calculated for a fixed geometry and efficiency of wet heat exchanger and for a fixed return water temperature. The heat transfer coefficient in the wet heat exchanger is calculated according to Liang et al. [2]. The influence of different parameters on condensing performances are analysed: excess air, return water temperature and flue gas mass flow <b>rate</b> for different <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> power.

The heat is released microbially {{at the expense}} of organic material; temperature is an effect and, because it is a determinant of microbial activity, it is also a cause of heat output; ventilation supplies oxygen and removes heat, mainly through the vaporization of water; water removal results from heat removal. These relationships were implemented in a field-scale process of static-pile configuration, using a mixture of sewage sludge and wood chips. Heat removal was matched to <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> through a temperature feedback control system, thereby maintaining biologically favorable temperatures.
