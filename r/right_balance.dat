5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was the <b>right</b> <b>balance</b> between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever is in front of the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be put off by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E

An average {{supermarket}} might carry 30,000–60,000 different product lines (product length or assortment), but might carry up to 100 different types of toothpaste (product depth). Specialty retailers typically carry fewer product lines, perhaps as few as 20 lines, but will normally stock greater depth. Costco, for example, carries 5,000 different lines while Aldi carries just 1,400 lines per store.|$|E

The theoretical basis on which these ideas were taught was drawn from types and categories of <b>rights,</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>rights</b> and parents' and children's rights. The teaching of these ethical frameworks, facilitated through action methods, enabled trainees to apply rights-related reasoning to link theory to practice.

25|$|The {{fluid in}} the {{internal}} compartments where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater {{is lower than the}} ambient level, the corals have to work harder to maintain the <b>right</b> <b>balance</b> {{in the internal}} compartment. When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. Depending on how much aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite are too low to pump into the internal compartment. They could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water.|$|E

St. Louis Post-Dispatch television critic Gail Pennington praised Stewart's performance as host writing that he [...] "did the Oscars proud Sunday night, turning in a four-star hosting performance that unfortunately made {{the rest of}} the show seem sluggish by comparison." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was [...] "on target, topical and funny," [...] and added, [...] "He was as relaxed, amusing and at home as Johnny Carson."

Gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing that the [...] "moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality" [...] that makes the film very realistic.

[...] Commenting on finding the <b>right</b> <b>balance</b> between technology- and fantasy-based heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Feige said [...] "Iron Man is a very technological hero; his movies are always technologically based. The first Thor was all about introducing Asgard and Thor in that more fantastical realm into the more reality-based MCU… As we go into Ultron clearly he does come out of technology, but we're using all of our tools at our disposal that we've established so far as part of the MCU to build the storyline of Age of Ultron." ...|$|E

Vital to his new formation, Koeman asked for more wingers, such as Andy van der Meyde, and Boudewijn Zenden, but Benfica did not sign them. Instead, he received attacking midfielders Diego Souza, Andrei Karyaka and Giorgos Karagounis. To improve Koeman's options up-front, composed of Nuno Gomes and Mantorras, Benfica tried but failed to sign Jon Dahl Tomasson. Koeman instead received Italian international Fabrizio Miccoli on loan from Juventus. In defence, Benfica added Brazilians Anderson, Léo, with Nélson [...] replacing Miguel, who moved to Valencia.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{to make use of}} several themes that have since become {{recurring}} elements within David Lynch's works, with a write-up for The A.V. Club describing its contents as [...] "idealized 1950s culture, industrial design, midgets, [...] physical deformity". In addition, the film features two separate but connected worlds, another hallmark of Lynch's writings. The film's art direction would have featured a heavily industrial backdrop, setting the action against an [...] "oil slick, smokestack, steel-steam-soot, fire-sparks and electrical arcs realm", similar to the direction ultimately taken in the depiction of Victorian England in The Elephant Man and the planet Giedi Prime in Dune. Although Lynch's first two feature-length films were shot in black-and-white, he had hoped to film Ronnie Rocket in color, inspired by the works of French film-maker Jacques Tati.

500|$|Let Me In: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the film's soundtrack album. It was {{released}} by Varèse Sarabande on October 12, 2010. The score was composed by Michael Giacchino.

He mentioned, [...] "I {{was always trying to}} say, 'let's take music out!' and Matt [...] was like, 'no, put it in!'" [...] In composing the score, he stated that he also applied certain musical themes to each character for which the audience could respond to as the story progressed.

Or should this be sentimental? Or should it be emotional? Or should it be this? It was a weird balance because you're dealing with a dynamic that is quite questionable as far as what everyone's intentions are in the film.|$|E
