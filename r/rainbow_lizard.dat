50|$|P. giganteum infects the <b>rainbow</b> <b>lizard</b> (Agama agama), {{as well as}} Agama mossambica and Agama cyanogaster.|$|E
50|$|Like all Plasmodium species it {{has both}} {{vertebrate}} and insect hosts. The vertebrate host is the <b>rainbow</b> <b>lizard</b> Agama agama. The vectors are Lutzomyia or Culicoides species.|$|E
40|$|Smears of {{peripheral}} {{blood from the}} common <b>rainbow</b> <b>lizard</b> (Agama agama) were examined for the distribution and localization of lipid, glycogen, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase, {{using a variety of}} staining techniques. While erythrocytes were strongly reactive with the peroxidase test, granulocytes and monocytes were only weakly or moderately active. Lipid and glycogen, as well as acid and alkaline phosphatase, were found in granulocytes and monocytes. Some lymphocytes showed weak acid phosphatase and moderate PAS activities. A small population of 'mononuclear' cells was noted which were not reactive to any of the histochemical tests adopted...|$|E

30|$|Large {{variations}} in the total WBC and TT counts were reported for V. ammodytes in this study, {{as well as for}} other reptiles, and are considered normal (Duguy 1970; Campbell and Ellis 2007). The mean total WBC count in V. ammodytes was similar to that reported for some other snake species (Troiano et al. 2000), but it was higher than those reported for pre- and posthibernating vipers held in captivity (Dutton and Taylor 2003). It is considered normal that wild populations have higher total WBC values than captive ones, probably due to elevated parasite infestations and also due to differences in ambient conditions between natural and captive environments (Salakij et al. 2002; Rangel-Mendoza et al. 2009). Some lizards show high values of the total WBC count (Sodeinde and Ogunjobi 1994), which is near the maximum value recorded for V. ammodytes. Wojtaszek (1991) reported TT count in Natrix natrix ranging from 32 to 34 × 109 /L, depending on the sex, similar to results of the present study. The thrombocyte/leukocyte ratio was approximately 2 for N. natrix, compared to 1.5 for V. ammodytes. In V. ammodytes, the range in the TT count was wider than that reported for N. natrix. Other reptiles, however, may greatly differ. The <b>rainbow</b> <b>lizard</b> Agama agama (Sodeinde and Ogunjobi 1994) has a relatively low TT count that ranges from 5.6 to 8.8 × 109 /L, and leukocytes up to seven or nine times higher than thrombocytes in same unit of volume.|$|E
40|$|Agama agama, the agamid <b>rainbow</b> <b>lizard,</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to serve as transport and reservoir host to several protozoan and helminth parasites. We randomly sampled 310 specimens between May and July, 2005, at Oyingbo, Lagos, Nigeria (6 ° 34 ' 60 '' N- 3 ° 19 ' 59 '' E and 6 ° 34 ' 60 '' N- 3 ° 19 ' 59 '' E). They harboured four species of nematodes: Strongyluris brevicaudata, Parapharyngodon awokoyai, Capillaria sp. and Oxyuris sp.; one of Cestoda, Oochoristica agamae; one of Trematoda, Mesocoelium monas; and one of Pentastomida, Raillietiella sp. Strongyluris brevicaudata had the highest prevalence of infection (82. 3 %), followed by P. awokoyai (74. 5 %), Raillietiella (10. 3 %), Capillaria sp. (8. 4 %) and O. agamae (7. 4 %). M. monas and Oxyuris sp. had low prevalences: 1. 61 % each. Raillietiella sp. and Capillaria sp. can cause localized inflammation and intestinal infections in humans. The prevalence of infection was higher in larger adult lizards. Prevalence in males was 97. 6 % (94. 1 % in females). In four of the helminth species, intensity of infection was higher in male lizards. Parasite intensity was highest in the rectum, followed by the intestine (p < 0. 05). Infection intensity was, to a large extent, dependent on the type of parasite, and age of lizard. During May, P. awokoyai had its highest mean intensities and prevalence. The prevalence and mean intensity of helminthes varied with the month of collection (both p < 0. 05). For the three months studied, prevalence and mean intensity of S. brevicaudata were highest in June (July for the other species) ...|$|E

50|$|Rock monitor lizard, {{water monitor}} lizard, giant plated <b>lizard,</b> <b>rainbow</b> skink, ground agama and {{speckled}} thick toed gecko {{have all been}} seen in Mapungubwe National Park.There {{are estimated to be}} at least thirty-two species of snake in the park, although only fifteen have thus far been confirmed. Some of these species include the southern African python, snouted cobra, black mamba, both horned and puff adders, and at least three species of whip or sand snakes. Nile crocodile occur in and along the Limpopo River.|$|R
50|$|Bijilo Forest Park has {{a diverse}} fauna of invertebrates, {{reptiles}} and mammals. There are troops of green monkeys, Western red colobus, Campbell's mona monkey and patas. The green monkeys have been fed by visitors {{and this has}} caused issues with the monkeys and the park {{is now trying to}} stop this practice. There is also a population of the nocturnal Senegal bushbaby. Other mammal species which can be seen include the Gambian sun squirrel, African civet, genets, mongooses, brush-tailed porcupine among other smaller, less noticeable species. The forest is also home to a diverse reptile fauna including agama, <b>rainbow</b> and monitor <b>lizards</b> and some interesting and colour ful insects and invertebrates including fire ants, dragonflies, termites, butterflies, and the golden silk orb-weaver.|$|R
6000|$|On a pale-yellow, windy {{evening in}} October Carl Meredith went away. He had enlisted on his eighteenth birthday. John Meredith saw {{him off with}} a set face. His two boys were gone--there was only little Bruce left now. He loved Bruce and Bruce's mother dearly; but Jerry and Carl were {{the sons of the}} bride of his youth and Carl {{was the only one of}} all his {{children}} who had Cecilia's very eyes. As they looked lovingly out at him above Carl's uniform the pale minister suddenly remembered the day when for the first and last time he had tried to whip Carl for his prank with the eel. That was the first time he had realised how much Carl's eyes were like Cecilia's. Now he realised it again once more. Would he ever again see his dead wife's eyes looking at him from his son's face? What a bonny, clean, handsome lad he was! It was--hard--to see him go. John Meredith seemed to be looking at a torn plain strewed with the bodies of [...] "able-bodied men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five." [...] Only the other day Carl had been a little scrap of a boy, hunting bugs in <b>Rainbow</b> Valley, taking <b>lizards</b> to bed with him, and scandalizing the Glen by carrying frogs to Sunday School. It seemed hardly--right--somehow that he should be an [...] "able-bodied man" [...] in khaki. Yet John Meredith had said no word to dissuade him when Carl had told him he must go.|$|R
