40|$|Highly indebted {{developing}} economies commonly {{also hold}} large external reserves. This behavior seems puzzling given that governments {{in these countries}} borrow with an interest rate penalty to compensate lenders for default risk. Reducing debt {{to the same extent}} as reserves would maintain net liabilities constant while decreasing in-terest payments. However, holding reserves can have insurance benefits in a financial crisis. To rationalize the levels of international reserves and external debt observed in the data, a standard dynamic model of equilibrium default is extended to include dis-tortionary taxation and debt restructuring. This paper shows that fiscal adjustments induced by sovereign default can generate large demand <b>for</b> <b>reserves</b> if <b>taxation</b> is dis-tortionary. At the same time, a non-negligible position in reserves modifies the debt restructuring negotiations upon default. A calibrated version of the model produces recovery rate schedules that are increasing with reserves, as seen in the data, being also able to replicate large positions of reserves and debt to GDP. Finally, I study how both mechanisms play a key quantitative role to generate such result, in fact, not including them, produces a counterfactual demand <b>for</b> <b>reserves</b> that is close to zero...|$|R

50|$|The state {{government}} was {{headed by a}} Viceroy (Subedar Nizam) appointed by the Mughal Emperor between 1576 and 1717. The Viceroy exercised tremendous authority, with his own cabinet and four prime ministers (Diwan). The three deputy viceroys for Bengal proper, Bihar and Orissa were known as the Naib Nazims. An extensive landed aristocracy was established by the Mughals in Bengal. The aristocracy was responsible <b>for</b> <b>taxation</b> and revenue collection. Land holders were bestowed with the title of Jagirdar. The Qadi title was <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> the chief judge. Mansabdars were leaders of the Mughal Army, while faujdars were generals. The Mughals were credited for secular pluralism {{during the reign of}} Akbar, who promoted the religious doctrine of Din-i Ilahi. Later rulers promoted more conservative Islam.|$|R

We examine {{the case of the}} classic Pigouvian tax to control a negative externality, and consider how recycling the revenues, labeling of the tax and information about its purpose affects the support <b>for</b> <b>taxation.</b> We test the support <b>for</b> <b>taxation</b> within a single-price market experiment, in which purchases by some buyers impose external costs on others. Observing behavior consistent with tax-aversion, we also find that recycling the revenues to more narrowly targeted groups seems to increase support <b>for</b> <b>taxation.</b> In the absence of narrow revenue recycling, labeling a Pigouvian instrument as a 'tax' may significantly lower the likelihood of voter support.
