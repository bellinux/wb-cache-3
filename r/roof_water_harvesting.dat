High density and steep land value have driven people to maximise liveable and productive spaces in urban settings. This include the reinvention of roofs’ functions extending from merely a protection from the elements to a platform housing sustainable building technologies such as green roof, rainwater harvesting and photovoltaic power generation. On one hand, researches or different sustainable technologies are competing for funding, resources, space and recognition. On the other hand, some of the green building rating criteria have immense influence on decision makers to choose only one between various sustainable building technologies. This paper explores the possibility of combining green <b>roof,</b> rain <b>water</b> <b>harvest</b> system and building integrated photovoltaic thermal power generation to explore integrated sustainable roof design (ISRD). Potential integration benefits including: i) The increase of roof ambient temperature due to the installation of building integrated photovoltaic thermal power generation can be offset by green roof. ii) The energy gained from building integrated photovoltaic thermal power generation can be utilised to operate irrigation system for green roof during draught season. iii) Polluted rainwater runoff can be cleaned via green roof and improve the quality of collected rainwater in rain <b>water</b> <b>harvest</b> system. iv) <b>Harvested</b> rain <b>water</b> can be utilised to irrigate green roof during hot weather. ISRD can be modified accordingly to suit specific needs. Researchers with different specialisations can work together to conduct research based on ISRD and to explore possibilities integrating other suitable sustainable technologies into ISRD...|$|R
50|$|Rainwater harvesting, {{irrespective}} of the technology used, essentially means harvesting and storing water in days of abundance, for use in lean days. Storing of rainwater {{can be done in}} two ways; (i) storing in an artificial storage and (ii) in the soil media as groundwater. The former is more specifically called <b>roof</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> and is rather a temporary measure, focusing on human needs providing immediate relief from drinking water scarcity, while the latter has the potential to provide sustainable relief from water scarcity, addressing the needs of all living classes in nature. Through the proposed individual rainwater harvesting, units will be made available to the beneficiaries. Rain water harvesting has gained popularity in Kerala through various projects implemented by different agencies. The Rain Water Harvesting Campaign of the Government and publicity by various media are responsible for popularizing rain water harvesting in the state. Rainwater harvesting is viewed as a water security measure for the State of Kerala, with two broad types of programmes.|$|E

The objective of this study is, therefore, designed to analyze factors influencing the adoption of Domestic <b>Roof</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Harvesting</b> (DRWH) practices using a binary logit model. The results of the study are based on data collected from a survey of 120 households which are selected using purposive and stratified sampling techniques to select enumeration areas and sampling unit (sample strata) respectively. And 30 sample respondents are selected using purposive sampling from each stratum. In addition 20 non household water users are selected purposively for focus group discussion. The binary logit model used a total of 11 explanatory variables. Out of which 8 variables were significant to affect household decision to adopt DRWH practices. These are age, monthly income, perception towards quality & reliability of existing water supply, social responsibility and attitude towards importance of <b>roof</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting,</b> house ownership and affordability of the technology. Therefore, this study focuses on the extent of adopting DRWH as an alternative source of fresh water in the face of increasing water scarcity since it is remaining untapped resource.

40|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> {{is being}} widely {{promoted}} as a panacea {{for the growing}} drinking water crisis in India and many underdeveloped and developing countries. This article analyzes the scope, physical feasibility, and economic viability of <b>roof</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> systems across classes and under different physical and socioeconomic situations. This article argues that <b>roof</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> systems (RWHS) are not alternative to public systems in {{urban and rural areas}} of regions receiving low rainfall. Hydrological opportunities for RWHS are very poor in urban and rural areas. The systems offer very little scope in ensuring domestic water security for urban housing stocks of low- and middle-income groups. At the same time, they offer tremendous potential for independent bungalows having large roof area. However, their physical feasibility is very poor in urban areas. Their economic viability as a supplementary source of domestic water supply seems to be poor in urban areas, when compared to augmenting the supplies from the existing public systems. The incredibly low rates charged for domestic supplies by urban water utilities and government subsidies for RWHS would only lead to the urban elite increasing their access to water supplies, while the burden on water utilities would remain unchanged. This will lead to greater inequities in access to water supplies. At the same time, in rural areas with dispersed populations and hilly areas, RWHS may be economically viable as a supplementary source to already existing public water supply schemes. But as its impacts {{are not likely to be}} uniform across classes, government subsidies are not desirable. In hilly regions receiving high rainfalls, government investment for community water supply schemes could be replaced by heavy subsidies for installation of RWHS...|$|E
40|$|Till {{about thirty}} years back, the areas around our homes and offices {{used to be}} unpaved and the rain falling on these areas would {{percolate}} into the soil and remain there for being drawn through shallow open wells. Consequently open wells and not - so - deep bore wells started drying up. The reason is that no sincere attempt is made to replenish the ground water table with rainwater during the monsoon. The Rainwater harvesting is the simple collection or storing of water through scientific techniques from the areas where the rain falls. It involves utilization of rain water for the domestic or the agricultural purpose. The method of rain <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> has been into practice since ancient times. It is as far {{the best possible way}} to conserve water and awaken the society towards the importance of water. The method is simple and cost effective too. It is especially beneficial in the areas, which faces the scarcity of water. This is when Rain <b>water</b> <b>Harvesting</b> proves to be {{the most effective way to}} conserve water. We can collect the rain water into the tanks and prevent it from flowing into drains and being wasted. It is practiced on the large scale in the metropolitan cities. Rain <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> comprises of storage of water and water recharging through the technical process. India is land of versatile whether where inconsistency in rain is frequent. So as an option of having a back-up for water needs, one system becomes necessary which provides much saving of <b>water.</b> Although rainwater <b>harvesting</b> (RWH) is gaining popularity as a sustainable water saving system in urban as well as rural areas, estimating required storage area for water remains an important design challenge so we are going to design an effective plan by which we can collect rain water into a storage for a particular campus and we are also going to make a design by which we can recharge the ground water.

40|$|Sri Lanka {{receives}} {{an average annual}} rainfall varying from 900 mm to 6000 mm. However, the rainfall is not distributed equally over the island. Hence, traditionally, the country {{is divided into three}} main climatic zones as wet zone, dry zone and intermediate zone. Two thirds of the island is occupied by the dry zone, which receives less than 1750 mm of average annual rainfall. The dry zone periodically has faced water stress conditions from the past, and Hambantota District appears to be a severely affected area, on the basis of surface water availability. With the ongoing development projects, the demand for water in the district will increase in the next few years. Therefore, implementation of a proper water management system as well as preservation of existing surface and groundwater resources is essential to overcome this problem. A methodology is developed to find the most suitable locations for water harvesting structures in Hambantota District by using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. Suriyawewa Divisional Secretariat area is selected as the research area considering its average climatic conditions and location within Hambantota District. This methodology can be generalized to the whole District in the first instance. The research area is hydrologically analyzed to discretize the area into catchments and the preferred catchments to harvest the runoff based on surface area, slope and rainfall are found by using GIS techniques. The selected catchments are then analyzed with geological data and drainage characteristics to find the most suitable catchments to construct reservoirs to store rainwater. The analysis yields four such locations, which were subsequently field verified for spatial accuracy. However detailed local investigations are necessary before proceeding to actual construction of the reservoirs. Groundwater recharging also {{plays an important role in}} water management, as groundwater represents 30. 1 % of the world’s fresh water resources. GIS techniques are employed to integrate data on land use, climate, soil, stream pattern and ground slopes, and consequently to find potential areas for groundwater recharging. Here also, detailed local investigation must precede any construction work in the selected areas. Also, potential areas to implement <b>roof</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> projects in Suriyawewa are found by analyzing the rainfall and building cover by using GIS techniques. These areas are recommended to be used as project areas when implementing efficient <b>roof</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> methods.

An increment in water harvesting can significantly increase the crop yields in these areas and improve the economy as most of the Districts in the Dry Zone are agriculture-based. Also, a proper water management system is a must for the industrial development of the area under focus, while it gives a solution to the problems regarding drinking water.

40|$|Khartoum State in Sudan {{is subject}} to the erratic and intense {{rainfall}} during the short rainy season and dryness and heat {{throughout the rest of the}} year. High intensity rainstorms with a short duration have become more frequent in the area during the last two decades resulting in cities inundation and flash floods in the rural parts. On the other hand, the dry season means hot weather in the urban parts and water shortage in the rural part. Rural areas are dependent on the runoff water brought about by the seasonal streams as a source of water. For this study, Khartoum City Center and Seleit area were taken to investigate the application of water harvesting in the urban and rural areas, respectively. Accordingly, the hydrological characteristics and the specification of the potential water harvesting sites and systems were examined. For Khartoum City Center, characteristics of the drainage system were examined using ArcGIS platform. It is found that the drainage system covers 42 % of the area with total capacity of 24000 m 3. Daily rainfall data for urban meteorological station were used to calculate the probability and the return period of the rainfall, as well as the potential runoff. Rainfall probability of occurrence was calculated applying Gumbel distribution method for extreme events that were arranged according to the Peak-over-Threshold method. The potential runoff that could be generated from a certain rainfall was calculated using the Natural Resources Conservation Services method provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (US-NRCS). Accordingly, the curve number was calculated depending on the land use/land cover and the hydrological soil group. Consequently, the weighted curve number is found to be 94 %, indicating dominant imperviousness. 13. 1 mm rainfall depth produces runoff volume equal to the drainage system capacity with return period of one year; whereas more than four folds the drainage system capacity is produced by 30 mm rainfall depth that is considered the threshold for raising flood hazard. Six potential sites for roof rainwater harvesting were selected. Accordingly, it is found that, the application of <b>roof</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in 18 % and 72 % of the commercial and business district buildings can accommodate the runoff resulting from the 13. 1 and 30 mm rainfall depth, respectively. Hence, impounding rainstorm water would help managing the urban runoff water, and consequently, the stored water could be used for making more green areas that will enhance the urban environment. Three watersheds of ephemeral streams (wadi), namely Wadi El Kangar, Wadi El Seleit, and Wadi El Kabbashi make up Seleit area. Distinct maps were prepared in ArcMap for the calculation of the potential runoff and the specification of the appropriate water harvesting sites and systems. The Wadis watersheds areas are found to be 540, 344 and 42 km 2 for Wadi El Kangar, Wadi El Seleit and Wadi El Kabbashi, respectively. Daily rainfall data of rural meteorological station were classified into three groups representing the soil dry (AMCI), moderate (AMCII), and wet (AMCIII) moisture conditions; the respective CNI, CNII, and CNIII values were calculated accordingly. The weighted CN values indicate high runoff potential within the three soil moisture conditions. Accordingly, the rainfall thresholds for runoff generation for AMCI, AMCII and AMCIII conditions are found to be respectively 18. 3 mm, 9. 1 mm and 4. 4 mm for Wadi El Kabbashi and 22 mm, 11 mm and 5 mm for both Wadi El Seleit and Wadi El Kangar. El Kangar dam subwatershed was used for calibrating the potential runoff calculated by the NRCS method. Since the Wadis are ungauged, Google Earth and GIS platforms were used to calculate geometrically the volume of the dam reservoir water for three years. This volume was compared to the annual runoff calculated by the NRCS method. Consideration to different factors was made to locate the potential water harvesting sites. Accordingly, water harvesting systems for fodder and crop plantation; sand storage surface or subsurface dams; or groundwater recharge, were specified. The socio-economic study revealed that the financial capacity, if any, of the villagers is very limited. Thus, the financial source for the construction of the suggested potential water harvesting or the rehabilitation of the existing ones is questionable. Hence, other potential financial sources are needed to help executing water harvesting projects in the region, e. g. Khartoum State Government. Applying water harvesting in Seleit area is found to be promising. Improving the livelihood of the villagers by applying runoff water harvesting could assure better water accessibility, better income generation from farms production, and allocation of time for other activities, e. g. education. This would be reflected in reduced migration to nearby cities and stabilized market supply of agricultural and animal products. Therefore, the development of the rural part is of great benefit to the development of Khartoum State, as long as the interdependency and mutual benefit between the rural and urban areas, represented by the local food and labor market, remain exist...|$|E

Identifying the suitability of positive displacement pumps over centrifugal pumps when connected to photo voltaic power source, a viable and cost effective solar pumping system is proposed to be used as an integrated draw-off device for a potential RWH system to be used in domestic situation...|$|R

In-field <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> can potentially enhance soil water storage, and this will enable crops to survive during mid season droughts. Improved <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> may result in improved crop yields, food security and livelihood among households. <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting</b> should be integrated with other management strategies e.g., improving soil fertility management, tillage, timing of operations, pest management and choice of cropping system in order to increase the efficiency of use of the <b>harvested</b> <b>water.</b> Water, is probably the strategic entry point, for reducing risk of crop failure due to water scarcity. However, there is need for changes in policies to promote the use of in-field <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> technology in the semi-arid smallholder farming areas, improved extension activities, knowledge dissemination, and the promotion of farmer-led knowledge sharing to increase the resilience of farmers to changing climate. The policies should also address the current land ownership structure to encourage farmers to invest on their land. <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting</b> technologies from other regions also need to be explored and tested in Zimbabwe. More permanent <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> technologies may be a solution to the problems of perennial high labour requirements of the current <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> practices; hence there is need to promote them. Farmers should be given a ‘farmers basket of innovations’ that is full of options, from which they could select the ones most suited to their complex and diverse agronomic, environmental, climatic, socio-economic conditions and resource endowments.|$|R

The role of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in achieving sustainable agricultural intensification and specified resilience was explored. Suitable areas for <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in the Upper Blue Nile basin were identified. The usefulness of the Curve Number method for surface runoff estimation was evaluated, and was found to perform satisfactorily. The impact of climate change in the Lake Tana sub-basin was studied. A decision support system was developed for locating and sizing of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> ponds in the SWAT model. Methodological developments enabled analysis {{of the implications of}} <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> intensification in a meso-scale watershed in the Lake Tana sub-basin. Results suggest that <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> can increase agricultural productivity, sustain ecosystems and build specified resilience, and thereby contribute to sustainable agricultural intensification. There is considerable potential for <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in the Upper Blue Nile Basin. Rainfall may increase in the Lake Tana sub-basin due to climate change. Supplementary irrigation from <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> ponds and better nutrient application increased staple crop production by up to three-fold. Moreover, a substantial amount of cash crop was produced using dry seasonal irrigation. <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting</b> altered the streamflow regime, and reduced sediment loss from the watershed.        <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting</b> can {{play an important role in}} food security. It showed potential to buffer climatic variability. In the watershed studied, <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> will not compromise the environmental water requirements. Instead, increased low flows, and reduced flooding and sediment loss may benefit the social-ecological systems. The adverse effects of disturbance of the natural flow variability and sediment influx to certain riverine ecosystems warrant detailed investigation.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>harvesting</b> {{systems have}} {{improved}} productivity in various regions in sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, {{they can help}} retain water in landscapes, build resilience against droughts and dry spells, and thereby contribute to sustainable agricultural intensification. However, there is no strong empirical evidence that shows the effects of intensification of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> on upstream–downstream social–ecological systems at a landscape scale. In this paper we develop a decision support system (DSS) for locating and sizing <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> ponds in a hydrological model, which enables assessments of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> intensification on upstream–downstream ecosystem services in meso-scale watersheds. The DSS was used with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for a case-study area located in the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia. We found that supplementary irrigation in combination with nutrient application increased simulated teff (Eragrostis tef, staple crop in Ethiopia) production up to three times, compared to the current practice. Moreover, after supplemental irrigation of teff, the excess water was used for dry season onion production of 7. 66 t/ha (median). <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting,</b> therefore, {{can play an important}} role in increasing local- to regional-scale food security through increased and more stable food production and generation of extra income from the sale of cash crops. The annual total irrigation water consumption was ~ 4 %– 30 % of the annual water yield from the entire watershed. In general, <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> resulted in a reduction in peak flows and an increase in low flows. <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting</b> substantially reduced sediment yield leaving the watershed. The beneficiaries of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> ponds may benefit from increases in agricultural production. The downstream social–ecological systems may benefit from reduced food prices, reduced flooding damages, and reduced sediment influxes, as well as enhancements in low flows and water quality. The benefits of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> warrant economic feasibility studies and detailed analyses of its ecological impacts...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} spatial-scale {{variations}} on <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> has been evaluated at micro-catchment, hillside/farm, and watershed (=catchment) scales in three relatively dry environments in Syria, Pakistan and Egypt. Micro-catchment <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> captures localized runoff only through independent micro-catchment systems {{and is not}} influenced by hill slope runoff and stream flows. In Syria, {{it was found that}} only a fraction of total runoff from a catchment is collected, with no significant effect on water supply downstream. Therefore, it is less sensitive to spatial-scale variations (rainfall, topography, soils) and it is less likely to create upstream-downstream water-use conflicts. Micro-catchment <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> established fodder shrubs, with 3 - 7 fold growth improvement and 27 to 90 % survival rate. In contrast, spatial rainfall and geo-hydrological variations greatly influenced the potential of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> at the watershed scale in north-west Egypt. The study revealed the importance of scientific data and appropriate assessment methods. Due to potential socio-economic disputes, the institutional arrangements for water allocation and conflict resolution are critical at this scale. At the farm scale, the low-cost farm runoff structures (US$ 48 per structure), effectively regulated the runoff, reduced terrace damage and improved field soil moisture, and were shown to be suitable for <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> on terraces in Barani, Pakistan. The study infers that <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in the drylands is a viable option to improve productivity and conserve natural resources, if it is appropriately implemented. Nevertheless, the size of the <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> system and the spatial scale at which it is to be implemented determine the options for <b>water</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
