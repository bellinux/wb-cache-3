A host can use a bandwidth estimation probe to determine the bandwidth between itself and any other host in the system. The {{problem is that the}} result of such a measurement may not necessarily be the sender's upload bandwidth, since the most bandwidth <b>restricted</b> <b>link</b> on the path could also be the receiver's download bandwidth. In this paper, we formally define the bandwidth determination problem and devise efficient distributed algorithms. We consider two models, the free-departure and no-departure model, depending on whether hosts keep participating in the algorithm even after their bandwidth has been determined. We present lower bounds on the time-complexity of any collaborative bandwidth measurement algorithm in both models. We then show how, for realistic bandwidth distributions, the lower bounds can be overcome. Specifically, we present O(1) and O(log log n) -time algorithms for the two models. We corroborate these theoretical findings with practical measurements on a implementation on PlanetLab...|$|E

Since the traffic characteristics of encoded video {{have a significant impact}} on its network transport, we examine the bit rate-distortion and bit rate variability-distortion perfor-mance of single-layer video traffic of the H. 264 /AVC codec and SVC extension using long CIF resolution videos. We also compare the traffic characteristics of the hierarchical B frames (SVC) versus classical B frames. In addition, we examine the impact of frame size smoothing on the video traffic to mitigate the effect of bit rate vari-abilities. We find that compared to MPEG- 4 Part 2, the H. 264 /AVC codec and SVC extension achieve lower average bit rates at the ex-pense of significantly increased traffic variabilities that remain at a high level even with smoothing. Through simulations we investi-gate the implications of this increase in rate variability on (i) frame losses when transmitting a single video, and (ii) on a bufferless statistical multiplexing scenario with <b>restricted</b> <b>link</b> capacity and information loss.

This study aimed at presenting a review of major inflammatory chemical mediators {{and place them in}} neuropathic pain pathophysiology. CONTENTS: Inflammation is the homeostatic response of vascularized tissues to remove harmful agents and restore their normal functions. Nervous system (central and/or peripheral) diseases and injuries may induce neuropathic pain and may also modify inflammatory process nervous mediation. In such pathological conditions, there might be pain without <b>restrict</b> <b>link</b> with admitedly harmful or painful stimuli, as well as there might be inflammation without <b>restrict</b> <b>link</b> with the presence of harmful agents and the need to remove them. Chemical mediators involved in neuropathic pain and inflammation pathophysiology modulate the presentation of both. CONCLUSION: Studies on inflammation offer evidences to support the important role of their chemical mediators in neuropathic pain pathogenesis. In peripheral and central sensitization, a thin borderline between reversibility or not of neuropathic pain may be respected or exceeded by inflammatory mediators actions...|$|R

40|$|A categorification of a {{polynomial}} link invariant is an homological invariant {{which contains}} the polynomial one as its graded Euler characteristic. This field has been initiated by Khovanov categorification of the Jones polynomial. Later, P. Ozsvath and Z. Szabo gave a categorification of Alexander polynomial. Besides their increased abilities for distinguishing knots, this new invariants seem to carry many geometrical informations. On the other hand, Vassiliev works gives {{another way to}} study link invariant, by generalizing them to singular links i. e. links with {{a finite number of}} rigid transverse double points. The first part of this thesis deals with a possible relation between these two approaches {{in the case of the}} Alexander polynomial. To this purpose, we extend grid presentation for links to singular links. Then we use it to generalize Ozsvath and Szabo invariant to singular links. Besides the consistency of its definition, we prove that this invariant is acyclic under some conditions which naturally make its Euler characteristic vanish.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} a road pricing scheme that aims to <b>restrict</b> <b>link</b> traffic flows on a network within a {{predetermined}} upper-bound, such as road physical or environmental capacity. In our previous sequential experimental approach, the optimal link tolls are obtained, without resorting to both analytical travel cost and demand functions. In each trial, two steps are involved, prediction and correction, based on the observed link flows associated with a given link toll pattern. One key assumption made in the study is that the observed link flows are exactly in a deterministic equilibrium. This assumption is of course questionable in real applications, {{given the fact that}} travelers need sufficient time to learn and adjust their trip-making decisions in a new pricing environment. In this study, the exact prediction-correction method is modified to a partially inexact trial method, whose convergence is established theoretically. Numerical experiment shows that the partially inexact trial method is even more cost efficient in terns of the overall convergence rate. The extension thus obviates the requirement for observation of exact deterministic traffic equilibrium after each price experiment and makes the sequential experimental approach more robust in real applications...|$|R
40|$|With over 17 {{emissions}} trading systems (ETSs) {{now in place}} across four continents, interest in linking ETSs is growing. Linking ETSs offers economic, political, and administrative benefits. It also faces major challenges. Linking can affect overall ambition, financial flows, and the location and nature of investments, reduces regulatory autonomy, and requires harmonization of ETS design elements. This article examines three options that could help overcome challenges by restricting the flow of units among jurisdictions through quotas, exchange rates, or discount rates. We use a simple model and three criteria—abatement outcome, economic implications, and feasibility—to assess these ‘restricted linking’ options. Quotas can enhance cost-effectiveness relative to no linking and allow policy-makers to retain control {{on the extent of}} unit flows. Exchange rates can create abatement and economic benefits or unintended adverse implications for cost-effectiveness and total abatement, depending on how rates are set. Due to information asymmetries between the regulated entities and policy-makers setting the exchange rate, as well as uncertainties about future developments, setting exchange rates in a manner that avoids such unintended consequences could prove difficult. Discount rates, in contrast, can ensure that both cost-effectiveness and total abatement are enhanced. Overall, <b>restricted</b> <b>linking</b> options do not achieve the benefits of full linking, but also avoid some major pitfalls, as well as offering levers that can be adjusted, should linking concerns prove to be more significant than anticipated. </p...|$|R

However, pairing such low Q-factor loops in inductive energy transmission <b>links</b> <b>restricts</b> the <b>link</b> transmission performance. The contribution {{of this paper}} is to assess the improvement that is reached with a two-stage design method, concerning the transmission performance of a planar square loop relative to an initial design, without compromise to a Q-factor constraint. The first stage of the synthesis flow is analytical in approach, and determines the number and spacing of turns by which coupling between similar paired square loops can be enhanced with low deviation from the Q-factor limit presented by an initial design. The second stage applies full-wave electromagnetic simulations to determine more appropriate turn spacing and widths to match the Q-factor constraint, and achieve improved coupling relative to the initial design. Evaluating the design method in a test scenario yielded a more than 5 % increase in link transmission efficiency, as well as an improvement in the link fractional bandwidth by more than 3 %, without violating the loop Q-factor limit. These transmission performance enhancements are indicative of a potential for modifying proximity HF-RFID reader antennas for efficient inductive energy transfer and data telemetry links...|$|R

Endothelial cells (EC) have previously been shown to be the target of activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) resulting in extensive cell lysis. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are multipotent cells which can be isolated from multiple sites, each demonstrating immunomodulatory capabilities. They are explored herein for their potential to protect EC from CTL-targeted lysis. CD 8 (+) T cells isolated from human PBMC were stimulated with mitotically inactive cells of a human microvascular endothelial cell line (CDC/EU. HMEC- 1, further referred to as HMEC) for 7 days. Target HMEC were cultured in the presence or absence of MSC for 24 h before exposure to activated allogeneic CTL for 4 h. EC were then analysed for cytotoxic lysis by flow cytometry. Culture of HMEC with MSC in the efferent immune phase (24 h before the assay) led to a decrease in HMEC lysis. This lysis was determined to be MHC Class I <b>restricted</b> <b>linked</b> and further analysis suggested that MSC contact is important in abrogation of lysis, as protection is reduced where MSC are separated in transwell experiments. The efficacy of multiple sources of MSC was also confirmed, and the collaborative effect of MSC and the endothelium protective drug defibrotide were determined, with defibrotide enhancing the protection provided by MSC.
