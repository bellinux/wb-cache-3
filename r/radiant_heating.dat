5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses <b>radiant</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E
25|$|Comfort {{is reached}} at lower air {{temperature}} due to eliminating circulating air. <b>Radiant</b> <b>heating</b> experiences highest comfort levels as people's own energy (± 70 Watt for an adult) (must radiate out in heating season) is in balance with its surrounds. Compared to convection heating {{system based on}} academic research the air temperatures may be lowered by up to 3 degrees.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of the CIRS, UBC's new Student Union Building, which opened in summer 2015, was also {{designed}} to adhere to the most stringent sustainability requirements.

40|$|In this work, {{a multidimensional}} model {{that the authors}} have {{previously}} developed for computing <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> loss in an internal combustion engine is applied to study <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> loss characteristics in a Diesel engine. The model is applied to {{study the effects of}} load and speed on <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> transfer in the engine. It is shown that as load is increased the <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> loss increases and the fraction of <b>radiant</b> to total <b>heat</b> loss increases from about 12 % at an overall equivalence ratio of 0. 3 to 16 % at an overall equivalence ratio of 0. 5. As speed is increased, the <b>radiant</b> and total <b>heat</b> loss again increase but the ratio of <b>radiant</b> to total <b>heat</b> loss remains about the same for the cases considered. It is shown that there is a strong correlation between the <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> loss characteristics and soot concentration and temperature in the chamber...|$|R

25|$|Chairman Doug Robertson told Northern News Services {{that the}} church was looking at {{applying}} for grants for green retrofitting. It was considering also replacing the boiler, since it could not change the heating system overall. When built, the church had used a <b>radiant</b> <b>heating</b> system. It was cheaper than the modern forced-air heating, but unlike {{that could not be}} switched off when the church was not in use as it would take too long to warm the building up. it was also necessary to keep the building warm during the bitterly cold Arctic winters to prevent structural issues from developing, and to protect the interior artwork.|$|E
25|$|In November 1948, {{the first}} of these new homes were {{completed}} and ready for occupancy. These one-story, three bedroom houses were constructed on concrete slabs with <b>radiant</b> <b>heating</b> - construction atypical of New England and initially viewed with suspicion by some. This suspicion was apparently unwarranted since the market value of some of the original houses is now over $450,000. The cost of a basic house was $7,820; but a homeowner could also add cedar shingles for $319.00; cedar clapboards with gypsum sheathing ($247.00); a breezeway-type porch without a garage ($325.00) or with a garage ($1,250.00); or a detached garage ($925.00). Some homeowners took advantage of these extras when they selected their houses, while others chose to wait and made additions to their houses at a later date.|$|E
25|$|An {{electric}} {{underfloor heating}} system has heating cables {{embedded in the}} floor. Current flows through a conductive heating material, supplied either directly from the line voltage (120 or 240 volts) or at low voltage from a transformer. The heated cables warm the flooring by direct conduction and will switch off once it reaches the temperature set by the floor thermostat. A warmer floor surface radiates heat to colder surrounding surfaces (ceiling, walls, furniture.) which absorb heat and reflects all non absorbed heat to yet other still cooler surfaces. The cycle of radiation, absorption and reflection starts slowly and slows down slowly nearing set point temperatures and ceases to take place once equilibrium is reached all-round. A floor thermostat or a room thermostat or combination controls the floor on/off. In the process of <b>radiant</b> <b>heating</b> {{a thin layer of}} air which is in touch with the warmed surfaces also absorbs some heat and this creates a little convection (air circulation). Contrary to believe people are not heated by this warmed circulating air or convection (convection has a cooling effect) but are heated by the direct radiation of the source and reflection of its surrounds.|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} model for computing flows, sprays, and combustion in internal combustion engines {{is modified to}} include <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> loss. <b>Radiant</b> <b>heat</b> loss is computed by solving the radiative transport equation using a discrete ordinates approximation method. Such a method solves the radiative transport equation {{for a set of}} discrete directions spanning the range of 4 π solid angle. Angular integrals of intensity are discretized by numerical quadrature. The resulting discrete ordinates equations are numerically solved by using a finite volume approach in contravariant formulation. Computations are made with and without <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> loss in a diesel engine, and the effects of the <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> loss on the computed temperature and NO and soot concentrations are discussed. Inclusion of <b>radiant</b> <b>heat</b> loss reduces the peak temperature by about 10 %. As a result, the predicted frozen NO concentrations are found to be lowered. However, the soot concentrations are not significantly altered...|$|R

2500|$|The Exploratorium at Pier 15 has a {{separate}} system for its ventilation needs, pairing a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) with displacement ventilation distribution to bring outdoor {{air into the}} building. [...] By integrating <b>radiant</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling and displacement ventilation, the Exploratorium has greatly reduced the portion of its HVAC system that relies on forced air. [...] Reducing {{the size of a}} building’s forced air system has the associated benefits of both lower energy loads as well as reduced ductwork, both of which are cost-saving.|$|E
2500|$|Rocket uses a multi-tubular boiler design. Previous {{locomotive}} boilers {{consisted of}} a single pipe surrounded by water (though the Lancashire Witch did have twin flues). Rocket has 25 copper fire-tubes that carry the hot exhaust gas from the firebox, through the wet boiler to the blast pipe and chimney. [...] This arrangement resulted in a greatly increased surface contact area of hot pipe with boiler water when compared to a single large flue. Additionally, <b>radiant</b> <b>heating</b> from the enlarged separate firebox helped deliver a further increase in steaming and hence boiler efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|Falls Church {{was to have}} a home {{designed}} by a famous architect during the inter-war years—if only he would agree. [...] "Of course I will give you a house," [...] responded architect Frank Lloyd Wright to the request by Loren Pope, a Falls Church resident. The Pope-Leighey House, as it would later be called, was built at 1005 Locust Street, just outside the town limit. Nestled in rolling woodland, the house was a Usonian home with concrete floors coated with red-colored wax, piano hinges on the doors, and <b>radiant</b> <b>heating.</b> Wright visited Falls Church numerous times during construction in 1940.|$|E
2500|$|Electric <b>radiant</b> <b>heating</b> [...] uses heating {{elements}} that reach a high temperature. The element is usually packaged inside a glass envelope resembling {{a light bulb}} and with a reflector to direct the energy output {{away from the body}} of the heater. The element emits infrared radiation that travels through air or space until it hits an absorbing surface, where it is partially converted to heat and partially reflected. This heat directly warms people and objects in the room, rather than warming the air. This style of heater is particularly useful in areas through which unheated air flows. They are also ideal for basements and garages where spot heating is desired. More generally, they are an excellent choice for task-specific heating.|$|E
2500|$|Concurrent {{with the}} {{development}} of Broadacre City, also referred to as Usonia, Wright conceived a new type of dwelling that {{came to be known as}} the Usonian House. Although an early version of the form can be seen in the Malcolm Willey House (1934) in Minneapolis, the Usonian ideal emerged most completely in the Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House (1937) in Madison, Wisconsin. Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's <b>radiant</b> <b>heating</b> system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including sandwich walls that consisted of layers of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper, a significant change from typically framed walls. Usonian houses commonly featured flat roofs and were usually constructed without basements or attics, all features that Wright had been promoting since the early 20th century.|$|E

[...] When needed, the bay water is moved to a titanium heat exchanger, of which the building has two, where it is either used to heat or cool water that is cycled through a system of thermally activated radiant slabs. [...] There are [...] of plastic tubing in the <b>radiant</b> <b>heating</b> system in the floor, creating 82 different heating and cooling zones with distinct control systems.
