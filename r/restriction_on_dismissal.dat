40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact on firm-level {{productivity}} of Japan's regulatory <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>dismissal</b> of employees. First, with regard to the route through which <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> employee <b>dismissal</b> affect firm-level productivity we set out hypotheses indicated by economic theory, and we then use firm-level microdata to conduct an empirical analysis of the impact on firm-level productivity of Japan's regulatory <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> employee <b>dismissal.</b> From the results of this analysis we learn that companies' total factor productivity growth is significantly lower when there is a relatively high cumulative number of court rulings voiding employee dismissals. In addition, although we do not observe that the stiffening of <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>dismissals</b> stimulates the substitution of labor by capital inputs, it is clear that there is a significant overall lowering of labor productivity. The effect of employment protection for specific workers does not remain solely at the level of the labor market, and by exerting a negative impact on firm-level productivity it impacts the entire economy. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a search}} and {{matching}} labor market equilibrium model, this paper quantifies lost labor productivity and consumption per worker {{that emerges from}} the <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>dismissals.</b> <b>Dismissal</b> <b>restrictions</b> hamper the efficient reallocation of workers, with workers remaining longer in jobs. But the restrictions also tend to induce job-specific investments. A calibration exercise applied to Portugal suggests that the <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>dismissal</b> slow the pace of worker reallocation and cause substantial losses of labor productivity and consumption. Although lower worker mobility induces job-specific investment that offsets part of the labor productivity and consumption losses, {{the size of this}} offsetting effect is, at most, modest.

30|$|When {{examining}} {{the relationship between}} labor market structures and outcomes, {{it is helpful to}} distinguish between regulations, interventions, and institutions. Regulations set work’s legal parameters, {{in the form of a}} minimum wage and/or <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>dismissal.</b> The state deploys interventions to correct market failures, such as the inability of private financial markets to viably insure the risk of unemployment (unemployment insurance) and differences in how much information employers and job seekers have (job-seeking assistance). Institutions are the structures and agreed procedures for exerting influence and carrying out decisions. For the labor market, the best example is the space afforded in the legal code of most countries for collective bargaining through labor unions.|$|R
30|$|A second common set {{of labor}} laws, {{employment}} protection legislation (EPL), restricts employers’ ability to dismiss workers—reducing flows into unemployment but also out of it. Strict EPL can slow new employment if <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> dismissing workers make employers wary of hiring someone new. For this reason, <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> <b>dismissal</b> can increase unemployment, the duration of unemployment, and the attraction of fixed-term contracts. Past a certain threshold, it can even cause employers {{to turn to the}} untaxed, unregulated labor market. Beyond affecting flows into and out of employment, EPL creates an “insider-outsider” divide. Those that have a protected job (“insiders”) are relatively guarded from losing it, while the inactive and unemployed (“outsiders”) find it more difficult to gain employment. EPL changes the distribution of jobs with important implications for first-time job seekers, youth (especially), women, the disabled, and other disadvantaged groups.|$|R
30|$|As {{discussed}} above, subsidies {{can include}} conditionalities on employers and beneficiaries. In {{the case of}} employers, countries could consider imposing <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>dismissal</b> of workers {{in order to reduce}} substitution effects. They can also condition the subsidy on extending the length of the employment contract after the subsidy expires. Because of monitoring and enforcement reasons, however, it is unclear that the benefits of these conditionalities outweigh the costs.|$|R
40|$|In {{theoretical}} literature, {{the effects}} of employment protection on unemployment are ambiguous. Higher employment protection decreases job creation as well as job destruction. However, in most models, wages are bargained individually between workers and firms. Using a conventional matching model in which a monopoly union sets wages, I show that employment protection can unambiguously increase unemployment. Interestingly, I find that tightening the <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> redundancies and <b>dismissals</b> may even increase the probability of dismissal.

30|$|A second option {{could have}} been {{represented}} by a sweeping deregulation of the labor market, through additional deregulation of both temporary and independent work and a more drastic cutback of <b>restrictions</b> <b>on</b> individual <b>dismissals</b> (De Nicola 2012). However sensible this could appear from an economic point of view (and I have doubts that a labor market freed from binding norms would be a rational choice, {{not to mention the}} social costs), {{it would not have been}} viable politically, given the opposition by at least one of the trade unions (CGIL, the most representative one) and by the party closest to it (the Democratic Party). In any case, it would not have been the choice of this Minister, convinced as I am that encouraging a reduction of labor costs through a progressive impoverishment of labor relationships would have resulted mainly, if not solely, in an increase in casual and precarious jobs. It could have saved some jobs in the short run, but it would have resulted in further productivity decline. Indeed, it is exactly by improving the quality of labor and by investing in human (as well as in physical capital) that productivity and competitiveness can be increased.|$|R

40|$|LL. MThe {{provisions}} of South Africa’s law <b>on</b> <b>dismissal</b> based <b>on</b> operational requirements are frequently relied on by employers who dismiss employees to further various objectives. Against this background, this dissertation critically analyses the law providing for employers {{to rely on}} their operational requirements {{as a basis for}} fair dismissal, and the legal principles on selecting employees for <b>dismissal</b> based <b>on</b> operational requirements. As part of this analysis, the approach in South Africa is compared with the approach in Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia. The analysis is based on a critical literature study that includes a consideration of the relevant legislation, treaties, conventions, directives, case law, recommendations, textbooks, journal articles and statistical sources. This dissertation draws broad conclusions regarding the contents, effects and shortcomings of the aspects of South African law <b>on</b> <b>dismissal</b> based <b>on</b> operational requirements that fall within its scope. In broad terms, this dissertation finds that the conceptual model underpinning the South African regime <b>on</b> <b>dismissal</b> based <b>on</b> operational requirements, is intrinsically sound, but that certain aspects require reform. It finds further that South Africa’s law <b>on</b> <b>dismissal</b> based <b>on</b> operational requirements generally provides employees with a relatively high degree of employment security, and severely limits managerial prerogative. This dissertation concludes that the primary areas requiring reform relate to the test for substantive fairness that does not include a proportionality analysis to weigh up the competing interests of the employer and the employee(s), and the requirements regarding selection criteria that fail to include consideration of the impact of <b>dismissal</b> <b>on</b> individual employees and their dependents. This dissertation makes proposals for reform in these areas...|$|R
