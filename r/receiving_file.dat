5000|$|The TOC2 {{protocol}} is {{an updated}} version of the TOC protocol, or [...] "Talk to OSCAR" [...] protocol. Its existence was never documented by AOL and it is only used in a few AOL Instant Messenger clients. Some clients are beginning to offer plugins for TOC2 in light of AOL's recent shutdown of their TOC servers. Like its predecessor, TOC2 is an ASCII protocol and lacks some features of OSCAR, but unlike TOC, TOC2 is known to support buddy icons and <b>receiving</b> <b>file</b> transfers (not sending). TOC2 operates in essentially the same way as TOC, as a wrapper for OSCAR. Porting code from TOC to TOC2 is remarkably easy as well.|$|E
25|$|Octet {{allows for}} the {{transfer}} of arbitrary raw 8-bit bytes, with the <b>received</b> <b>file</b> resulting byte-per-byte {{identical to the one}} sent. More correctly, if a host <b>receives</b> an octet <b>file</b> and then returns it, the returned file must be identical to the original.|$|R

5000|$|Instead of communicating, {{the teacher}} issues communiques and makes {{deposits}} {{which the students}} patiently receive, memorize, and repeat. This is the [...] "banking" [...] concept of education, in which the scope of action allowed to students extends {{only as far as}} <b>receiving,</b> <b>filing,</b> and storing the deposits.|$|R
5000|$|Pando was an {{application}} which was mainly aimed at sending (and <b>receiving)</b> <b>files</b> which {{would normally be}} too large to send via more [...] "conventional" [...] means. It used both peer-to-peer (BitTorrent protocol) and client-server architectures and was released for Windows and Mac OS X operating systems.|$|R

50|$|To send or <b>receive</b> <b>files,</b> {{a person}} uses a BitTorrent client on their Internet-connected {{computer}}. A BitTorrent client {{is a computer}} program that implements the BitTorrent protocol. Popular clients include μTorrent, Xunlei, Transmission, qBittorrent, Vuze, Deluge, BitComet and Tixati. BitTorrent trackers provide a list of files available for transfer, and allow the client to find peer users known as seeds who may transfer the files.|$|R

50|$|The widely adopted ZMODEM used {{a sliding}} window protocol. Rather than wait for {{positive}} acknowledgment after each block is sent, it sent blocks {{in rapid succession}} and resent unacknowledged blocks later. By avoiding delays due to latency, the bandwidth usable for transmission more closely approached the bandwidth of the underlying link. ZMODEM could also resume interrupted transfers without retransmitting the already-received blocks. In addition to developing the protocol, Forsberg developed software for sending and <b>receiving</b> <b>files</b> using ZMODEM.|$|R
50|$|Psi {{supports}} file transfers between other XMPP clients, and it {{is possible}} to send to or <b>receive</b> <b>files</b> from other IM networks, if the user's servers support this. Psi supports Contact Is Typing Notification (which works with Yahoo!, MSN, and AIM contacts). Version 0.10, released in January 2006, brought automatically resizing contact list and composing window in chat dialogs, tabbed chats, support for Growl messaging system on Mac OS X, window transparency and many other changes.|$|R

5000|$|Access Matrix came bundled with MBASIC, CBASIC, the Perfect-series office software, Personal Pearl {{database}} and Fancy Font markup/formatting system. Custom-written software included a disk format/verify/duplication utility (DISKU.COM) that worked {{with both the}} internal A:/B: drives as well as optional external 8" [...] disks (C:/D: and E:/F:). A custom-written Telecommunications utility (TELCOMU.COM) offered dialup address book, basic terminal emulation, XMODEM/Modem7 file transfer and other features for connection to BBS and other online systems or to operate as a drone to <b>receive</b> <b>files</b> uploaded from other computers.|$|R
30|$|Using names is {{important}} because it permits programs to operate on arbitrary networks of channels and not just on linear pipelines. For example, the Clive diffs tool accepts names for streams to be compared for differences. It concurrently <b>receives</b> <b>file</b> trees (one per input channel) and computes and prints file differences. Differences are reported through the output channel and may be further processed by other programs. Unlike in the standard UNIX implementation, {{there is no need to}} issue one or more RPCs per file being compared to the file provider (they are streamed).|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{radio for}} {{vehicles}} is normally {{hampered by the}} problem of the shadowing of the line-of-sight between satellite and receiver. In this paper, the results for a personalized radio concept are show, which is an alternative to the streaming approach used for traditional radio: instead of transmitting a number of distinct continuous streams, individual audio and multimedia files are broadcast. The <b>received</b> <b>files</b> are stored in a large cache located in the receiver of each mobile terminal. There, the files are sequentially played from the cache to generate a service similar to traditional radio/entertainment programmes...|$|R

Huck tries to talk to his wife Kim about them, but she manages to {{convince}} Huck to testify. After Huck's testimony, David begins investigating the case. Jake tries his best to stop David, only for David to continue pursuing the investigation, getting help from other B613 agents. David ultimately finds out that his assistant is a B613 agent who has killed other agents as Jake manages to shoot her.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} the user {{interact}} with the spacecraft as if the spacecraft were a file server, so that the user can select and <b>receive</b> data as <b>files</b> in standard formats (e. g., tables or images, such as jpeg) via the Internet. Internet technology will be used end-to-end from the spacecraft to authorized users, such as the flight operation team, and project scientists. The proposed solution includes a ground system and spacecraft architecture, mission operations scenarios, and an implementation roadmap showing migration from current practice to the future, where distributed users request and <b>receive</b> <b>files</b> of spacecraft data from archives or spacecraft with equal ease. This solution will provide ground support personnel and scientists easy, direct, secure access to their authorized data without cumbersome processing, and can be extended to support autonomous communications with the spacecraft...|$|R

Company claims that encrypted messages are deleted from servers {{as soon as}} they have been delivered to recipient. Lifetime of encrypted data (pictures, voice messages, files) is defined by message self-destruction timer value which has a maximum of 14 days, however the chat participant may choose to manually purge messages. On mobile devices all messages, <b>received</b> <b>files</b> and metadata are encrypted before saving them to internal storage, where application passcode is used as a key to symmetric encryption.|$|R

40|$|We analyse numerically {{manifestations of}} the {{radiative}} amplitude zero (RAZ) effect in single leptoquark production associated with hard photon emission. We present some quantitative conclusions on the possibility to distinguish leptoquark charges produced in ep collisions taking account of three-body final state subprocesses and of proton structure functions. Applying this method to HERA and possible LEP+LHC experiments we show that the RAZ analysis {{can serve as a}} tool to determine the leptoquark electric charge up to large leptoquark masses.

30|$|The Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a {{short message}} that validates the message and {{provides}} integrity and authenticity to the message. In our scheme, we apply the message authentication code to realize {{the integrity of the}} cloud medical data. It is easy to construct a hash function; by entering a user’s private key and an arbitrary length of the file, you can get a MAC. A hash is obtained by the downloader based on its own private key and the <b>received</b> <b>file,</b> and if the hash is equal to the MAC of the file, the integrity and authenticity of the file is guaranteed. Otherwise, it indicates that the file has been modified.|$|R
50|$|These two new ioctls {{were later}} reused {{as a way}} to fix the {{inherent}} unsafety of GEM buffer sharing. Unlike GEM names, file descriptors can not be guessed (they are not a global namespace) and Unix operating systems provide a safe way to pass them through an Unix domain socket using the SCM_RIGHTS semantics. A process that want to share a GEM object with another process can convert its local GEM handle to a DMA-BUF file descriptor and pass it to the recipient, which in turn can get its own GEM handle from the <b>received</b> <b>file</b> descriptor. This method is used by DRI3 to share buffers between the client and the X Server, and also by Wayland.|$|R
