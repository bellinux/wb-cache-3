50|$|Between {{the end of}} the '80s and the {{beginning}} of the '90s, INR was suddenly <b>revolutioned</b> after the work of two italian physicians: Cesare Gianturco and Guido Guglielmi. The first combined a ∂eep knowledge of diagnostic radiology with a great ability to solve technical and manual problems. He invented Gianturco's coils, which he used to make the first attempts to embolize arteries and aneurysms. Gianturco also patented the first endovascular stent approved by the American FDA; a device with a great legacy. In the second half of the 1980s, Hilal was the first in Columbia University to use coils to treat brain aneurysms; but this technique was inaccurate and dangerous because the coils were released with little control with great risk of occluding the vessel from which the aneurysm originated. The coil embolization was revolutionized by the work of Guido Guglielmi in UCLA, who realized that electricity could function as a controlled release mechanism for coils; in 1991 he published two works dealing with the embolization of brain aneurysms by means of detachable platinum coils (Guglielmi's coils). The treatment of aneurysms was thus made more accessible and safe.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of mini-implants has <b>revolutioned</b> {{biomechanics}} in orthodontics {{with better}} results {{as far as}} anchorage is concerned. We have no limits when using these attachments depending only on our imagination. Anterior deep bites in severe class II malocclusion patients are a common problem that causes orthodontists to focus therapy in biomechanics to eliminate the problem by extrusion of posterior teeth or intrusion of the anterior. In this case, we decided to correct the anterior deep bite by intruding the incisors using as anchorage two mini-implants. The case was compromised by periodontal disease with moderated loss of alveolar bone {{so we had to}} choose biomechanics with a stable anchorage to achieve our goals. In the end, the patient exhibited collateral effects that were solved successfully and the deep bite was eliminated with great results and stable periodontal health...|$|E
40|$|This is Chapter 24 in the "AutoMathA" handbook. Finite automata {{have been}} used {{effectively}} {{in recent years to}} define infinite groups. The two main lines of research have as their most representative objects the class of automatic groups (including word-hyperbolic groups as a particular case) and automata groups (singled out among the more general self-similar groups). The first approach implements in the language of automata some tight constraints on the geometry of the group's Cayley graph, building strange, beautiful bridges between far-off domains. Automata are used to define a normal form for group elements, and to monitor the fundamental group operations. The second approach features groups acting in a finitely constrained manner on a regular rooted tree. Automata define sequential permutations of the tree, and represent the group elements themselves. The choice of particular classes of automata has often provided groups with exotic behaviour which have <b>revolutioned</b> our perception of infinite finitely generated groups.

The need for the human intelligence process still remains. Computers have <b>revolutioned</b> the science of meteorology, but many forecasting tasks still require a large amount of human interpretation and interaction. The forecaster needs to have rapid access to information in order to verify, review, modify, and interpret the computer results. Currently the forecasters review the various data types separately. The system under development will synthesize and display to the forecaster satellite imagery, graphical overlays of the meteorological fields, and alphanumeric reports in a timely manner. A local network will place the forecaster directly on an electronic network which spans the world. Additional tools are provided to the forecaster, such as animation and pseudo-color, to enhance the human recognition processes. Multiple level zooms are utilized to span the range from global to mesoscale phenomena. The forecaster then draws in the human interpreted details.

40|$|Asthma is a {{heterogeneous}} disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation {{that results in}} {{a wide spectrum of}} clinical manifestations. Patients with severe asthma represent a substantial share of consumption of healthcare resources and hospitalization. Moreover, these patients are at risk of increased morbidity and mortality. Recently, several phenotypes and endotypes of asthma have been identified. The identification of specific subtypes of asthma is fundamental for optimizing the clinical benefit of novel treatments. Although in most patients the disease can be controlled by some combination of pharmacologic agents, in some 5 - 10 % of patients the disease remains uncontrolled. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting pathogenetic molecules (e. g., IgE, IL- 5, IL- 5 Ra, IL- 4, IL- 13, TSLP) are currently available or under development for the treatment of different forms of severe type 2 asthma.

40|$|The {{genesis of}} the {{creative}} process in Art is currently conceived as the intellectual selection by the artist of fragments of memory from her/his personal, cultural and emotional experience. Interpretation of the artistic object has been systematically developed from an external perspective of art history, literature, and fine arts or of medicine and psychology. Recent neurological findings on the molecular nature of memory have <b>revolutioned</b> {{the knowledge of the}} mental process of memorization, remembrance and creative synthesis. A movement of scientists defends the necessity of new tools to access mental processes, inherently subjective, such as artistic creativity. In the light of those evidences, we propose a new approach to the artwork starting from a first-person analysis, namely introspection, which offers an interpretation of the {{genesis of the}} artwork from his/her own memory. The scientific, philosophical and social background on the neuropsychological processes guiding the creative activity is reviewed. Our purpose is to integrate the previous approaches from a wide multidisciplinary perspective, and to pose a new reflection on how the autobiographical and intertextual data from the artist are modeled in a dynamic way in the complex net of mental interactions up to reach the creation of an artwork, which highlights an original new vision on the reading of art. This insight from first-person analysis might complement and enrich other analyses external to the artist. </em...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, in fulfillment {{of the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy in Science Johannesburg, 2012 Platinum is nowadays one of the best and widely used antitumor agents in cancer chemotherapy. The numerous performances reported by many previous researchers for this metal in the fight against several malignancies led to the synthesis of many platinum complexes. However, the clinical responses related to these complexes {{led to the development of}} non-platinum compounds with metal ions which exhibit antitumor activity. Ferrocene is one of them, owing the high consideration inter alia to its environmental oxidore-ductive behavior. Methotrexate is another clinically used anticancer drug worthy to be mentioned. With a structure very close to that of folic acid, differing from it by an amine function and a methyl group, respectively, instead of an hydrogen and an hydroxyl group on the folate, methotrexate has been considered as an antagonist of folic acid by its mechanism of action in the biological environment. It has, together with platinum and non-platinum complexes, shown notorious side-effects by fighting both normal and abnormal cells despite their antineoplastic potency. This is the reason why a drug delivery system is considered as a tool to improve metal complexes and other drugs selectivity for cancer cells. The strategy of enhancing the potency of non-polymeric chemically, physically, or biologically active compounds through the expediency of binding such compounds to a polymeric carrier has <b>revolutioned</b> numerous technologies. In the present thesis is demonstrated the synthesis of several water-soluble macromolecular drug carriers intended for biomedical applications, and the anchoring of platinum to ferrocene-containing antineoplastic agents on one side, then to methotrexate-containing antineoplastic agents on the other side, resulting in a co-conjugate or a conjugate bearing two different drugs on a single carrier. This multidrug anchoring offers the advantage to exploit the potency of two different drugs on a single polymeric structure, each drug having its own pharmacokinetic path. Platinum is the common drug, while ferrocene and methotrexate are the various co-drugs. This order of having the platinum imparted to the polymeric carrier after the two drugs above mentioned were adopted in obedience to the strategy of having the most synthetically demanding drug incorporated in the carrier before the least one. Anchoring of the three drugs to polymeric structures was achieved in aqueous environment. Methotrexate (MTX) and ferrocene (Fc) binding were achieved via HBTU as coupling agent. In all cases, more or less, but very close to, 100...|$|E
