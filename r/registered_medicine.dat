50|$|Umbellulone is a {{monoterpene}} ketone that {{is found}} in the leaves of the Umbellularia californica. The formula of umbellulone is C10H14O, containing a cyclopropane and cyclopentane ring. There is only one isomer of umbellulone known. Umbellulone is a lipophilic, it's a liquid (oil) at room temperature. The boiling point of umbellulone is 220 °C and the vapor pressure is 0.159 mm/Hg. Due to this extremely low vapor pressure, umbellulone fumes are easily created. This makes the substance easily inhaled. Umbellulone has a high-affinity binding for thiols. The molecule is reactive with most of the thiols, but not with all. The reaction between the thiol cysteamine and umbellulone, is given in figure 3. A European <b>registered</b> <b>medicine</b> called Cystagon® or Procysbi® contains cysteamine, which can interact with umbellulone.|$|E

An unregistered or unlicensed medicine in South Africa is one that has not been assessed or approved by the Medicines Control Council (MCC). Off-label prescribing is relatively common in children, and many anti-asthmatic drugs are used off-label, particularly in young children. Off-label prescribing is not illegal and is not necessarily wrong. It is a refection of inadequate paediatric clinical trials. The main problems with off-label prescribing are the higher rate of adverse events and ethical issues such as benefit/ harm risks and the need for informed consent. The MCC should facilitate the registration of drugs for paediatric use, and should both enforce and encourage drug trials for medicines for children. Articl...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The State of Victoria in Australia {{introduced}} Chinese medicine practitioner registration in 2000 {{and issued}} its education guidelines in late 2002 for introduction in 2005. This study obtained practitioners' views on desired capabilities for competent Chinese medicine practice {{and to identify}} professional development needs. Methods A questionnaire, consisting of 28 predefined capabilities in four categories with a rating scale of importance from one to five, was developed and sent to all <b>registered</b> Chinese <b>medicine</b> practitioners in the State of Victoria, Australia in October, 2005. Results Two hundreds and twenty eight completed questionnaires were returned which represented {{a response rate of}} 32. 5 %. Of the four categories of capabilities, technical capabilities were considered {{to be the most important}} for clinical practice. Specifically, the ability to perform acupuncture treatment and/or dispense an herbal prescription was ranked the highest. In contrast, research and information management capabilities were considered the least important. The educational background of practitioners appeared to be an important factor influencing their rating of capabilities. Significantly, nearly double the number of practitioners with Australian qualifications than practitioners trained overseas valued communication as an important capability. For continuing professional education, clinical skills courses were considered as a priority while research degree studies were not. Conclusion <b>Registered</b> Chinese <b>medicine</b> practitioners viewed skills training as important but did not support the need for research and information management training.

40|$|Abstract A recent World Health Organisation study {{conducted}} in 26 countries found substantial disagreement in the prescribing information available in those countries, {{as well as}} significant disparity between brands within the same country. This {{appears to be a}} common experience in other countries. This may mislead prescribers, patients and those comparing drug-use patterns across countries, and have serious safety implications. This study was carried out to investigate the variability of prescribing information currently available within South Africa, comparing generic and originator brands. It also investigated the extent of variability between the Standardised Package Insert (SPI) mandated by the Medicines Control Council, versus internationally approved prescribing information for given drug substances. Five drug substances were selected that are widely used in South Africa. The package inserts of the originator product were compared in terms of the indications, dosage, cautions, side-effects and drug interactions versus five generic brands of each drug substance registered in South Africa, using a comprehensive method adapted from the WHO study. The SPI was also compared against the South African originator brand package insert and those approved in four international MCC Reference Countries (ie. USA, EU, Canada & Australia) for each drug substance. Substantial disagreement was found between the originator and generic products for each drug substance, which may be due, in part, to the absence of a mandatory periodic updating requirement for package inserts in the post-registration phase in South Africa. This may result in divergence between materials from companies that voluntarily submit safety updates {{over the life of the}} product, and those that do not. There was also substantial disagreement between the SPI and the originator and international reference country materials. The reason is less simple to explain. The SPI project is in its early stages, and requires validation to ensure that the texts are in fact, entirely in line with latest best clinical practice and with the reference countries with which MCC aligns itself. These findings are comparable with those found in international WHO study. Regulatory authorities have key responsibility in ensuring that prescribing information is current and consistent across originator, generic and international materials. It is recommended that the MCC implement a mandatory updating requirement for all <b>registered</b> <b>medicines</b> with specified timelines. Secondly, a validation step should be introduced in the MCC SPI project to ensure consistency with international materials. Additional recommendations are made to improve the quality and practicality of prescribing information to ensure that it remains relevant in the South African and regional context. vThese findings are comparable with those found in international WHO study.

40|$|BackgroundDuring the {{transition}} processes, the Western Balkan countries {{were affected by}} conflicts and transition-related changes. Life expectancy in these countries is lower, while the mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is higher in comparison with western and northern parts of Europe. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the treatment possibilities for the most common NCDs in the Western Balkan countries. The secondary aim was to understand and compare the policies regarding prescribing-related competencies of family physicians. MethodsIn June and July 2017, a document analysis was performed of national positive medicines lists, strategic documents, and clinical guidelines for the treatment of the most frequent NCDs; arterial hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). All text phrases that referred to medicines prescribing were extracted and sorted into following domains: medicine availability, prescribing policy, and medication prescribing-related competencies. ResultsPossibilities for treatment of arterial hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and COPD vary across the Western Balkan countries. This variance is reflected in the number of <b>registered</b> <b>medicines,</b> number of parallels, and number of different combinations, as well as restrictions placed on family physicians in prescribing insulin, inhaled corticosteroids, statins and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), without consultant’s recommendation. ConclusionWestern Balkan countries are capable of providing essential medicines for the treatment of NCDs, with full or partial reimbursement. There are some exceptions, related to statins, newer generation of oral antidiabetic agents and some of the antihypertensive combinations.

40|$|Abstract: Nutritional {{supplements}} {{refer to}} any supplementary product ingested {{to increase the}} nutritional content of a normal diet to either fill a need or presumed deficiency. The Medicines Control Council (MCC) of South Africa is a statutory body that regulates the performance of clinical trials and registration of medicines. The MCC is responsible for ensuring that all clinical trials of both non-registered medicines and new indications of <b>registered</b> <b>medicines</b> comply with the necessary requirements for safety, quality and efficiency. However, there is currently no regulatory framework enforced by the MCC with regards to supplements in South Africa. A great health concern thus arises with the popularity and the usage of nutritional supplements. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine if gymnasium users in Johannesburg North use nutritional supplements and also to ascertain the attitudes of gymnasium users towards nutritional supplements. The study determines where gymnasium users obtain their information and education regarding supplements. In addition, the researcher gathered information regarding the average monthly expenditure on supplements by Johannesburg’s gymnasium users. A theory of attitudes, namely the functionalist theory by the psychologist Daniel Katz, views that attitudes are determined by the functions they serve for us. People grasp on to given attitudes because these attitudes help them attain their basic goals and needs. This theory was used as a guideline to determine that attitude plays a role in the use of nutritional supplements. The study design is a cross-sectional quantitative study using a self-administered questionnaire (Annexure X). The sample consisted of 364 (205 male and 159 female) gymnasium participants aged between 19 and 49 years old. The participants attended gymnasiums two or more times a week at any of the five selected gymnasiums within the Johannesburg North region. Noticeable findings amongst the demographics of the gymnasium users include the growth of African (Black) gymnasium users in public gymnasiums. Further findings show that gymnasium users are aware of the increase in nutritional supplement use in public gymnasiums. The majority of gymnasium users make use of nutritional supplements [...] . M.
