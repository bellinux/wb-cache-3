5|$|Since the 1990s, the {{official}} State Flag of Georgia {{had been a}} center of controversy as it incorporated the historic Confederate flag dating to the American Civil War, which among some people is thought to symbolize resistance to cultural changes in the state. After 2001 changes to the flag which removed this, Governor of Georgia <b>Roy</b> <b>Barnes,</b> who had led the flag-redesign effort, was defeated for re-election; many {{thought it was the}} result of the political backlash. The 1956 version with the Confederate States of America battle emblem, known as a St.Andrew's cross, was a continuing topic of debate for southern heritage proponents. Reed served as one of Governor Sonny Perdue's floor leaders in debates that led to the ratification of the current (2003) version of the state flag.|$|E
5|$|Over Georgia, {{the storm}} dropped heavy {{rainfall}} of 10inches (255mm) in 24hours in various locations. The deluge caused rivers to crest past their banks, including the Oconee River at Milledgeville which peaked at 33.7feet (10.3m). The rainfall, which was heaviest across the southwestern {{portion of the}} state, washed out several bridges and roads, and flooded many other roads. Georgia governor <b>Roy</b> <b>Barnes</b> {{declared a state of}} emergency for seven counties in the state. The storm also spawned two tornadoes. In South Carolina, Allison's outer bands produced 10tornadoes and several funnel clouds, though most only caused minor damage limited to a damaged courthouse, snapped trees and downed power lines. Allison produced from 12 to 16inches (305 to 406mm) of rainfall in North Carolina, closing nearly all roads in Martin County and damaging 25homes. The severe flooding washed out a bridge in eastern Halifax County and flooded numerous cars. Wet roads caused nine traffic accidents throughout the state.|$|E
