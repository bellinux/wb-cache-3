50|$|The {{majority}} of scanners' energy is {{delivered to the}} skin and the underlying tissue. Thus, while the dose would be safe if it were distributed throughout {{the volume of the}} entire body, the dose to the skin may be dangerously high.The X-ray dose from these devices has often been compared in the media to the cosmic ray exposure inherent to airplane travel or that of a chest X-ray. However, this comparison is very misleading: both the air travel cosmic ray exposure and chest X- rays have much higher X-ray energies and the health consequences are appropriately understood in terms of the whole body volume dose. In contrast, these new airport scanners are largely depositing their energy into the skin and immediately adjacent tissue, and since this is such a small fraction of body weight/vol, possibly by one to two orders of magnitude, the real dose to the skin is now high.In addition, it appears that real independent safety data do not exist. A search, ultimately finding top FDA radiation physics staff, suggests that the relevant <b>radiation</b> <b>quantity,</b> the Flux per unit area and time (because this is a scanning device) has not been characterized. Instead an indirect test (Air Kerma) was made that emphasized the whole body exposure value, and thus it appears that the danger is low when compared to cosmic rays during airplane travel and a chest X-ray dose.|$|E

40|$|For {{prevention}} of radiation injuries {{it is important}} that the operator is constantly and accurately aware of the radiation dose to which he is exposed. In order to measure the radiation dose he is receiving it is most advantageous for the operator to carry the measuring instrument on himself.

From the nature of its mechanism for radiation test its wavelength dependence is unavoidable, as we have already reported in the previous paper. In the present report we havew discussed the wavelength dependence of film emulsion and described a part of the experiments performed. In blackening of the photographic emulsion of film the action of secondary electorons such as Compton electron, photoelectron, classical scattering (Thomson sattering) augment that of the incident ray. The yield of secondary electrons depends moreover on hardness of the incident radiation, thus, the optical density dose not correspond with the roentgen unit which is based on the energy absorption by the air even the hardness of radiation quality and optical density vary on the linear part of sensitivity of the film.

GCR are modulated by solar activity, at the period of solar minimum activity, GCR intensity is at maximum and the main contributor for space radiation is GCR. At present for space radiation measurements conducted by JSC (Johnson Space Center) SRAG (Space Radiation Analysis Group), the preferred active dosimeter sensitive to all LET (Linear Energy Transfer) is the tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC); the preferred passive dosimeters are thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) and optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) sensitive to low LET as well as CR- 39 plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) sensitive to high LET.

Through the infrared radiation measurement of specific dynamic objects in two-dimensional space, it is found that the dynamic calibration model based on this measurement method has higher measurement precision.|$|E

At present the best passive personal dosimeters used for astronauts are thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) and optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) for low LET and CR- 39 plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) for high LET.

The assessment process is prospective and subjective. Changing and complex construction situations impede their practical and efficient application. To assess safety risk {{with regard to}} changing site conditions in an objective and efficient way, this study proposes a quantitative model for hazard exposure assessment based on real-time location data of construction workforce and equipment, collected by a location-based proximity warning system. In contrast with traditional {{risk assessment}} methods, the model proposed in this study combines accident probability and hazard exposure duration into a single quantitative concept—hazard exposure amount.

A fundamental property of remotely sensed data is its resolution. Aggarwal (2003) defined resolution as the capability of the system to provide information with the smallest discretely separable amount in terms of distance (spatial), wavelength band of electromagnetic radiation (spectral), time (temporal) and/or <b>radiation</b> <b>quantity</b> (radiometric). Remotely sensed data {{can be applied to}} estimate biophysical and phenological characteristics of vegetation at multiple spatio-temporal scales and extents (Coops et al. 2012; Jensen 1983; Kerr and Ostrovsky 2003; Washington-Allen et al. 2006). The spatial resolution of remotely sensed imagery varies from less than a metre to 1  km or more. Regional rangeland assessments typically use coarse spatial resolution imagery, for example, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, with a daytime visit cycle of one to two days, ≥[*] 250  m spatial resolution and 36 spectral bands. With more than a 15 -year history, MODIS data has enabled a global land coverage, and one that is available as a free resource for both land managers and academic researchers (Reeves et al. 2015). In addition, the NOAA Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) has provided global data since 1978. The capability of AVHRR information for monitoring rangeland has been demonstrated in many investigations (e.g. Tucker and Sellers 1986; Prince and Tucker 1986). The 1 km 2 resolution of the AVHRR is ideal for continental-scale monitoring with a one-day global daytime repeat cycle providing data valuable for assessing regions that are sensitive to inter-yearly atmosphere changes (Svoray et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|Background: During {{the last}} 20 years both in vitro and {{in vivo models}} have been {{developed}} for studies of the cell killing characteristics of low energy electrons, e. g. Auger electrons. This thesis deals with radiobiological effects of radiation from indium isotopes in V 79 cells in vitro (Paper I-III) and the rat testis in vivo (Paper IVV). The focus has mainly been on studies of the accuracy and limitations of the radiation dosimetry in both models. Material and Methods: Thermo luminescent dosimetry (TLD) was used for measurement of the absorbed dose to cells exposed to photon induced Auger electrons or X-ray photons at ultrahigh dose rates. A rat testis model was developed and intratesticularly exposed to 110 In, 111 In and X-ray photons. The biokinetics and dosimetry were carefully evaluated by use of a scintillation camera, HPGe semiconductor detector and TL Dosimetry. Results: In none of the in vitro experiments could an enhanced biological effect attributed to Auger electrons be proved. It was concluded early in the work that the dosimetry was a matter of decisive importance for assessment of radiobiological results and that every single irradiation occasion needs to be scrutinized. Although the rat testis model was demonstrated to be an appropriate model for radiobiological studies in vivo, {{there was no difference in}} the sperm count survival when exposed to the Auger emitting radionuclide 111 In compared to 110 In and X-ray photons. Discussion and Conclusion: Radiobiology must rely on a <b>radiation</b> <b>quantity</b> such as absorbed dose to compare the effects between different experiments and laboratories. This investigation has shown the complexity of determining the absorbed dose in radiobiological experiments. The accuracy depends on several factors, especially the experimental setup and the accurate calibrations of the TLDs.
