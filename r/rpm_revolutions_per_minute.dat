A prototype single cell rotary water electrolyser was constructed, {{and a number}} of design challenges with regard to the practical application were addressed. The rotary electrolyser was tested over a range of current density, centrifugal acceleration, electrolyte concentration, temperature, and electrode geometry. The test results showed that at normal cell operating conditions (7. 7 M KOH solution, 348 K) much of the cell voltage benefits were achieved at an acceleration of about 16 g (g= 9. 81 ms- 2), equivalent to a rotational speed of 500 <b>rpm</b> (<b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> for the rotary cell. The rotary electrolyser cell voltage was about 0. 25 - 0. 5 V, less than the equivalent static cell under similar operating conditions, depending on the current density. The cell voltages achieved, without an effective electrode catalytic coating, were comparable with typical industrial values of fully developed pressurised cells. At a higher acceleration of 41 g, the rotary cell's current density can be up to 13. 5 kAm- 2 without causing gas bubble blinding of the membranes and electrodes.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} are to investigate the fully wetted and cavitating performance of a self-adaptive composite propeller and its dependence on the propeller rotational frequency (<b>RPM</b> or <b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> {{in addition to the}} advance coefficient and ambient pressure. Self-adaptive composite propellers are designed {{to take advantage of the}} intrinsic deformation coupling behavior of anisotropic composites to improve propeller performance via automatic, passive blade pitch adjustment in spatially or temporally varying flow. The design methodology, numerical and experimental studies of selfadaptive composite propellers in fully wetted flow can be found in [1 - 7]. In past studies, the primary focus was the fully wetted performance of the composite propellers operating at the design RPM. However, since the deformations of adaptive composite propellers depend on the hydrodynamic load, which in turn depends on the propeller RPM, the response of adaptive composite propellers depend on both the advance coefficient and RPM. Moreover, at high RPMs, composite propellers may be subject to resonant vibration failure due to the inherent flexibility needed to achieve the desired self-adaptive behavior, and due to the decrease in natural frequency caused by added mass effects. Hence, it is important to evaluate the ratedependent behavior of self-adaptive composite propellers. It is also important to evaluate the cavitating performance of self-adaptive composite propellers since cavitation can lead to thrust breakdown, decrease in efficiency, as well as erosion and localized impact damage to the composite blades. In this work, a previously validated coupled boundary element method finite element method (BEMFEM) is used to analyze the rate-dependent response of self-adaptive composite propellers in fully wetted and cavitating flows. Implications of the rate-dependent behavior on the design and interpretation of experimental studies, particularly cavitation tunnel studies, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{investigate}} the application of motor control system that suit to the new movement mechanism of driver car seat. The objective of this project is to design control circuit and integrate electric and electronic devices to the mechanism of the anti theft car seat. This Project involved of Infrared Transmitter circuit and Infrared Receiver circuit of 12 volts DC Motor. The motor will rotate bidirectional due the command of code that has been installing in the microcontroller. The coding inside the microcontroller has been programmed by using the Visual Basic software. PICAXE 14 M microcontroller has been selected for the control circuit because it is very appropriate with this control circuit system and PICAXE 14 M also good for the motor controller. 12 volt of DC motor is connected to control a new mechanism of seat movement which is rack and pinion gearing system and Internal gearing system. The rack and pinion gearing system is the system for the movement forward and backward of the car seat whiles the internal gearing system for bend the backrest of the seat down and up. Both of this mechanism involved of same types of gearing profiles. The types of gear used in this mechanism are the spur gear. A pair of spur gear is mesh together. One essential for correct meshing of the gears is {{that the size of}} the teeth on the pinion {{is the same as the}} size of teeth on the wheel. The pinion is the smallest gear and the larger gear is called the gear wheel. The 10 teeth of the smaller pinion and the 20 teeth of the wheel lay to the parallel axes. The module types used in this gearing system are 1 module. Module is the unit of size that indicates how big or small gear is. It is the ratio of the reference diameter of the gear divided by the number of teeth. The 20 teeth of gear wheel are coupled together with the 40 teeth of gear as the output gear. The purpose used the 40 teeth of output gear because of the gear reduction. The output speed of a DC motor is usually too fast for normal used. Most DC motors at normal operating voltages spin at high <b>RPM</b> or <b>revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> so it is really necessary to reduce the rate at the wheel spins to suit the normal movement of seat. The gear reduction also can increase the torque of the motor to the output gear. This output gear is attached and mesh together with a rack and the internal gear. A rack is a rectangular prism with gear teeth machined along one side. The internal gear is hollow. The profile and teeth shape is similar as of external gear except that the internal gear had different addendum and dedendum values modified to prevent interference meshes. They are used in planetary gears to produce large reduction ratios. The gear ratio is the relationship between the numbers of teeth on two gears that are meshed. In this project all the gear ratio is 1 : 2. The simulation of the gearing system done by using the SolidWorks software. Solidworks is a 3 D mechanical CAD or computer aided design program that runs on Microsoft window.

Swabs are used to collect infectious body fluids, where the concentration of pathogens can range from 1 × 104 CFU/mL (colony forming units/mL) in respiratory-tract infections and 1 × 105 in urinary-tract infections, to up to 1 × 109 CFU/mL in salivary samples. These samples are then eluted and lysed, prior to DNA (De-oxy Ribonucleic Acid) analysis.

Various methods to elute samples from swab include chemical digestion of fibres (~ 20 % recovery), centrifugation (~ 58 % recovery), piezoelectric vibration, or pressurized fluid-flow (~ 60 % recovery). This study reports a magnetically-actuated physical impingement method for elution and recovery of artificial sputum samples from cotton fibres. A device has been fabricated to induce a rotating magnetic field on smaller magnetic particles in a vial that strikes the swab within a confined gap. Elution from the swab in this device was characterized using 2 % Methyl cellulose in deionised water, loaded with fluorescent-tagged polystyrene beads and E. coli at various concentrations.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} deposition of poly(3 -methylthiophene) and the electrochemical polymerization of 3 -bromothiophene {{in the presence}} of 2, 2 '-bithiophene have been studied. Mechanisms have been proposed, based on the electrochemical responses recorded during polymer formation and characterization of the resulting polymer films by cyclic voltammetry, ac impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy as well as by x-ray emission spectroscopy. [...] A rotating Pt disc electrode was applied to probe the potentiostatic deposition of poly(3 -methylthiophene). It was observed that poly(3 -methylthiophene) films could be formed on both stationary and rotating electrodes even at rotation rates as high as 1600 <b>rpm</b> (<b>revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute),</b> and that the quantity of polymer deposited decreased with increasing rotation rate. It was therefore concluded that polymer deposition takes place both through the precipitation of oligomeric intermediates from the solution, and via the coupling of monomeric species with polymer chain ends in the polymer film matrix. Chronoamperometric responses recorded during polymerization, as well as the characterization of the resulting polymer films by cyclic voltammetry, ac impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, demonstrated that the deposition of oligomeric intermediates from the solution contributes most to polymer formation on a stationary electrode. On the other hand, polymer growth on a rapidly rotating electrode occurs primarily by the incorporation of monomeric species into polymer chains grafted on the electrode surface. Much smoother, more homogeneous films were deposited on rotating electrodes. [...] The polymerization of 3 -bromothiophene {{in the presence of}} 2, 2 '-bithiophene was investigated by cyclic voltammetry.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} development of marine and hydrokinetic energy projects in rivers, estuaries, and coastal ocean waters of the United States. Hydrokinetic (HK) technologies convert the energy of moving water in river or tidal currents into electricity, without the impacts of dams and impoundments associated with conventional hydropower or the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) maintains a database that displays the geographical distribution of proposed HK projects in inland and tidal waters (FERC 2012). As of March 2012, 77 preliminary permits had been issued to private developers to study HK projects in inland waters, the development of which would total over 8, 000 MW. Most of these projects are proposed for the lower Mississippi River. In addition, the issuance of another 27 preliminary permits for HK projects in inland waters, and 3 preliminary permits for HK tidal projects (totaling over 3, 100 MW) were under consideration by FERC. Although numerous HK designs are under development (see DOE 2009 for a description of the technologies and their potential environmental effects), the most commonly proposed current-based projects entail arrays of rotating devices, much like submerged wind turbines, that are positioned in the high-velocity (high energy) river channels. The many diverse HK designs imply a diversity of environmental impacts, but a potential impact common to most is the risk for blade strike to aquatic organisms. In conventional hydropower generation, research on fish passage through reaction turbines at low-head dams suggested that strike and mortality for small fish could be low. As a consequence of the large surface area to mass ratio of small fish, the drag forces in the boundary layer flow at the surface of a rotor blade may pull small fish around the leading edge of a rotor blade without making physical contact (Turnpenny 1998, Turnpenny et al. 2000). Although there is concern that small, fragile fish early life stages may be unable to avoid being struck by the blades of hydrokinetic turbines, we found no empirical data in the published literature that document survival of earliest life-stage fish in passage by rotor blades. In addition to blade strike, research on passage of fish through conventional hydropower turbines suggested that fish mortalities from passage through the rotor swept area could also occur due to shear stresses and pressure chances in the water column (Cada et al. 1997, Turnpenny 1998). However, for most of the proposed HK turbine designs the rotors are projected to operate a lower <b>RPM</b> (<b>revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> than observed from conventional reaction turbines; the associated shear stress and pressure changes are expected to be lower and pose a smaller threat to fish survival (DOE 2009). Only a limited number of studies have been conducted to examine the risk of blade strike from hydrokinetic technologies to fish (Turnpenny et al. 1992, Normandeau et al. 2009, Seitz et al. 2011, EPRI 2011); the survival of drifting or weakly swimming fish (especially early life stages) that encounter rotor blades from hydrokinetic (HK) devices is currently unknown. Our study addressed this knowledge gap by testing how fish larvae and juveniles encountered different blade profiles of hydrokinetic devices and how such encounters influenced survivorship. We carried out a laboratory study designed to improve our understanding of how fish larvae and juvenile fish may be affected by encounters with rotor blades from HK turbines in the water column of river and ocean currents. (For convenience, these early life stages will be referred to as young of the year, YOY). The experiments developed information needed to quantify the risk (both probability and consequences) of rotor-blade strike to YOY fish. In particular, this study attempted to determine whether YOY drifting in a high-velocity flow directly {{in the path of the}} blade leading edge will make contact with the rotor blade or will bypass the blade while entrained in the boundary layer of water flowing over the blade surface. The study quantified both immediate and delayed mortalities (observed immediately, 3 hours, and 24 hours after encountering the blade) among freshwater YOY fish resulting from contact with the blade or turbulent flows in the wake of the blade...|$|E
