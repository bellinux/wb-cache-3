5|$|After the separation, Margo {{moves into}} Beale's {{apartment}} {{and they get}} married soon afterwards. In response to the marriage, Susanna impulsively marries Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgård), a bartender whom she barely knows. Maisie bonds with Lincoln, but Susanna quickly grows <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> how much Maisie warms to him.|$|E
5|$|Rivalry between Brooks and Clayton predated the 1868 election. Clayton saw Brooks as {{his strongest}} {{competitor}} for preference and distinction {{and did not}} want him to become too entrenched with the party leadership. Brooks felt that his ability and service to the party were not being recognized or appreciated, and he grew bitter and <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> the other Republicans, including Clayton.|$|E

5|$|Some players {{remained}} <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> Craig's dubious elevation {{ahead of}} Harvey during the 1957–58 tour of South Africa but appreciated {{that he had}} not promoted himself and that he was fair and open to input from teammates. On the tour, Harvey broke a finger at catching practice and missed the early tour matches. After it healed, Harvey returned for a match against a South African XI, in a virtual dress rehearsal for the Tests. He scored 173 as the tourists crushed their hosts by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for the success of their dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain on good terms afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Beebe had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} {{with some of}} his superiors at the zoo, particularly Hornaday, who was <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> Beebe's constant demands for more funding and staff, as well as the fact that as Beebe's career progressed he gradually devoted less and less time to caring for the zoo itself. One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society's Library, which would occasionally go missing for years as a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe, and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's work when others criticized it.|$|E
50|$|Another tragedy he {{experienced}} {{was that in}} addition to his brother's murder, his father murdered his mother. Mehmet Akbaş remarried after he was released from the prison. However, Müslüm Gürses remained all the time silent and <b>resentful</b> because <b>of</b> his father's doing.|$|R

5|$|Brown {{was born}} on December 28, 1933 in Lexington, Kentucky. He was the only son of the five {{children}} born to John Y. and Dorothy (Inman) Brown. His father {{was a member of}} the U.S. Congress from Kentucky and a member of the Kentucky state legislature for nearly three decades, including a term as Speaker of the House. John Sr. was named for, but not related to, the nineteenth century governor of the same name. A 1979 People magazine article recounts that the elder Brown's nine unsuccessful political races – for either governor or the U.S. Senate – took a toll on his family and left his mother <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> all the money spent on campaigns.|$|E
5|$|For the 1938 season, Constantine {{played for}} Rochdale in the Central Lancashire Cricket League, {{although}} {{he continued to}} live in Nelson. He received £812 for the season, and performed successfully, but did not enjoy the experience. The nature of the pitches was different in his new league; furthermore, {{some of the players}} seemed <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> his high earnings. There was also an incident of racial abuse which Constantine believed the Central Lancashire League committee effectively covered up. This season ended Constantine's career in the Lancashire Leagues, although during the war he returned to play for Nelson as an amateur.|$|E
5|$|His reign {{was marked}} by {{multiple}} wars with the Lombards, a Germanic people who {{had arrived in the}} former Roman province of Pannonia under the leadership of their king, Audoin. Thurisind also had to face the hostility of the Byzantine Empire, which was <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> the Gepid takeover of Sirmium and anxious to diminish Gepid power in the Pannonian Basin, a plain covering most of modern Hungary and partly including the bordering states. The Byzantines' plans to reduce the Gepids' power took effect when Audoin decisively defeated Thurisind in 551 or 552. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian forced a peace accord on both leaders so that equilibrium in the Pannonian Basin could be sustained.|$|E

5|$|On {{its return}} to England the {{expedition}} was coolly received by London's geographical establishment which was <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> the pre-emption {{of a role}} they envisaged for their own National Antarctic (Discovery) Expedition. There were also questions about Borchgrevink's leadership qualities, and criticism of the limited amounts of scientific information which the expedition provided. Despite the groundbreaking achievements in Antarctic survival and travel, Borchgrevink was never accorded the heroic status of Scott or Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers. However, Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole in 1911, acknowledged that Borchgrevink's expedition had removed the greatest obstacles to Antarctic travel, and had {{opened the way for}} all the expeditions that followed.|$|E
5|$|Sam Mendes {{directed}} a 1993 RSC production in which Simon Russell Beale's Ariel was openly <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> the control exercised by Alec McCowen's Prospero. Controversially, {{in the early}} performances of the run, Ariel spat at Prospero, once granted his freedom. An entirely different effect was achieved by George C. Wolfe in the outdoor New York Shakespeare Festival production of 1995, where the casting of Aunjanue Ellis as Ariel opposite Patrick Stewart's Prospero charged the production with erotic tensions. Productions in the late 20th-century have gradually increased the focus placed on sexual tensions between the characters, including Prospero/Miranda, Prospero/Ariel, Miranda/Caliban, Miranda/Ferdinand and Caliban/Trinculo.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{had been}} a {{fruitful}} and successful international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> British actions that were perceived as high-handed and insensitive. One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft {{had been a}}ppointed {{the head of the}} new Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Britain without any prior consultation {{and at a time when}} the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was a sure sign of waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist Bennett Lewis, who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born Walter Zinn turned the job down.|$|E

25|$|During the Hundred Days he was {{appointed}} cavalry commander in Belgium, under the still <b>resentful</b> eye <b>of</b> Wellington.

5|$|After a brief {{stay with}} the Danish consul, the family were shipped to a refugee camp {{on the island of}} Büyükada in the Dardanelles Strait near Istanbul, Turkey, where the Kulikovsky family shared three rooms with eleven other adults. After two weeks, they were {{evacuated}} to Belgrade in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Regent Alexander Karageorgevich, later to become King Alexander I, offered them a permanent home there, but Dowager Empress Marie summoned her daughter to Denmark. The Grand Duchess complied, and the family arrived in Copenhagen on Good Friday 1920. They lived with Kulikovsky's mother-in-law, Dowager Empress Marie, at first at the Amalienborg Palace and then at the royal estate of Hvidøre. Kulikovsky and Marie did not get along; he was <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> his wife acting as Marie's secretary and companion, and Marie was distant toward him.|$|E
5|$|In July 1869 Van Gogh's uncle Cent {{obtained}} a position {{for him at}} the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch at Southampton Street, and took lodgings at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more than his father. Theo's wife later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> issues such as {{the degree to which the}} firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Foshan is a hub of Southern Chinese martial arts, where various schools {{actively}} recruit disciples {{and compete}} against each other. Although the Wing Chun master Ip Man {{is the most}} skilled martial artist in Foshan, he is unassuming and keeps a low profile. As an independent wealthy man, he feels no need to accept any disciples and instead spends his days training, meeting with friends, and spending time with his family. However, his wife is often <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> the time he spends training and discussing martial arts with friends and colleagues. Though not a professional martial artist, Ip is respected in Foshan due to the abilities he displays in friendly, closed-door competitions with local masters. Ip's reputation is further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive, rude, highly skilled Northern Chinese martial arts master, Jin Shanzhao, thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan.|$|E

5|$|At {{least in}} part <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> the French king's {{previous}} support of his Lancastrian opponents, and possibly {{in support of his}} brother-in-law Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, Edward went to parliament in October 1472 for funding a military campaign, and eventually landed in Calais on 4 July 1475. Richard's was the largest private contingent of his army. Although well known to have publicly been against the eventual treaty signed with Louis XI at Picquigny (and absent from the negotiations, in which one of his rank would have been expected to take a leading role), he acted as Edward's witness when the king instructed his delegates to the French court, and received 'some very fine presents' from Louis on a visit to the French king at Amiens. In refusing other gifts, which included 'pensions' in the guise of 'tribute', he was joined only by Cardinal Bourchier. He supposedly disapproved of Edward's policy of personally benefitting—politically and financially—from a campaign paid for out of a parliamentary grant, and hence out of public funds. Any military prowess was therefore not to be revealed further until the last years of Edward's reign.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch East India Company {{had founded}} the Cape Colony on the {{southern}} tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the East Indies. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large Afrikaner (or Boer) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands during the Flanders Campaign. British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the Great Trek of the late 1830s and early 1840s. In the process the Voortrekkers clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and to the various native African polities, including those of the Sotho and the Zulu nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic (1852–77; 1881–1902) and the Orange Free State (1854–1902). In 1902 Britain occupied both republics, concluding a treaty with the two Boer Republics following the Second Boer War (1899–1902).|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Rova of Antananarivo occurred {{at a time when}} the complex was in the final stages of the process to become classified as Madagascar's first cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Six people were initially charged in connection with the Rova's destruction in an Antananarivo court of law, but the official investigation concluded that the fire was an accident. Public accusations of a cover-up placed the blame for the fire on government officials, various ethnic groups, foreign powers and other parties. Widespread belief persists within and outside Madagascar that a deliberate arson was the cause. Rumoured justifications for arson at the Rova were numerous and remain unproven. The revelation that important financial archives had been destroyed early on the morning of the fire sparked rumours that corrupt government officials had lit the blaze to create a public distraction from their illicit activities. Other explanations have included popular dissatisfaction with the election of divisive mayor Guy Willy Razanamasy or a flare-up of long-standing tensions among coastal peoples <b>resentful</b> <b>of</b> Merina socio-political domination. Accusations were also made against both then-president Albert Zafy and his predecessor, Didier Ratsiraka. The debate over why and how the Rova burned remains an unresolved and highly contentious subject decades later.|$|E
