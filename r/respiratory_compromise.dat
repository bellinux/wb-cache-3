500|$|In contusions, torn {{capillaries}} leak fluid {{into the}} tissues around them. The membrane between alveoli and capillaries is torn; damage to this capillary–alveolar membrane and small blood vessels causes blood and fluids to leak into the alveoli and the interstitial space (the space surrounding cells) of the lung. [...] With more severe trauma, {{there is a}} greater amount of edema, bleeding, and tearing of the alveoli. [...] Pulmonary contusion is characterized by microhemorrhages (tiny bleeds) that occur when the alveoli are traumatically separated from airway structures and blood vessels. Blood initially collects in the interstitial space, and then edema occurs by an hour or two after injury. An area of bleeding in the contused lung is commonly surrounded by an area of edema. In normal gas exchange, carbon dioxide diffuses across the endothelium of the capillaries, the interstitial space, and across the alveolar epithelium; oxygen diffuses in the other direction. Fluid accumulation interferes with gas exchange, and can cause the alveoli to fill with proteins and collapse due to edema and bleeding. The larger the area of the injury, the more severe <b>respiratory</b> <b>compromise</b> will be.|$|E

40|$|Respiratory {{dysfunction}} is {{a common}} problem in the high level (C- 4 through C- 8) spinal cord injured (SCI) population, due to neuromuscular impairment in the muscles of respiration. Ability to inspire {{a reasonable amount of}} air to produce an efficient cough and relieve pulmonary secretions is compromised by the lack of inspiratory and expiratory muscles secondary to neuromusuclar impairment. Length of phonation, such as the ability to say a sentence in one breath, is also impaired. The Appoggio technique is taught to singers in order to maximize the use of the diaphragm through mental and physical inhibition of the shoulder, chest, and accessory muscles of the neck during inspiration. In this four week, single subject study, the Appoggio technique was applied to a chronic, <b>respiratory</b> <b>compromised,</b> and complete C- 4 SCI subject for six treatment sessions. It was found that the subject made remarkable improvements in length of phonation using this technique.

40|$|Introduction: We {{present a}} case of acute abdomen, causing {{increased}} intra-abdominal pressure, leading to further herniation of an existing paraesophageal hernia, and consequently acute <b>compromised</b> <b>respiratory</b> function. This acute respiratory complication to a paraesophageal hernia has not previously been reported. Presentation of case: We present {{a case of}} a 75 -year-old female who was acutely admitted with stridor. The patient was known to have a paraesophageal hernia monitored using watchful waiting, and dyspnoea. The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to intubation. Diagnostic imaging revealed a paraesophageal hernia pressing onto the trachea as well as appendicitis and ileus. Surgery confirmed perforated appendicitis, peritonitis, and ileus causing high intra-abdominal pressure, resulting in further herniation of the paraesophageal hernia as a cause for acute <b>compromised</b> <b>respiratory</b> function. Appendectomy and gastropexy were performed. The patient was later discharged to rehabilitation. Discussion: Patients with pulmonary symptoms caused by a paraesophageal hernia, especially patients with sizeable hernias, could potentially be in greater risk of severe airway affection if complicated by acute abdomen. These patients could benefit from elective hernia repair, rather than watchful waiting, as it would eliminate pulmonary symptoms and prevent similar cases. Patients monitored using watchful waiting should be informed that acute abdomen could cause acute <b>compromised</b> <b>respiratory</b> function. Conclusion: Any case of acute abdomen causing high intra-abdominal pressure could potentially cause further herniation of an existing paraesophageal hernia, resulting in acute <b>compromised</b> <b>respiratory</b> function. In patients known to have a paraesophageal hernia, similar cases should be suspected if the patient presents with acute breathing difficulties...|$|R

40|$|Influenza exacts a {{heavy burden}} on the elderly, {{a segment of the}} {{population}} that is estimated to experience rapid growth in the near future. In the past decade most developed and several developing countries have recommended influenza vaccination for those > 65 years of age. The World Health Organization (WHO) set a goal of 75 % influenza vaccination coverage among the elderly by 2010, but it was not achieved. In 2011, the Technical Advisory Group at the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of WHO for the Americas, reiterated the influenza vaccine recommendation for older adults. Relatively little information has been compiled on the immunological aspect of aging or on reducing its impact, information particularly relevant for clinicians and gerontologist with firsthand experience confronting its effects. To fill this data gap, in 2012 the Americas Health Foundation (Washington, D. C., United States) and the nonprofit, Fighting Infectious Diseases in Emerging Countries (Miami, Florida, United States), convened a panel of Latin American clinicians and gerontologists with expertise in influenza to discuss key issues and develop a consensus statement. The major recommendations were to improve influenza surveillance throughout Latin America so that its impact can be quantified; and to conduct laboratory confirmation of influenza for all patients who have flu-like symptoms and are frail, immunosuppressed, have comorbidities, are <b>respiratory</b> <b>compromised,</b> or have been admitted to a hospital. The panel also noted that: since evidence for antivirals in the elderly is unclear, their use should be handled on a case-by-case basis; despite decreased immunological response, influenza vaccination in older adults is still crucial; indirect immunization strategies should be encouraged; and traditional infection control measures are essential in long-term care facilities...|$|R

The screening model included only the basic views required to evaluate common lung parenchymal and functional neonatal heart conditions in sick infants. The accuracy of interpretation during the course was assessed by Kappa. Results: The inter-rater agreement between all trainees and instructor improved {{on the second day}} of the course to Kappa 0. 86 (95 % CI: 0. 72 - 0. 97) for LUS views and 0. 78 (95 % CI: 0. 69 - 0. 91) for FHUS views. The inter-rater agreement between trainees themselves improved from Kappa 0. 64 (95 % CI: 0. 47 - 0. 81) for LUS on day one to 0. 89 (95 % CI: 0. 81 - 0. 96) on day two.

40|$|BackgroundSince {{the first}} {{successful}} operation with left heart bypass performed by Dodrill in Michigan in 1952 (The Michigan Heart) and {{the first successful}} application of the heart lung machine in 1953 performed by Gibbon the extracorporeal circulation has become a conditio sine qua non in cardiac surgery. Through the last decades extracorporeal circulation has become an important therapeutic tool not only in cardiac surgery. It is used in several indications in neonatology, pediatrics, oncology, and vascular surgery. The most important indication next to cardiac surgery is the use as ECMO in intensive care medicine to treat patients with ARDS, cardiac failure, severe lung embolism and sepsis. MethodsBetween January 2005 and April 2012, 311 ECMO were implanted in our hospital. In 79 patients a venovenous System was implanted, in 230 patients we performed a venoarterial ECMO and in 2 patients we used a second venous approach as a venovenousarterial ECMO. Different Oxygenators (Quadrox®, ECCO®, Eurosets®and Medtronic®) and different Systems. (Levitronics®, Medtronic®, Lifebridge®, Medos®and Cardiohelp®) were used. ResultsThe average survival in Patients allover is 46 %. The highest survival rate {{is shown in the}} department for cardiac surgery with 68 %. The highest Mortality is shown in the department for internal medicine with 66 %. Different Indications, Risk factors, time of Implantation and learning curve might be some reasons for this difference in outcome. It is also shown that we could decrease Mortality in Patients treated with an ECMO in cardiac surgery through the last 5 Years from almost 80 % to 32 %. ConclusionECMO has become an important therapy part in the management of different medical emergencies such as ARDS, cardiogenic shock, severe lung embolism and sepsis. By increasing in hospital experience in hemodynamically and <b>respiratory</b> <b>compromised</b> patients we established an interdisciplinary ECMO program and decreased mortality in such emergencies. These new technologies are expanding the potential applications for ECMO in exciting ways, including new patient populations and the ability to make ECMO mobile for both intra-and inter-hospital transport. The team approach between Cardiac surgery, Anesthesia, Perfusion and internal medicine was not only a gain on security it is an option to develop ECMO further...|$|R
